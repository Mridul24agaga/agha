Its simple layout means that even people who aren't very good with computers can make visually appealing material. This makes it a useful tool for making interesting movies for teachers, marketers, and small businesses, since they don't need a lot of training or resources. The software lets people explore their ideas without being limited by complicated technology issues, which boosts innovation. These days, pictures are the main way people communicate, so making good movies quickly is more important than ever. With its AI-powered tools and easy-to-use interface, Filmora is a step toward making video creation more accessible to everyone. Filmora has all the tools you need to easily make your ideas come to life, whether you're working on a personal project, a business show, or a social media campaign.

These tools let users focus on what really matters: making content that people will remember. They do this by making processes easier and boosting creativity.

OpenAI's Sora video generator is an exciting and innovative tool that can revolutionize content creation, but there are several features and improvements that could enhance its functionality and user experience. Here are some potential features and improvements that would take Sora to the next level: 1. Better Contextual Understanding and Coherence Enhanced Long-Form Video Generation: Currently, many text-to-video generators struggle with maintaining coherence over long-form content.

Here are some potential features and improvements that would take Sora to the next level: 1. Better Contextual Understanding and Coherence Enhanced Long-Form Video Generation: Currently, many text-to-video generators struggle with maintaining coherence over long-form content. Improving Sora's ability to create seamless and logically consistent videos, even for longer durations, would make it even more useful for tasks like creating documentaries, lectures, or training modules. Contextual Continuity: Ensuring the AI understands the context of the entire script, including recurring themes, character development, or evolving narratives, would significantly improve the realism and flow of generated videos. 2. Improved Animation and Movement Fluid Animation: One of the common challenges of video generation AI is creating smooth and natural-looking animations for movement (e.g., characters walking, objects interacting). Enhancing the AI’s ability to generate more fluid, realistic animations, especially with subtle gestures, movements, and facial expressions, would make the content feel more lifelike. Better Action Sequences: Sora could improve in terms of producing more complex action scenes (e.g., fast movements, sports activities, or complex interactions between characters) that look convincing and accurate. 3. Customizable Visual Styles Diverse Art Styles: Offering more visual style options could open up Sora to a wider audience. Users could choose between different art styles, such as hyper-realistic, cartoon, minimalist, 3D animation, or even specific film genres (e.g., noir, sci-fi, fantasy). Tailored Aesthetic Filters: Allowing users to define the aesthetic tone of the video (e.g., vintage, futuristic, dystopian) would enhance creativity and provide greater control over the visual output. 4. Voice Customization and Realism AI-Generated Voices with Emotional Tone: The integration of realistic voice generation with emotional nuance (happy, sad, serious, etc.) could improve the storytelling aspect of generated videos. If users could choose a particular voice tone and accent, it would make the generated videos feel more personalized and authentic. Speech to Text Refinement: Enhancing the AI’s ability to sync dialogue with mouth movements in animated characters would improve immersion and make the video feel more lifelike. 5. Interactive and Dynamic Elements Real-Time Interactivity: Allowing users to interact with the generated video, changing specific scenes, dialogues, or camera angles dynamically, could be a game-changer, especially for industries like gaming or interactive storytelling. Branching Storylines: For users who want to create interactive narratives, incorporating the ability to generate branching storylines based on user inputs would be incredibly useful for creating choose-your-own-adventure-style videos. 6. Advanced Scene Transitions and Effects Smooth Scene Transitions: Improve the transition between scenes or settings so that changes in background, time of day, or location feel natural and not jarring. Advanced camera effects like zooms, pans, or shifts in perspective could add more cinematic quality to the video. Enhanced Special Effects: The ability to integrate stunning visual effects (e.g., explosions, magical elements, weather effects) seamlessly into the video would significantly boost the realism and creativity of generated content. 7. Text and Image Integration Real-Time Text Overlay: Incorporating features that allow text to be overlaid in real-time as part of the scene or dialogue would be useful for creating videos like tutorials, explainer videos, or news reports. Visual Aid Integration: Allowing users to generate charts, diagrams, or infographics in sync with the narrative could be an excellent feature for educational content, product demos, and technical training videos. 8. Expanded Language and Cultural Support Multilingual Capabilities: The ability to generate videos in multiple languages, with accurate translation of both speech and on-screen text, would make Sora a global tool. Automatic subtitles and dubbing would also be valuable for accessibility. Cultural Customization: Supporting cultural differences in video production (e.g., respecting cultural norms in storytelling, attire, or settings) would enhance Sora’s usefulness across different regions and industries. 9. Collaborative Features Multi-User Editing: A collaborative editing feature would allow multiple users to contribute to a single video project, similar to how platforms like Google Docs allow for real-time collaboration. This would be especially valuable for team projects or content creation involving multiple departments. Crowdsourced Creativity: Allowing users to share and remix videos created on Sora would encourage a creative community and help refine the video generation process. 10. Enhanced Customization Tools for Non-Experts Intuitive Interface with More Control: While Sora is likely designed to be user-friendly, providing more intuitive yet advanced customization tools (e.g., adjustable lighting, camera angles, and character design) would give users more control without overwhelming beginners. Template Options: Offering templates for different types of videos (e.g., interviews, tutorials, marketing, etc.) could allow users to start with pre-designed formats and then tweak them as needed, making the process faster and easier for those without extensive video production experience. 11. Speed and Efficiency Enhancements Faster Rendering: As the demand for video generation grows, improving rendering speeds and making the video generation process faster would be crucial, especially when it comes to large-scale projects or iterative design. Optimization for Mobile Devices: Allowing Sora to generate high-quality videos while being optimized for mobile devices (both in terms of generation and viewing) would be a useful improvement, especially for creators who work on the go. 12. Ethical Safeguards and Bias Reduction Enhanced Content Moderation: While current safeguards are in place to prevent the generation of inappropriate content, continuous refinement of these safeguards will be necessary to ensure that videos adhere to ethical standards and avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or misinformation. Bias and Representation: Ensuring that Sora can generate diverse, inclusive, and fair representations of people, cultures, and communities would be essential for preventing bias and making the generated content accessible to a broader audience. Conclusion: These features and improvements would elevate OpenAI's Sora video generator and further its potential to disrupt content creation across industries. By focusing on better realism, customization, interactivity, and collaboration, Sora could become a go-to tool for everyone from individual creators to large organizations, helping to democratize the creation of high-quality video content.

AI videos can change how you approach content creation by making the process faster, more efficient, and often more affordable. Whether you’re a business looking to enhance your video marketing strategy or a creator aiming to produce engaging content, AI video generators offer an innovative solution that drastically reduces the complexity of video production. The trick, however, lies in personalization. While these tools excel in streamlining workflows, it’s important to customize your content to match your brand’s voice and goals. With the right AI video generator, you can maintain your creative vision while saving hours of editing time. These tools are designed to assist you, not replace the human touch, allowing you to focus on storytelling while the AI handles the technical heavy lifting. With so many options on the market, choosing the best AI video generator is crucial to maximize output and ensure high-quality results. Luckily, we have researched and compiled a list of the best. What is an AI Video Generator? An AI video generator is software that uses artificial intelligence technology to create engaging AI videos automatically. These tools can help anyone in the video creation, from newbies to advanced users. In simple terms, an AI video generator can perform different tasks such as: Generate video from text (e.g., automatically generate a video based on a video script). Generate animated videos from still images. Generate short video advertisements, social media videos, or instructional videos. Adding virtual characters and voices to videos. Automate video editing and post-production. How Do AI Video Generators Work? The computer science of how AI generates videos is beyond my understanding and, honestly, not what this article is about. But in simple terms, what I understand of it is: Machine learning, which is just ‘an extremely powerful computer’, knowing language on some robotic, mathematical level, scrapes the text and converts it into computer language: numbers. As computers understand everything in these terms, the combinations of numbers they receive from the text will correspond to number patterns within videos that express the same ideas as the text. They will match. It’s like turning a script into a movie, but instead of a director, you have an algorithm working its magic. Thus, a video is born. What Makes a Great AI Video Generator? The best AI video generator should allow you to do anything with it. Here’s what makes the best ones stand out: 1. Customization Whether you need lip-syncing, voiceovers, realistic facial expressions, or background music, these AI tools let you control every detail of the video creation process. From explainer videos to YouTube Shorts, you can customize AI-generated videos to match your brand, vibe, or even the tiniest detail you imagine. 2. Templates Library Great AI video makers come with pre-designed templates and models to spark your creativity. Need to craft a training video, tell an engaging story, or educational content? The library makes the entire process faster and more intuitive. All you need is to pick a template, and you’re halfway there. The templates aren’t just about speed; they’re about turning your ideas into video content that pops. 3. Smart Subtitles and Captions Want to go global? Many top-tier AI video generators support language translations, making adding multilingual subtitles and even translating your content easy. Whether you’re creating videos for social media platforms or a worldwide audience, these AI tools help you speak everyone’s language. 4. Effortless Ease of Use Nobody wants an AI tool that feels like homework. The best AI video editors are intuitive and designed to simplify the process. No steep learning curves or endless tweaking but straightforward tools that help you create professional-quality videos faster. 5. Picture-Perfect Quality High-quality videos are a must, and these tools deliver. Export videos in HD, 4K, or whatever format you need without compromising quality. Some even offer video upscaling, so your finished product looks sleek and polished on any screen. Why Use AI Video Generators? Now that we know what an AI video generator is let’s examine the advantages of using the best one in your video production process. 1. Efficiency and Time Savings Using the best AI video generators will help you save time and mostly money while increasing your video content output. Note that we said ‘increasing’ since an AI video generator should not be your only way of making video content. The technology is not that good yet, and most consumers can tell the difference between AI-generated videos and videos created by experts. That said, unlike traditional editing, which requires hours of painstaking work, AI-powered tools allow you to create polished videos quickly without advanced editing skills. This speeds up the video creation process, enabling you to deliver fresh content to multiple platforms without delay. 2. Consistency and Error Reduction AI generators also provide consistency and error reduction. With AI, you get high-quality, error-free content every time. The technology ensures that even the finer details, such as subtitles and metadata, are accurate and consistent, making it ideal for everything from training videos to YouTube content. Feel free to use AI video generators to turn your blog posts into videos or create fun, short-lived social media content. However, when crafting that important explainer video that introduces your brand to the world, you might want to consider a more personal touch. 3. Versatility Lastly, AI video generators are incredibly versatile. Whether you need a video in Quicktime format for Apple users or a Windows Media file for Microsoft users, AI tools can handle a range of formats. With customizable templates and transitions, you can personalize your videos, allowing you to create content that aligns perfectly with your vision. What Types of Videos can I make with these Tools? AI text-to-video technology simplifies the creation of high-quality videos for various business purposes. Here’s how you can use it: Explainer Videos: Simplify complex concepts with engaging animations, natural text-to-speech voiceovers, and clear visuals. Perfect for showcasing products or ideas in your media projects. Training Videos: Deliver interactive, customizable AI-generated content to onboard customers or train employees. From step-by-step processes to educational tutorials, create videos with ease and professional quality.

Peech AI h2 So, what’s the best AI video generator? h2 FAQ about AI video generators This article was originally written in June 2022, and updated in Oct 2023 When I first wrote this article a year and a half ago, AI video generators just started becoming popular and it was considered high-tech back then. Creating videos just by typing in text sounded like a sci-fi movie. Now, at the end of 2023 - it seems like all of the online video editors are AI-based now. The competition is fierce, the markets are flooded and there are dozens of different products with their unique twists. That’s why this article is needed more than ever. We spent two full days testing each and every AI video generator, sorting them into different categories, and finding their pros/cons. I hope that this article will save you a ton of research time and narrow down your choice to the top three tools that you can then test out for yourself. I’m just here doing the heavy lifting for you. You’re welcome. My criteria for evaluating different AI video makers on the market Let me start by saying that I went through a lot of scammy websites that offered solutions that looked shady. In the end, I managed to find the top 3 AI video creators in each category. Each AI video maker will have the following criteria explained: Pros Cons Use cases Pricing Before choosing an AI video generator for yourself, my advice would be to think about the use case, and what features you need. There are a lot of different tools on the market with features, and if you go into this journey without a concrete goal you will be swamped with the opportunities and fall into the paradox of choice. One table to rule them all - the results from our testing of AI video generators Here’s a quick overview of the top 3 AI video makers that we tested, sorted by category. I tested each of these and ranked them for you, and after the table, you can find a more in-depth review. ‍ | Type | Rank | Name | Pros | Cons | Pricing (monthly) | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | AI talking head | 1 | HeyGen | The best-looking avatars Tons of extra features | Older avatars don’t look good | $0 / $29 / $89 / Enterprise | | AI talking head | 2 | Synthesia | Tons of avatars, in various settings | Price Flexibility | $30 / Enterprise | | AI talking head | 3 | D-ID | Great API, and dev capabilities | Not a lot of functionality in the Web App Avatars not looking as great as HeyGen | API $0 / $18 / $50 / $198 Studio $0 / $5.9 / $29 / $196 | | AI text to video | 1 | Plainly | Custom template creation Premium stock footage Adjustable AI algorithm Very flexible video editing | No stock assets for specific people | Book a demo to learn more | | AI text to video | 2 | Kapwing | Very flexible and intuitive Tons of editing capabilities Good templates | AI summary not great Stock assets not great | $0 / $24 | | AI text to video | 3 | Visla | Great voiceover Easy to use Great AI summary | Editing not flexible Templates quite simple | $0 / $24 | | AI text to video | 4 | InVideo | Amazing voiceover (the best) Great UI | Quite slow Editing not flexible | $0 / $30 / $60 | | AI content repurposing | 1 | Opus Clip | Fastest setup Very good cuts and useful clips | Simple templates | $0 / $19 | | AI content repurposing | 2 | Munch | Great cuts Implements SEO functionality | Quite slow | $0 / $49 | | AI content repurposing | 3 | Peech AI | Good looking templates Tons of design capabilities | Not for classic shorts format video snippets | $0 / $39 / $89 | ‍ | If you are a news company that's looking to create more video content using AI - you should check out Plainly's AI text-to-video.

Book a 15-min demo with me and I'll show you what I mean. | | --- | Three types of AI video generators During my research, I found that there are basically three types of AI video makers. To ensure I’m comparing apples to apples, I’ll split my analysis into three sections. There are AI video generators that allow you to: Create a talking avatar Turn text into video (slideshow-based videos) Repurpose long-form content into short snippets Depending on your use case, you’ll have to decide what works for you. A talking avatar type of video generator is a tool that allows you to write a script, and get an AI-generated avatar that will read out that script in the same way a human being would do. These tools also allow you to design the scene behind the avatar, so you can create a wide range of “talking head” videos. Text-to-video solutions work for more straightforward videos. This type of AI video generator will take the script you input, and divide it into scenes with background images/videos, narration, and captions. Oftentimes, it’s enough to simply add a prompt. The videos you can make are quite simple, and they might not have the WOW effect like the one above. However, it’s still impressive that you can make videos just by typing text. Content repurposing solutions are great for taking a long YouTube video and splitting it up into short social media videos. These tools often lack advanced design capabilities such as the text-to-video tools, and the output is a video with a simple text overlay. On the other side, their AI algorithm is tuned to extract great content from long videos which is something you can’t do with other types of tools. If you’re a bit confused with all of the options, this might be useful. Instead of looking at solutions and finding the problems - let’s look at problems and link them to solutions. Depending on what your use case you will need a different AI video maker. Here are some examples: ‍ | Use case | Type of tool | | --- | --- | | Employee onboarding, training, documentation, e-learning…etc. | Talking avatar | | Explainer videos; YouTube videos; News videos…etc. | Text to video | | Youtube Shorts; TikTok videos; Instagram Reels; LinkedIn videos; Social Media ads…etc. | Content repurposing | ‍ What you see above is frankly just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to possible use cases, but I hope it gives you an idea of what can be done with video generators. Now, let’s go over the tools. AI video generators that allow you to create avatars 1. HeyGen HeyGen was ranked number 3 when I wrote this article initially - when I did my research again for the update I was stunned by the progress they made. Apart from the rebrand (they were called Movio.la previously), HeyGen added new avatars and a ton of new features. You can actually see the progress, if you take a look at some of their old AI avatars you can see that they weren’t really great. Apart from the new avatars, HeyGen now allows an easy creation of your own avatar (and voice), and also video translation. Pros: Best looking avatars Tons of extra functionality (translation, easy custom avatar creation..etc) Affordable pricing Cons: Old avatars look off They are trying to do a lot of things at once, and although this is a great thing it can lead to a bloated platform Pricing: You can try it out with 1-minute free credit or choose between two plans starting at $29 (Creator) and $89 per month (Business). Make sure to check out their pricing page because there is a pricing slider depending on how many video minutes you need per month. Here’s a video I created with this tool: 2. Synthesia Synthesia was number one in the original article and for a good reason. They really were the best. One of the first AI talking head solutions, Synthesia was leading the market. Although it’s very close between HeyGen and Synthesia, I decided to give them spot number two. To be quite honest, both are amazing platforms, and the only reason that Synthesia is number 2 is because of pricing - it’s not as flexible as HeyGen, but that’s probably because they are targeting different target markets. Pros: Great in-built video editor with a ton of great templates and editing capabilities Great selection of diverse avatars Cons: Price API still in beta Pricing: $30/per month, no free plan. Please check their pricing as there are limitations within the plan (e.g. 10 video credits available per month). Want to see it in action? Here’s a video I created with Synthesia: 3. D-ID This AI avatar generator has been around for ages, it was one of the first on the market and the reason that it’s on this list is because it’s tailored towards a very specific use case. The folks from D-ID realized that all of their competitors focus on the Web App experience and the single video creation so they focused on the API and developer use cases. When everybody zigs, you zag I guess. Although their avatars are not as good as Synthesia or HeyGen, they are not bad by any means, what’s great about D-ID is their API and all of the opportunities it opens. With the D-ID API, you can easily create automated workflows, or even add AI avatars into your products. I might be biased, because our product, Plainly, is also an API-first solution - but I had to include D-ID! Pros: Built for integrations, amazing API Great pricing Cons: Not a lot of functionality in the Web App Avatars are not the best Pricing: Their pricing is split into API and Studio usage. Make sure to check their pricing page for the most updated pricing. API has a free plan with 5 minutes of usage and a watermark, and after that, it starts from $18 per month for 30 minutes. Studio also has a 5-minute free plan, and then it starts from $5.9 per month for 10 minutes. Here’s the video I created using D-ID: Video generators that allow you to turn text into video When I started researching this type of AI video creator, I noticed that they are 1) all pretty much similar to one another and 2) very good tools. Ranking them was a very hard job because most of them have the same functionalities and similar pricing. The thing that decided the rankings was the user experience, and nitpicking the features. Let’s go over the tools I tested. 1. Plainly We created Plainly with one philosophy in mind. AI shouldn’t replace video editors but enable video teams to focus on the creative side of the work and let AI do the grunt work. With that in mind, we created Plainly - a platform built on top of our video rendering API, that enables online news companies to increase their monthly video output by 10x. Plainly is perfect for those news companies who already have video production set in place, but want to increase the output. The first step in the process is to set up branded video templates that will be used and connect them to our platform. After that, Plainly will automatically summarize your articles, create scenes, create voiceover, write on-screen text, find relevant stock assets, and compile all of that into a video which you can later edit and tweak to perfection. If you want to learn more, book a demo. Pros: Easy branded template creation Adjustable AI algorithm Premium stock assets Flexible video editing API available Cons: I must admit, that if you search for a very specific person, our stock asset library sometimes comes short. Luckily you can add your own assets. Pricing: Book a demo to learn more. 2. Kapwing Kapwing is a new addition to this list, and it rose straight to the top. Started as a standard online-video editor it quickly adapted to the market needs for AI. The reason why it’s number 2 is because it created the most seamless experience between AI and the standard video editing process. All of the other AI text-to-video tools are very limited in the sense of editing you can do post-video-generation. With Kapwing, the AI is a helper and it allows you to kick-start your video and do 95% of the work. That’s exactly the same philosophy we have with Plainly’s text-to-video feature (see above). Pros: A lot of editing capabilities, very flexible Very nicely designed templates Cons: Their AI summarization is not great, the script I got needed work Their stock assets are not as good as the other solutions Pricing: There’s a free plan with watermarks, and then you can upgrade to a $24 per month plan. Here’s the video I created using Kapwing: 3. Visla Visla is also a new addition to this list. They are trying to create an all-in-one video editor that has all of the functionalities of professional video editors such as Premiere but on the cloud. I really like the fact that I can do pretty much anything I want in Visla, and their AI text-to-video maker is also pretty great. Although the editing is not as flexible as Kapwing, it has a better AI script-writing feature and better asset selection. Pros: Great voiceover Easy to use Great script writing (text summarization) algorithm Cons: Not a lot of editing capabilities Editing UI is a bit overwhelming Quite simple templates Pricing: Their pricing is quite simple, you can start with the free plan and then upgrade for only $24 per month. Here’s the video I created using Visla: 4. InVideo InVideo was at the top of our rankings in the original article, and although still a good tool the other AI video makers are simply better. Remember, these are all nuances, if you go with any of these options you won’t regret it. Since last time, InVideo added a ton of new features and they completely redesigned their AI video generator product. Their focus now is to allow users to generate videos from prompts and although they have a few shortcomings, the things I really like are how straightforward the video creation is, and how good the voiceover is. Pros: Easy to use, simple creation Amazing voiceover Cons: Slow Editing UI not very flexible, and a bit confusing Pricing: Pricing goes from free to $25 per month to $60 per month. Here’s the video I created using InVideo: | If you need a powerful video editing API to automate video creation, or to create engaging video content from articles book a demo of Plainly here and we’ll show you how to do it. | | --- | AI content repurposing video generators This is a completely new category of AI video generators, and they rose to fame in the last year or so. This type of AI video maker allows you to take long-form video content and split it into short, social media clips with ease. As an ex-video editor, I remember the days when I was watching 90-minute webinars and cutting 60-second clips from it. It was quite painful. That’s now gone, and I’m glad it’s gone because no editor should do that kind of work anymore. Here are the life-saving AI content repurposing video generators. 1. Opus Opus is the clear leader in this category, their user experience is fantastic and their AI algorithm is great. It really does find useful videos, cuts them, and also adds text on top. It’s quite easy to edit the video afterwards and I was just very positively surprised by the experience. Pros: Fastest setup Very good automated cuts Cons: Can be slow sometimes Templates are quite simple Pricing: There’s a free tier, and the paid plan starts at $19 per month 2. Munch Munch is the close second. Although they are very similar tools, Munch has taken a slightly different approach. They added a bit of SEO functionality, so you can see what keywords appear the most in your videos and also the search volume for those keywords. I’m not sure how are they calculating this though. Overall the experience with Opus is better, it’s faster to set up and the editing after the cuts are made is easier. Pros: Good cuts SEO features Cons: Very slow Not as easy to edit the video as Opus Pricing: Starts at the free plan, and you can upgrade for $49 / month 3. Peech AI Peech has a very unique twist on the content repurposing game. If you want to create simple videos, with no graphical elements then Opus is better – but if you want to create a more polished-looking video with graphic overlays then Peech is your tool. The unique twist Peech has is that it adds the cut videos into a pre-designed template with tons of graphical elements, and transitions - so it goes a step further than just adding captions. The reason that it’s in the third spot is because it looks like the market favors those simple videos - but I think Peech deserves to be on this list in case someone wants to create something more. Pros: Great templates Automatically adds graphical elements Cons: Not for simple videos (classic YouTube shorts) Pricing: Starts at free, and then you can upgrade for either $39 or $89 per month So, what’s the best AI video generator? The best in the talking head category is HeyGen, there’s no word about it. Their avatars are almost perfect, their UX is pretty smooth, and they have a wide range of extra features that others don’t. If you are a prosumer, and someone who wants an affordable way to generate simple videos from text then I’d pick Kapwing. They have great editing capabilities, their templates are pretty good and it’s a very complete tool. When it comes to automated content repurposing - then Opus is the clear leader here. Great automated cuts, easy and flexible video editing, and great user experience. In my opinion, all of these tools are good enough to be used in your business. It really is a fascinating industry, and I’ll be following it closely and exploring the direction it’s heading into. ‍ | f you are an online news company that wants to create video content from articles - then the best AI text-to-video generator is our tool Plainly.

An AI video generator is a tool that generates videos from descriptions using artificial intelligence algorithms. These text-to-video generators use AI to create or enhance video content from text inputted by users. AI video generation helps craft high-quality videos without the need for expensive equipment, actors, or even video editing skills. What is the best AI video generator? The text-to-video feature in the AI video creator quickly generates videos from text with AI avatars and voices, making it the best text-to-video generator AI. Choose your ideal avatar, type your script, and generate talking head videos for your product releases, explainer videos, and more in minutes. What is a talking head video? A talking head video is one of the most common types of video used for e-Learning. It features a person, or the “Subject-Matter Expert” (SME), who directly addresses the viewer in an interview-like format. This video type is often shot from the chest or waist upwards, with the presenter either standing or sitting. Because of their human elements, talking head videos are suitable for building trust and connection with the target viewers. What differentiates talking head videos from other video types? What sets talking head videos apart from other video types is they let SMEs or instructors communicate directly through the camera, as if they're having a one-to-one conversation with learners. Talking head videos are ideal for brief and straightforward learning sessions, which users can access on their own time. With tools like an AI video generator from text, you can break down lengthy presentations into a series of shorter clips. Can AI create videos from text? Yes, it can! Type in the script you want the avatar to narrate or speak and choose from 300+ voices available in 40+ languages. Then, watch as AI generates your video in minutes. Use the AI video maker to turn your script into talking head videos with customizable AI avatars. Omg I love you guys! Thanks for making it so easy for me to use your templates.
