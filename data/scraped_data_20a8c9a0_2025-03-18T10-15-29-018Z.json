Most of this work is done by AI tools, such as Creatify.ai, now; hence, the time used to have a captivating video is reduced. For instance, in case you are producing a video that explains how a product works, instead of taking hours to add the animation, edit the shots, and insert the effects, it only takes minutes. Even a Novice Can Follow A Simple Process Usually, AI video makers, such as Creatify.ai, are accessible since one can effortlessly drag and drop clips and have provided templates and instructional sections. Ease in this regard does not only benefit professionals but even the unskilled and uninformed can make a great video. Affordable: It is very expensive to hire a camera person to shoot one clip for you or to buy expensive videos and editing packages. With many platforms like Creatify.ai, which are AI-based, possible package offers are affordable, even free, or with trials. This opens up the possibility of making videos accessible to the general public, small business people, and content creators with low budgets. Room for Experimenting & Customizing Most AI video creation tools, such as Creatify.ai, feature numerous templates, animated sequences, visuals, and voiceovers that support stylization and generation of a personalized video regardless of how creative one is. Best AI Video Creation Tools for Beginners As you make videos, the first step is choosing an AI video tool that is going to help you attain your objectives. Be aware that some video makers are unique and allow a variety of things.

Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Your First AI Video Now that you have chosen an AI tool, let's walk through how to make a great video. Step 1: Define the purpose of your video and identify its audience First of all, the purpose of using a video and what content has to be given through a video shall be defined. Whether it is something to sell, educate, or just for fun for yourself, purpose can help you make decisions at every stage of development. As per the recent stats, 85.1% of content writers use AI to Create video content. Step 2: Create a Script or Outline Whenever working on a short video, an organized script keeps things clear in a manner an ambiguous script could not. Here is a simple example for the demonstration of a product: Introduction: Give a quick overview of the product and why it's valuable. Features: Mention the main features with pictures or graphics. Use Case: Explain how the product fixes a problem. Closing: End the message with a call to action to your viewer. Examples include \"Buy now\" or \"Learn more.\" Keeping your words short and interesting will keep your audience engaged, along with building retention. Step 3: Pick your visuals, text, and voiceovers Adding visuals, text, and voiceovers can be done with ease by using AI tools such as Creatify.ai. Visuals: Most AI video platforms have libraries of stock images, video clips, and animations. For instance, lifestyle clips work just fine to support a fashionable brand, but in the case of a technological product, one should go for more modern graphics. Text Overlays: Most of the tools permit writing texts over the video; thus, they are really helpful in certain cases, such as instructional videos or tutorials. It's also possible to choose several font types if you would like the effects to reflect your brand design. Voices: Generally always able to customize AI voices. Some voices are available to select from. You are also allowed to make them faster or slower, even change the tone of voice, making it sound more attentive. Step 4: Transitions and Effects to Customize the Video Transitions and effects are cool, but putting too much into it will overflow and you won't be able to pay attention. AI tools like Creatify.ai, InVideo, or Pictory are suggesting changes based on what's in your video. This way, you could see how they look and make some tweaks if needed. Step 5: Preview, Edit and Refine Always preview your video before finalizing or marketing. Check for mistakes, whatever may disrupt the rhythm, or some graphics or pictures that may not align with what you want to convey through your message. Most AI tools actually do offer the facility of real-time editing; thus, it should not be too tiring to make a few amendments. Step 6: Export and Share Once the video looks good to you, export it in a format recommended for the target platform. Many of the AI applications will provide standard sizes when uploading content on YouTube, Instagram, or other platforms without losing quality and density. Tips to Make Your AI Video Stand Out Creation of a basic video is pretty easy, but other techniques are involved to make it stand out. Employ High-Quality Images and Crisp Audio HD images and crystal-clear audio entail that it would be professional. Most AI tools, like Creatify.ai, offer HD images for your particular product or service you are showcasing; you can even upload your graphics for brand consistency. Keep It Short and Sweet A short video will engage viewers and retain their attention. The length, when placed on social media, should be approximately 1 to 3 minutes, although tutorial videos may extend to 5 to 10 minutes. Remove all detailed descriptions and only include key points. Branded Colors and Fonts Consistent branding creates a professional look. If creating more than one video, choose colors, fonts, and a visual style that reflects your brand. Optimize for Mobile Viewing Most of the viewers nowadays will view from the mobile screen; so, the text should be readable and the graphics discernible on the small screen. Finish with an Interesting CTA A strong call-to-action to move your audience to the next step to go to the website subscribe or share that video. AI-based Advanced Features to Enhance Your Videos With AI video creation, you could reach out to advanced features that push videos to the next limit. Some of them are enumerated as follows: Voice Cloning and Text-to-Speech Customization Some of the advanced tools feature Resemble.ai, allowing for voice cloning and using either your own voice or creating synthetic voices on the kind of help it offers; just that little touch is what makes it unique-personalized. It would be very handy in training videos or when handling customers. AI-Generated Avatars Create an avatar of yourself talking with your voice using Creatify.ai or Synthesia. This adds that human, relatable feeling in your videos and this really works great in tutorial or training video. Natural Language Processing for Script Assistance There are some AI video editing tools that are built with NLP technology; it allows the software to recommend scripts based on certain keywords. This saves time in terms of ideating and actually writing the script. Smoothed Automatic Scene Transitioning and Effects AI tools can monitor your content flow and give you possible transitions and effects to make your video professional and full of dynamism throughout. Common AI Challenges and How to Handle Them As powerful as these AI tools are, there are still several challenges that you might face: Creative Limitation of AI Although AI can create visuals and voiceovers for you, it still doesn't get as subtle as a human would. Give your unique touch to every video by personalizing every script, using different visuals, and giving new styles a shot. AI Voiceover Pronunciation and Tone The AI voices sometimes mispronounce words or simply don't have the right, rich intonation a human voice would produce. You will want to play back your video to determine what this voiceover sounds like and make edits to your script or voice options. Limitations to Customization Many of the services allow for some degree of personalisation, but possibly may not offer a specific variety that a brand would really require, such as certain font styles or shades of color. One way around this is by using a template along with styles that most closely fit your brand. Technical Quality and Brand Consistency More attention should be paid to consistency of visual, audio, and branding, resolution setting, and export quality. For slight mismatches that may make a video appear amateurish, higher qualities are important. Conclusion Thanks to AI-driven video creation tools like Creatify.ai, a user can create professional striking videos without having any prior technical experience and expensive software. It further offers open highways for business owners, content creators, and people with stories to take full responsibility for video creation. Every step forward by AI opens entirely new possibilities in storytelling, marketing, and education. This can be accomplished by following the steps, best practices, and trying out available tools to develop professional videos the target audience would like to watch. Thanks to AI, creating videos for a wide range of creators has never been easier than today. Author: Harikrishna Kundariya Video content is blooming in the present digital world.

Visuals: Most AI video platforms have libraries of stock images, video clips, and animations. For instance, lifestyle clips work just fine to support a fashionable brand, but in the case of a technological product, one should go for more modern graphics. Text Overlays: Most of the tools permit writing texts over the video; thus, they are really helpful in certain cases, such as instructional videos or tutorials. It's also possible to choose several font types if you would like the effects to reflect your brand design. Voices: Generally always able to customize AI voices. Some voices are available to select from. You are also allowed to make them faster or slower, even change the tone of voice, making it sound more attentive.

AI tools like Creatify.ai, InVideo, or Pictory are suggesting changes based on what's in your video. This way, you could see how they look and make some tweaks if needed. Step 5: Preview, Edit and Refine Always preview your video before finalizing or marketing.

The length, when placed on social media, should be approximately 1 to 3 minutes, although tutorial videos may extend to 5 to 10 minutes. Remove all detailed descriptions and only include key points. Branded Colors and Fonts Consistent branding creates a professional look. If creating more than one video, choose colors, fonts, and a visual style that reflects your brand.

Give your unique touch to every video by personalizing every script, using different visuals, and giving new styles a shot. AI Voiceover Pronunciation and Tone The AI voices sometimes mispronounce words or simply don't have the right, rich intonation a human voice would produce.

Limitations to Customization Many of the services allow for some degree of personalisation, but possibly may not offer a specific variety that a brand would really require, such as certain font styles or shades of color. One way around this is by using a template along with styles that most closely fit your brand. Technical Quality and Brand Consistency More attention should be paid to consistency of visual, audio, and branding, resolution setting, and export quality.

(HONEST 2025 Review) Jenny Ho March 13, 2025 ### Faceless Digital Marketing: Definition, Tips, and Strategies for 2025 Jenny Ho March 12, 2025 Approximately 40% of creators admit that the whole content creation process—constant production, editing, and social media management—drains them emotionally. ‍ Automating your YouTube channel is a must if you want to work less and earn more in 2025 and beyond. ‍ When I first started, I tried to save every penny and refused to use tools to automate my channel. ‍ The result? ‍ I QUIT. ‍ I didn’t have enough time to create videos every day or just every week, and I didn’t have the skills to do it all myself. ‍ Think of the most successful YouTubers. They didn’t get there by managing every little detail themselves. They built a system that lets them focus on the big picture while their channels are run by the best YouTube automation tools. ‍ So, I decided to figure out how to use AI to run my YouTube channel on autopilot. Here’s what you need to do: What is YouTube Automation? In simple terms, YouTube automation is a process where content creators streamline or even outsource parts of their video-making process to save time and boost productivity. In simple terms, it means using tools or services to handle repetitive tasks—like video editing, keyword research, thumbnail creation, or even video scripts—so the creator can focus more on strategy and growth. ‍ Imagine you want to run a YouTube channel without doing everything yourself. ‍ With YouTube automation, you might hire a scriptwriter, use an AI tool to edit videos, or automate your social media posting for each new upload. ‍ Some creators even build whole channels without appearing on camera by using voiceovers and stock footage. ‍ Dave Nick, a YouTuber with 934,000 subscribers, explains: “YouTube automation is taking a business approach to YouTube. ‍ Instead of being the face of the channel, recording videos, and editing them yourself, you create faceless content that earns revenue from ads, sponsorships, and digital products. ‍ You don’t need to be on camera, edit videos, or even be involved in the creation process at all. ‍ To automate a YouTube channel, you have two options Use AI tools to handle everything Outsource the work and simply steer the ship Today, I’m going to guide you through the first option—using AI tools to run a successful YouTube channel without breaking the bank on outsourcing. ‍ Let’s jump right in! Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up YouTube Automation Starting with YouTube automation can feel overwhelming. But you don’t need to overthink it. Just follow the steps below, and you’ll be on your way to a successful YouTube channel. Choose the Right Niche When picking a YouTube niche, don’t just chase ad revenue. You need millions of views to make serious money, unless you’re in a high-traffic niche like MrBeast’s. Relying on YouTube’s algorithm is risky. ‍ Instead, I want control over my channel, so I can cash in whenever I want. If YouTube changes its algorithm, I’m still in charge, leveraging my audience and content for new opportunities. ‍ Take my example: I chose the business and marketing niche because it offers: High CPM: Up to $13.52 per 1,000 views, according to TubeBuddy, by focusing on topics like making money online and digital marketing. Multiple Revenue Streams: Brand sponsorships, freelance opportunities, and even courses on marketing and business. Professional Alignment: It sharpens my professional skills and improves my profile. Not sure about your niche? Ask yourself: Am I passionate about this niche? Can this niche provide multiple income streams beyond ads? Do I have enough knowledge in this niche to create valuable content? If you’re curious about different niches, take a look at the video below! Choosing a niche you enjoy with long-term potential is key to staying motivated. YouTube can take 2-3 years to gain traction, so avoiding burnout is crucial. ‍ MrBeast spent 10 years in his niche before going viral. ‍ Still can’t define yours? ‍ Then… ‍ Start creating, experiment, and you’ll find it. ‍ Did I choose \"marketing and business\" when I first started out? ‍ Nope! ‍ I tried different jobs, created content for other businesses, and managed multiple channels of my own. ‍ I kept planning, testing, and creating until I found the niche that aligned with my passion, what I do well, and what the market pays for. ‍ That’s how I stayed motivated until my channel finally took off. Create Content Ideas Now that you've chosen your niche, most will tell you to start with the channel name, but I suggest a different approach. First, think about the main topics you want to cover. ‍ For example, if your niche is business and marketing like mine, break it down into 5 key topics: How to Make Money Online: Explore side hustles, new business models, and remote jobs. Marketing Strategies: Share tips on marketing and how to monetize those skills. Freelancing Tips: Offer advice on excelling as a freelancer and reaching the top of your field. Investing on a Budget: Teach how to start investing with little money and grow wealth over time. Business Success Stories: Highlight business journeys, including challenges and wins. These topics will provide value, keep you motivated, and help you grow as an expert. ‍ As your channel grows, you can start monetizing early by offering services like YouTube consulting or selling digital products, such as business guides or Notion templates. ‍ The reason I list out 5 topics for my channel is to avoid burnout. Many content creators struggle with whether to niche down or niche up. ‍ For me, it’s all about balance. Niche down for laser focus and growth in the beginning, then niche up within that area to keep learning and creating without losing interest. Craft Content Plan Once you have your core 5 topics, the next step is developing a content plan. Use ChatGPT to brainstorm content ideas, hashtags, and keywords for a month, three months, or even a year. This will give you a roadmap, so you’re never stuck wondering what content to create next. ‍ You can use the following prompt for ChatGPT: ‍ “I need help developing a content strategy for my brand in the [niche]. My main platform is YouTube. I need you to develop content ideas specifically for YouTube. For example, I’m in the business and marketing niche, and I’ve created a video titled, '6 Ways to Earn Money Online for People with No Experience!' That’s the type of content I want. Create [Number] content ideas for YouTube. Generate [necessary information] like titles, outlines, and ideas that stand out in my niche.” ‍ For example: ‍ \"I need help developing a content strategy for my business and marketing brand. I use YouTube as my main platform and need 10 content ideas with video outlines and titles. Make these ideas relevant and competitive.” After ChatGPT generates a list of ideas, do some competitive research. ‍ Look at successful videos in your niche and note their titles. This ensures ChatGPT’s ideas align with content that’s proven to perform well on YouTube. Finding that balance between creativity and what works is key! ‍ Now that you have your niche, strategy, monetization plan, and content roadmap, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and bring your plan to life. Let's move on to the execution phase! Set Up Your Channel Simply create a Google account and pick a name for your YouTube channel. ‍ Then, upload a profile picture and banner that align with your niche and content focus. You can easily customize a template you like using Canva. And just like that, you're ready to roll! ‍ For example, if your channel is about marketing, you might use a name like \"JennyMarketing.\" Pair this with a professional banner and a clear, concise description of what your channel offers. How to create content With your list of content ideas in hand, you're ready to start making videos. ‍ But it's easier said than done. Long-time YouTuber MatPat retired in 2021, citing burnout from over a decade of nonstop content creation. ‍ Many veteran creators feel similar pressures ​(Creator Handbook). ‍ Creating videos means you have to write a script, edit footage, add a voiceover, sprinkle in some sound effects, and find the right music. ‍ It’s a time suck, and if you're not experienced, it can take weeks just to produce one video. ‍ I don’t want that tedious process to crush your dream, so here’s my secret to keeping your motivation sky-high and seeing results within the first few months. ‍ Creating a faceless YouTube video boils down to five key ingredients: Script Voice-over Visuals Music Captions Image source Script Writing a full script isn’t just time-consuming; it’s also tricky if you don’t have much writing experience. But with Zebracat, you just need to drop your content idea into the platform, and Zebracat will generate a script for you. You’ll even get three scripts to choose from, so you can pick the one that fits best, tweak it, or add your own touch. ‍ Influencer List Widget Create videos from text in 1 minute! 85% of your audience craves more video. They don't want to read—they want to watch, feel, and engage. In just 60 seconds, Zebracat transforms your text into fully edited videos that get your audience hooked. No editing skills required! Your browser does not support the video tag. Try Zebracat for Free ‍ If you want to try creating a script with ChatGPT instead, use this prompt: ‍ \"Your task will be to write my short script for my short video on YouTube. First read these scripts I wrote. Tell me how I write and create a style guide to use in the new script. Make the style guide include what kind of words I use, my sentence length, my tone and style and structure. Include what makes my writing unique [Include example posts]” ‍ After that, chatGPT will give you this result: Once ChatGPT analyzes your style and gives you a guide, you can start feeding it content ideas or drafts. From there, ChatGPT will craft an engaging script that matches the style and tone you’ve provided, making the script feel like your own. ‍ And if you’re curious about the other AI tools I use to create viral scripts that still feel human—without spending hours—check out Best AI Apps for Content Creators in 2025. Voice-over If you are the person who: Not confident with your voice Keep stumbling over words and re-recording again and again. Feel like recording eats up too much time and kills your creativity. Then, try a more efficient method: ‍ Just pick one of Zebracat’s 100+ human-sounding voices in a variety of languages. ‍ It’ll make your videos sound more professional and engaging, helping them stand out. With this option, you can focus less on creating content yourself and stop worrying about why your YouTube Shorts aren’t getting views anymore ‍ You can try other text-to-voice tools like ElevenLabs, Murf, or Speechify, but I highly recommend using Zebracat’s built-in voice-over feature. ‍ It helps you create videos much faster since you don’t have to switch between different apps or pay multiple subscriptions. Plus, you can test the voice-over quality right in Zebracat to see if it suits your needs. ‍ Visuals Do you enjoy spending hours editing a 1-minute video? ‍ Searching through endless footage, stock images, downloading music from different platforms, and stressing about copyright issues—only for your laptop to slow down when you try to piece it all together? ‍ I HATE it. But you don’t need to bear that tedious part of creating content. ‍ You just need to type in or paste scripts in Zebracat and it will automatically create the best footage and images for your content, saving you from the hassle of searching, cutting, stitching clips, animating elements—whatever it is. It handles all of that for you. Music Have you ever seen how YouTubers spend hours searching for the perfect music to match their content? Image Source Just thinking about it is already exhausting. I hate scrolling through endless lists of songs, trying to find one that fits, listening over and over until it finally matches my video. ‍ It’s such a painful process, especially when you’re on a tight schedule. ‍ 90% of content creators report experiencing burnout, with 71% saying it made them consider quitting entirely. ‍ Efficient social media tools help automate repetitive tasks and alleviate the mental load of constant content creation ​(Tubefilter). ‍ That’s why I use the music in Zebracat. No more searching, downloading, organizing, or trying to remember where I saved the files. ‍ You just click “Music,” and Zebracat has everything organized by genre. You can find the right track instantly, with no worries about copyright issues. Super easy! Captions If you want animated pop-up captions, there’s no need to use any extra tools. ‍ Just use Zebracat! You can turn captions on or off, change the color, adjust the effects—all with a few clicks. No need to type every word or manually add effects. ‍ Just choose the style of captions you like, and you’re good to go! Image Source With Zebracat’s 4 workflows, you can make videos from any starting point.

Optimize Videos for SEO Yay! You’ve made awesome content, but just posting isn’t enough. You need to make it SEO-friendly if you want your video to blow up: Use a title with keywords people search for. You don’t want it lost in the crowd! Add trending hashtags. They help the algorithm know what your video is about. Make a thumbnail that grabs attention and makes people want to click. Use video chapters so viewers can easily follow along. To automate all of this, you can use tools like TubeBuddy or VidIQ. Personally, I use TubeBuddy because it’s super affordable—just $2.50/month, or around $1.80/month with a discount code if you pay yearly. ‍ TubeBuddy helps you save keywords when researching your competitors and keeps track of your content ideas. ‍ When you add their plugin and watch any YouTube video, it shows you metrics like the channel’s SEO score, hashtags, and keywords used in the title and description. ‍ You can also save competitors' hashtags directly to your TubeBuddy account and easily add them to your videos. No more manually checking lists or files—just pick the hashtag file you want, and your content is instantly SEO optimized. Image Source ‍ And if you're unsure what keywords or title to use for your next video, just search in TubeBuddy’s Keyword Explorer. ‍ It ranks keywords from most to least searched and links you to competitor videos. It’s super efficient. You can see which content from your competitors ranks for each keyword and which videos have the most views, all in the dashboard! With all of these tools, you can already automate your YouTube channel right now! But if you’re curious about what other tools can help you grow your YouTube automation channel, check out “Best AI Tools to Create Faceless Videos in 2025.” ‍ Best Practices and Tips for Effective Automation Automated content creation can feel overwhelming if you try to tackle everything at once. It’s tempting to want all the benefits right away, but trust me, taking it step by step will save you from headaches. Start Small and Scale When I first started using automation, I wanted to fix everything at once—scheduling, editing, SEO, all of it. But it felt like trying to clean an entire messy house in one hour. I ended up frustrated and back where I started. ‍ The better way? Tackle one room at a time. Start with the thing that’s draining your energy the most. For me, it was editing. So, I used Zebracat to create videos faster without getting stuck in the tiny details. Once that was under control, I moved on to SEO and started using TubeBuddy for tags and titles. ‍ This way, I could actually see progress. And honestly? Seeing that one part of my process was smoother gave me the motivation to keep going. ‍ You don’t need to automate everything right away. Pick one small thing, make it work, and then build from there. ‍ Take it slow, and you’ll feel the difference. Bit by bit, your channel will run smoother, and you’ll get back the time you thought you’d lost forever. Regularly Check Automated Processes Even the most reliable systems need regular check-ups. ‍ Think of your best YouTube automation tools as a well-tended garden; without consistent care, weeds can overtake the beauty. Regularly reviewing your automated processes ensures they align with your channel's goals and adapt to any changes. ‍ For example, if you've automated video uploads or SEO tasks, periodically assess whether the metadata generated remains relevant. ‍ Trends evolve, and outdated tags or descriptions can negatively impact your visibility. Tools like VidIQ can alert you to shifts in your niche, allowing you to adjust your strategy accordingly. Balance Automation with Human Touch YouTube workflow automation is a powerful tool, but it shouldn't replace your unique voice and creativity. Viewers connect with authentic content. ‍ While platforms like Zebracat can streamline video creation, adding personal elements—such as responding to comments or hosting live Q&A sessions—keeps your audience engaged. ‍ Brands combining automation with human interaction saw higher engagement rates than those relying solely on automation. Use automation to handle repetitive tasks, freeing up time for activities that require your personal touch. ‍ \"Automation is great for the grunt work,\" I often say, \"but the heart of your channel—the connection with your audience—should always come from you.\" Maintain Consistency with Branding Think about your best friend. They’ve got their signature style—maybe it’s a favorite hoodie or those worn-out sneakers they always wear. ‍ Then one day, they show up in a sharp suit and fancy shoes. You’d stop and stare, right? Not because they look bad, but because it doesn’t feel like them. ‍ That’s exactly how your audience feels when your branding suddenly changes. If your thumbnails, fonts, or tone aren’t consistent, it throws them off. It feels like they’ve landed on someone else’s channel, and that trust you’ve built starts to fade. ‍ Automation can help you keep things steady. Tools like Zebracat make it easy to create templates for intros and outros that match your style every time. Use the same colors, fonts, and layout so your audience always knows it’s you. Track and Adjust Based on Analytics Automation without checking your numbers is like driving with your eyes closed—you might be moving, but you have no idea where you’re going. Take time to look at your channel’s performance. Tools like YouTube Studio show you what’s working, like how long people watch your videos or how often they click on your thumbnails. If some videos don’t click with your audience, tweak your approach and create more of what they love. FAQs ‍ How Does Automation Affect YouTube Channel Engagement? Picture this: You’re throwing a party. You’d want everyone to feel welcome, right? Automation can help with stuff like managing the guest list or sending reminders, but if it’s overdone, people might feel like they’re just another name on a list. ‍ Same deal with YouTube—automation can make posting videos and handling comments easier, but too much can make your channel feel... kinda impersonal. People want to feel like there’s a real person behind the screen. If your replies seem automated, viewers might not stick around because they don’t feel valued. What Are the Risks of Automating YouTube Content? Automation’s a time saver, but it’s not perfect. Think of it like a double-edged sword. ‍ On one side, it helps you get things done faster, but on the other, it can mess things up if you’re not careful. For example, you might accidentally post something irrelevant or poorly timed if you’re not watching closely. ‍ Overdoing automation can also make your channel feel robotic—like sending a pre-printed birthday card instead of a handwritten one. It’s just... meh. People come to YouTube for the personal vibe, so don’t lose that! How Can I Automate Responses to Comments on YouTube? Automating responses is like having a helpful friend at your party who greets people and answers basic questions. Tools like YouTube’s moderation features or bots can handle stuff like “Thanks for watching!” or FAQs. ‍ But here’s the thing: not every comment should get an automated reply. Sprinkle in some real responses to—it shows your viewers you’re paying attention and that they matter. A mix of both works best! Is It Possible to Automate Live Streams on YouTube? You can totally automate parts of your live streams!. Tools like OBS Studio or Streamlabs can help schedule streams or set up graphics automatically. But here’s the kicker: live streams are all about interacting with your audience in real time. So, while you can automate the setup, you still need to be there, chatting and connecting with your viewers. That’s what makes live streams awesome. Can I Automate Ad Placement in My YouTube Videos? Yes, you can. You don’t have to do anything—YouTube already places ads automatically on your videos. ‍ However, if you want to control what types of ads appear, how many should show up, where they should appear, and when they should play, you’ll need to set it up yourself or hire a virtual assistant to do it for you. ‍ This process can be quite time-consuming, and so far, there aren’t any tools to automate this. But I’ll keep you updated if anything changes! ‍ But don’t go overboard with ads. Too many can annoy viewers and make them click away. Keep a balance—ads should work with your content, not ruin the vibe. ‍ Conclusion While AI can automate your YouTube channel entirely, I still recommend keeping an eye on it to maintain authenticity. ‍ AI is powerful and has a lot of potential, but it's still in its early stages and can’t fully replace you. Don’t ignore your content completely. The best way to grow long-term is to create a lot of worthwhile videos with Zebracat and keep monitoring your channels to bring your channel to the next level. ‍ Influencer List Widget Create videos from blog post in 1 minute! 85% of your audience craves more video.

Turn your texts, PPTs, PDFs or URLs to video - in minutes. Learn more How to make AI videos The tools you'll need will depend on the specific type of AI-generated video you want to create. I suggest the following: For studio-quality videos with AI avatars: Synthesia For social media and YouTube content: FlexClip, Veed, Canva For creatives and short storytelling: Runway, Kling, Hailuo, Sora, Luma For AI-powered video editing: Filmora, Topaz, Capcut For AI-powered video repurposing: Munch, Opus Clip, Vidyo For animated videos: Animaker, Renderforest If you want a more in-depth guide to these tools then check out our guide to the best AI video generators. How to create AI videos using Synthesia PlayCreate an AI Video in 4 Minutes with Synthesia ⚡️ You can create an AI video in 5 simple steps with Synthesia: Step 1: Create a new video Step 2: Paste in your script Step 3: Choose an AI avatar Step 4: Edit your video Step 5: Generate your video You can follow along with this demo: Or you can follow the step-by-step guide below. Let's get started! Step 1: Create a new video Log in to Synthesia, then click 'New video'. You can start from blank or choose one of a wide variety of templates. I recommend you choose a template for the best results. You can customise everything later. Tip 💡Speed up the design process by using a video template If you don't have an eye for design, or you simply want to save even more time, use professionally-designed video templates. Synthesia has 55+ video templates for a wide range of video types, from training videos, marketing videos, explainer videos, promo videos, video presentations, and so much more. And, you can still adjust every element to your liking! After selecting a template you can click the ‘Add scene’ button on the left to see the various layout options that come with your chosen template. You can use these scenes to start to build out the structure of your video. Step 2: Paste in your script ‎Synthesia's is an AI video generator based on a text-to-video model - which means that you can create videos just by typing text. One option is to just upload a document: Synthesia can handle PDF documents, PowerPoint files, Word documents, and TXT files (read more on converting a PDF to video). However, for the best results I recommend you review your text and transform it into a video script. It's not as difficult as it may seem, but it makes a world of difference to the video creation process. We have a dedicated guide to creating video scripts to help you out. Once you have that ready, copy your video script and paste it into the script box scene by scene. Synthesia will use that text to generate a text-to-speech voiceover for your avatar. Your avatar can speak in more than 140 languages. You can either type your script in your target language, or type it in another language and translate it later. The text-to-speech we use is pretty damn good, but if you find that it's mispronouncing words, you can always adjust the pronunciation and add pauses and emphasis to improve the narration. ‎‎Step 3: Choose an AI avatar This is where the AI comes in to perform its magic. In this step, you can choose an AI avatar to act as a narrator/presenter in your video. There are 230+ diverse AI avatars to choose from, and you can choose where you want the avatar to appear, how large or small it should be or hide it altogether. To add an AI avatar in Synthesia, click 'Avatar' in the panel on top of the video canvas. Pick the avatar(s) you want to use and the framing (Full-body, Circle, Voice only). Adjust the position and size of the avatar on the video slide by left-clicking on it with your mouse. ‎Step 4: Edit the video It's time for video editing. Luckily, you won't need any fancy video editing software for this. ‎Here are some of the things you can add and change in your AI video without using external video editing tools: Images (stock or own) Backgrounds videos Screen recordings Background music Shapes Text on screen Animations, transitions GIFs, icons, logos Step 5: Generate the video That's it; you've just made an engaging video using AI. Once you press 'Generate video,' Synthesia will perform some AI abracadabra and, well, generate the video. ‎‎Once the video passes through our content moderation process, you can view it, share it, download it, or embed it. And if you really like it, you can even duplicate it or create a video template from it. What are AI videos used for?

The AI interprets the prompt and generates a matching video, complete with movement, lighting, and even physics. This is by far the most popular type of AI video generation. Image-to-video Look at that VEO 2 animates windows wallpaper! pic.twitter.com/qL51V8S4oA — testtm (@test_tm7873) December 26, 2024 Image-to-video AI video generation animates static images, bringing them to life with motion effects. AI can generate smooth transitions, camera movements, or even animate characters from a few frames. Image-to-video models are popular with AI video creators because they allow you to maintain character, scene and object consistency throughout your video. You would typically use these tools alongside an AI image generator like Midjourney. Video-to-video @runwayml has 4K upscaling now! 🤯 I did a comparison between Runway GEN-3 and Topaz Video AI's upscaler, from HD to 4K. Runway's file size footprint is 40% of Topaz (using the Theia model), and after reviewing the results on a 40\" monitor, there's little to no difference in… pic.twitter.com/GamPOXq9mr — Tom Blake (@Iamtomblake) January 9, 2025 Video-to-video AI video generation uses AI to enhance, modify, or transform existing videos rather than creating new ones from scratch. This can include improving video quality, changing styles, adding special effects, or even altering elements within the footage—like removing objects, or replacing backgrounds. Some good examples of video-to-video includes Synthesia's AI dubbing (with lip sync) or Topaz's video upscaling. Th‎e best AI video generator for studio-quality videos with AI avatars Synthesia PlayCreate an AI Video in 4 Minutes with Synthesia ⚡️ Verdict: Easy to use and great for training, internal communications, marketing, outreach and localisation/translation ‎Link: ‎https://www.synthesia.io/ Synthesia is a leading AI video generator that allows you to create studio-quality videos with AI avatars that can narrate your text. It includes more than 60 video templates you can start from, and you can choose between more than 230 AI avatars that speak more than 140 languages and accents. Here's an example video I made for a product launch: PlayProduct Introduction (Free AI Video Template) Synthesia can be used to create a variety of video types, with the most common use cases being learning and development videos, including training videos and other eLearning video production. It also excels at producing onboarding videos and video content for internal communications, as well as marketing and outreach videos. Synthesia is a top-ranked AI software, with 1150+ reviews on G2 and has a rating of 4.7 out of 5. The platform is being used by 50,000 companies of all sizes, with many big names among them, such as Reuters, Zoom, and Amazon. Synthesia is a browser-based platform and I found it easy to set up my first video. I simply typed in my script, selected an avatar from their library, customized my video with the AI video editor, and then Synthesia generated a polished video featuring one of its realistic AI avatars. With over 230 avatars to choose from, I easily found options that fit different tones and purposes. You can also make a custom avatar that looks like you. Synthesia supports over 140 languages, and I was able to create localized versions of my video with ease. The platform even has a multilingual video player that automatically translates videos to viewers’ preferred languages, making it useful for global audiences. I tried adding multiple avatars on screen to simulate conversations, which worked smoothly and could be helpful for training scenarios or role-playing videos. The platform has over 60 professionally designed video templates that make it easy to produce polished content quickly. Features like live collaboration tools allow teams to work together seamlessly, while detailed video analytics provide insights into video performance. Altogether, these capabilities make Synthesia a practical, efficient choice for professional projects. One of its most popular use cases is as training video software, but it's also great for other sales and marketing videos and multilingual content. Th‎e best AI video generators for creative video production Here's my rundown of the best text-to-video and image-to-video AI video generators for creative video production. Hailuo Hailuo Director Mode is so fun. Being able to combine camera shots is just fantastic. Here shaky camera and push in. pic.twitter.com/MfqBA22vm8 — Jerrod Lew (@jerrod_lew) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best free option for creative video production Link: ‎https://hailuoai.video/ Hailuo AI is an AI video generator that delivers high-quality 6-second video clips at 720p resolution. It offers text-to-video, image-to-video and a subject reference feature. Hailuo offers a 3-day free unlimited generation period so that you can generate a bunch of videos for free and really test the tool. Subject reference is a particularly cool feature. It lets you upload a photo of a character and then generate a scene with that character in it. I found the output to be pretty accurate, although I often needed to do some manual editing to maintain coherence. The model can also take multiple attempts to get it right, which will eat into your credits. The feature also often fails at close-ups (wide shots tend to work better but lose fine details). One of the first things that stood out to me was how well it understands prompts. Hailuo seemed to nail camera movements and scene composition accurately. The image quality is also noticeably high. However, generation times are limited to 6 seconds, which makes creating longer sequences more tedious. Al‎ibaba Qwen Another day, another release. Alibaba have quietly included video generation in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max and it's really good. Here are a few examples - check them out. pic.twitter.com/u6qptO59ai — TomLikesRobots🤖 (@TomLikesRobots) January 30, 2025 Verdict: Completely free and produces high quality videos, but often with unreliable generation Link: ‎‎‎‎https://chat.qwenlm.ai/ Alibaba included an AI video generator in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max. It’s a text-to-video only tool, but it’s completely free and I’ve been impressed by the quality. The one catch is that the generation is kind of unreliable. I often enter my prompt and the video generates up to 99% complete and then gets stuck for quite a while. In my experience the videos do eventually finish generating but be prepared to wait a little. The output quality seems to be really good, and while the functionality is limited, it’s completely free and the videos have no watermark. Kl‎ing If you’re looking to combine character consistency with high-quality VFX, @Kling_ai is the best choice. 🎥✨ Version 1.5 absolutely nails VFX. A true must-have! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/rO1WvmLj3k — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) January 12, 2025 Verdict: High quality output, but very long free plan generation wait times Link: ‎https://www.klingai.com/ Kling offers text-to-video and image-to-video features, along with free video generation credits for users who log in each month. Kling brings an impressive level of fluidity and realism to movement in videos. I found the adjustable creativity and relevance slider particularly useful for fine-tuning outputs. Its biggest strength lies in image-to-video generation (and in particular its elements feature), which is far superior to tools like Runway. The motion is smoother, and the AI follows prompts accurately. When I asked for a character to blink or walk forward while the camera zoomed in, Kling delivered exactly what I asked for. If you need storytelling or consistency between frames, Kling is a great option. Kling 1.5 also supports HD, which is a nice bonus. Kling has some drawbacks, the biggest being generation speed. On the free version, I sometimes had to wait an hour or more for a single clip, and I’ve heard of free users waiting a full day for results. This is a major issue if you need quick iterations. On a paid plan the generations are quicker, but I also noticed that Kling sometimes gets stuck at 99% completion and wastes credits. At the end of the day, if you prioritize quality, accuracy, and motion control, Kling is a great choice. The motion brush tool adds extra control, and the first-attempt success rate is high, meaning I spent less time fighting the AI to get what I wanted. Ru‎nway When setting up a shot in Runway, think carefully about where to put the camera. Consider what the camera placement tells the audience about the story, about the character, and about the moment. Every angle is a decision that affects how the audience will experience it. pic.twitter.com/XnijHcb0Jv — Cristóbal Valenzuela (@c_valenzuelab) November 11, 2024 Verdict: The Gen-3 model gives you great results and some amazing advanced features that come with a bit of a learning curve Link: ‎https://runwayml.com/ Runway’s latest Gen-3 model offers a comprehensive suite of creative tools, such as text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video, alongside advanced features like motion brush, keyframes, camera controls and inpainting. On the free basic plan, you can create short text-to-video clips (up to 10 seconds long or 16 seconds using the \"extend video\" feature in the older Gen-2 model) but can’t upscale resolution or remove watermarks. You also can’t generate videos directly from text using their Gen-3 Alpha model on the free plan (only images to video). However, you can still make great videos with just the image-video feature. Here's an example workflow to show you how I use Runway’s free plan to create AI-generated short story videos: Midjourney to generate images Runway for image-to-video Suno to generate music Elevenlabs for some effects Topaz for video upscaling Capcut for editing I found Runway’s advanced features to be pretty amazing. Camera control lets you adjust angles, focus, and movement to achieve a polished, professional look. The Motion brush tool allows you to add motion and direction to specific parts of a video, which is great for creating visually dynamic social media content. Keyframes allow you to configure the starting, middle, and ending frames to create smooth transitions between them. Inpainting lets you automatically remove unwanted objects throughout your clip. This tool handled complex scenes surprisingly well; I could remove background elements without affecting the continuity of the video, something that would usually require a lot of time and expertise. However, I found that these advanced features come with a learning curve, so if you’re new to video editing you might need a bit of practice to fully utilize Runway’s capabilities. I found Runway’s video generation process to be fast and reliable. I think the pricing is reasonable given the platform’s capabilities, especially for creators, filmmakers, and digital artists who want more control and creative freedom. However, the costs might feel high if you’re only looking for basic AI video generation, as Runway is designed for those looking to push creative boundaries and explore the possibilities of AI in video production. Go‎ogle Veo Been generating impossibly dangerous stunts with veo 2 using text prompts. Still surprising how realistic they can look (though not perfect yet). pic.twitter.com/0gETBwGH5y — Ethan Mollick (@emollick) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best option for creative video production, but limited access for now (US only waitlist) Link: ‎https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/ I was blown away by Google Veo 2’s realistic video generation capabilities. Every clip I produced, from a misty jungle scene to a foggy wildlife sequence, was rendered in stunning detail, and the visual fidelity was top-notch. One of the aspects that stood out for me was the advanced cinematic controls. I could specify everything from lens types to shot angles and even adjust depth-of-field effects, which made it feel like I had an entire professional film crew at my fingertips. The dolly zoom and pan shot features, in particular, added that extra layer of cinematic flair that really brought my scenes to life. In my tests, Veo 2 consistently produced more “correct” results compared to other tools like OpenAI’s Sora. The physics simulation is fantastic with objects and characters that move and interact in a way that feels natural and true to real-world behavior. I found that character consistency was excellent too; no matter how complex the scene, the generated characters maintained their look and identity throughout the video. Veo 2 supports high-resolution outputs (up to 4K) and longer video durations too, which simplifies your workflow as you won’t need upscaling tools. The only reason why Veo 2 isn’t my top pick for creative video production is because it’s still not publicly available - you have to join a waitlist and it’s still US only. There’s also room for improvement still, and I sometimes saw some strange character movements in my generated videos. Op‎enAI Sora 🚨 It’s crazy! #Sora just dropped, and it’s already blowing everyone’s minds! 😱🎥 Here are 10 mind-blowing examples showcasing its insane possibilities. 🔥 The future of video is here. 🚀👇 pic.twitter.com/Mcq2OepO3R — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Fun to play around with but needs to improve Link: ‎https://sora.com/ Sora is OpenAI’s entry into text-to-video AI video generation, and after spending some time with it, I’ve found it to be a mixed bag. On the one hand, when Sora works, it can deliver stunning, lifelike visuals, especially for abstract or artistic scenes. Its storyboard functionality is one of my favorite features, as it lets you prompt multiple shots in a single generation, and the “Blend” option adds a fun layer of creativity, allowing you to combine visual elements in unexpected ways. However, in my experience the model struggles with some critical aspects. Sora consistently fails when it comes to physics, general body movements, and character consistency. For example, I tried generating scenes as simple as making cats dance, only to be met with choppy motion, glitches, and overall results that were far from convincing. In several cases, the outputs felt like a gamble: some generations might be passable, but most of the time, prompts didn’t translate well into the expected actions or camera movements. I found that free or cheaper alternatives outperform Sora in accuracy and usability. There’s a steep learning curve, and despite the potential of the video-to-video remix functionality (which I’ve used to remaster some older AI-generated clips), the overall inconsistency is hard to overlook. You can access Sora on the plus plan ($20/month) which gives you 50 videos up to 720p resolution and 5 seconds long, or the pro plan ($200/month) for 500 videos up to 1080p resolution and 20 seconds long. Pi‎ka I had early access to the Pika 2.1 Model, A new journey begins, More clips to follow! @pika_labs pic.twitter.com/rN5OfMacoo — Stevie Mac (@StevieMac03) January 23, 2025 Verdict: The free plan isn’t great, but the premium plans have very good image-to-video features Link: ‎https://pika.art/ Pika offers a free plan that gives you access to Pika 1.5, which has text-to-video and image-to-video features and 150 monthly video credits. Videos can be downloaded without a watermark on the free plan. I wasn’t super impressed with the quality of the generated videos though. However, while Pika 1.5’s video output is nothing special, Pika 2.1 (available on the paid plan) offers an image-to-video feature called scene ingredients, which I think is pretty amazing. With scene ingredients you can build a shot from the exact character, object, wardrobe, and setting you want. It works by using reference images of each element and then providing a prompt. It’s similar to Kling’s elements feature in that it allows you to ensure creative consistency between scenes, which I found made it a super useful tool to produce actually usable videos. Lu‎ma First impression Luma > Sora pic.twitter.com/R2pXVsAesw — The Retro Burn (@burntheretro) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Their new Ray 2 model is great, but it’s a premium feature and it doesn’t offer image-to-video Link: ‎https://lumalabs.ai/ Luma's Ray 2 model has great motion realism and the physics feel really natural. The frame-to-frame consistency is a clear improvement over previous versions and it does an excellent job with cinematic elements, responding impressively to lighting, contrast, film formats, and camera motion. At times, it even seemed to intelligently structure shots. By using highly detailed prompts and running multiple generations, I found that it’s possible to create some truly stunning videos, though it does require some cherry-picking to get the best results. When I tested a sports car driving through snowy mountains at dawn, the scene composition was spot on and the snow, warm light, and camera tracking all felt smooth and natural. I also experimented with close-up shots of faces, and I was surprised by how well it captured emotional expressions, particularly in an extreme sadness prompt, where the eye movements and facial subtleties felt incredibly lifelike. Where Luma stands out is its ability to generate dynamic camera movements while keeping the scene coherent. It understands cinematic depth and framing in a way that makes it ideal for dramatic shots. I found that Luma is great at handling large-scale scene changes. For example, when I asked it to generate a collapsing building Luma delivered a convincing destruction sequence. Currently, Luma’s Ray 2 is only available to paid users and is capped at 720p resolution. Videos can be up to 10 seconds long, but I noticed that after about 7 seconds, scene consistency can start breaking down, occasionally shifting in unintended ways. Ad‎obe Firefly Here's another video created by Adobe Firefly.. a 3D printer, printing a car. Very impressed by the results. https://t.co/L5d8zf3TGv pic.twitter.com/ySylkRlDMS — techAU (@techAU) February 13, 2025 Verdict: Inconsistent motion and limited free use (only 2 free generations) make it hard to recommend Link: ‎‎https://firefly.adobe.com/ Adobe Firefly offers both text to video and image to video, both capable of producing 1080p clips from simple prompts or static images. Firefly struggles with distortion. I tested it by generating a video of \"a cyclist riding through a mountain trail in autumn,\" and while the colors and scenery were nice, the motion was noticeably unnatural. The cyclist's legs appeared to glitch mid-pedal, and the overall movement felt disjointed. Image to video fared better when creating abstract or background footage, but realistic human action remained a challenge. The output currently feels more like digital experiments than polished, usable content. On the positive side, Firefly's interface is intuitive. The built-in controls for adjusting camera angles, motion paths, and shot sizes make experimenting with different styles relatively simple. After generating two free videos, I was prompted to upgrade to either Firefly Standard or Pro for additional generations. While Firefly is enjoyable to explore and has clear creative potential, I’ll stick with more reliable alternatives for projects that need high-quality, natural-looking results. The best AI video generators for social media and YouTube content Fl‎exClip PlayHow to use FlexClip's AI Video Creator Verdict: User-friendly video tool with innovative AI features Link: ‎https://www.flexclip.com/ FlexClip is highly user-friendly platform that excels at helping you create professional-looking videos quickly and efficiently. I love the drag-and-drop editor. It’s perfect for creating videos on the fly without needing to spend hours on intricate editing. I’ve used it to create everything from social media content to promotional videos. The AI-powered text-to-video tool allows you to input simple text prompts, and the AI generates video clips based on the text, matching stock footage, adding text overlays, and even suggesting music. It's perfect for social media clips. While the AI can be a little hit or miss when it comes to perfectly matching footage to specific content, it’s an amazing tool for creating videos when you’re short on time or just need a draft to build upon, and I typically only need to make a few adjustments after generation. The AI script generator is another great feature. While the scripts are generally a good starting point, they often need a little fine-tuning to match the specific tone of the brand or subject matter. This is definitely a time-saver, though, especially when you’re stuck trying to put ideas into words. Another feature that impressed me was the AI background remover. It works surprisingly well. For most images, the background removal is clean, though it sometimes struggles with more intricate details like hair or small objects. It’s a great time-saver when you’re working with product images or need transparent backgrounds quickly. FlexClip also offers an auto-subtitle generator, which is a great tool for improving accessibility and engagement on social media platforms. It’s surprisingly accurate, and I’ve used it for videos on YouTube and Instagram. However, it does occasionally struggle with fast speech or complex accents, so if you’re working with content that has unclear audio, this may not always be 100% reliable. One area where FlexClip could improve is its media library. While it offers a decent range of stock footage and images, it’s not as extensive as some other platforms I’ve used. For niche content, I’ve often had to source additional media from other places. The stock library is good for general-purpose videos, but it may not always have exactly what you need. Ve‎ed PlayHow to Make a YouTube Intro Verdict: User-friendly browser-based video editor that streamlines social media content creation Link: ‎https://www.veed.io/ Veed is a user-friendly, browser-based video editor that made creating social media content incredibly easy for me. The intuitive layout and drag-and-drop functionality let me start projects quickly, and I loved using features like automatic subtitles, text-to-speech, and background removal to give my videos a professional touch. The templates and filters helped keep my style consistent, and with auto-translate, creating multilingual content was straightforward. The only downside I found was that the free plan includes a watermark, and complex scenes sometimes required a bit of manual tweaking to get the AI effects like background removal just right. Overall, Veed offered everything I needed for quick, polished videos with minimal effort. Ca‎nva PlayCreate content fast with Canva Video Verdict: AI-powered video editing with versatile templates Link: ‎https://www.canva.com/video-editor/ai/ Canva is not only a design tool; it’s also a great alternative for creating social media and YouTube videos. I tried its video editor, and I was impressed by how well it adapts to video creation. Canva’s templates make it easy to start projects tailored for platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. One of my favorite features is the automatic resizing, which lets me quickly reformat videos for different platforms without needing to start from scratch. The AI-powered suggestions for text and animations are also handy—it feels like Canva’s tools know how to keep my content consistent and visually engaging. With access to a vast library of stock media and music, I could easily enhance my videos, and the new AI text-to-speech and captioning features were a nice bonus, especially for making my videos more accessible. Overall, Canva’s video editing tools made it simple to produce polished, shareable content that looks just as good as anything created with dedicated video editors. The best AI-powered video editors Fi‎lmora PlayFilmora 14 is HERE! | Introducing a NEW way to edit Verdict: An affordable and user-friendly video editor with robust AI features Link: ‎https://filmora.wondershare.com/ When I first tried Filmora, I was immediately struck by how easy it was to navigate. The drag-and-drop functionality and straightforward interface made it simple to start editing, even without much prior experience. Filmora offers a robust library of transitions, effects, and templates, allowing me to quickly put together visually appealing videos, which is ideal for creating content for social media and YouTube. I appreciated how the platform balances usability with a range of features, making it suitable for both beginners and intermediate users who want to produce polished videos without a steep learning curve. Filmora’s pricing is also accessible, with options that cater to different types of users. They offer an annual subscription starting at around $49.99 per year, and for those looking for more flexibility, a lifetime license is available for around $79.99. There’s also a free version, which is great for testing the software before committing, but it does add a watermark to videos. For creators looking to edit consistently without major financial commitments, Filmora’s pricing offers a good balance of affordability and value, especially considering the powerful AI tools it includes. These plans are well-suited for individuals and small business owners who need regular access to professional-grade video tools without breaking the bank. Filmora's AI-powered tools bring a lot of convenience and creativity to the editing process. I'll run through each one. The AI Smart Cutout feature, for example, allows you to cut objects out of scenes by painting over the area, which is perfect for isolating specific subjects without complex masking. I also found AI Audio Denoise to be extremely useful for cleaning up background noise in my videos, especially when I recorded in less-than-ideal environments. The AI Audio Stretch tool was another handy feature that let me extend background music to match scene transitions, saving me the hassle of remixing or finding perfectly timed tracks. These AI tools are not only time-saving but also elevate the overall quality of the final video, helping users create professional-looking content with minimal effort. The AI Motion Tracking tool was a lot of fun to experiment with—it can be used to track faces or moving objects, allowing for privacy blurring or creative effects like pasting funny stickers over someone’s face to make meme-style videos. Another feature I really enjoyed was AI Remove Background, which made it easy to change the background of my videos without needing a green screen. I could, for instance, place a runner in an outer-space setting, which opens up endless creative possibilities. Additionally, Filmora’s AI Silence Detection tool helped speed up my editing by automatically removing pauses and hesitations, making it effortless to create snappy jump cuts. These tools make Filmora an efficient, AI-enhanced option for quick edits and visually dynamic effects. However, while these AI tools are great for general use, there are a few limitations. The precision of features like Smart Cutout and Remove Background isn’t perfect and might require manual touch-ups for complex scenes. Additionally, while Filmora handles most tasks smoothly, rendering can slow down when working with high-resolution files or when using multiple AI features in one project. This might be a drawback for users with demanding workflows or those creating high-quality, professional-grade content. Overall, though, Filmora’s AI tools make it an impressive choice for social media creators and hobbyists. In summary, Filmora is an accessible, budget-friendly video editor that packs a lot of AI-driven functionality into an affordable package. It’s particularly suited for those creating content for social media, YouTube, or personal projects. With its range of pricing options, Filmora offers a lot of value, especially for casual and intermediate creators who don’t need the high-end features of more advanced (and expensive) software. To‎paz PlayExperience Wonder by Topaz Labs Verdict: A premium AI-driven enhancer that delivers cinematic upscaling and noise reduction for professional-quality footage Link: ‎‎https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-video-ai Topaz Video AI is an advanced video enhancement tool that uses AI to upscale, stabilize, and improve video quality. When I tried it, I was impressed by how well it upscaled footage, even to resolutions as high as 16K, adding a cinematic clarity to older or lower-quality clips. The AI-driven noise reduction made a noticeable difference, effectively removing grain and artifacts that I struggled with in other software. I also found the frame rate enhancement and slow-motion features to be smooth and natural, making it ideal for creating professional-quality slow-motion shots or restoring archival footage. Priced at $299 for personal use and $1099 for commercial licensing, Topaz Video AI is an expensive but valuable investment for filmmakers, content creators, and digital archivists looking to elevate their work with high-end upscaling and video repair capabilities. Ca‎pCut PlayLearn How to Create Amazing Content using CapCut Web Version | CapCut Verdict: A free and versatile editor with intuitive AI tools that make crafting polished content effortless across devices Link: https://www.capcut.com/ CapCut is a free, all-in-one video editing tool that I found easy to use across mobile, desktop, and browser platforms. The array of AI-powered features—like background removal and automatic upscaling—made editing quick and straightforward, especially for creating social media content. The audio-to-text transcription was a time-saver, automatically adding captions that boosted accessibility and engagement on my videos. I liked tools like video stabilization and text-to-speech, which let me enhance video quality without needing complex software. CapCut’s collaborative features were also helpful, especially when working on shared projects, and the library of templates gave me plenty of creative options. Overall, CapCut’s versatility and ease of use make it a great choice for both personal and professional video editing. The best AI video generators for video repurposing Op‎usClip PlayOpusClip 3.0: The smartest AI clipping tool just got smarter Verdict: A smart and time-saving tool that repurposes long videos into engaging, platform-ready clips with minimal effort Link: ‎https://www.opus.pro/ Opus Clip has quickly become one of my favorite tools for repurposing long videos into social media-friendly clips. The AI-driven clip generation feature is surprisingly accurate, identifying the most engaging parts of my videos and saving me the time I’d usually spend sorting through footage. I appreciate how it automatically resizes clips to fit different platforms like TikTok and Instagram without any manual adjustments. Adding captions and even emojis is simple, and I noticed it makes the videos more engaging, especially for viewers who watch without sound. One of the standout features is the \"hook\" identification, which picks out key moments to grab attention quickly. Overall, Opus Clip made it easy to create compelling, shareable content from my existing videos, and the AI features really lightened my workload. Mu‎nch PlayMeet Munch Verdict: Efficiently converts long-form content into shareable social snippets using AI Link: ‎https://www.getmunch.com/ Munch is an AI-based tool for repurposing long-form video content into shorter clips suited for social media platforms. It identifies key moments in videos and includes features like auto-cropping, subtitles, and format adjustments to help optimize content for platforms such as Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok. Munch offers a streamlined way to create shareable content from existing videos, aimed at enhancing reach and engagement across various channels. I found the interface clean and easy to navigate, allowing me to jump right in without needing tutorials. One feature I particularly liked was the automatic detection of key moments. Munch’s AI identifies engaging segments, which saved me the time of manually sifting through my footage to find the best parts to share. For anyone looking to repurpose content across platforms, this automation is a real time-saver. Munch’s formatting tools also make it easy to resize videos for different social platforms. The auto-cropping options adjust clips to fit Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and more, making cross-platform distribution simpler. I appreciated the automatic subtitle feature, which made my videos accessible to a broader audience without much additional work. However, while these features are useful, they lack some customization. I couldn’t manually adjust the selected clips as much as I’d like, and sometimes the AI would pick sections that didn’t feel as relevant or engaging as I had hoped. One limitation I noticed is that the output quality and customization options are fairly basic compared to more advanced editing software. While auto-cropping and subtitles are convenient, the styling options for subtitles are limited, and I missed having more flexibility with transitions and effects. This might be a drawback if you’re aiming for highly polished, branded content, as Munch is more focused on speed and efficiency than fine-tuning. Overall, though, it’s a solid tool for quickly repurposing long videos into social-friendly snippets. If you need a quick way to generate clips from existing content and don’t require advanced editing, Munch is a handy addition to your toolkit. Wi‎secut PlayTurn long videos into shorts with Wisecut AI Verdict: Wisecut streamlines editing by automatically trimming dead space and adding professional touches Link: ‎https://www.wisecut.ai/ Wisecut automatically finds interesting moments in long clips and cuts them, adding music and subtitles. I tested it by uploading a raw clip full of awkward pauses and unnecessary dead spots, and Wisecut’s smart editing removed all the fluff. The auto-cut feature was spot-on, leaving me with a much tighter, more engaging video without having to painstakingly cut it all myself. The tool is super intuitive. It offers handy features like background noise cancellation and even let me choose whether to add background music, which really helped polish the final product. I also appreciated the straightforward interface—it made setting up projects and tweaking settings a breeze. In short, Wisecut has saved me a significant amount of time, letting me focus more on creating content rather than getting bogged down in editing. If you’re looking to streamline your workflow and produce cleaner, more professional videos, I’d highly recommend giving it a try. How did I decide on the best AI video generators? I focused on the following factors when building this list: Quality of Output – I evaluated whether each tool produces videos with the resolution, length, and overall quality required for professional results Ease of Use and Customization – I looked for an intuitive interface and flexible customization options to accommodate different skill levels and creative needs Platform Compatibility and Export Options – I checked if the tool is compatible across devices and offers export options suitable for various platforms Pricing and Free Plan Limitations – I compared pricing structures and the limitations of free plans to ensure they offer good value for different budgets AI Capabilities and Features – I specifically assessed the AI-driven features About the author Content Writer & Marketing Expert Ema Lukan Ema Lukan is a seasoned Content Writer and Marketing Expert with a rich history of collaborating with marketing agencies, SaaS companies, and film studios.

You know that feeling when you open a new app and your brain just goes \"nope\"? That was me with pretty much every video editor out there. After trying what felt like a million different options (and maybe crying a little), I found WeVideo. Real talk - I was super skeptical because these days everything's \"AI-powered.\" Like, my coffee maker probably has AI now or something. But this one's actually different. You just chuck your videos in the cloud (no more phone screaming at me about storage!), and get this - it's actually kind of fun to use? Never thought I'd say that about video editing! What I really love about it: • Super easy to pick up (didn't have to watch 500 tutorials) • Works right in your browser (my old laptop is so happy) • The AI actually helps instead of making a mess of things Here's a tip from someone who learned the hard way: use their templates! I used to be all \"Nah, I'm too creative for templates,\" but boy was I wrong. They're like having a friend with amazing design skills stopping you from making terrible choices. The other day, I threw together a birthday video for my mom in half an hour. Half an hour! Usually, it takes me that long just to figure out where the basic tools are! Look, it's not perfect - sometimes it thinks my cat's a dog (rude), and yeah, I still end up Googling stuff now and then. But honestly? It's the least frustrating video editor I've ever used. And at this point in my life, \"least frustrating\" is basically a five-star review. Hope this helps!

Now, these aren’t (yet) as advanced as AI image generators, so don’t think you can just type “make a new Star Wars movie,” and it will create a blockbuster for you. Instead, what they do is automate many of the tasks involved in video editing, such as cutting footage to insert, re-ordering scenes, adding audio effects, generating captions, and adding avatars, graphics, or animations. However, they are becoming more powerful and flexible by the day, so who knows what they will be capable of soon? Whether you want to speed up the process of making corporate how-to videos or try your hand at becoming the next Stanley Kubrick, here’s a rundown of some of the top generative AI platforms for creating and editing videos today.

More Newsletters Descript Descript is something of a disruptive player in the generative video market as a startup launched by one of the co-founders of Groupon. By gaining a reputation as a powerful tool for social media content creators and TikTok kids, it’s hit a marketing sweet spot, but it’s also used across a wide range of corporate and educational use cases. Descript users start with a script and then build their video out from there. You just pull in footage that can be manipulated and enhanced with AI, as well as audio that can be imported or generated from text, mimicking the user’s voice. You can then edit and re-arrange the timeline simply by snipping and moving the text. Descript stands out from other AI video editing tools – particularly ones that are available free online – with its user-friendliness and range of features. Everything is set up to make it quick for anybody to start producing and editing videos. Handy features such as eye-contact correction and “one-click” studio-quality sound are signs that the team is looking to add valuable innovations as the tool evolves. Adobe Premiere Pro with Sensei Another example of an industry-standard tool being given a generative AI makeover for the modern age. Adobe Premiere Pro has long been a video editing tool of choice for professionals and enthusiasts and now has a suite of new features powered by Adobe’s Sensei generative AI platform. Functions like transcription, inserting and re-ordering scenes, color correction, and audio adjustment, such as remixing music to match the timing of visuals, can now be streamlined and automated using natural language. It also has a text-to-speech feature that simplifies the process of creating captions and transcripts. This reduces the time that creators need to spend on manual tasks, allowing them to focus on more creative elements of their work. Adobe is going all-in on generative AI, adding tools and capabilities across its entire Creative Cloud suite, and video production is just one area where it is leading the field today. Pictory Pictory aims to automate the process of turning scripts and blogs into videos with minimal user effort. It’s great for those who want to make quick, snappy videos for marketing or just for fun. It can also be used by educators and online course creators to make lively learning material. One of the tasks it specializes in is automatically creating highlight reels showcasing the most important, exciting or interesting moments from longer videos. It then makes it simple to quickly repurpose them as trailers or social clips to engage more viewers. Generative AI is clearly going to make a big splash in the world of marketing, and there are plenty of tools designed to fit the needs of marketers. User-friendliness is a key feature of this platform, which focuses on making it simple to create the type of videos that millions of businesses across the world need every day. Runway Runway is different from the other platforms I’ve highlighted here because it does – to an extent – offer straightforward text-to-video generative AI. This means you can type “Sun rising over a beach at sunset,” and it will create a completely synthetic video. Alternatively, you can upload an image and bring it to life. When I tried it, the results were sometimes not exactly what I was hoping for, but they were impressive nonetheless, and it’s mind-boggling to think what this technology might be capable of in the not-too-distant future. As with ChatGPT and any generative AI tool with language-based input, the results can be greatly improved by taking some time to learn about the best ways to communicate what you want it to do. Other Great Generative AI Video Tools Beyond the five tools listed above, there are many other tools rapidly developing in the field of generative AI video creation, with the most noteworthy ones listed below for their innovative contributions and capabilities. Colossyan: Generate synthetic content tailored for workplace learning. Deepbrain: AI-generated virtual avatars and synthetic media aimed at corporate and business users. Designs.AI: Generate graphics, videos, logos and other design assets. Elai: Generative video tool geared towards designing training videos. Filmora 13: Full AI-powered video editing suite with chatbot co-pilot to help you out. Flexclip: Offers a good range of templates and resources, making it easy to get started with AI video. Fliki: Transform text into lifelike speech and videos; make videos in minutes. Heygen: Create talking photographs and other cool AI video tricks. Invideo: Create videos using a simple interface and pre-made templates. Lumen5: Web-based tool that converts text into engaging videos as well as AI “talking heads.” OpusClip: Automagically transforms long-form videos into short, punchy viral clips. Peech: Create branded videos from your existing content library for podcasts, webinars or social media. Synthesys: Generate professional AI-powered avatars and voiceovers Timebolt: Make videos more exciting by removing silences, rapidly cutting scenes and speeding up when the action is slow. Veed.io: Enhance video content by adding automated captions and subtitles, cleaning up audio issues and AI editing. Visla: Create professional videos with AI functions such as automated generation from scripts, natural language voiceovers and collaborative functionality. As we journey through the landscape of generative AI and its impact on video creation, it's clear that the tools we've explored are just the tip of the iceberg. The array of emerging tools rapidly developing in this space promises to further revolutionize how we create, edit, and envision video content. The potential for generative AI in video creation is vast, and as these tools become more sophisticated and accessible, we stand on the brink of a new era of storytelling and content creation.
