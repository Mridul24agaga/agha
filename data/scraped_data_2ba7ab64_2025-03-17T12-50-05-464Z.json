They’re using some AI magic to help people create videos without needing to be a video wiz or have fancy equipment. Think of it as a one-stop shop for anyone who wants to whip up videos for social media, marketing, or just for fun, without diving deep into the nitty-gritty of video production.\n\n### Main Features\n\n1. **Video Creation and Editing Services**: At its core, AutomateTube is like a digital toolbox for making videos. Users can create videos from scratch or edit existing footage. This is a big deal for anyone wanting to produce engaging content without the whole film crew behind them.\n\n2. **User Accounts**: You’ll need to create an account to use their services. This means keeping your info up to date and making sure your account is secure.

AutomateTube just needs a license to host and share your content. But there are rules to follow. They’re pretty strict about the kind of content allowed, which means no illegal stuff, no copyright violations, and definitely no sketchy software. They want to keep the platform safe and sound.\n\n### Payment and Subscriptions\n\nNow, let’s talk money. AutomateTube operates in USD, and the fees involved can change, but they promise to let you know beforehand. Some features might need a subscription, so if you’re planning to dive deep into what they offer, keep an eye out for any costs that might come up.\n\n### Legal Stuff and Terms\n\nOkay, here’s where it gets a bit serious. AutomateTube has terms and conditions that you have to agree to if you want to use their services. They cover everything from how they can change the service at any time to the limits of their liability (basically, they’re saying they’re not responsible for any mishaps that come from using their platform).\n\nThey also have a refund policy, privacy policy, and all that jazz, which is pretty standard. If they change their terms, they’ll give you a heads-up, which is nice.\n\n### Audience and Use Cases\n\nWho’s this aimed at? Honestly, pretty much anyone who needs to create video content. This could be marketers needing quick promo videos, social media influencers looking to spice up their feeds, or even individuals wanting to create personal content for family and friends. You don’t have to be a tech genius or a video editing pro to figure it out, making it accessible for a wide audience.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nIn a nutshell, AutomateTube is stepping in to simplify the video creation game using AI. They’re making it easier for people to produce professional-looking videos without the hassle of traditional methods. You get ownership of your content, have guidelines to keep things clean, and a flexible payment structure that can fit various budgets.\n\nSo if you’re someone who needs to crank out videos but doesn’t want to spend hours learning complicated software, AutomateTube might just be your new go-to spot. Just remember to stay within their content rules and keep your account safe, and you’re good to go!",

What's Good Bit Rate and Its Effect on Video Best Codecs for Exporting Your Project Choose the Right Video Format for You More about Quality & Performance More What you’ll learn: Video post-production fundamentals What’s post-production? Why is post-production important? Key differences: Pre-production, production, and post-production Video post-production: Essential editing steps for beginners So, what’s Post Production? Post production is the third and final stage of video creation and it follows on from the first stage, pre-production and the second stage, production. It’s a detailed process that involves many different skillsets and types of professional software, all working together to create a final version of your video. Why is Post Production Important? Without the film post production process, there is no finished product. Every element of post production works to enhance the overall story of the film. Sound mixing and editing, for example, helps setting the mood and tone of the piece — which is further enhanced by color grading. With skillful editing, a video can reach its full potential. Key Differences: Pre-production, Production and Post Production Pre-production Pre-production is the planning phase. It encompasses every stage of work that occurs before a film is shot. What’s involved: Scripting, Storyboarding, Shot List, Hiring, Casting, Costume & Makeup Creation, Set Building, Financing and Insurance, Location Scouting. TIP: Having a strong concept is an essential component of a video. Unfortunately is often an overlooked step in the production process. Production Production is the shooting phase. Footage is gathered by filming scenes live. What’s involved: Filming, On-location Sound Recording, Reshoots. TIP: The quality of footage you get in production can't be corrected in post-production, so make sure the footage from production is the highest quality you can get! Post production This last stage is where the film takes shape as an actual product. Post production is organizing, cutting, coloring and editing the footage captured in production. What’s involved: Editing, Colour Grading & Correction, Visual Effects & Animation, Sound Recording, Foley Recording, Script Sound Recording, Sound Mixing & Editing, Soundtrack & Music. TIP: Using a video editing software gives you a more intuitive and fast way to edit video enabling you to take your creativity to the next level. Now we know what post production means, let’s dive into the fundamental stages of post production process. Basic Workflow for Editing Your Video In the post production stage of your video-creation process, you take the elements you shot during production and craft them into your final vision for the video. Here's where you add effects, sound, music, and titles. You’ll use non-linear editing software on your computer, and possibly other software for sound processing, visual effects, and even 3D graphics. Every video is different, but all projects involve fundamental basic post production steps. POWER UP YOUR STORY Every great video begins with a story... Planning Every edit starts with a plan. For most professional productions, the plan takes the form of a well-crafted script along with detailed storyboards honed to make production of the video as smooth as possible, from the initial idea all the way to delivery of the video. Every good video tells a story, with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Write your script around the story you want to tell. You’ll also want to plan how you’ll use music, graphics, text, and effects, so there’s a logical flow and consistency to it. If you didn’t shoot with a script or storyboard, now is the time to come up with a plan for editing and telling a story with your video. Logging/Importing Your Footage Most video editing software allows you to preview clips without importing them into your project, so that’s a great way to review the video footage and decide what you’re going to use. Remember, some “bad” footage can be salvaged. You can be color-correct your footage if necessary, or stabilize shaky footage. It's always best to avoid problems like this in the first place, but if that's not possible, then your post-production tools can come to the rescue. Get a good feel for what your editing software can do, and you’ll know what footage you’ll be able to use despite the problems it has. Once you’ve decided on the files you want to use for your video, import them into your project. Then, you can sort the footage into folders or “bins.” For example, you might sort B-roll or insert shots into a single bin. Or, you could sort footage into bins by scene. You have a lot of flexibility, and each project may require different organization techniques, so determine what works best for your project. Editing Work smarter, not harder. Some NLE software enables you to perform pre-editing tasks before you ever bring your footage to the timeline. For instance, you can sequence the clips into one or more rough-cut versions with a storyboard feature. And you can mark In and Out points to pre trim your footage, that is, define the sections of a clip that you want to use. This can save huge amounts of time later in the process. If you haven't already used a storyboarding tool to assemble your clips roughly in the order you want, you can bring them to your timeline and do the job there. Refer to your script as you assemble your scenes, so you know you’re getting everything you planned. Once you have a rough edit that you like, you can begin the fine editing process where you get your edits exactly right. You'll also add transitions, fades in and out, and more to finalize the flow of your story from beginning to end. Multicamera Editing Use the multicamera tools in VEGAS Pro to work more efficiently and instantly switch between camera angles in a multicamera shoot. Special Effects With Boris FX Continuum effects you can add spectacular effects to your films. Lens correction plug-in Lens distortions are not a problem anymore with this plug-in, which helps you to remove distortions quickly and easily. Learn more Visual Enhancements Unleash your creativity. Now that you have your polished edit, it’s time to add corrections, enhancements, visual effects, and “movie magic.” First, you need to master the video. Stabilize any shaky clips, clean up unwanted noise or artifacts in the video, and correct color or add creative color grades for a unique or specific look to your film. Then, you will add visual effects like green-screen composites, 3D imagery, and any other visual processing or enhancement you may want. Video Stabilization Sometimes an editor has no choice but to work with a shaky clip. With video stabilization, you can salvage otherwise unusable footage. Video stabilization in VEGAS Pro makes it quick and easy to make wobbly footage super stable. Contrast Correct color or add creative color grades for a unique or specific look to your film. Add depth and detail to your image naturally with these contrast adjustment sliders. Enjoy a level of control which helps you achieve the perfect pop in your image every time. Learn more Sound Processing and Effects Set the tone. With your visual edits and effects now in place, it’s much easier to add in music and other sound effects and synchronize it to your video. Remember that your sound exists to enhance your visuals. It's a huge part of your overall video, so don't underestimate its importance, and don't compromise on quality! Few people notice great audio (and that's exactly what you strive for), but everyone will notice bad audio. It can't be overstated: Great videos need great sound. First, clean up any sound that needs it, using noise filters and other audio tools to remove as much unwanted background noise as possible, and even out your volume levels so they’re consistent. Then you can add enhancements like sound effects, voiceovers, music, and everything else which makes a great video experience. Perfecting audio Start perfecting audio when you’ve got all your visual elements in place. Use audio meters to know for sure that you have consistent levels. Many sound problems can’t be easily fixed, so make sure to record clean, strong audio so you don’t have to try to fix it in post. If you do have problems, clean up unwanted sounds, and use crossfades between sound clips to smooth out the transitions between them. Multiple Audio Busses You can mix and arrange sophisticated audio effects with audio busses. Assign tracks however you like and combine effects for incredible flexibility and creativity. Learn more Final Delivery Know your audience, Deliver for your audience! Turn your footage into amazing videos and truly cinematic experiences. Choose which format best suits your audience and enjoy the ability to create eye-catching dynamic title animations to give your film a one-of-a-kind look. Text and Titles Now it’s time to add titles and credits at the beginning and end of your video, and any other text you may need. Don’t forget that you have the chance to make titles really creative and interesting! Export Once you’ve completed your edit, it’s time to export so others can watch it. Decide which format best serves your audience. Streaming services like YouTube and Vimeo provide guidelines for how best to export. There are different requirements if you want to export for DVD or Blu-ray video, or even broadcast TV. Most editing software has a wide array of options to choose from, and some offer a high degree of control over your export options.

Types of video effects What do you need to add video effects? 10 Video Editing Effects to Transform Your Footage How to easily add effects to a video FAQs on Video Editing Effects Video editing effects are a great way to take your content to the next level. Adding dynamic cuts and eye-catching transitions will keep your viewer’s attention. You can use effects to boost engagement and make visually entertaining videos. Finding new ideas for editing effects can be challenging. But whether you’re a beginner or a pro editor, we’ve got some suggestions to make your content stand out from the crowd. Our list of 10 must-try video editing effects is full of exciting and creative ideas for you to try out. What are video editing effects? Video editing effects might sound complicated, but they’re pretty straightforward. They are ways of enhancing your content with cuts, transitions, and filters. Some effects are simple and commonly used, like jump cuts. Others, like CGI and LUTs, are more complex. Content creators usually choose editing effects that help them enhance the tone and pace of a video. Editing effects are a great tool for keeping the viewer’s interest as a video plays. Types of video effects There are a few different types of video effects. From the epic and cinematic effects used in movies to subtle edits, you may not even notice in your favorite videos. Certain effects are for specific purposes, like perfecting the mood and viewing experience of a video. To do this, creators use tools including color correcting and frame adjustment. On the other hand, eye-catching and extraordinary effects exist too. These include green screen creations and dramatic transitions. Invisible effects vs. visible effects Invisible and visible video effects are different results that you can achieve through editing. These two categories of editing effects have some key differences. You could use one type or another to enhance your video. Most creators use a combination of both for maximum effect. Visible effects are edits that look obvious to the viewer, and they can clearly see the video is edited. Changing the speed of the video, adding animations or 3D elements are some examples of visible effects. These effects deliberately stand out. They are used to tell a story or create an atmosphere in the video. Invisible effects, on the other hand, are not supposed to be noticeable. These subtle edits include color-correcting and stabilizing footage. They help make the video look more realistic rather than being eye-catching features of the video. Invisible effects are best when viewers cannot tell they are even there. They create consistency and enhance the natural features of the video. What do you need to add video effects? To add video effects into your content, you need the right software. Video editing software comes in a few different forms. There are downloadable softwares, apps, and online editing platforms. It’s best to pick a software type that fits with your workflow and lifestyle. For example, if you’re on the go a lot you may prefer an editing app. Some video editing software is more advanced than others. You won’t find exactly the same effects across all platforms. Think about what type of effects you want to add before looking for software. This will help you choose a basic or more complex platform. If you want to save on space, you can also try an all-in-one recording and editing platform like Riverside. Riverside records in up to 4K video resolution, and it’s text-based editor makes video editing as easy as going through a text transcript. Learn more, or start editing videos effortlessly with Riverside. Video editing software with effects There’s plenty of software to choose from when you’re searching for video effects. However, every platform is different. If you’re a beginner editor or want a smaller toolkit of effects, you could try Apple iMovie. On the other hand, more advanced software exists if you’re looking for a greater variety of effects. Adobe Premier Pro and Corel VideoStudio Ultimate both offer a pretty extensive range of transition, color grading and special effects tools. You can use these to unleash your creativity. 10 Video Editing Effects to Transform Your Footage If you’re ready to enhance your content with video effects, look no further. We’ve got 10 amazing effects for you to try out. The list below is full of ideas for your next eye-catching video. Flex your creative muscles by giving these editing effects a go – the results may surprise you! Video speed Switching up the speed of your video is an easy way to catch people’s attention. Slow down a clip to make the scene last longer. This can create funny moments, like watching a person fall in slow motion. Slowed videos can also have dramatic effects, like a bullet leaving a gun at a drawn-out pace. Speeding up your video is a great way to cover a lot of ground quickly. For example, you can speed up a clip of a person sewing a dress to give an overall sense of the process. This is a really useful effect when the viewer does not need to see every moment of the clip in detail. Using time lapses can also make beautiful, awe-inspiring events like sunsets leave a lasting impression. Intro title Many content creators use intro titles to present themselves and the topic of their video. Because intro titles are often the first thing you see when you play a video, they should be attention-grabbing. They are usually no longer than a few seconds, so the viewer can dive into the content without getting bored. These titles consist of images or text showing the content creator or topic of the video. Your intro should be animated to be eye-catching. Intro titles have many positive effects. They can help with branding and personalizing your video. They also create expectations about the kind of content the viewer is going to see. Because of this, they are a great way to increase viewer engagement. Filters Video filters add a special effect to a person or scene. You can use fitlers to create effects like blurring, smoothing, pixelating, and more. There are many reasons to use filters. They can make a scene look dramatic, otherworldly or artistic. Often, they are used to enhance a person's appearance or create an atmosphere in the video. You can find editing software on mobile and desktop devices that offers a range of filters to try. They are a great storytelling tool accessible to beginners and pros. Motion graphics Motion graphics refers to animated graphic design. This means text or images that are animated and move within the video. You can animate a whole image or word, or elements of it can change. For example, you could create a title and have the font or color change. There are strong reasons for using motion graphics. They draw attention to particular words or phrases, so you can make taglines, brand names, and more stand out. You can also use them to add personality and fun to your video. You can use them to tell jokes or add entertaining features to your narrative. LUTs LUTs (Lookup Tables) are color filters you can apply to change the color of your video. A LUT is a set of numbers that remap your image and alter its look. You can get LUTs for free from certain camera manufacturers, editing software, and content creators. You can use LUTs in video editing software like Final Cut Pro. LUTs give your footage a certain aesthetic. Videographers use them to create a consistent look with their content. They are also a helpful way of preparing your video for color grading. Color grading You may not realize how many videos you watch have been color graded. This video effect is an essential step for many creators. It can transform your content in subtle ways to achieve a consistent tone or color. Deciding on a color palette before you edit your video is a good idea. Your palette will give you direction when it comes to color grading. You can be creative with this effect to set the mood of your video or be stylistic. For example, brightening up the main person’s face in your video. In this way, color grading can help you draw attention to certain parts of a scene. Color correction Color correction is a crucial step in the editing process. It’s amazing how making subtle changes to the color of your video can have a powerful overall effect. With color correction, the aim is to fix any problems with how your footage looks. It’s also important to make the colors in your videos match the natural tones in the real world. You might be wondering why color correction is so essential. Well, through this process you create continuity in the colors between different video clips. This creates a sense of unity to your video. When color correcting, you can also make changes to exposure, contrast, skin tones, hair color and more. This helps create a natural look and feel to your content. Transitional effects Transitional effects have one key purpose: to move from one shot to another. They are very handy tools for creating visual interest in your video. You can use them to add fun, creativity, or professionality to your storytelling. For example you could use a fade transition, where one shot gradually dissolves into another. This is a gentle way to move between scenes, and can be used to create a nostalgic or thoughtful tone. There are many different types of transitional effects to choose from. Some can make your video seem more dramatic or dynamic, while others are best for a serious atmosphere. Popular transitions include: jump cut, cutaway, wash out, fade, wipe, L Cut and J Cut. You can experiment with these types to find the style that works best for your content. Reverse video Having part or all of your video played in reverse is a simple way to create an interesting visual. Footage played backwards can be used to entertain viewers, make them laugh, or show a journey from end to beginning. Editing software like Adobe Express includes features to reverse your video clips. Putting a song or voiceover on top of a backwards video clip is a popular idea. This is because a story can be told while the reverse video plays. Split screen Split screen means having multiple shots in frame at once. This effect has a huge benefit: it allows you to show different people’s reactions at the same time. You can use this editing effect for podcasts and interviews. With certain video editing software, you can even customize the layout of the split screen. You can put coloured borders around different camera angles. Or you could have the shots switch between different people. It’s best not to overcrowd the screen with too many shots at once, or viewers won’t know where to focus. Tip! Try Riverside’s automated layouts. You can split your screen with just a quick click.

You can add special effects to a video using editing software. The specific process for adding effects varies a little from platform to platform. Usually, you can find an effects section within the toolbar of your editing software. You can either drag and drop effects or select points in your video where you want to add them. You can add special effects with mobile editing apps, online editors or downloadable software. What are the 5 stages of video editing? The five stages of video editing are as follows: Stage one: Organize Go through your recorded material and sort the clips you want to use. Group and label the clips according to the scenes or takes they refer to. Stage two: Assemble Arrange your clips into a timeline. The clips should be put together to match the storyboard or narrative you want to tell with your video. Stage three: Rough cut Create a first draft of your video. Make cuts to scenes, add transitions, an intro and any other features you need to enhance the pacing. Stage four: Fine cut Go through your video draft and pay close attention to detail. Make smaller edits regarding pacing and framing at this point. Stage five: Final cut At this stage, it’s time to review your final cut. It’s important that you watch your video on multiple devices to make sure it comes across well on mobile and desktop. This is also the time for color correction and color grading to add the final touches to your video.

#EditingTips #YouTuber 10 comments yep we are going to make your videos much better in this video i'm going to be giving you five tips to not just make your videos much better but it will also allow you to focus on the tasks that actually makes your videos much better and eliminate all the boring and monotonous tasks that actually makes video editing sometimes very boring and frustrating and trust me even if you are a citizen editor you will hear things or to hear that you probably didn't know or just didn't do so let's just get it started oh and by the way don't forget to hit the like button and subscribe to the channel for more videos like this one so let's start with the number one which is extremely generic but criminally underutilized or completely misused which is having an editing workflow this is basically a list of things that you need to have for every single video that you will be doing from the beginning to the export this will make a video i think much faster because you will not need to think about what to do next and to make it easier for you to understand how it works i'm gonna give you my own video editing workflow step one collect the footage that means collect everything that i've recorded and put them in one place one folder one drive which is easily accessible for any video editing software step 2 transcoder footage it's extremely important step that we're going to talk about this in a minute step 3 put the footage in your video editor self-explanatory just drop the footage into an editor that's basically it next is cut the footage basically to get rid of all things that you don't need this can be a silent parts or mistakes or things like that and i'm gonna teach you how to do that extremely fast in a minute as well next is add b-roll basically take all the additional footage that you recorded and put it on the top of your main footage like main footage is like this one and b-roll is all the clips that you see on this footage next is add graphics and other graphical elements we're doing this right now because all the main footage is already cut and edited and now we can add some more resource intensive tasks like graphics this can be your titles your intros your outros your end screens your calls reaction and things like that and all the texts and things like that as well next is edit your audio this is your adding your music adding your sound effects leveling your volume correcting your audio and things like that we're doing this now because basically all the video part is practically done next is color grade slash color correct practically self-explanatory you're gonna fix the colors of your videos you're doing this right now because all again all the footage is already done and color graded footage usually is pretty difficult to run on video editing software so we are gonna do this closer to the end and the next step which is extremely important is to wait yes you heard this right will it be an hour or day or two just let your edited footage to rest for some time because you need to clean your head just to understand what you might be missing or maybe what you might be overusing as well next step you check again you're gonna go through all of your id footage again and see what you need to fix and the last but not least is export basically everything is ready and now video is ready too now let's move to the important tip number two transcoding your footage with handbrake transcoding your footage basically transforming your videos into different file formats it can make your videos smaller which is easier to store but can be a bit difficult to run on video editing software because video editing software needs to decompress all this footage or it can make your footage larger which makes it difficult to store but easy to edit because your video editing software doesn't need to decompress it anymore i highly suggest you to use software called handbrake and transcoder footage as i said in a previous step before you're gonna put them in your video editing software handbrake is absolutely free software that literally is free and open source software available both on windows and mac and you can use it extremely simply i myself use it for every single video it makes it extremely easy to edit afterwards i just put my footage input all the settings that i want at the end and just press export and i just wait a bit and the video is done tip number three use auto cutting software and for that i use software called timebolt and timebot literally saves me hours of time while editing when you record the videos and as an example when i record my videos this can be youtube videos or course videos i have a lot of dead air in it to explain what that air means that air is basically silent parts in your video where you think where you read or where you do basically nothing and you need to cut all of those parts manually while editing well with timebolt not anymore tumbled is basically standalone software where you put your transcoded footage it finds all dead air and just selects all the data for you or cuts it completely for you and at the end you can export an xml file or just completely cut eclipse and just put it in your video editing software what i do in my case i export xml file basically preserving everything that was cut out from the video and just put it in a video editing software and all i need is just go through entire footages and just cut out mistakes which is extremely fast and extremely simple when all the dead air is already gone i will be linking time bolt in the description down below by the way i'm not sponsored by timebolt i just love the software it is a paid software it has a free tier as well that you can try but it has a paid software as well and i actually contacted developer and they actually gave me a special discount code which you can read it on a screen right now that gives you 20 off from every plan i simply cannot stress this enough if you are editing a lot of footage this will save you an hours and hours of time it's extremely great and i'm simply amazed why i was not using this software before try it yourself and you can thank me later tip number four is to use shortcuts guys and girls i simply cannot stress this enough always use shortcuts while using editing and for the also didn't understand what do i mean by that it's a i'm talking about keyboard shortcuts basically as an example in my case as i use davinci resolve if i want to make a cut usually if i don't use the keyboard shortcut i need to move mouse select the tool select the cut point and then deselect the tool to move to regular move tool it takes a lot of time and mouse movements and mouse movements are very very inefficient while editing while keyboard shortcuts can increase the speed of those mundane tasks by a lot and every single video editing software has their own sets of keyboard shortcuts and i highly highly recommend you to learn them and to be fair when i learned keyboard shortcuts my editing speed actually doubled and again to be fair if you are an old subscriber and remember when i was editing my all of my videos actually on my ipad to be fair the reason why i'm not indigo on my ipad anymore is because i cannot use the keyboard shortcuts and when you learn keyboard shortcuts you can focus on the thing that is important which is the story and video itself and last but not least is number five which is the biggest thing that saved my time by a lot and it is kind of like a step up from the keyboard shortcuts and it's using macros and i use macros to basically eliminate all the repetitive tasks in my video editing and for that i use a software on my mac which is called keyboard maestro and on windows you can use the software called autohotkey and what macros allow you is basically to do a multiple tasks or sequence of tasks with a single click of a button or just single combination of a button as an example when you want to cut a clip in your video these are the action that it takes so first you need to select the beginning of the cut then you need to make a cut then you need to select the end of the cut then you need to make the cut then you need to actually select the clip that you want to cut away and then you need to delete it which usually takes two key strokes like in my case it's shift delete this takes a lot of time even with using keyboard shortcuts now with the macro that i've built that's the thing that i need to do cut the beginning of the clip move to the end make a cut and delete everything with one command or basically all the actions that i've told you before down to only two actions and when you have longer videos it saves a lot of time because it all adds up because trust me even selecting six commands versus two commands because you decrease the editing effort three times which is huge and now i'm going to show even more complicated macro that i've built utilizing the mouse as well look how keyboard micro allows me to do audio leveling and effects with one single command everything you see right now is done automatically without me touching anything how cool is that or look how fast i can apply the color grade to an entire clip it's insane how fast you can do things with macros it takes some time to learn them but when you do boy oh boy the possibilities are practically endless with the things that you can do with the macros and not just in video editing it's basically in everything so that was it there was five tips that i actually use myself to become a better or rather faster video editor and focus more on the quality rather than on just doing the things that are simply boring utilize these tips and tricks and you're gonna become much faster editor and for all the software that i talked about you can find the links in the description down below oh yeah and don't forget to hit the like and subscribe this video and i'm gonna see you in the next one take care",
