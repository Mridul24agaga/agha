  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, my friend, let’s break down this website content from AutomateTube. So, this site is really centered around helping folks create videos using AI technology. Basically, it’s a platform where you can whip up some slick videos without needing a film crew or a degree in video editing. Sounds pretty cool, right?\n\n### What’s the Vibe?\n\nAt its core, AutomateTube is an AI Video Generator. It’s all about making the video creation process easier and more accessible for everyone. Whether you're a content creator, a marketer, or just someone wanting to share something fun on the internet, this site seems to have your back. The whole premise is to automate a lot of the grunt work that usually goes into video production.\n\n### Signing Up & Getting Started\n\nTo hop on board, you’ve got to create an account. This isn’t just a free-for-all; they’ve got some basic rules in place. You need to be at least 13 years old, and they're on top of account security, so no sharing your login details with your buddy. You know the drill—keep it to yourself. Plus, make sure your account info is legit because they expect you to keep that updated.\n\n### What They Offer\n\nWhen it comes to services, they’re giving users a handy platform for video creation and editing. Pretty much, you can create videos from scratch, list them, and maybe even edit existing videos. The site hints that they might tweak their offerings from time to time, which is typical for tech platforms; you evolve or get left behind, right?\n\n### Content Ownership & Rules\n\nOne of the cooler points is that you, as a user, still own the content you create. So, if you whip up a dope video, it’s yours. However, by uploading it to their platform, you’re giving AutomateTube a license to host and display your work. It’s like saying, “Hey, I made this, but you can show it off for me.” But they also lay down some ground rules on the type of content you can upload. Anything illegal or harmful? Nah, that's a hard pass. \n\n### The Nitty-Gritty on Payments\n\nLet’s talk money for a sec. The pricing is in USD, which is pretty standard. They do mention that the fees might change, but they’re on it with notifications, so you won’t get hit by surprise charges. Some features might even require a subscription, which is the norm for a lot of platforms. They’re keeping it secure when processing payments, so you can rest easy on that front.\n\n### Liability & Legal Stuff\n\nNow, no one likes the fine print, but it’s important. AutomateTube clarifies that they’re not responsible for any indirect problems that might come from your use of their services. So, if your video bombs and you blame them—sorry, not their problem! They also reserve the right to change their terms whenever they feel like it, but they promise to give you a heads-up if it’s a big deal.\n\n### The Lowdown on Prohibited Content\n\nThey draw a pretty clear line on what you can’t upload. Think of it as a digital no-fly list. Content that’s illegal, harmful, or misleading? They’re definitely not about that life. Plus, don’t be thinking you can throw up someone else’s copyrighted material without their okay—it’s a no-go.\n\n### Wrapping It Up\n\nSo, in summary, AutomateTube is all about providing an AI-driven platform for easy video creation. They value user-generated content, but with a solid set of guidelines to keep everything cool and legal. While they do charge for some services and maintain the right to change things up as they go, they seem committed to giving users a simple way to create and share videos. It’s hard to say if it’s something that’ll change the game for everyone, but for those looking to dip their toes into video content creation without breaking a sweat, it could be a solid option.\n\nIf you’re into creating videos but don’t want the hassle of traditional video editing, AutomateTube might just be worth checking out. Just keep an eye on those terms—they like to keep things fresh!",

Follow 999998 Austin Miller Technology Lover | Technical Blogger · Oct 6 · Austin Miller Technology Lover | Technical Blogger · Oct 6 · What is automated video editing? Automated video editing is a process that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to streamline the video editing process. Instead of manually trimming clips, adding transitions, and applying effects, software can analyze the footage and make intelligent decisions based on pre-defined rules or learned patterns. Key features of automated video editing software: Scene detection: Automatically identifies the beginning and end of scenes within a video. Shot detection: Recognizes individual shots (e.g., close-ups, wide shots) within a scene. Content analysis: Analyzes the content of a video to identify objects, people, and actions. Automatic editing: Applies pre-defined editing rules or learned patterns to create a finished video. Benefits of automated video editing: Increased efficiency: Reduces the time and effort required for video editing. Improved consistency: Ensures that videos adhere to a consistent style and format. Enhanced creativity: Allows editors to focus on more creative aspects of video production. Cost savings: Can reduce the overall cost of video production. While automated video editing is a powerful tool, it's important to note that it may not always produce perfect results. Human oversight and intervention are still necessary to ensure that the final product meets the desired quality standards. 327 views · 9 upvotes · 4 shares · 1 comment 30 views · Upvote · Comments About the Author Austin Miller Technology Lover | Technical Blogger Owner at South Point Convention Center2015–present HM in Hotel Management, New York UniversityGraduated 2014 Lives in Jacksonville, Florida, USA2015–present Knows Middle English 2.5M content views48.4K this month Active in 14 Spaces View more in Universe of Everything About · Careers · Privacy · Terms · Contact · Languages · Your Ad Choices · Press · © Quora, Inc. 2025",

Whether you’re a YouTuber, a small business owner, or a professional video editor, producing high-quality content quickly and efficiently is key to staying ahead of the competition. In recent years, AI video editing tools have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional manual editing methods. But what exactly is driving this shift, and why are more creators making the switch to AI? Let’s dive into the comparison between free AI video generator and traditional editing, exploring the advantages, drawbacks, and real-world applications. Traditional Editing: A Tried and True Method Traditional video editing has long been the industry standard. For years, video editors used software like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, and Avid Media Composer to create professional content. These tools provide manual control over every aspect of the editing process, from cutting footage and colour grading to adding sound effects and transitions. For many creators, traditional editing is the most familiar approach. It offers complete creative control, allowing editors to manipulate every frame and detail of a video. However, this control comes at a cost. Traditional video editing requires a high level of skill, and the process is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. Here are some key factors that define traditional editing: Manual Control: Editors can tweak every aspect of the video by hand, which provides precise control over the final output. Learning Curve: Traditional software often has a steep learning curve, requiring hours of training and practice to master the tools. Time-Consuming: The editing process can take days or even weeks for larger projects, especially when editing long-form content. High Costs: Traditional video editing software often requires significant investment, both in terms of software licenses and hardware. While traditional editing still remains the gold standard in many professional settings, it’s not without its challenges, particularly for creators who need to churn out content quickly and efficiently. AI Video Editing: The New Frontier AI video editing tools have introduced a new era of efficiency and automation. Powered by machine learning algorithms and neural networks, these tools analyse raw footage and automatically make decisions on how to improve the video. Whether it’s trimming unwanted sections, adjusting audio levels, or applying filters, AI tools can do it all in a fraction of the time it would take a human editor. For many content creators, AI is quickly becoming the go-to solution for video editing. But how exactly does it differ from traditional methods, and what makes it so appealing? AI video editors work by automating many aspects of the video editing process, allowing creators to focus more on the creative and strategic aspects of their content. Some key features of AI-powered tools include: Automated Trimming and Cutting: AI tools can automatically identify and remove unnecessary sections of a video, such as awkward pauses or repeated content, saving hours of editing time. AI-Generated Captions and Subtitles: Many AI tools can generate accurate captions and subtitles automatically, making videos more accessible and improving SEO. Scene Detection and Organisation: AI can recognise changes in scenes or subjects and break footage into manageable chunks, organising clips by context or theme. Smart Audio and Visual Enhancement: AI can adjust lighting, colour grading, and sound to enhance the overall quality of a video without the need for manual intervention. Easy Resizing for Multiple Platforms: AI tools can automatically resize and reformat videos for different platforms, such as YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, ensuring your content is optimised for each platform’s requirements. A major benefit of AI video editing is speed. What would traditionally take hours or days of manual work can now be done in minutes or even seconds. This time savings is particularly important for creators who need to meet tight deadlines or manage a large volume of content. Why Are Creators Switching to AI? There are several reasons why creators are increasingly turning to AI for video editing, from the speed of the process to the ability to focus on creativity instead of the technical details. Let’s take a closer look at the factors driving the shift. 1. Time Efficiency Editing a video traditionally requires a significant investment of time. From reviewing footage to trimming, colour grading, and final touches, manual editing can take hours or even days, depending on the complexity of the project. AI cuts this time down dramatically by automating repetitive tasks such as trimming, audio levelling, and colour correction. For example, a YouTube video editor powered by AI can take raw footage, analyse it for key moments, and automatically cut out unnecessary sections. This leaves the creator with a polished video in a fraction of the time. This time savings allows creators to focus on producing more content, which is critical in today’s fast-moving digital world. 2. Cost-Effective Traditional video editing software can be expensive, especially for creators who are just starting out. Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro are industry-standard tools, but their price tags can be prohibitive, with recurring subscription costs and the need for high-performance hardware. AI video editing tools, on the other hand, are often more affordable and can be accessed on a subscription or pay-per-use basis. Many AI-powered platforms offer free versions with basic features, making them accessible to creators at all levels. For small business owners and independent creators who need to manage costs, this makes AI an attractive option. 3. Automation and Scalability The ability to scale content creation is essential for YouTubers, marketers, and businesses. As your content library grows, so does the need to efficiently edit and optimise videos. AI-powered editing tools automate many aspects of video production, making it possible to scale your content output without the need for additional human resources. For instance, AI tools can generate consistent video intros and outros, resize videos for different platforms, and even optimise content for SEO. This makes scaling your YouTube channel or marketing campaign much more manageable. 4. Enhanced Creativity Despite the automation, AI tools still offer plenty of room for creativity. Rather than spending hours on technical editing tasks, creators can focus on the creative aspects of their work, such as storylines, visuals, and audio choices. AI tools are designed to complement, not replace, the creative process. In fact, many AI-powered video editors, such as CapCut Commerce Pro, allow creators to experiment with different visual styles, special effects, and transitions, making it easier to enhance the overall production value without technical expertise. Conclusion: The Best of Both Worlds Both AI and traditional video editing methods have their place in the content creation process. For creators looking for efficiency, speed, and cost-effectiveness, AI video editing tools like CapCut Commerce Pro are proving to be indispensable. However, for more complex projects requiring detailed craftsmanship, traditional editing remains the preferred choice. As AI technology continues to evolve, it’s likely that the gap between traditional editing and AI-powered editing will continue to narrow. In the meantime, creators have the luxury of choosing the tool that best suits their needs—whether that’s the precision of traditional software or the efficiency of AI-driven automation.

Despite its massive feature set, the program interface is clear and not as intimidating as fully pro-level software. It lets you do everything from the simplest clip trimming and VR to multicam and keyframed effects. Who It's For PowerDirector is suitable for serious video enthusiasts and YouTubers who want to do the most with their videos without needing a film degree. Even professionals might find that it has everything they need. It's also a good option if you don't want to pay for a subscription; a one-time license is available.

It offers all the effects, color tools, and collaboration and output options any pro could want. Recent updates have added impressive auto-captioning and the ability to edit video based on the text, a unified Color Manager, AI audio auto-tagging, and collaboration features. It's importing and exporting pages have also been updated to be more intuitive. The program runs on both macOS and Windows. Premiere Pro is only available by subscription, so the cost is relatively low upfront, but it adds up in the long run. That's ameliorated by the frequent and sometimes impressive updates subscribers get. Who It's For As its name suggests, Premiere Pro is for professional video editors. That said, plenty of serious amateurs use and enjoy it. It's especially strong for those who need to collaborate with others, as well as teams who use Adobe's Creative Cloud suite of applications.

Speaking of devices, if you shoot with an iPhone, iMovie takes advantage of the proprietary features in footage shot on it. You also get somewhat advanced tools like chroma-keying, picture-in-picture, and audio filters. Moving up to Final Cut Pro from iMovie makes for a smooth transition, too. Who It's For iMovie targets nonprofessionals like people who want to put together a video of that family vacation or Junior's soccer match. But its Storyboard feature makes it a great starting point for those interested in filmmaking. Of course, it's only for users of Apple hardware, as with most things Apple, and if you need many video tracks, you need a different app. Specs & Configurations Number of Video Tracks 2 Motion Tracking Multicam Editing 3D Editing Supports 360° VR Content Keyword Tag Media Supports 4K XAVC-S Format Exports to H.265 (HEVC) GET IT NOW $0.00 Apple App Store Learn More Apple iMovie Review Best for Professionals on Macs Apple Final Cut Pro 4.0 Excellent Pros & Cons Magnetic, trackless timeline Superior organization tools, including libraries, ratings, tagging, and auto analysis for faces and scenes Support for 360-degree footage and wide color spaces Plug-in support Multicam editing Fast performance Nontraditional timeline editing may turn off longtime video producers Import and export experiences trail those in Premiere Pro No automatic speech-to-text captioning Runs only on Apple hardware Fewer collaboration features than Premiere Pro Why We Picked It Final Cut Pro has a rethought, modern interface with a \"trackless\" timeline. An editor who has worked in this interface for a while will come to enjoy its flexibility and realize that it offers just as deep a set of tools and capabilities as any app with a more traditional interface. Final Cut's impressive AI-powered Scene Removal Mask tool that removes the background in video without requiring a green screen. The iPad version of the app (requiring a $4.99-per-month subscription) dovetails nicely with the desktop application, and Apple has announced multicam editing support for that version. Who It's For As evidenced by the number of top Hollywood movies and shows made in Final Cut Pro, the software is a good fit for professionals, but its usability makes it a fine choice for amateur enthusiasts as well, particularly those wanting to move up from Apple iMovie.

It continues to offer useful tools while delivering fast performance and ease of use. Who It's For VideoStudio is aimed squarely at amateur videographers, YouTubers, and TikTokers. VideoStudio is also a value play with a reasonable one-time license price.

The node-based editing workflow offers the ultimate in-effects control, and the software is replete with keyframing, color grading, and audio tools. It renders video projects with category-leading speed (as long as you select hardware GPU encoding), and the company also makes cameras, consoles, and other hardware that tie in smoothly with the software. Recent tool additions include strong AI-powered editing features, such as auto-captioning and text-based editing similar to that in Premiere Pro. Who It's For Resolve targets professional video editors and has been used in many top-of-the-line Hollywood productions, including Avatar, Dune, and Snakes on a Plane. But that's not to say a determined amateur can't take advantage of its generous free version and go as deep (or as shallow) into its toolset as they like.

Good-looking effects and transitions are included, as are a selection of soundtrack music. Exporting is among the fastest, and you can directly upload to YouTube or Vimeo. It's also reasonably priced, with both one-time and subscription options. Versions are available for both macOS and Windows. Who It's For Those just getting into video editing will appreciate Movavi's clear interface and appealing set of tools for both video and audio. Everyone will appreciate its fast rendering and built-in uploading. It's also good for those who don't want to spend a lot of money on video editing software.

It packs a healthy helping of near-pro-level capabilities into a fairly intuitive interface. Pinnacle has mask motion tracking, titling, and great audio tools, as well as deep support for keyframe editing. For speed, this snappy video editing software is among the best. You don't need to pay a subscription, either, though it's not the lowest-priced option. Who It's For Pinnacle Studio is video editing software for people who want more advanced tools than the company's consumer-friendly app, Corel VideoStudio. If you need multicam, keyframing, and the like, it's a good choice for you. Those who don't want to pay a subscription will appreciate its one-time pricing.

It has nifty capabilities such as color matching, audio-syncing for limited multicam, motion tracking, and speech-to-text. It's also a fine performer when it comes to export speed. Versions are available for both macOS and Windows. Who It's For Filmora is for amateurs who want to keep getting new effect ideas for their videos but don't want to dig into the weeds of a Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve. It's available as either an annual subscription or a reasonably priced perpetual license.

If you want to have some fun with your video without stressing your brain with concepts like timecodes and keyframes (though the latter are available if you want them), Premiere Elements is a good choice. Who It's For Adobe characterizes the audience for Premiere Pro as \"memory keepers\"—those members of the family who want to preserve fun outings and events, spiff them up, and share them. A license now lets you use the program for only three years (previously there was no limit), but that still works out to be more affordable than a full subscription to Premiere Pro. Premiere Elements is available for both macOS and Windows.

Its templates for intros and outros can help give form to your video project. Strong points are its AI-powered speech-to-text auto-captioning and, conversely, its AI voiceovers that turn your captions into spoken words in many voice styles. Clipchamp also boasts some groovy effects to bling up your production values. Who's It For Clipchamp is for anyone who wants to quickly produce compelling short videos without worrying about file formats and other technical details. Social marketers, in particular, will appreciate its templates and their pizzazz. For longer projects, you probably don't want to wait for its much longer rendering times than the other applications included here. It's not only for Windows users, though, since it works on the web on any desktop platform and has mobile apps for the two big OSes.

At this point, all the software here does a fine job of letting you join, trim, and split video clips. Most also provide extensive tutorials, help, and guided editing tools. You can make use of special effects such as animated transitions, picture-in-picture (PiP), chroma-key (aka green screen), and filters that enhance colors or apply creative effects and distortions. With most products, you can add a multitude of timeline tracks that accommodate video clips, effects, audio for soundtracks, and text overlays. Some of the more entry-level programs include a storyboard view, which makes joining clips and adding transitions, effects, and background music even simpler. The Best Video Editing Software for Motion Tracking Motion tracking is an impressive effect that's available in most pro-level and some consumer-level video editing software. It lets you attach an object or effect to something moving in your video. For example, you might use this editing tool to place a blur over the face of someone you don't want revealed in your video or to display a text box next to a moving object. You mark the object you want to track, specify the effect or text, and let the app follow the marked object. (Credit: CyberLink/PCMag) Motion tracking used to be the sole province of special-effects software tools such as Adobe After Effects or Apple Motion. Corel VideoStudio was the first consumer product to include motion tracking. It still leads the pack in the depth and usability of its motion-tracking tool (even including multipoint tracking), though several others now include this video editing tool. Pro-level software like DaVinci Resolve and Premiere Pro also do motion tracking, and they support plug-ins and ancillary applications with even more capabilities. Does Editing Software Support 4K and 8K Video? Support for 4K video source content has become fairly standard in video editing software, and pro software already supports up to 8K and sometimes even higher. However, this isn't really practical unless you're running a full-size movie theater. That said, even smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra can now shoot in 8K. (Credit: Corel/PCMag) Support for 4K and higher formats varies among the consumer products. For example, some but not all the applications can import Sony XAVC and XAVC-S formats, which Sony's popular DSLRs, mirrorless cameras, camcorders, and professional video cameras use. The same is true for the H.265 High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard. Most of the applications here now can import and export HEVC, but there are still a few holdouts. If you plan on working with 4K or higher video content, make sure you choose a video editing application that can render output files quickly (see the section on speed testing below). Support for newer formats, such as the open-source AV1 and the even more efficient H.266 (VVC—Versatile Video Coding), is very limited at this point. Furthermore, none of the apps here supports H.266. Happily, several of them do support importing Google's WebM format. The Best Video Editing Software for Multicam Advanced abilities continue to make their way into accessible, affordable, and consumer-friendly video editing apps as each new generation of software is released. Multicam editing, which lets you switch camera angles for the same scene shot with multiple video cameras, used to be a feature only for professional software. This and many other advanced effects are now available in enthusiast-level programs. CyberLink PowerDirector excels at multicam editing, as do the pro-level applications DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro, and Final Cut Pro. Can You Edit Video on a Smartphone? You can create and edit videos on mobile devices almost as easily as you can watch them. If you're making videos for social media, you might even prefer to edit on a phone. Many of the desktop applications on this list of the best video editing apps also have mobile video editing apps. Adobe has a separate app called Premiere Rush, which you can use to edit video on your phone and then continue editing it on the desktop Premiere app or the Adobe Express app; it comes with a subscription to either. Apple's iMovie interacts similarly with Final Cut Pro. TikTok itself has the excellent and free CapCut. With more than 100 million downloads on the Google Play store, the powerful CyberLink PowerDirector's separate mobile app has made a name for itself on mobiles as well as the desktop. Many of these apps let you shoot video with your phone and start editing right away on the same device. What Is Color Grading and What Can LUTs Do? (Credit: Adobe/PCMag) One capability that has arrived in consumer-level video editing software is color grading. Color wheels, curves, and histograms give editors control over the intensity of every shade. Another important tool you find in some applications is color matching. If you shoot videos with multiple cameras and in different lighting conditions, you should make sure your video editing software has good color-matching capability for a consistent look. You may also want an application that supports producing HDR content, since that's now available on many TVs. LUTs (lookup tables), also known as CLUTs (color lookup tables), are powerful color editing tools. This staple of pro-level software lets you quickly change the look of a video to give it a specific mood. For example, think of the dark blue look of thriller movies like The Revenant. You can download LUTs for free from several sites or use those included with video software to give your video a specific look. One well-known LUT type is the kind that can make a daytime scene look like it was shot at night, known in moviemaking as day for night. In fact, pros use LUTs to simply get colors right based on the camera they use for shooting. What Are the Best Apps for Editing Action Cam Footage? Many video editing apps now include tools that cater to action camera users. For example, several have automated freeze-frame along with speedup, slowdown, and reverse-time effects. CyberLink PowerDirector's Action Camera Center pulls together freeze-frame with stabilization, slo-mo, fish-eye correction, and correction for underwater footage. The Platinum version of Magix Movie Studio includes templates and effects specifically for action-cam footage. Which Video Editors Have the Best Title Effects? These video editing applications pay a lot of attention to creating title effects. Apple Final Cut Pro has added 3D title creation, which is pretty spiffy, letting you extrude 2D titles and rotate them on three axes. Corel VideoStudio also includes 3D titling, though it's not as powerful as Apple's. PowerDirector's Title Designer has transparency, gradient color, border, blur level, and reflection in titles; Magix has impressive title templates, complete with animations. Corel VideoStudio and Pinnacle Studio have a nifty title effect in which your video fills the text characters. Look for an application that lets you edit titles in WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) mode so you can type, format, and time it right over the video preview. Captions for dialogue are another type of text you may want to overlay on your video. Several of the programs now have auto-captioning that takes dialogue from your video clips and produces a caption file. The next step is appearing in the applications, too: letting you edit using the text captions. This capability started in Premiere Pro and most recently has landed in PowerDirector. What Are the Fastest Video Editors? Video editing is one of the most computing-intensive activities. It pays to have the best laptop or desktop you can afford if you're serious about cutting your own movies. Most applications help speed up the editing process by creating a proxy file of lower resolution so that huge, full-resolution files don't slow down normal editing and previewing. Particularly intensive is rendering the finished product into a standard video file that is playable on the target device of choice, whether it's a TV, laptop, or smartphone. Most software can speed up by taking advantage of your computer's graphics processor. Be sure to check the performance section in each review linked here to see how speedy or slow the application is. For render speed testing, I have each program join seven clips of various resolutions ranging from 720p all the way up to 8K and then apply cross-dissolve transitions between them. I then note the time it takes to render the project to 1080p30 with H.264 at 16Mbps and 192Kbps audio. The output movie is just over five minutes in length. I tested on a Windows 11 PC sporting a 3.60GHz Intel Core i7-12700K, 16GB RAM, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, and a 512GB Samsung PM9A1 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD. In my render speed test results over the years, CyberLink PowerDirector has been a leader, but in the latest test runs, DaVinci Resolve currently takes the crown, with PowerDirector, Filmora, and Adobe Premiere Pro hot on its heels. Other measures of performance include startup time and simple stability. Again, video editing is a taxing activity for any computer, involving many components. In the past, video editing programs took longer than most other apps to start up, and unexpected shutdowns were unfortunately common, even in top apps from top developers such as Adobe and Apple. The stability situation has greatly improved, but the complexity of the process only increases as these editors gain more powerful effects. As such, they are likely never fully immune to crashes, which often raise their ugly heads after a feature update. What's the Best Free Video Editing Software? If you don't want to invest a lot of money and effort into your video editing exploits, you have some free options. Our top pick for free video editing is DaVinci Resolve. The free download is popular among YouTubers and gamers because it gives you a large subset of the program's features without the pro-level capabilities you don’t need. The free version is surprisingly robust, with standard editing and cutting, effects, motion graphics, color correction, and audio editing. If you use a Mac, the excellent iMovie comes with your computer. For Windows users, the free Clipchamp gets you all the basics along with some nifty effects, though some of its more appealing features (like exporting to 4K) require a paid subscription. A very cool feature is its text-to-speech voiceover capability. The app is the same on Windows 10 and Windows 11, and it's a Progressive Web App with a multitrack timeline that outputs videos suitable for social media sharing. There are some free video editors in the Microsoft Store, including Animotica, Movie Maker, and Video Editor Studio. Some of them are quite basic, but most include clip joining, transitions, and effects in a touch-friendly interface. One freemium video editing app is not in the app store that recently caught my attention is MiniTool MovieMaker. I prefer apps from the Microsoft Store since I know they've been vetted for security and function, run in sandboxes that can't mess with your system software, and are easy to install and update. Recommended by Our Editors 10 Tips for Editing Home Videos Like a Pro Want to Be a YouTuber? Here's How to Edit Your YouTube Videos (For Free) Adobe Brings AI Text-Based Editing to Video Free video editing software often comes with legal and technical limitations, however. Some widely used codecs require licensing fees, meaning makers can't offer free software to handle these standard file formats. That said, the impressive open-source Shotcut does many of the same things as the paid applications in this roundup, including chroma-keying and picture-in-picture. Shotcut is completely open-source and free, as are the also surprisingly powerful Kdenlive and Openshot applications. Lightworks is also free but has paid options that remove a 720p output resolution limit. Shotcut, Lightworks, Kdenlive, and Openshot all run on Linux as well as Windows and Mac. Do You Need 360-Degree VR Support? Several of the products here (Adobe Premiere Elements being a notable exception) still support 3D video editing if that's your thing, though 360-degree VR footage is now more important. If you want 360-degree VR support, use CyberLink PowerDirector. Other options are Adobe Premiere, Apple Final Cut Pro, and Magix Movie Edit Pro. Support varies, with some apps including 360-compatible titles, stabilization, and motion tracking. PowerDirector is notable for including those last two. Final Cut has a useful tool that removes the camera and tripod from the image, which can be an issue with 360-degree footage. Which Video Editors Have the Best Audio Features? We still live in the days of talkies, so you want to be able to edit the audio in your digital moves as well as the picture. Most of the products here include canned background music, and many, such as Pinnacle Studio, can even tailor the soundtrack to the exact length of your movie. Most of these programs can separate audio and video tracks, clean up background noise, and add environmental audio effects such as concert hall reverb. A couple of the products have an auto-ducking feature, which lowers background music during dialog—a definite pro-level plus. If you want to create movies that use surround sound technology like Dolby Atmos, you need a pro-level application such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Apple Final Cut Pro, or DaVinci Resolve. What About Apple Video Editing Software? Though macOS users don't have the sheer number of software choices available for PCs, Apple fans interested in editing video are well served. At the beginner level, the surprisingly capable and enjoyable-to-use iMovie comes free with every Mac since at least 2011. iMovie only gives you two video tracks but does a good job with chroma-keying, and its Trailers and Storyboard features make it easy to produce slick, Hollywood-style productions, showing you what kind of shots to include. (Credit: Apple/PCMag) In the midrange is Adobe Premiere Elements, which is cross-platform between Windows and macOS and has a lot more features and provides help with creating effects. Recently joining that program in Apple world is a macOS version of PCMag's Editors' Choice enthusiast-level video editing application, CyberLink PowerDirector. The program now has nearly all the features found in its Windows version. Professionals and prosumers have powerful but pricey options in DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro, and Premiere Pro. Final Cut is a deceptively simple application that resembles iMovie in its interface and ease of use, but it's massively capable, and many third-party apps integrate with it for even more power. Premiere Pro uses a more traditional timeline and enjoys a large ecosystem of companion apps and plug-ins. It also excels in collaboration features and plays well with ancillary Adobe software such as After Effects and Photoshop. Read more about the differences between Final Cut Pro and Premiere Pro here. Note: you do not need a full Creative Cloud subscription to get Premiere Pro. You can get a separate subscription just for it.

I’ve been reviewing software for PCMag since 2008, and I still get a kick out of seeing what's new in video and photo editing software, and how operating systems change over time. I was privileged to byline the cover story of the last print issue of PC Magazine, the Windows 7 review, and I’ve witnessed every Microsoft win and misstep up to the latest Windows 11. Prior to my current role, I covered software and apps for ExtremeTech, and before that I headed up PCMag’s enterprise software team, but I’m happy to be back in the more accessible realm of consumer software. I’ve attended trade shows of Microsoft, Google, and Apple and written about all of them and their products. I’m an avid bird photographer and traveler—I’ve been to 40 countries, many with great birds!

New technologies and changing viewer preferences are shaping how we create and consume video content. Staying informed about the latest Video Editing Trends is essential for content creators and marketers. This article explores the top ten trends that will define video editing this year. The Top 10 Video Editing Trends You Should Follow in 2025 Video editing is constantly evolving, and staying updated on the latest video editing trends can help creators produce high-quality and engaging content. In 2025, several key trends are expected to shape how videos are created and edited, making it an exciting time for professionals and hobbyists alike. AI-Powered Editing Tools Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming video editing, marking a key shift in video editing trends. By automating repetitive tasks and providing intelligent recommendations, AI tools are enabling creators to produce high-quality videos faster and with less effort. Let’s explore this trend in detail under several key areas: Automation of Tedious Tasks One of the most significant contributions of AI to video editing is the automation of time-consuming tasks. In traditional editing workflows, tasks like color correction, audio syncing, and organizing clips can take hours or even days. AI-powered tools simplify these processes by performing them automatically. For example, AI can quickly analyze a video’s lighting and color balance, then make corrections that match the desired style or tone. This ensures consistent quality throughout the footage. Similarly, audio syncing—once a painstaking manual task—is now automated by AI, ensuring perfect alignment between audio and visuals with minimal user input. These automation capabilities are driving video editing trends by streamlining workflows and reducing production time, which is especially valuable for professionals working on tight deadlines.

Let’s take a deeper look at why 360-degree video content is gaining traction and how creators are using it to transform the viewer experience. What Are 360-Degree Videos? A 360-degree video is a type of content that captures a full panoramic view of the environment. Unlike traditional videos that have a fixed frame, 360-degree videos allow viewers to look around in all directions—up, down, and side to side—using their mouse, finger, or a VR headset. This immersive format puts the viewer at the center of the action, making them an active participant rather than a passive observer. This unique capability is why 360-degree videos are becoming a core focus in modern video editing trends. They offer a fresh way to engage audiences, giving them control over how they experience the content. Why Are 360-Degree Videos Gaining Popularity? The growing popularity of 360-degree videos is fueled by advancements in technology and changing viewer expectations. Here are some reasons why this format is becoming a key trend: Immersive Storytelling: 360-degree videos create a sense of presence, allowing viewers to feel like they are part of the scene. This is particularly appealing for storytelling, as it provides a more engaging and emotional experience. Increased Accessibility: Devices such as smartphones, tablets, and affordable VR headsets have made it easier for people to view and interact with 360-degree videos. Platforms like YouTube and Facebook now support this format, further driving its adoption. Interactive Experiences: The interactive nature of 360-degree videos makes them more engaging than traditional formats. Viewers can explore the content at their own pace, which enhances their overall experience. Versatility Across Industries: From travel and real estate to education and entertainment, 360-degree videos have diverse applications. This adaptability makes them a valuable tool for creators across various fields. As one of the most innovative video editing trends, 360-degree video content is reshaping how creators connect with their audiences. Applications of 360-Degree Videos 360-degree videos are being used in creative and impactful ways across different industries. Here are some of the most common applications: Travel and Tourism: These videos are perfect for showcasing destinations, allowing viewers to explore landmarks, natural wonders, and cultural attractions from the comfort of their homes. Travel companies use 360-degree content to inspire wanderlust and attract customers. Real Estate: Virtual tours of homes, apartments, and commercial properties have become a game-changer for the real estate industry. Potential buyers can explore spaces interactively, gaining a better sense of layout and design. Education and Training: 360-degree videos are used in e-learning to provide immersive training experiences. For example, students can explore historical sites, participate in virtual science experiments, or practice medical procedures in a simulated environment. Entertainment: Filmmakers, musicians, and game developers are using 360-degree videos to create interactive experiences. For instance, music videos and live concert recordings in 360 degrees give fans a front-row seat to their favorite performances. Corporate Marketing: Brands are using 360-degree videos to create memorable advertising campaigns and showcase their products in a more interactive way. These diverse applications highlight why 360-degree video content is becoming one of the most versatile video editing trends. Challenges of Creating 360-Degree Video Content While 360-degree videos offer many benefits, they also come with challenges that creators need to address: Technical Complexity: Shooting 360-degree videos requires specialized cameras and equipment, as well as a strong understanding of how to stitch multiple video streams together seamlessly. High Production Costs: The equipment and software needed for 360-degree video production can be expensive, making it less accessible for smaller creators. Editing Requirements: Editing 360-degree videos is different from traditional video editing. Editors must ensure smooth transitions, avoid visual distortions, and consider how viewers will interact with the content. Bandwidth and File Size: 360-degree videos are often larger in file size, which can make them challenging to stream or download, especially for viewers with slower internet connections. Despite these challenges, advancements in technology and software are making it easier for creators to overcome these obstacles, keeping 360-degree videos at the forefront of video editing trends. The Role of Technology in 360-Degree Videos Technology plays a crucial role in the creation and consumption of 360-degree videos. Here are some of the tools and innovations driving this trend: 360-Degree Cameras: Cameras like the Insta360, GoPro MAX, and Ricoh Theta make it easier to capture high-quality panoramic footage. These devices are designed specifically for 360-degree video production. Stitching Software: Programs like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, and specialized tools like Kolor Autopano make it possible to stitch footage from multiple lenses into a seamless 360-degree view. VR Headsets: Devices like Oculus Quest, HTC Vive, and Google Cardboard enhance the viewing experience, immersing viewers in the content. Platform Support: Platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Vimeo have integrated support for 360-degree videos, making it easier for creators to distribute their content and reach a wider audience. These technological advancements are driving the adoption of 360-degree video content and shaping video editing trends around immersive experiences. The Future of 360-Degree Videos The future of 360-degree videos is bright, with even more exciting possibilities on the horizon. As virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies become more advanced, the line between 360-degree videos and fully immersive experiences will blur. Creators will be able to combine 360-degree content with interactive elements, such as clickable hotspots and real-time data overlays. Additionally, as AI-powered tools become more sophisticated, editing and producing 360-degree videos will become faster and more accessible. AI could automate tasks like stitching, color grading, and object tracking, freeing up creators to focus on the creative aspects of their projects. As these innovations unfold, 360-degree videos will remain at the forefront of video editing trends, offering new ways to engage and inspire audiences. Personalized Content Creation In today’s fast-paced digital world, personalization is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity. Audiences want content that speaks directly to them, addressing their unique preferences, needs, and interests. This shift has made personalized content creation one of the most important video editing trends. By tailoring videos to specific audience segments, creators can enhance engagement, build stronger connections, and foster loyalty. Let’s explore why personalization matters and how editors are adapting their techniques to deliver highly targeted content. What Is Personalized Content Creation? Personalized content creation involves designing videos that resonate with specific groups or individuals based on their preferences, demographics, or behaviors. Unlike generic videos aimed at a broad audience, personalized content focuses on delivering a message that feels relevant and meaningful to the viewer. For example, a brand might create different versions of a promotional video for various age groups, using imagery, language, and music that appeals to each segment. Similarly, a YouTuber might customize content based on viewer feedback, ensuring their videos align with what their audience wants to see. This approach is a core element of modern video editing trends, helping creators stand out in an increasingly crowded market. Why Is Personalization Important? Personalization is important because it helps create a stronger emotional connection between the viewer and the content. When people feel that a video is tailored to them, they are more likely to watch, share, and engage with it. Here are some key reasons why personalized content is becoming essential: Increased Engagement: Personalized videos grab attention and keep viewers interested by addressing their specific needs and preferences. Better Audience Retention: When viewers feel understood, they are more likely to stay loyal to a brand or creator, watching more videos and returning for future content. Improved Conversion Rates: For businesses, personalized videos can lead to higher sales and conversions by delivering targeted messages that resonate with potential customers. Enhanced Viewer Experience: Personalization creates a more enjoyable and relevant viewing experience, which boosts overall satisfaction and strengthens relationships with the audience. As one of the leading video editing trends, personalization is transforming how creators connect with their viewers. How Editors Are Creating Personalized Content Creating personalized content requires editors to use specific techniques and tools to tailor videos to their target audience. Here are some of the strategies driving this trend: Audience Segmentation: Understanding the audience is the first step in personalization. Editors analyze data such as demographics, interests, and viewing habits to create content that appeals to specific segments. Dynamic Video Elements: Some editors use tools that allow for dynamic content changes based on viewer data. For example, the text, images, or voiceovers in a video might change depending on the viewer’s location or preferences. Data-Driven Insights: Analytics tools help creators identify what works and what doesn’t. By analyzing metrics like watch time, likes, and shares, editors can refine their content to better suit their audience. Localized Content: Personalization often involves adapting videos for different regions, incorporating local languages, cultural references, and imagery to make the content more relatable. Feedback Integration: Engaging with viewers through comments, polls, and surveys helps creators understand their audience’s preferences and tailor future videos accordingly. These strategies are becoming standard practice in video editing trends, allowing creators to deliver highly effective personalized content. Technology Driving Personalized Content Creation Technology plays a significant role in making personalized content creation possible. From AI-driven tools to advanced analytics platforms, technology is empowering editors to create videos that are more relevant and impactful. Here are some of the key technologies shaping this video editing trend: Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI tools can analyze viewer data, predict preferences, and recommend personalized elements for videos. For example, AI might suggest specific themes, colors, or music based on the target audience. Machine Learning: Machine learning algorithms help identify patterns in viewer behavior, enabling editors to make data-driven decisions about content creation. Dynamic Video Platforms: Platforms like Vidyard and Wistia allow creators to produce dynamic videos that change based on viewer data, such as their name, location, or previous interactions. Advanced Editing Software: Modern editing tools like Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro offer features that make it easier to customize videos, such as adding localized subtitles or swapping out graphics for different audience segments. By leveraging these technologies, creators can stay ahead of video editing trends and produce content that truly resonates with their audience. Applications of Personalized Content Creation Personalized content creation is being used across a variety of industries to improve engagement and achieve specific goals. Here are some examples of how this trend is being applied: Marketing and Advertising: Brands create personalized ads that target specific demographics, such as showing different products to men and women or tailoring messages based on location. Education: Online educators use personalized videos to address the needs of different learning styles, such as breaking complex topics into smaller, targeted lessons. Entertainment: Streaming platforms like Netflix use personalization to recommend shows and movies based on viewer preferences, creating a more enjoyable experience. Corporate Training: Companies use personalized training videos to cater to employees in different roles, ensuring the content is relevant and effective. E-Commerce: E-commerce businesses create product recommendation videos tailored to individual customers, increasing the likelihood of a purchase. These applications demonstrate how video editing trends like personalized content creation are driving innovation across multiple sectors. Challenges of Personalized Content Creation While personalization offers many benefits, it also comes with challenges. Some of the most common obstacles include: Time and Effort: Creating multiple versions of a video for different audience segments can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Data Privacy Concerns: Using viewer data for personalization must be done responsibly to avoid violating privacy regulations or losing audience trust. Technical Complexity: Implementing personalized elements often requires advanced tools and expertise, which can be a barrier for smaller teams. Cost: Producing tailored content can be more expensive, especially if it involves additional resources or specialized software. Despite these challenges, the benefits of personalized content make it a worthwhile investment for creators looking to stay ahead of video editing trends. The Future of Personalized Content Creation As technology continues to evolve, the possibilities for personalized content creation are expanding. In the future, AI and machine learning will play an even larger role in automating the personalization process. For example, AI might generate completely customized videos for each viewer based on their behavior, preferences, and interactions. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) will also open new doors for personalization. Imagine a virtual tour where the environment changes based on the viewer’s interests, or an AR shopping experience where product recommendations appear in real time. These innovations will ensure that personalized content creation remains one of the most dynamic video editing trends, driving engagement and redefining how creators connect with their audiences. Augmented Reality (AR) Integration Augmented Reality (AR) is no longer just a futuristic concept; it has become a vital part of modern video editing processes. By seamlessly blending digital elements with real-world footage, AR is opening up exciting possibilities for creating dynamic and engaging content. As one of the most transformative video editing trends, AR integration is helping creators push the boundaries of storytelling, advertising, and interactive experiences. Let’s explore why AR is becoming a key tool in video editing and how it is shaping the future of content creation. What Is AR Integration in Video Editing? AR integration in video editing involves overlaying virtual objects, animations, or effects onto real-world video footage. This technology uses advanced software to track and map the physical environment, ensuring that the digital elements interact naturally with the surroundings. The result is a seamless combination of the real and virtual worlds, creating a visually captivating experience for viewers. For example, an editor might use AR to add floating text or 3D graphics that interact with a person or environment in a video. This capability is why AR is gaining prominence as one of the most innovative video editing trends, allowing creators to make their content more immersive and memorable. Why Is AR Integration Important? AR integration is important because it provides a new level of creativity and interactivity in video production. Here are some of the key reasons why this trend is gaining traction: Enhanced Viewer Engagement: AR creates visually stunning content that draws viewers in and keeps them engaged. The interactive and dynamic nature of AR makes videos more exciting to watch. Memorable Experiences: Videos that use AR stand out because they offer something unique. Viewers are more likely to remember content that includes immersive and interactive elements. Creative Freedom: AR gives editors more tools to express their creativity, allowing them to design videos that would be impossible to produce using traditional methods. Relevance to Modern Audiences: With the rise of AR in apps, games, and social media platforms, audiences are becoming more accustomed to this technology. Integrating AR into video content aligns with current viewer expectations and keeps creators ahead of video editing trends. How AR Is Used in Video Editing AR integration is being applied in various ways to enhance video content. Here are some common uses of AR in video editing: Interactive Graphics and Overlays: Editors can add 3D graphics, text, or animations that appear to interact with the real world. For example, a fitness video might include AR overlays that display calorie counts or workout statistics in real time. Virtual Objects and Environments: AR allows creators to place virtual objects into real-world settings. This is often used in advertising, where a product can be showcased in an interactive and eye-catching way. Augmented Storytelling: In films and videos, AR can be used to create immersive storytelling elements, such as holographic characters or virtual landscapes that enhance the narrative. Live AR Effects: AR is increasingly being used in live video production, enabling real-time effects and overlays. For instance, live sports broadcasts might use AR to display scores or player stats on the field. These applications highlight why AR integration is becoming one of the most exciting video editing trends for creators across various industries. Technology Driving AR Integration The growing adoption of AR in video editing is made possible by advancements in technology. Here are some of the key tools and innovations enabling this trend: AR Development Platforms: Software like Spark AR, Adobe Aero, and Unity make it easier for creators to design and integrate AR elements into their videos.

Smart Devices and Wearables: The widespread use of smartphones, tablets, and AR headsets is driving demand for AR content. These devices allow viewers to experience AR-enhanced videos seamlessly. Cloud-Based Rendering: Cloud technology enables faster rendering of AR effects, reducing the time and computing power required for production. These tools are essential for keeping up with video editing trends and making AR integration more accessible to creators. Industries Benefiting from AR Integration AR integration is making a significant impact across multiple industries, helping businesses and creators deliver innovative content.

Social Media: Platforms like Instagram and Snapchat use AR filters and effects to create fun, shareable video content. These examples show how AR integration is driving innovation and becoming a central focus in video editing trends. Challenges of AR Integration in Video Editing While AR offers many benefits, it also comes with challenges that editors must address: Technical Complexity: Implementing AR effects requires specialized knowledge and tools, which can be a barrier for beginners. High Production Costs: The software and hardware needed for AR integration can be expensive, making it less accessible for smaller creators. Time-Intensive Workflows: Creating and rendering AR elements often takes more time than traditional editing processes. User Experience Considerations: Ensuring that AR elements are intuitive and enhance the video rather than distracting viewers requires careful planning and execution. Despite these challenges, AR integration remains one of the most promising video editing trends, with new tools and techniques constantly emerging to address these issues. The Future of AR Integration in Video Editing The future of AR integration in video editing is bright, with many exciting developments on the horizon. As technology advances, AR tools will become more intuitive and accessible, enabling creators to produce high-quality AR content with minimal effort. Here are some trends to watch: Real-Time AR Editing: AI and machine learning will make it possible to create and edit AR effects in real time, streamlining the production process. Hyper-Personalized AR Content: AR videos will become more personalized, allowing viewers to interact with content tailored to their preferences and behavior. AR in Live Events: AR will play a larger role in live video production, such as concerts, sports broadcasts, and virtual conferences, providing interactive experiences for remote audiences. Integration with VR and MR: The combination of AR, virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR) will open up new possibilities for creating fully immersive video content. These innovations will keep AR integration at the forefront of video editing trends, driving creativity and engagement across all types of media. In summary, the Video Editing Trends of 2025 highlight the importance of innovation and adaptability in video production. From AI-powered tools to immersive AR experiences, these trends offer exciting opportunities for creators.

comments these are the best video editing apps for Android in 2025 we've narrowed it down to the top Android video editors that we recommend from beginner friendly and free video editing apps to more advanced options so that you can find the best one for you so I've now this down to my top three picks we're going to start off with an amazing free option and that is VN video editor this is one that works on iOS it works on Android there's also a Mac version of this available as well and this is a great option if you're someone who is an absolute beginner through to an intermediate level because of how easy and how simple they make video editing so it's really easy for you to jump in to get up to speed add your video clips in easily trim them down add effects and all of that stuff again really really simply so there's quite a few effects and Transitions and things that you can choose from not as many as the next option but still probably more than enough for what most people would use they even make it easy for you to do things like add in automated captions so if you want to add text to your videos then you can do that easily in here too but I think what really makes VN video editor stand apart from a lot of the other options out there is that the free version of it has no watermark and really not a lot of limitations compared to a lot of the other options and is one of the few apps out there that is easy to edit in and is actually fun to edit in I think that's a really big piece of this because if you're enjoying what you're editing then you will edit more make more videos and I think that's really what's at the core of VN video editor and the next app that I'm mentioning is that they encourage people to make more videos so while the free version of VN video editor is amazing and that's probably what most people are going to get away with there are some limits but again they're not really limits either on the free version you can have up to 100 projects at any given time which is a lot if you don't need 100 just remove some and you're going to get around that but on the paid version obviously you're going to unlock everything which is more transitions effects templates those sorts of things there's more control over sharing your projects between different people or different devices and it will also automatically remove the title screen that is added at the end of all of your new projects and again don't worry if you're on the free version you can still remove this you just want to make sure that at the end of your video You're selecting that little card and you're removing it so that it's not in your video and one of the standout features for me with this as well is the amount of control that you actually get over your export settings again this is something that most other apps don't have so we've got the ability to really dial in the video resolution the frame rate and even the quality or the bit rate that we want to export helping us really dictate the file size and quality of the video that we want to save okay the only other point you should be aware of with VN video editor is if you do pay for it that it's not transferable between different devices meaning if you pay on Mac your license is on Mac if you want the Android version as well then you need to pay again for that but again the piece that I am so pumped on here with this is the free version I think it's awesome so VM video editor great option beginner right through to an intermediate level someone looking for fast easy editing without the overwhelm of a bunch of effects menus and all of that stuff but my next top pick is cap cut this is another one that we speak a lot about on this channel because it's a really good app so cap cut again is available on multiple devices so there's an iOS there's an Android there's a Mac and a Windows version and they make it really easy for you to start and to transfer your projects between different devices too so you can actually upload your projects to the cap cut cloud and transfer all your video files video assets and have them synchronize across different devices but there's also at its core a lot of similarities with VN video editor you could eily jump between them like once you get up to speed with one of them you'll find the other one very very intuitive and very very familiar because there is so much overlap they're very similar so again this makes cap cut easy to use it's got a great intuitive interface great for beginners through to I'd say the top end of intermediate there's probably a few more advanced features in there now but someone who is looking for something as the most professional editing app on Android then that's where the next option will be best suited to you but if we're comparing VN video editor and cap cut cap cut really is next level in terms of the built-in effects built-in AI functionality built-in Transitions and templates there is so much in there that if you just want to just tap on a few things and create something amazing with all of that pre-built in stuff it is really really easy to do in cap cut and some of the effects in there are these are things that would take you hours to go and create from scratch so it's really awesome to be able to add this stuff in at really the tap of a screen so you've got things again like the AI generator captions you've also got background removal you've got background noise removal to clean up any audio remove any background noise there's even a text based editing option as well where you can transcribe what's been said in your videos and you can edit from text to help you edit faster and really out of all the different apps and tools and software in the space none of them are updating as much and as fast as cap cut is it's really becoming a leader in the space in terms of how fast it's innovating now it is worth noting that not that long ago cap cup was totally free and now they've definitely moved a lot of the core functionality and things in terms of all the extra effects and everything over onto a paid or Pro Plan there is still a free version but you are limited to exporting seven videos at the time of recording this video seven without a watermark so if you want to create more than seven videos in a month then you will need to jump on the Pro Plan but if you're only creating a video a week for YouTube then maybe you could get away with this but obviously outside of that you also unlocking all of the features and functionality of cap cut in terms of the higher grade effects and more Pro level features too so while there's not quite as much control over the export settings and really dialing everything in that element capcut is really next level in terms of most of the other things that you would want when editing a video again that's all the built-in effects transitions all of that stuff now the third option I've got for you is for those of you that are looking for the most advanced functionality when it comes to video editing on an Android device and this is really where I would recommend that you're using this on an Android tablet more so than a phone just for screen real estate and everything you can use it on a phone and it works well but if that's your sole device then I would probably recommend cap cut over this but again it's going to come down to what works best for you and what your requirements are but this app is called Luma fusion and it really is almost think like Final Cut Pro on Android it has the most amount of prograde features on the video side but also audio controls audio filters things too and in terms of the overall interface and using it it's one of those things that once you get up to speed with you could be really fast and really fluid editing in it but there is going to be a bit more of a learning curve than something like VN or cap cut it also right now doesn't have the broad range of AI functionality that you'll get in capcut but what it does have again is the more prograde features from traditional editing software professional traditional editing software that a lot of people are still looking for and I personally know a few people that use this Luma Fusion on Android or Luma Fusion on iPad as their main editing device so just like the others Luma Fusion is cross device compatible too so there is an iPad version Android version so you can run this on your desktop Mac as well so I think this is a great option if you are someone that has probably already learned to edit before you're coming from traditional editing tools and now you want something on your Android device or if you're someone who is looking for the most amount of professional grade features someone who really wants to dial everything in and have full control over everything that they need then Luma Fusion is the tool for you now there isn't a free option for Luma Fusion but the pay version It's one time only and it's incredibly cheap and if you're looking at this comparing it to a cap cut then it's going to work out much much cheaper so again the best tool is really the best tool for you based on your skill level based on what it is you're looking to achieve but really it's which one is going to allow you to do what you got to do in the shortest period of time without overwhelm without making the process daunting or not fun for you if we're enjoying this process we're going to do it more so the price for Luma Fusion right now the time of recording this video is $29.99 us which again is a onetime fee there are some extra paid upgrades if you want them things like multicamera functionality there's also options for integration with story blocks for stock footage for music and for sound effects too so if you're looking for the most professional option on Android and again my recommendation is on a tablet instead of a phone then you can go past Luma Fusion now that you got your Android editing app sorted if you want to learn how to edit in the most efficient way don't forget to download our free pdf guide which is linked on screen taking you through the most efficient process no matter which app or tool you're using there's also a bunch of other resources and links in the description box below to help you even further including free tutorials on these tools and also courses on some of them too so don't forget to check those out and I will see you in the next video cheers",
