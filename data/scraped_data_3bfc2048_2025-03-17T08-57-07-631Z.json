  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, let's break down what the AutomateTube website is all about, like we‚Äôre just chilling over a beer and I‚Äôm explaining it.\n\n### What's the Vibe?\n\nSo, AutomateTube is basically an AI video generator platform. Imagine if you had a magic wand that could whip up videos without you needing to be a video editing wizard. That's what they're offering here. It seems like they‚Äôre trying to cater to people who want to create videos quickly and maybe don‚Äôt have the skills or the time to mess around with complicated software.\n\n### Main Stuff on the Site\n\n1. **Creating Videos**: Right off the bat, they're pushing for users to \"Create Video.\" This suggests it‚Äôs a user-friendly setup where you can jump in and start making videos. There‚Äôs probably some AI magic in the background, helping you put things together seamlessly.\n\n2. **User Accounts**: You gotta create an account to get going. They make it clear that keeping your account info accurate is your job, and they‚Äôre serious about security‚Äîno sharing accounts with your buddy, no matter how much you trust him. And yeah, you gotta be at least 13‚Äîa nod to the legal age thing.\n\n3. **Content Ownership**: Now, here‚Äôs where it gets interesting. If you whip up some sweet video content using their platform, you still own it. That means if your video goes viral, you‚Äôre not giving away the rights just because you used their service. They only get the right to host and display it, which is pretty fair.\n\n4. **Content Guidelines & Restrictions**: They‚Äôve got rules about what you can and can‚Äôt post. They‚Äôre big on keeping things legit‚Äîno illegal stuff, no copyrighted material unless you have permission, and definitely no scams or malware. It‚Äôs like the rules at a good party; keep it fun, legal, and safe.\n\n5. **Payment Details**: If you're thinking of using their service, be prepared to toss some cash their way. Prices could change, but you‚Äôll be in the loop before they do. Most importantly, all payments are in USD, which is standard, but it's worth noting. It sounds like they might have subscription plans, so if you're serious about video-making, that could be something to look into.\n\n6. **Liability Limitations**: They‚Äôre pretty clear that if something goes wrong while you‚Äôre using their platform‚Äîlike, let‚Äôs say you lose your footage or their system has a hiccup‚Äîthey‚Äôre not gonna take the blame for any indirect or consequential damages. So, if your project goes sideways, you‚Äôre on your own. This is a classic legal move to protect themselves.\n\n7. **Terms Changes**: They reserve the right to change their terms whenever they feel like it. If they do something major, they‚Äôll let users know. As someone who‚Äôs dabbed into online services before, that‚Äôs not unusual; just keep an eye out if you're using the platform often.\n\n8. **Governing Law**: If things ever get messy legally, the terms are governed by laws without conflict principles. This part is a bit dry but basically means if there‚Äôs ever a legal squabble, there are specific laws that apply.\n\n### Key Topics & Services\n\n- **AI Video Generation**: This is the core service. It‚Äôs all about using AI to help create engaging videos, which is what can set you apart from your competition if you‚Äôre in content creation.\n  \n- **User-Friendly Interface**: They‚Äôre aiming for accessibility, meaning you don‚Äôt have to be a tech genius to make a killer video. \n\n- **Content Management**: You have control over your content, which is a big deal in this digital age. You get to choose what you create, and you‚Äôre still the boss of it.\n\n- **Community and Creativity**: While they don‚Äôt go deep into community features, the user-generated content aspect suggests there's a space for creativity to flourish, which can be pretty motivating.\n\n### Wrapping It Up\n\nIn short, AutomateTube seems like a solid platform for anyone looking to create videos easily without diving deep into editing software. They keep things straightforward with account security, ownership rights, and a clear set of guidelines. Just be ready to pay up if you want all the sweet features.\n\nIt‚Äôs really about empowering users to make their vision a reality, all while keeping the platform professional and legal. If you're someone who needs to churn out video content‚Äîmaybe for a job, social media, or just for fun‚Äîthis site could be worth a shot. Just keep in mind the rules, and you‚Äôll hopefully have a smooth ride with their AI tools.",

and how you can start as a complete beginner people usually charge thousands of dollars for courses just like this and all I ask in exchange for the free education is just smash that like button for the YouTube algorithm And subscribe to my YouTube channel so I can continue to create free courses just like this so here's what you're going to learn in today's free course I'm going to be giving you a comprehensive guide to YouTube automation I'm going to explain all the technical stuff so you understand it so you can Master the terminology I'm going to be showing you successful examples of YouTube automation channels that are already making tons of money without showing their face I'm going to be showing all the ways to make money with YouTube well also give you tons of Niche ideas I'm going to show you how to set up a YouTube channel from scratch how to create videos from scratch and show you all the tools that you need to start making videos today I'm also going to be teaching you how to create eye-catching thumbnails and reveal my secrets on how I grow my YouTube channels very quickly I'm also going to be covering tons of other topics like YouTube shorts best practices to grow like I said and so much more so stick around all the way till the end of this free course and you are about to become a YouTube automation expert so first I'm going to go over some important terms that you guys need to know for your YouTube Journey first up we have the CPM CPM stands for cost per mile which is how much advertisers pay per 1,000 views this is all dependent on where your viewers are watching your videos at like what country the niche of your channel and the type of videos that you create CPM represents the total amount that the advertisers paying I care more about RPM RPM is how much you are getting per 1,000 views usually this is the CPM minus 40 % that's how you get your RPM and YouTube shows you this too on every single video once you're monetized another key term I want you guys to know is clickthrough rate the more people click on your video from other videos on the feed the more that YouTube boosts your video the next term that's important is watch time watch time just refers to the duration of how long are people watching your videos so now that you have this terminology down now let's talk about how the YouTube algorithm works first of all you can be a complete beginner and go viral on YouTube YouTube is a very fair platform if you are creating good content with everything that I'm going to teach you in this video your videos will do good so three things that I want you guys to keep in your mind when you are creating videos number one is Will somebody actually click on this video this is where good thumbnails come in number two is watch time how long are users watching your videos for and lastly engagement are people liking this video are they commenting on it or are they just clicking on your video and leaving right away cuz they get bored the YouTube algorithm takes all of these factors into play when they are deciding on boosting your video out to more viewers or not now let's talk about all the ways you can make money with YouTube automation if you don't already know YouTube has created so many millionaires but not a lot of creators will actually talk about it because it actually kind of makes them lose relatability With Their audience and they feel like then they're just making videos to make money and a lot that's why like a lot of times people don't really realize how much money is in YouTube so number one is AD Revenue this is just the money that you're making from the views but there's many more you can also make money from Paid subscriptions Affiliates Channel memb memberships merch Super Chat super stickers YouTube premium brand deals the list literally goes on for this but the most awesome thing about YouTube is that you can use it as a funnel to then funnel to other offers like digital products that you're selling e-commerce stores that you have can all be grown through your YouTube videos YouTube is the most stable platform out of all these other social media platforms what the best one to invest your time into especially because you can make so much passive income through your YouTube videos because there's not as much competition in the space so now you see how many ways you can make money with YouTube and you know the terminology now I want to talk about how to pick a niche I want you guys to pick a niche based on something that you at least like why would I start a YouTube channel about sports when I don't even like sports right so I want you guys to make sure that when you are venturing out and kind of you know productive scrolling and looking through YouTube or figuring out what you're going to do I want you to pick a niche and I want you to like this Niche because even when you start making money with it this is a long-term commitment this becomes your business so you want to just do something that you like and you'll thank me later also it's good to stay within one Niche or a couple sub niches with your YouTube channel because this is setting your brand for you and people are subscribing to you for that content so if you are switching around and posting a bunch of different stuff and one day you post Sports and the next day you post makeup people are going to unsubscribe to you and you will not grow a stable YouTube channel so I made a little list for you guys these are very popular Niche ideas I feel like when you see ideas visually you can definitely get an idea for it so here's a couple Niche ideas that you guys can go through and just kind of brainstorm these are the most popular ones on YouTube right now there's two ways to get ideas for your YouTube channel you can search through YouTube using keyword searches to gain ideas thinking about things that you or your family might be searching or you can use AI Trend search platforms like Trend assist AI because a lot of people are using Chach PT for ideas lately I've started to use platforms like Trend assist AI more because it's more based on specific market research made for beginners that are wanting to start and grow fast on multiple different social media platforms one of the main ones being YouTube so if you guys go to Trend assist. it will bring you to this page you can just log in and create an account and you'll be brought here this is very straightforward and easy to use you can literally just type in what are the top 10 faceless YouTube channel Niche types for 2025 these are all really good ideas but one definitely stands out which is the health Niche for multiple reasons mainly because it's educational content YouTube actually pays more per 1,000 views remember RPM your RPM is higher for this type of content versus content that's just made for kids so now let's ask it this give me 10 faceless YouTube automation Channels with the most subscribers in the health Niche and you can see here it gives us tons of examples to go by so here's one that Trend to says day recommended for us this channel healthy lawn life they started posting only 1 year ago and they now have over 400,000 subscribers and are getting millions of views and you guys can see here most of their videos is just stock footage Clips with a voiceover behind them if we go to social blade you can also see here that they are also making over $100,000 a year just from the views on this single YouTube channel so let's check another one okay so this is another Channel Medical Centric so we can look it up on YouTube so here's another example same type of videos and I just went to social blade typed it in and you can also see here they are making over $200,000 per year so now you can see kind of my process of market research there are tons of other YouTube channels across YouTube literally making videos just like this rocking up millions of views they're making thousands of dollars monthly and if they can't do it why can't you let's go ahead and just go through different faceless YouTube channels examples just to get some ideas check out this fan-made politics news channel as you can see these guys are literally just creating videos to discuss about news events without being an official news station this video got over 2 million views and all their videos is just mix of different topics on famous political figures which can all be sourced from the internet they have a lot of views and subscribers already and this channel is doing really well another faceless YouTube channel idea this one is all about food and it's completely faceless he has his face like in his main picture but all his videos are faceless he has gained over 4 million subscribers just from these simple food videos so if you're into food or cooking yourself you can also start a food Niche Cooking Channel you guys have to remember you don't have to take stock footage clips and put them together like YouTube automation can be anything YouTube Automation and especially faceless YouTube automation can even be you taking videos of your mom cooking and posting it it doesn't have to always be like the same exact thing that I'm showing you guys here just remember that all of these that I'm showing you here are examples so just keep this in mind that when you guys are looking through these channels I want you guys to gain ideas and um hopefully this helps you guys to really think that through as well and with food also like food is never going to go out of trend so it's a pretty awesome Niche to be in you don't have to be a Master Chef to make food videos here's another faceless YouTube channel that has over 1 million subscribers this is an ASMR Channel literally anybody can do faceless videos that they're making thousands of dollars monthly and if they can't do it why can't you so now that we did full market research I am now going to show you two different types of ways to make these videos come to life the first method will be creating videos using the power of AI the second method will be creating these videos manually so I'll show you guys how to use AI to create videos and I'll also show you guys how to create these completely manual AI nowadays can literally be used as a coworker so instead of you having to pay employees or pay people to make these videos all you have to do is just have a couple awesome AI platforms to put together and AI can bring these to life so much faster so the AI platform that I do use for AI created videos is in video AI you can create videos just like the ones we saw in minutes by typing in one simple text prompt and this AI will create a full-blown video for you in minutes so we're going to use Trend assist AI again so let's go back over to Trend assist Ai and let's ask Trend assist give me unique trending health related topics to create YouTube videos on so now we have tons of video topics here this one captured my attention as I do remember seeing this trending across social media so now let's just get more specific and ask Trend assist AI give me good titles for YouTube videos about we'll just copy and paste this here digital detoxing and the benefits of reducing screen time for mental health so now we literally have our topic and title ready to go next step is actually creating the video and by the way guys for both of these AI tools that I'm using today I did put the links for these down in my description box down below so you can just go through those if it's easier for you to access that way so the next platform that we you're going to is in video AI so after you click the link in my description box it will bring you to this page so now that we're here we see this box we're going to just ask the AI to create an educational YouTube video on and then we're going to just paste in what we copied from Trend assist AI digital detoxing and the benefits of reducing screen time for mental health remember the more detailed The Prompt is the better and I do actually recommend making all of your YouTube videos over 8 minutes you'll thank me later because you can actually have multiple advertisements on there if if the video is under 8 minutes you cannot do that so we can be even more specific here and just add create a 8 Minute YouTube video um and just add that in other things you can put to just help make this better is I always like to say the video should maintain a fast-paced rhythm use an American male voice use large subtitles divided into smaller segments for emphasis use a combination of slow and fast-paced clips synchronize with with the voice over and ensure a high level of Ed editing to enhance the visual impact of the video so just make sure that you guys do have these key components which is the topic of the video the tone of the voice the type of voice over whether you want subtitles or not the more specific you are the better the AI is going to do okay so now you can see our video is being generated as the AI is working just make sure you sign up you can create a free account to use I already have one but if you haven't made one you can make it here so now that this is done let's see what the AI made for us it is so crazy that the AI made this video this fast everybody is looking for the perfect digital detox but let's be honest it's harder than finding a needle in a hay stack so now you can see here's the preview of our video that we just made and here's the edit command box here you're going to be able to make a bunch of different types of edits using just simple text commands so we can just say add subtitles to the video or take them away change the intro and start with a joke add a call to action at the end to ask them to sub subscribe to your YouTube channel for more videos and another crazy feature here is you can even ask the AI to use your own voice you are able to clone your own voice with this system and I will show you guys how you can do that so if we come back to this edit command box and type in change voice over to Voice number one it is now using my voice so now you can see my own voice is added to this video just from this cloning tool day or even longer to allow our minds to reset and recharge this period of disconnection offers numerous mental health benefits if you don't want to use an automated voice over and rather have your own voice narrate the video you can clone your own voice and add it to your video to add even more of your personality to these videos let me show you how you can use this new voice cloning tool when you're on N Video AI just click on these three lines up here on the left hand side then under plugins just click on voices click here and you can add your voice so with this you have to submit a recording of at least 30 seconds and just mention I give in video AI the permission to use my voice this is just for you to use but if you don't mention this it will not work I know here it says to use high quality recording equipment but you really don't need to you can just use your phone or your laptop so once you film a voice just click click on choose file and you can upload it here check all of these boxes give it a second to work and then click done if you want to add multiple voiceovers you can click on this button here to edit and rename this file once the processing is complete you can then click on use and it will automatically add your voice to The Prompt so then you can add in whatever you want here to actually make the next video then when you're done just click on generate a video and they will literally use your voice to create the video with if you just upload One Voice by default they will use your voice for every single video you create if you want to add this voice to already existing videos that you made just go back to the command box and you can just type in the edit command box change the voice over to voice one or whatever you named your voice to be when you were renaming it so since we named ours voice one that's why we're calling it voice one and and when you're done just click on generate and the old AI voice over will now be changed to your own voice you can also completely change the language of this video so if you want to also start a Spanish Channel nid AI supports over 50 different languages so feel free to do that as well just make sure that do not you guys do not put a bunch of different languages on one YouTube channel your YouTube channels have to be separate from different languages and even I have Spanish channels so I think it's a great idea but the most important thing is just f on your main channel for now I didn't start Spanish Channel until way later on so that's kind of like a side quest and all you have to do to convert the language is just type into this text command box convert the video to Spanish and it will literally translate your entire video to Spanish another way to make edits with this is just click edit right here and you will see either edit by the media or edit by the script of the video which is what the narrator is saying you're also able to see what media matches up so if you ever want to change that you can just go in here and change whatever media you want to switch out the clips they have the best stock footage in the market and they are very very like always up on having the best stock footage in the market so this tool right here is alone very useful when you're done with your video just click download and you can download and then we can use this video for our YouTube channel now the way that we made the last video we were in the nid AI V2 this time I'm going to show you how the nid AI V3 works so and here we're going to just use the same topic I'm just going to copy and paste what we had and write create me a YouTube video about digital detoxing and the benefits of reducing screen time for mental health use generative media then just click generate a video with nid AI V3 you can create anything that you can think of from scratch using Nvidia ai's generative capabilities caught in this endless cycle of scrolling tapping and swiping um what if I told you there's a way out a way to rec it is so crazy how this entire video was made just by using Ai and it's the same process if you're wanting to switch out one of these clips you can just click on edit then click generative media click on generate New Media and then here you're just going to describe what you want the AI to make for you we're going to just say girl walking through woods with a black hoodie on then click generate a clip and you can see the AI created exactly what we wanted if you guys click on workflows you can see all the different types of projects that nid AI is capable of doing for you so definitely check these out also for more ideas just so you guys understand the pricing with Nvidia AI the first video that we made was with the plus plan that is $28 a month this video we use the generative plan of course you can try nid AI for free but if you want to use the generative capabilities I highly recommend that you go for this plan it is the one that I have and it does give you the most Bane for your buck with the $15 generative minutes this will save you hundreds of dollars that you would have otherwise had to spend on editing animating or other production costs now of course you can create these videos yourself but you can see that nid AI does this much faster you can also do this completely from your phone by the way guys they also have an app for iOS I put the link to access this AI tool down in my description box down below and you guys already know I got you guys I also reached out to them and got a code for you guys that you can use so you can use code Badd and Biz 50 when upgrading your plan okay guys guys now I'm going to show you how to make a thumbnail so I have this just pulled up it's called pixabay.com it's a free place that they have a bunch of photos and all I did was here I just searched for a couple keywords for the video that we're making so I just searched in person on phone screen right to match like the digital detox Vibe so I'm just going to search through here to just find a photo that matches the best of somebody just looking like they're consumed on their phone and also something that I feel like would look pretty good for YouTube as well so this video this photo right here definitely um looks pretty eye-catching it also looks it may have been made with AI but it looks very realistic so I'm going to go ahead and just click download and we're going to click download again so now we have this on our computer now I'm just going to go over to canva and I'm just going to type in here into the search of canva YouTube thumbnail and let's search for a YouTube thumbnail template this is just going to help us get the size of this so let's just look for one that we could also use even just like font what stands out I think this one looks really good so let's click on this one and then we're going to just click on customize this template we're just going to delete the image that's already on the screen just by hovering over it and clicking on the delete button then we're going to just go over to uploads and we want to upload our photo so I just dragged it into this box here and again if I didn't mention this is all like non-copyrighted photos and stuff on that pixabay website they have a couple other websites like that um that you can take photos from so now I'm just going to drag over everything that we have um because obviously we don't want it over our photo I Envision it kind of like the words being like next to her like this and we obviously don't need all of these so I'm just going to delete a lot of these and I'm just like Swip over them and then clicking delete on my keyboard just because it's faster so another thing is there's this like misted thing sometimes templates will have like weird stuff on it just make sure you delete that as well so now we are going to kind of just straighten these out cuz I don't want them twisted like that and we're going to go ahead and get this going so let's just straighten this out too and actually I'm just going to get rid of these boxes Okay so let me do a lot of creating thumbnails is all about I feel like just really like testing a bunch of different things to be honest and just kind of moving things around so it's really good and worth it to learn canva for multiple reasons so what I have here is I'm going to make a statement on this thumbnail that's going to capture people's attention so in my I'm thinking okay you need a digital detox think about the things that capture your attention as you were scrolling on YouTube and this will really help you out a lot when you're creating your own thumbnails so I'm just going to also zoom in a little bit to her so we can put these words on one side I don't know if you guys know this psychology but people's eyes naturally go to the left upper left part of the screen so it's always good to put your word your text or things that you want people to capture people's eyes on in that section so let's move her over a little bit I'm going to make her a little bit bigger and I always try to make the words as big as possible on the screen another reason why I do that is because 90% of users are on their mobile devices when they're searching on YouTube so we really want this to stand out so um let's see how this look so I think this is looking pretty good um I always recommend like just trying different colors I already liked the Bold text that they used but you can always try out different colors and different fonts to see like what's going to stand out the best best like this one is actually a little bit even more bold than the other one and we can make it even a little bit bigger so this looks really good as well so when you are done with your thumbnail we just again put together make sure this is stretched all the way shouldn't be any white this is already sized to a YouTube thumbnail we have our text here that's very bold we have the girl here that's going to be capturing attention Okay so when you're done just click on share and then click download we're going to download this as a PNG G click download again and we now have this downloaded to our computer okay so let's just say you are ready to upload this to YouTube you logged in with your Google account to YouTube created the channel you're going to go up to here and click on create then just click upload video then we're going to just click on select files and we're just uploading the video that we downloaded from N Video AI or whatever video you're wanting to do so the first thing that we need is a title for this video so we used Trend assist AI to get us that title so I'm going to copy and paste this from Trend assist Ai and we're going to load our description with lots of keywords but we'll just wait on that let's go ahead and first upload our thumbnail here so just click upload file and we're going to upload that picture so we here we have our thumbnail being uploaded it looks really good I always like to see how it looks on YouTube too this is a really great way to see it before as well down here I always select no it's not made for kids so just keep that in mind um when you say yes it's made for kids it's going to be put on the kids app which we don't want we want it to be pushed out to adults um same with the the age restriction there doesn't need to be an age restriction on this because anybody can watch this so just make sure that your set settings look just like mine this as well just say no to altered content none of your content is altered let's see what else here in the tags you just want to make sure that you can load your video up with tags so let's use Trend assist AI to get you the top trending tags so we're going to add the tags in description after so for now just click on next click next again next again and just make sure that your video is set to unlisted before you actually post it that's going to allow you to make edits before it's officially posted then just click save now our video is uploading and in the meantime let's go ahead and get our description and tags from Trend assist AI so now let's go back to Trend assist Ai and right here we're going to just copy and paste our title here so we just have it digital detox transfer your mental health by reducing screen time and we're going to tell the AI what we need so we're going to just say I just made a video uh YouTube video about digital detox transform your mental health to reducing screen

let's click on it and see how it [Music] looks everybody is looking for the perfect digital detox but let's be honest it's harder than finding a needle in a hay stack we are a species consumed smartphones tablets laptops screens illuminate our lives from sunrise to well past Sunset the average person spends over seven hours a day staring at another great way to get people engaged is to put a top comment so on the comment here we can actually write and have Trend assist AI write us one so we can say write me a you YouTube comment for my own video that tells my viewers to subscribe and like the video use emojis for this comment so it has now generated us a top comment here that we can use so just scroll over it click copy go back to YouTube let's go to the live video video and here

and it will actually pin this comment to the top so anyone that's watching will be more likely to interact with this video and guys just ignore the fact that this is a baddies and Business Club YouTube channel just ignore that I just wanted to post it on a channel just to show you guys um the example and the process of uploading a video now I'm going to show you guys how to start your YouTube channel the first thing that we need to bring this YouTube channel to life is a name for our YouTube channel a logo for our YouTube channel and a banner so I'm going to show you how to build this YouTube channel up and then I will show you how to make a video manually after that and all these food videos got me inspired to make a Food Channel so let's do it and it's going to be faceless as well and we're not going to film any videos ourself okay so I'm going to actually go back to Trend assist AI because I don't want to be wasting hours just picking a name so we're going to get their help on this and don't take this too hard because you can always change your name later but it is good to just get this out of the way and to get a catchy name so let's go back to Trend assist Ai and we're going to ask Trend assist give me 10 tww names for a YouTube channel about food now you can see it's going to give us so many different ideas for this channel that are also likely to just look good on YouTube so let's just scroll through here here and I would also right before you pick it just make sure you Google it and YouTube it just to make sure there's not any big channels or businesses using this specific name so I'm just going to go with this one dish Diaries because the word dish can just be easily seen as them registering food content always try to put a keyword for what you're doing in the title of your channel you can use this site called zarla to make your logo for free it's literally just zara.com logo maker and I'm just going to type in my channel name that I generated with cheses dayi to get started now just click create your free logo I love this website cuz it gives you a bunch of different random examples to choose from here you can just type in your keyword and see if they have it in their system but if they don't just choose something that's closest to your Niche so I'll just choose food and for Logos we don't really need a slogan so you can leave that out click next now it's going to ask you do you need a logo here I'll just pick I offer a service doesn't matter next you're going to see two choices we're going to just make it quick and simple so we'll just pick choose icons for me now you can see it's generated a bunch of different ideas for us to choose from you can scroll through all these designs to pick which one you like the most there's so many to choose from so for this demo I'm just going to choose this then just click customize icon and here you can edit your logo design if you prefer some more changes this will be a circle profile image on YouTube so we need to make sure the icon and the name fits within the borders of the circle so just don't make the font too large and next we need a YouTube channel Banner so on this site called canva there's a bunch of different design templates that you can choose from for your YouTube Banner this is also free to use I use canva and I have the free plan for beginners here it can be a little bit overwhelming to use but I promise if you master canva you will use it for so many things it will become a such a beneficial tool for your business Journey whether you have an online business or YouTube channel or anything so here's just your blank canvas you just see this rectangular box it's the exact size to upload to your YouTube channel as the thumbnail now go ahead and click design and a bunch of different templates will show here canva is a little bit weird with their YouTube Banner canva it's not the right size but we're still going to need to choose create YouTube Banner because when we upload it it becomes the right size in YouTube settings so here I'm just showing you what size your banner artwork should be because if you go on YouTube channels you can literally see all of the letter box style size so just make sure that you keep your artwork Within These Border Lines next just type in your Niche keyword in this case we're going to just look up some food templates just look at all of the these designs we don't even need to be professional graphic designers to create this awesome artwork so we just have to pick one that we can edit easier keeping the letter box size setting in mind so let's go for this one I can already see it can be easily edited just by me moving things around if you make a mistake up here you can just reverse your action to remove it the first thing I'm going to do is just make the font smaller I'm just going to click on it and drag it to the corner to edit the words we click on it and use your keyboard Enter key to read reposition the words above is your toolbar this button here can Center your text we want to get this on the center so by clicking effect another editing tool pops up from here and you can edit your font to a different color or style here you can adjust the settings to make your wording stand out more some of the elements on the template we might not need it we'll play around with it on the design to see how it looks just now you see me delete a white box that we don't need next I'm going to edit this text to suit my channel it's kind of like a slogan but it's more of just describing what my channel is about with a few words some elements we can keep some not we don't want to overload our B Banner design with just too many things the best designs are usually just super simple so after you finish your design just click up here and bring down the menu to download if for some reason the banner does not fit just go back and download to reduce the size you can do that here so just for the purpose of this video you guys will see I'm using an old Channel that I was just testing content on the subscribers is obviously here just ignore that you're going to obviously see no subscribers on your Channel to actually create your YouTube channel you're going to just go to Google and sign up with the Google account and then we're all automatically given a channel this way so first up just go to the drop- down menu and click YouTube Studio this is your channel internal dashboard this section is private and no one else can see this but you now just look for customization once you're here you're going to just click on upload for your profile picture and channel Banner upload the banner that we made for free from canva and just adjust it around and next we're going to do the same for your Prof profile picture you can just upload and click done so we'll just upload that logo then you can just put in your basic information below under name you can put in your channel name on this channel I'm going to name it dish Diaries like we took from Trend assist Ai and for the handle name you can just put your channel name if it's taken you can just put like a one or whatever you want here and the rest you can just leave out for now I just want to get some the most important things today just to get your channel going so after you uploaded your profile picture your banner added your channel name just click public and you are good to go and now you can view your channel homepage from clicking view Channel if you don't see any changes don't worry just give it a few minutes and YouTube will update it so now we have our YouTube channel page set up and ready to post videos on that looks so professional you see guys you guys don't have to pay anybody to do any of this stuff you can do this completely on your own or you can Master this and charge somebody else for it too you know just this right here is a service right that people actually charge other people's thousands of dollars for I mean if they're doing it you could technically do it too not every everybody knows about my YouTube channel or not everybody actually wants to do this stuff but I feel like it's super easy and if you're a beginner better put that money into something else and you can do this on your own like I just did in less than 10 minutes so now I'm going to show you how to create a YouTube video completely manual and I will be doing this from scratch using tools that are free if you value your time more it might be worth it for you to just get these AI tools and use AI to make your life way easier because they really do like put the script together for you they do like the videos and everything like that and it's much faster but if you are someone that you're not in that position where you can't pay this is also a way that works and what has been done for the past 10 years before AI came out so it's definitely doable so maybe you want to learn for yourself and you don't want to use AI I'm going to show you how to edit these videos manually so the first thing that we're going to do to start making these videos is we're going to go to pixels or pixabay to grab some clips to use so basically all you're going to do is just type in your Niche keyword to the search and scroll through all the clips you like for your video creation just for the purpose of this video I'm going to make a faceless video about pasta recipes you're going to just go through them and click download to store them in your desktop since my video is going to be about pasta I will be collecting a bunch of pasta video clips when you have all of your Clips downloaded just put them in one folder that way it will be easy to select them all together to upload to your editing software so now we're going to edit the video and this is the fun part of content creation for this tutorial we're going to use cap cut it is free to use so to start your video just simply click and drag all the clips that you want to use to the editing bar below and don't worry if the if the formation's wrong of them we can adjust it as many times as we want before we're done so here at this timeline we can now see we have about 4 minutes of Clips so our video length will be complete as a 4 minute long YouTube video ideally we want to make our videos at least 8 minutes because again I think I talked about this before in the video If if it's over 8 minutes you can put multiple ads on them so you make more money so when you're monetized you'll thank me later so now to get our script written that we can use for our video we're going to just go to Trend assist AI which specializes in YouTube content creation and we're going to ask the AI write me a short script for a 4 minute YouTube video about the top five healthy pasta recipes and let's see what this gives us so now here we have a script that we can use in this video and primarily I would have actually done this first I just wanted to get into the editing tips right away but I would have actually done this first because then in the pixa bay website you could specifically find Zucchini noodles and then match it up up to the specific script but now we have a perfect script with even timestamps so this can be really awesome and we can copy and paste this into our video and obviously into our editing system so now let's go back to cap cut and just click on text then we're going to just click default text and drag that down to our video we're going to drag this all the way across because we're going to have subtitles throughout this entire video and now we can just copy and paste what we took from the trend assist AI script that it wrote for us and right up here on the upper right hand side is where you're going to start adding the text when you're done copying and pasting over the first section it should look something like this and you can drag this around to where you want it to actually lay in the video you can do the same thing and repeat the process by then just selecting and pulling that bar across to wherever you want it pasting then from Trend assist a ey and putting it where you want in the video if you highlight all of the text font and The Orange Box together here you can change the color the style of the font and text and everything that you want to actually customize it to make it look even better they also have a text to speech option so you can actually make these subtitles come to life with that text to speech and test out some of the voices here and pick the best one I do love using Jesse so as far as music goes you can find a bunch of non-copyrighted free music that you can use very safely in your videos right here I just filtered it to being $0 to use them and they are all here for you if you want one of them you just scroll over it and you can click the download button right here and then we can import it into a cap cut and you're going to add the music just like how you added the text to add the music you're going to just click on audio and you'll see that a bunch of other music pops up here and you can technically find music this way as well I just feel like it's a little bit safer to just extract it from the file and you can actually just drag that file right into your video from your desktop too or you can search for a different sa here but I feel like the most important thing is to find non-copyrighted songs and the safest way is going through YouTube studio so now that our video is ready to go let me show you how it turned out welcome to Dish diarist today we are going to show you some great Pastor dishes each recipe has been tried thousands of times so now let's talk about YouTube shorts now YouTube shorts I look at it as a great way to grow your Channel and yes you can make money from it but you're going to make a lot more money from your lawn form content so that should be the priority you can use both skills that you learned in this video to make short form content it's literally the same thing except of making horizontal content you are making vertical content and I do have videos all about vertical content and editing those on my YouTube channel of course the fastest way is to use AI which I'll show you what shorts I was able to get by using nid AI come on fluffles you can do it I don't know if I can ah the moment of truth will he or won't he oh my did you see that packed with fiber protein and Omega-3s they help with digestion Boost energy and keep you Fuller longer much screen time can mess with your sleep and even make you feel more stressed try taking breaks like a quick walk or reading a book your so now I want to share my strategy of what I think led to my YouTube success how I literally grew two channels to over a million subscrib rers in less than just a couple years and how I was monetized within 6 months on both of these YouTube channels and if I had this knowledge back then I probably would have been monetized in 3 months um but just remember guys this is a long-term game like I always say nothing in life that's worth it is ever easy right like nothing that I ever really teach on my channel is easy because you have to back that up with actually wanting to do it if you go and open a business in a storefront today are you going to just open that store and just leave it and like not do anything with it not like talk about it not hand out flyers and like nothing no right a YouTube channel is the same thing like a business it can make you so much money but you have to really believe in it and want it to grow and actually put the work in and one of the biggest things I want you guys to remember is that quality is so much more important than quantity it does not matter if you are posting every single day on YouTube that's not what's going to make your YouTube channel grow what's going to make your YouTube channel grow is by posting quality content content that grabs attention content that's different than others that makes people interested so that's the mindset part of it the next part of it is the actual strategy behind it so I think that I was so successful with my YouTube channels because I didn't just rely on YouTube to grow them what I did was not only did I try to master you know lawn form content but it also puts so much time into mastering short form content I wanted to use my Tik Tok and my Instagram accounts and like any other social media have Pinterest Snapchat Facebook every other platform out there I funneled the audience to YouTube so then I knew that when people are searching my name on YouTube it's going to boost it they click on a video they say oh I saw her on Tik Tok oh I saw her on Instagram it's going to boost it so this is where YouTube shorts comes in so you guys can be creating YouTube shorts you can create YouTube shorts through N Video AI you can create them yourself you can record them yourself however you want to do it I do have videos on my YouTube channel just about short form content but I always use the short form content as a funnel to lawn form because once you break through on YouTube once you get monetized half of the battle is actually over because once you're monetize YouTube sees that like okay you put work in the account it has ads on it let me boost it even more so then YouTube gets money too you know so it's like worth it so just keep this in mind as you're growing your channels um spend time you know like I said invest your time into growing it there's no way to buy it like there's no fake followers on YouTube it's not a thing that's why I love YouTube too there's no fake followers there's no such a thing as fake views if you try to do that your channel will be Bann like you don't do that you know you don't have to do that there's no faking it you literally just have to always see how you can improve your thumbnails your titles are very important too like we talked about positioning and how you create your titles and how you create your thumbnails is really like just so important because that's what people are going to see first it's what's going to get people to click at the end of the day you don't have to have short form content platforms I know people that grew on YouTube without them so you don't have to have them I just feel like in my personal story that's what helped me to grow so fast but with other people I feel like they've grown just with YouTube so you can 100% Master YouTube like really focus on your thumbnails really focus on your titles on your keywording everything that we talked about in this video basically and you can just grow organically on YouTube but for me I just feel like that was a secret of mine that really helped me to grow congratulations you guys made it to the end of this free course I'm so proud of you guys for watching this whole thing and really learning this because not any life that's worth it

If you need any advice please contact a qualified advisor. 18 comments all right so in this video I'm going to cover exactly how I create my YouTube automation videos for $3 per video I've gotten a lot of questions about this I'm making right now 12 to 15K a month with faces YouTube automation channels and the fact that I make videos for $3 per video many people are in disbelief as you know a lot of other gurus a lot of other people are talking about videos that cost $200 $100 or even more so let me break this down for you I'm going to show you the niche the format what the video is like and why I think this is the best most long-term method that you can see as an investment for business owners for aspiring entrepreneurs and four people in a current 9 to5 so I'm going to answer these four questions first of all how can it be so cheap $3 per video sounds ridiculous to many people what other videos likees what do you get for the price how much I upload so how much I spend in total per month with this video production cost and whether this could be a good business model for you so the first question that I want the answers do I make the videos myself no I don't I have a team making the videos for me and that team consists of three people per Channel or per format basically and that is one a video recorder plus editor that's one person then we have the thumbnail designer and we have the video uploader let's start with the video recorder and the editor so this is how it goes I give him the topic for example a topic about how to convert Facebook account into a business page this is a super simple topic here's an example video of another Channel you can see this is the video right here which will play in a bit and these are his tasks he does research to the topic so he actually shows people how to fix this problem that people have he does the screen recording and he does a voice over over while recording right so he just hits recording on his phone and while he shows the process he talks so there are no two separate recordings it's just all at once then he does a mini edit he cuts the beginning he cuts the end maybe he made a mistake in the middle so he cuts that out everything that's everything you needed to do and this only takes about 10 to maybe 15 minutes if you're a beginner to do so you can upload six or four to six videos per hour when doing this so the price for a video like this is $2 and my video creator teams are all based in the Philippines great English and they work for cheap now here's an example video that I want to show you let me actually see if I can click this yes there we go all right hey guys in this video we're going to talk about how you can convert your personal Facebook p and then this guy just walks you through the process of doing this you can see one minute video super simple no heavy editing this is everything you need and these are the kind of videos that are making me this amount of money so this is the video recording itself now let's head over to the thumbnail which is very similar as well the thumbnail designer makes the thumbnail from a template that I gave them for example again how to convert Facebook account to business page something like that could look like this three lines of text and a logo super simple working from a template so I pay 50 cents per thumbnail and this literally takes 2 minutes to work so for me this is also very fair and Freelancers are happy to be paid this amount for this type of work then the third step which is the uploader this person uploads the video on my channel he uploads the video he selects the thumbnail he does the SEO he sets the upload defaults everything he schedules the video I don't touch anything here and as well here I pay 50 cents per upload so we all work with templates also with this everything is works with templates and the Freelancers are adding the videos to the channels and I've added them as an employee role so never give your email and password to someone of your Channel or your Google account you can simply add them to your channel like this you can go to permissions then go to permissions for the channel and then here you can add your freelancer email address and then add them as an editor or editor limited now they can upload the videos without you having to do anything so in this process right here the only thing I do is I provide them with the keyword which is by the way the main money maker skill and then they take care of the rest all right so for one video if you can do the math I pay $3 and everything is taken care of I don't even upload the videos myself the videos are all 2 minutes long Evergreen videos and across all my channels I upload roughly 120 videos like this and that means that I spend $360 per week on video production now important to know is that those videos usually take three to six or even longer in months to rank before they become profitable and generate money I see these channels as long-term Investments that can make me money for years so here's an example Channel that I want to show you I started this almost two years ago right now in the beginning it really didn't make much money we hit a spike with two videos that did really well but right here it was generating between $10 and $15 every single day it wasn't growing that much because a lot of videos needed time to rank but right now two years later I'm now hitting $100 days and it's continuing to grow so I have multiple of these channels as you can see straight away it takes a long time to build this up many people don't have the patience for this but if you do and you build a lot of these channels you're basically making passive income without working on it actively now I was recently thinking about this and thinking about for who would this model specifically be best suited for right and I've listed these three you're either a 9 to5 so you're working from 9 to5 and you want to build something on the side you can spend about four to five hours a week on finding keywords um uploading the videos and just Outsourcing it to a team as you have money available or for investors who are looking for alternative active Investments like stocks real estate I'd like to see this as digital real estate you can simply put like let's say a fixed amount of $500 every single month into this Channel and in months from now maybe years from now that channel can generate you between 50 and $150 every single day back so if you're willing to put in the work in that if you're willing to invest then this can be a very good way that's close to passive income so this is also for entrepreneurs so let's say you already have a current business model and you want to expand to other business models as well this is a great method so this is also how I would see it if you currently have money available you want to invest your money you can do that in stocks again in real estate you can also do it in digital real estate in these videos so $500 a month that will be good enough to get to at least $200 a month in about 1 to one and a half years of course of course that's not that appealing but if you just look at it as a traditional way of investing you would maybe get 5% returns right so it doesn't look that bad this is one of my first channels started in April 2020 got monetized in November 2020 as you can see right here this graph has been continuously going up and now generates me between $200 and $250 every single day and has generated over $100,000 in ad Revenue so I wouldn't really recommend this or I would I would really I wouldn't really recommend this if you are currently completely broke you have no money you have a study yeah you're very busy like you can probably invest into a freelancer team because you have no money you don't have much time so it's not really for those kind of people you either got to invest money into Freelancers into a team into you know improving your keyword research because it's not like you just spend money and you're going to make it guaranteed you also need to make sure that your topics are actually good or if you do have money available like one of these three uh people right here then you can do this you can even Outsource it to someone who does the research for you of course if you have that investment but this is basically what I was thinking about i' rather compare this to an active uh investment than like a business model that can help you get started so this is all all it for this video um I hope this give you a new insight of Why the videos are so cheap for who this this and I'll see you in the next one bye-bye",

      "content": "Video Production 7 Hidden Costs of Video Production (and How to Avoid Them) Discover the hidden financial traps of video production! Explore 7 unexpected costs and effective methods to avoid them. Table of Contents In video production, it's super important to know and handle costs well. It's not just about the money you first think of; it's about being ready for those sneaky costs you might not notice at first. These sneaky costs can suddenly make a project that seemed well-planned become really expensive. So, it's really important for businesses to know about them and do things to prevent them. This blog wants to talk about these hidden costs in video production and give you ten smart ways to avoid them. This way, your project can stay on track both creatively and money-wise. When you're getting into video production, it's not just the obvious costs you need to worry about. Hidden costs, which you might not see right away, can show up unexpectedly and mess up your budget. The 7 Hidden Cost in Video Production √¢¬Ä¬ç These hidden costs could be things like last-minute changes to the script, extra work needed after filming, or more money needed for licenses. They're usually costs you didn't plan for at the start but can add up a lot during production. The first step to avoiding these sneaky costs is understanding them. It's like preparing for hidden icebergs when you're sailing √¢¬Ä¬ì if you know they're there, you can steer clear of them better. In video production, you can usually avoid these financial surprises if you plan carefully and make smart choices. The trick is to ask the right questions and get clear answers about every part of the production process. For example, asking for a detailed breakdown of costs for things like animation, voice-overs, and editing can help you spot hidden expenses. And it's really important for your production partner to be open and honest with you. A trustworthy partner like Get Camera Crew will go through every cost with you, making sure nothing is unclear or hidden. Here are 10 things you can do to make sure you always know what's going on. 1. Thorough Planning Before Production Starts One of the best ways to avoid hidden expenses in video production is by carefully planning before filming begins. This stage is really important because it lays the groundwork for a smooth and clear production process. During this phase, you figure out every little thing, from the story to the practical details, making sure that every part of the production is carefully thought out and budgeted for. Here are the main things to focus on during pre-production: By spending time and effort planning before filming starts, you not only reduce the risk of unexpected costs but also make sure the production process runs smoother and more effectively. 2. Understand Your Contract Clearly A crucial step in avoiding hidden expenses is understanding the contract terms with your video production partner. Contracts can be complicated, so it's important to carefully read and understand every part before signing.

      "content": "The Hidden Costs of Being a YouTube Creator YouTube, often perceived as a haven for influencers, gamers, and vloggers, is synonymous with dreams of virality, immense popularity, and substantial revenues. As viewers, we‚Äôre accustomed to seeing polished content, high-resolution videos, and meticulously edited clips. But do we truly understand what goes on behind the scenes? The cost of content creation on YouTube is multifaceted and can quickly add up, sometimes without the creator even realizing it. The importance of financial planning as a YouTube content creator cannot be overstated. In an arena often glamorized for its creative freedom and potential for substantial earnings, many overlook the necessity of astute financial management. As a YouTuber, the journey begins with initial investments in equipment, software, and possibly web hosting, which can be substantial. Without a well-considered budget, these expenses can quickly escalate, leading to financial strain. Moreover, the fluctuating nature of income from ads, sponsorships, and merchandise sales requires creators to be adept at managing their finances to ensure sustainability. Effective financial planning also involves preparing for ongoing costs like equipment upgrades, editing software subscriptions, and unforeseen expenses such as repairs or additional gear. Furthermore, as their channel grows, creators may need to allocate funds for outsourcing editing or marketing, adding another layer to their financial planning. In essence, being successful on YouTube is not merely about creating engaging content; it‚Äôs equally about being financially savvy. Creators who master the art of budgeting and financial planning are more likely to sustain their passion in the long run, turning their creative endeavors into viable, long-term careers. In this comprehensive guide, we‚Äôll delve into the hidden expenses associated with being a YouTube creator, demystifying elements like web hosting, equipment, editing, and licensing. Web Hosting: An Online Abode Every YouTuber, especially those seeking to expand their reach, requires a digital home beyond the platform itself. Equipment: The Backbone of Content Quality, they say, is key to YouTube success, and that predominantly depends on the equipment a creator invests in. Editing: Crafting the Narrative After shooting, videos don‚Äôt magically become the polished content we see. They go through the crucible of editing, which has its own set of costs. Licensing: The Legalities To enhance content and avoid copyright infringement, creators often need to license various elements. Learning & Upgrading: The Continuous Investment To stay relevant and improve, creators need to continuously invest in learning and upgrading. Miscellaneous Costs: Often Overlooked There are several other costs that might not strike a creator immediately but are essential, nonetheless. Conclusion Embarking on a YouTube journey is exciting and promising, but also demanding. While ad revenues, sponsorships, and merchandise sales offer avenues for income, it‚Äôs imperative for budding creators to recognize the substantial initial and recurring investments required to create top-tier content. The path to YouTube stardom isn‚Äôt just about creativity and charisma; it‚Äôs also about smart financial planning and understanding the hidden costs of the trade. With the right balance, the investment can indeed pave the way to a successful and lucrative YouTube career. Sick of wasting time editing your own videos?

How much does it cost to create 1-Minute videos using AI tools? Mylene Dela Cena September 25, 2024 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Table of Contents Table of Contents AI video tools are your secret sauce to creating video content without the hefty price tag. But with so many choices, how do you know which gives you the most bang for your buck? We‚Äôll get into the details of AI video production costs and break down popular tools step by step. What is AI video creation in marketing? AI video creation uses artificial intelligence to automate parts of video production, from scripting to editing. An AI-powered video editor offers advanced features like automatic editing, voiceover generation, and real-time collaboration, enhancing efficiency and user experience. It‚Äôs the go-to solution for marketers and content creators to meet the growing demand for video content across social media. Benefits of AI video creation Lead generation AI video tools can help you showcase your expertise and build trust with your audience. Thought leadership or case study videos can move potential customers further in their buyer‚Äôs journey. Plus, most AI video platforms require viewers to enter their email addresses to access content, so you get a list of quality leads for your sales team to follow up with. Creating videos with AI tools streamlines the production process, making it easier to produce high-quality content efficiently. Cost-effectiveness Let‚Äôs be real: traditional video production can be expensive, especially if you want high-quality content. AI video creation tools are a scalable solution with low production costs for time-poor small businesses. Instead of reaching one person through cold outreach, you can reach hundreds of potential customers through one AI-generated video. Repurpose content Catching your audience‚Äôs attention is more complex than ever. Most platforms are going video first, so reach and engagement go to those sharing short-form videos. AI video tools give you a library of content to repurpose without recording individual pieces. For example, you can use a video editor to clip a section of your AI-generated video, change the aspect ratio, add subtitles, and voila, you have content ready for TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube Shorts with minimal extra effort. AI video creation process AI video generation uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze vast images, videos, and text datasets. The process involves three steps: Data analysis Storyboard generation Video composition using AI-driven editing techniques AI-driven techniques significantly enhance the process of editing video, offering script-based editing, traditional video editing capabilities, and specific AI functionalities that streamline and simplify the video production workflow. Standard features of AI video tools: Automated editing Content personalization Performance optimization Interactive capabilities Advanced Analytics These tools automate time-consuming tasks, personalize content, and give you valuable insights into viewer behavior. Cost breakdown by AI tool Now let‚Äôs get into the details of pricing for some popular AI video creation tools: AI tools like Descript allow users to edit video by editing the transcription, making the process more efficient. This method lets users cut or modify video content just like editing a text document, significantly saving time in the video editing workflow.

Comparative Analysis AI-powered tools allow you to edit videos with great flexibility and efficiency, offering features like real-time collaboration and drag-and-drop editing. Now, to help you make an informed decision, let‚Äôs briefly break down the costs and features of each tool side by side: Cost Comparison Pictory and Crayo.ai are the best value for budget options at $19 per minute of video. If you want more features and are willing to pay more, Synthesia might be for you. Regarding features, Invideo and Lumen5 have the most templates and stock media. If you‚Äôre more interested in AI and script generation, Pictory and Crayo.ai might be for you. Additional costs and considerations Before you sign up and choose an AI video creation tool, here are a few things to consider: Time to learn and use the tools. Each AI video creation tool has its own interface and features, so you‚Äôll need to invest some time in learning how to use it. Some tools, like Crayo.ai, are more user-friendly, while others, like Synthesia, have a steeper learning curve due to their advanced features. Don‚Äôt forget to factor in time for: Watching tutorials Practicing with the tool Getting to know all the features As you get more comfortable, you should explore more advanced features that will impact your productivity. Extra costs for editing or refinement. While AI tools can produce excellent videos, you may need to edit them to get that professional look. It could mean: Using external software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro (which have their costs) Hiring freelance editors or agencies for refinement (which can be expensive) Buying more stock media if you go over your plan limits You may also need features not included in your current plan, like higher-resolution exports or more templates. Upgrading to higher plans will increase your monthly cost. Subscription vs Pay-Per-Use: Long-term cost implications Most of the tools we‚Äôve looked at, like Pictory and Synthesia, are subscription-based. These offer monthly costs and unlimited access to features within plan limits, which is great for regular users with consistent video output but not so good for occasional users. Pay-per-use models are less common among the tools we‚Äôve analyzed. They can be more cost-effective for infrequent users, but they can be expensive if you need to create multiple videos quickly. When deciding between the two, consider your long-term content creation needs. Subscriptions are better for businesses or creators who need to produce content regularly, while pay-per-use is better for individuals or small businesses with occasional needs. Cost Comparison: AI tools vs Traditional methods To understand the value of AI video creation tools, let‚Äôs compare them to traditional video production methods: Traditional 1-minute video production costs Traditional video production costs vary greatly depending on project complexity, location, talent, and equipment. Here‚Äôs a rough breakdown: Simple corporate videos. $800 to $1,000 per minute. Complex projects with special effects or high-profile talent. It can be over $10,000 per minute. These costs include: Scriptwriting Crew hiring (camera operators, directors) Equipment rental Location fees Post-production editing Graphics or animations Stock footage alone can cost $100 to $250 per clip, so a one-minute video with multiple clips could cost $2,000 or more. When AI tools are more cost-effective AI tools are great in: High volume production. If you‚Äôre a business that needs video content for social media, AI tools like Synthesia, Invideo, and Pictory can help you create multiple-minute videos for $19 to $89 per month. Limited budget. Tools like Crayo.ai offer affordable plans for startups or small businesses to produce high-quality content without high overhead costs. Time-sensitive projects. AI tools can produce videos much faster than traditional methods, which is essential for marketing campaigns or announcements. When traditional methods might be more cost-effective Despite the benefits of AI tools, traditional methods still have their use: High production quality. Investing in commercials or corporate branding videos that require high quality, professional equipment, and skilled personnel might be worth it. Custom content. Projects that require highly customized content or complex emotional tones benefit from the storytelling and visual style that human creativity can bring. Long-term investment in skills. Companies investing in staff training for video production might find it more cost-effective to reduce their reliance on external production teams in the long run. The value of human expertise While AI video editing offers significant cost and speed benefits, they have some limitations: Lack of emotional nuance. AI can‚Äôt convey complex emotions and storytelling subtleties, resulting in videos that feel flat or lack emotional depth during the editing process. Generic content. Using templates and stock footage can result in videos that look similar or generic, diluting your brand. They need more creative flexibility. AI won‚Äôt adapt to unique creative visions or last-minute changes, while human editors have critical and creative thinking skills. Quality control. AI video clips may need additional oversight to meet quality standards, often requiring human intervention to refine. That‚Äôs where professional editing can help AI content: Refine content. Editors can adjust pacing, transitions, and overall flow to produce a polished finish. Customization and branding. Human editors can tailor videos to brand guidelines, add custom graphics, color grade, and add brand elements. Creative input. Editors bring experience and creativity to turn introductory AI-generated videos into stories. Quality control. Editors check before content goes to market to ensure quality standards are met. Fractional video editing: A cost-effective solution If you want to balance AI and human expertise, fractional video editing services like Vidpros might be the answer. This way, you can: Get professional editing talent without the cost of full-time staff. Scale your video production according to demand. Boost engagement and brand perception and potentially better ROI from your video marketing. By balancing AI and human expertise, you can optimize your video production for quality and cost. Capping off AI video creation tools are a cost-effective solution for businesses that need to produce video content regularly. By understanding the pricing models, hidden costs, and limitations, you can make an informed decision that balances your budget with your quality requirements. The key to video marketing isn‚Äôt just producing content fast and cheap‚Äîit‚Äôs about producing content that resonates with your audience and drives results for your business. Whether you use AI video editing tools, traditional methods, or a combination of both, the most important thing is that your videos communicate your message and achieve your marketing goals.
