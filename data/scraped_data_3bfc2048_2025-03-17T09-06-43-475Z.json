Let's dive into the nitty-gritty!\n\n### The Core of AutomateTube\n\nAt its heart, AutomateTube is an AI Video Generator. Basically, they’re offering a service that lets you create and edit videos through their platform. If you've ever wanted to make a video but didn't have the skills or the equipment, this is your jam. It’s like having your own video production team right at your fingertips!\n\n### What You Can Do Here\n\nYou can jump right in and create videos or even list videos that you’ve already made. It’s a mix of creation and sharing, making it easy for users to get their content out there without too much fuss. The website also has options for subscribers who want more advanced features or additional services, which is pretty cool if you're really getting into it.\n\n### User Accounts and Security\n\nNow, they make it clear that you need to create an account to get started. And they’re pretty strict about keeping your account info secure and accurate. Basically, don’t go sharing your account with your buddy, and remember, you’ve gotta be at least 13 years old to sign up. \n\nThis is pretty standard stuff, right? Just make sure your details are on point, and keep your login info to yourself, because they’re not taking any chances with security here.\n\n### Content Control\n\nWhen it comes to the content you create, AutomateTube is giving you the reins. You still own your videos; however, when you upload them, you’re allowing them to host and show this content on their platform. But there are rules to follow. They’ve laid down some ground rules about what’s acceptable to post. For example, no illegal stuff, no copyrighted material without permission, and definitely no malicious content. \n\nThis is all about keeping the platform clean and safe for everyone, so no funny business!\n\n### Payment Terms\n\nHere’s where it gets a little more serious: money! Everything’s priced in USD, which is good to know if you’re budgeting. They say that the prices might change down the line, and some features might come with a subscription fee. This is pretty common for platforms like this—you’ll likely have basic features for free and then premium stuff that you have to pay for if you want to level up.\n\n### Liability Limitations\n\nAutomateTube is also pretty clear about their liability—or the lack thereof. They’re saying, “Hey, we’re not responsible for any indirect or incidental damages that might happen from using our service.” It’s basically a disclaimer to cover their bases if something goes wrong while you’re using their platform.\n\n### Terms and Conditions Changes\n\nThey also mentioned that they might change these terms as they go along. If they make significant adjustments, they’ll let users know. This is important because it means you should keep an eye out for any updates to their policies.\n\n### Legal Stuff\n\nFinally, it’s important to note that their terms are governed by applicable laws, so that’s a big legal umbrella covering everything they do. No funny business!\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSo in summary, AutomateTube is a user-friendly site for anyone looking to create and share videos, powered by AI. You get to keep ownership of your content, but have to follow some rules about what you can upload. They’ve got a standard setup with user accounts, payment structures, and clear terms regarding liability and changes. If you're looking to dive into video creation without the headaches of traditional methods, this could be your go-to platform. \n\nAnd there you have it, the lowdown on AutomateTube!

The Rise of AI in Video Creation The video creation landscape has experienced a seismic shift with the advent of artificial intelligence. No longer confined to tech enthusiasts and broadcast studios, AI is now at the fingertips of marketers, enabling you to create eye-catching content like never before. From automated editing to content generation, AI tools are transforming the way you approach video production, allowing you to focus on the big picture while the machines tackle the tedious tasks. And let’s face it, we’re all looking for ways to do more with less—less time, less budget, and less stress. Lights, Camera, Algorithms! With AI stepping onto the director’s chair, the age of expensive cameras and specialized skills is fading fast. You can now rely on sophisticated algorithms to polish your raw footage into a masterpiece. Need a fast-cut promotional video? There’s an AI for that. Want to create video snippets that pop on social media? There are AIs just waiting to lend you a digital hand. The best part? These algorithms are not just smart; they’re *clever* at adapting to your unique style, ensuring your brand voice remains intact while simplifying the creation process. The New Marketing Director: AI Behind every winning marketing campaign is an ingenious strategist—only now, that strategist could be an AI. You might think that creativity is purely human territory, but AI is here to challenge that perception. It analyzes data, understands patterns, and can even predict what kind of video will tickle your audience’s fancy. Think of it as having a tireless assistant that never sleeps, constantly optimizing your video content for maximum reach and engagement. This shift to tech-driven decision-making may sound daunting, yet it opens the door to *unprecedented efficiencies* and insights. But there’s more to the story than just algorithms churning out creative content. As AI takes on more responsibilities, you’ll find that it can pinpoint trends and tailor messages more accurately than you ever could manually. This means you can spend less time wrangling spreadsheets and more time crafting the kind of engaging stories that resonate with your audience. However, beware of over-relying on these digital wizards—while they’re fantastic at analyzing and executing, they still lack that *innate human touch*. Balancing the insights of AI with your creative intuition is vital in creating compelling and authentic video content that truly connects with viewers. Automate or Die: The Future of Marketing Some may say that in today’s fast-paced digital world, it’s adapt or fade into obscurity. Welcome to the age of automation, where your marketing strategy needs to evolve quicker than a TikTok trend. If you’re not embracing the technologies that streamline your efforts, you risk becoming the marketing equivalent of a fax machine—inefficient, outdated, and largely ignored. With a robust AI video creation toolkit, you can transform your campaigns from laborious to legendary, allowing you to stay relevant and engaged with your audience. Goodbye Clunky Processes Any marketer worth their salt knows that clunky processes are the enemy of creativity. Long gone are the days of wrestling with cumbersome software and endless revisions. Instead, you have the power to harness the streamlined capabilities of AI technology that can automate tedious tasks, letting your talents shine where they truly matter—crafting compelling content. Think of it as the difference between wrestling a bear and sipping a piña colada on the beach while the bear handles the logistics. Trust me, your stress levels will thank you. The Magic of Automated Editing Behind the curtain of AI video technology lies the enchanting world of automated editing—a wizardry so powerful it can transform your raw footage into polished masterpieces faster than you can say “lapel microphone.” No longer do you need to spend hours combing through clips, deciding what goes where; your trusty toolkit analyzes your video and does the heavy lifting for you. Picture this: instead of sweating bullets over every cut and transition, you’re leisurely crafting your brand message, confident that the editing magic is working its wonders on the backend. To put it plainly, the allure of automated editing is that it not only saves your precious time but also elevates the quality of your output. With smart algorithms doing the heavy lifting, you’re not just keeping pace—you’re outpacing your competition. The benefits are clear: faster turnaround times, reduced costs, and increased engagement with your audience. Essentially, automated editing isn’t just a luxury; it’s a necessity for anyone hoping to sustain an edge in the bustling marketing arena. So why not let the magic happen and focus on what you do best? Optimization Overdrive Despite the fact that you may feel swamped with the never-ending marketing tasks, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. Enter the world of optimization, specifically tailored content that speaks directly to your target markets. Imagine being able to create personalized videos that resonate like a favorite song on repeat. With the help of AI tools, you can analyze your audience’s preferences, demographics, and behaviors to craft messages that hit home. Keep in mind, this isn’t about shouting louder; it’s about whispering sweet nothings directly into the ears of your ideal customers. You’ll notice engagement soar as your tailored content captures the essence of what your audience craves. Tailored Content for Target Markets Overdrive is the name of the game when it comes to deploying strategies that resonate with your audience.

It’s like wearing the right outfit for the right occasion—your audience will notice and appreciate the effort you’ve put into making them feel special. A/B Testing: The AI Edition One of the biggest perks of using AI in video creation is the ability to run A/B tests as if you had a scientific laboratory in your marketing arsenal. Want to know if your bright pink call-to-action button will outshine the classic, elegant blue? With AI, testing these elements becomes as easy as a click of a button. You can evaluate viewer reactions in real-time, so you can pivot strategies on the fly. The speed of getting feedback is mind-blowing, allowing you to optimize your videos faster than ever.

Expanding Reach with Smart Tech Between algorithms and analytics, the magic of smart tech allows you to reach not just more people, but the right people. It’s not about shouting louder; it’s about getting smarter with your targeting. With AI tools guiding your strategy, you’ll find yourself tapping into platforms and audiences you didn’t even know existed, maximizing the impact of your videos and truly amplifying your brand voice. Strategy is the name of the game when expanding your reach with smart tech. By integrating tools that analyze viewer behavior and predict trends, you can craft videos that appeal to your target demographics authentically. This enhances your reach while minimizing wasted efforts; after all, no one likes to watch a video that doesn’t speak to them, right? Plus, by being in the right place at the right time, you can reap the benefits of higher engagement rates and better ROI for your efforts. In this digital landscape, you’ll want to leverage those insights to keep your brand ahead of the curve—because the only way is up, and you’ve got the roadmap to get there! Nailing Your Creativity with AI All great marketers know that harnessing creativity is vital to successful campaigns. However, with the rise of AI in video creation, you might find yourself caught in a whirlwind of fascination and fear. Helping or harming our creative endeavors is the question of the hour. You may think, “Will AI take the soul out of my storytelling?” or “Can an algorithm understand human emotion?” The truth is, it can both elevate and stifle your creativity, depending on how you choose to use it. AI can provide inspiration, assist with tedious editing tasks, and help generate new ideas that you might never have considered. However, reliance on machines can also lead to the risk of becoming formulaic and losing that delightful human touch in your brand’s messaging. Helping or Harming: The Creative Dilemma The challenge lies in navigating this new landscape where technology intersects with artistry. You are in an exciting period where the lines between human creativity and AI assistance are increasingly blurred. While AI can crunch numbers, analyze trends, and even suggest visuals that’ll make your videos pop, it can’t replicate your unique voice and vision. If you find yourself coding your creativity into a straightjacket defined by algorithms, you might inadvertently stifle the imagination that typically powers real engagement. Striking that equilibrium is vital for harnessing the best of both worlds without sacrificing authenticity. Finding the Balance: Human vs. Machine Your instinct may be to fully embrace AI tools to churn out content faster, but be cautious not to let them dominate your creative process. Sure, machines can handle the grunt work and free up your brain for more imaginative pursuits. However, the challenge is understanding when to lean on AI and when to maintain the organic, messy beauty of human creativity. You want to ask yourself: is this idea born from a digital assistant or is it a spark of originality emanating from you? The future of marketing hinges on finding a balance that allows you to leverage AI while still infusing your work with that delightful human flair. Helping to bridge this gap between human creativity and machine efficiency is vital for marketers looking to thrive in a crowded landscape. You can think of AI as a collaborative partner, providing ideas and tools while you stay firmly in control of your vision and storytelling. Don’t let AI write your narrative; instead, let it be a trusty sidekick that amplifies your voice, enhancing your creativity and keeping your audience engaged. Ultimately, the most rewarding creative solutions will come from actively engaging with AI, using it not to replace your artistry, but to empower your unique perspective. Case Studies: Success Stories of AI-Driven Campaigns Your interest in the transformative power of AI in marketing is about to pay off! Here’s a peek into some remarkable success stories that demonstrate how brands have leveraged the potential of AI-driven video creation tools to engage audiences and skyrocket their ROI: Company A: Boosted their conversion rates by 45% after implementing a personalized video campaign, leading to a $1 million increase in sales within three months. Brand B: Decreased their video production time by 75% while simultaneously increasing viewer engagement by 60% using AI-generated content. Agency C: Achieved a 200% growth in social media shares after releasing a series of viral AI-generated videos aimed at the Gen Z demographic. Startup D: Obtained a staggering 50% increase in customer retention rates after utilizing AI-driven video content for personalized email marketing. The Brands That Got It Right Around the globe, innovative brands are breaking ground with AI-driven video campaigns that not only resonate with their audience but also elevate their overall marketing strategy. Take, for instance, a popular fitness brand that utilized AI to analyze user data, creating tailored video workouts that saw a 70% increase in subscriber retention. Another brand in the travel sector ramped up customer engagement by integrating AI-generated video tours, which enabled them to achieve a remarkable 150% spike in bookings during the launch period. These success stories are a testament to the creative possibilities that AI tools bring to your marketing mix! Lessons Learned from Epic Fails Case studies of failure in this space offer valuable insights that help ensure you don’t make the same missteps. One infamous campaign involved a well-known apparel brand that attempted to use AI for creating great videos only to miss the mark in understanding their target audience. The end result? A string of disconnected content that fell flat and garnered backlash on social media. An equally cautionary tale revolves around a tech company that over-automated their content production, leading to generic and uninspiring videos, ultimately reducing viewer engagement by 80%. Understanding the pitfalls of AI campaign failures often lies in recognizing the importance of human oversight and the need for a well-crafted strategy. If you push the envelope without grasping your audience’s desires or lose your brand’s voice in the process, the consequences can be severe. Engagement can plummet, and social media can turn into a forum of criticism. Therefore, it’s necessary to combine the precision of AI with your unique brand narrative to make sure your videos hit home. Embrace the technology, but keep a watchful eye on the quality and relatability of your content!

AI is revolutionizing the way videos are produced, edited, and personalized, opening up new possibilities for content creators and reshaping the landscape of video production. In this blog, we will explore how AI is changing video content creation and the potential impact it can have on the future of video production. Automated Video Editing with AI Video editing is a time-consuming and complex process that requires skill and creativity. However, AI-powered video editing tools are now making it easier and faster for content creators to edit videos. AI algorithms can analyze video footage and automatically generate edited versions based on predefined criteria such as length, pacing, and visual effects. These tools can also identify key moments, remove unwanted content, and even create transitions, resulting in professional-looking videos with minimal effort. One example of AI-powered video editing is the automatic generation of video highlights. AI algorithms can analyze hours of footage, identify key moments, and automatically create short highlight videos, saving content creators hours of manual editing work. This can be especially useful in industries such as sports, where capturing the best moments from a game or event is critical for creating engaging content. Personalized Video Content with AI AI is also enabling content creators to deliver personalized video content to their audiences. By analyzing user data and preferences, AI algorithms can generate customized video content that is tailored to individual viewers. For example, video streaming platforms can use AI to analyze user viewing history and provide personalized recommendations for content that matches the viewer's interests. This can lead to increased engagement and viewer satisfaction, as viewers are more likely to watch content that is relevant to their interests. Moreover, AI is also being used to create dynamic video content that adapts in real-time based on viewer interactions. For instance, interactive videos that allow viewers to choose their own path or make decisions during the video can be created using AI algorithms that analyze viewer choices and dynamically generate different video segments accordingly. This creates a unique and engaging viewing experience for each viewer, enhancing viewer engagement and interactivity. Enhanced Visual Effects with AI Visual effects (VFX) have become an integral part of video content creation, adding depth, realism, and excitement to videos. Traditionally, VFX required extensive manual work and specialized skills. However, AI is now transforming the VFX industry by automating and enhancing the process. AI algorithms can analyze video footage and automatically generate visual effects such as motion tracking, object removal, and scene reconstruction. This can save content creators time and effort in post-production, while also improving the quality and realism of the visual effects. Additionally, AI-powered tools can also generate realistic 3D animations and virtual backgrounds, allowing content creators to create immersive and visually stunning videos without the need for expensive equipment or physical sets. Improved Video Analytics with AI Video analytics is another area where AI is making a significant impact. AI algorithms can analyze video content and extract valuable insights, such as viewer engagement, sentiment analysis, and content performance metrics. These insights can help content creators better understand their audience and optimize their content creation strategy accordingly. For example, AI-powered video analytics tools can analyze viewer behavior, such as viewing patterns, attention spans, and interaction rates, to provide data-driven recommendations on how to improve content engagement. This can help content creators make informed decisions about their video production, distribution, and marketing strategies, resulting in more effective and engaging content.

beginners because you don't have to show your face to actually get started as long as your YouTube videos are being watched you make money and there's no limit on how much money you can actually make with this you can also make money with YouTube automation from anywhere in the world in less than one year I have built two successful YouTube channels so I've learned a lot about how YouTube works and how you can start as a complete beginner people usually charge thousands of dollars for courses just like this and all I ask in exchange for the free education is just smash that like button for the YouTube algorithm And subscribe to my YouTube channel so I can continue to create free courses just like this so here's what you're going to learn in today's free course I'm going to be giving you a comprehensive guide to YouTube automation I'm going to explain all the technical stuff so you understand it so you can Master the terminology I'm going to be showing you successful examples of YouTube automation channels that are already making tons of money without showing their face I'm going to be showing all the ways to make money with YouTube well also give you tons of Niche ideas I'm going to show you how to set up a YouTube channel from scratch how to create videos from scratch and show you all the tools that you need to start making videos today I'm also going to be teaching you how to create eye-catching thumbnails and reveal my secrets on how I grow my YouTube channels very quickly I'm also going to be covering tons of other topics like YouTube shorts best practices to grow like I said and so much more so stick around all the way till the end of this free course and you are about to become a YouTube automation expert so first I'm going to go over some important terms that you guys need to know for your YouTube Journey first up we have the CPM CPM stands for cost per mile which is how much advertisers pay per 1,000 views this is all dependent on where your viewers are watching your videos at like what country the niche of your channel and the type of videos that you create CPM represents the total amount that the advertisers paying I care more about RPM RPM is how much you are getting per 1,000 views usually this is the CPM minus 40 % that's how you get your RPM and YouTube shows you this too on every single video once you're monetized another key term I want you guys to know is clickthrough rate the more people click on your video from other videos on the feed the more that YouTube boosts your video the next term that's important is watch time watch time just refers to the duration of how long are people watching your videos so now that you have this terminology down now let's talk about how the YouTube algorithm works first of all you can be a complete beginner and go viral on YouTube YouTube is a very fair platform if you are creating good content with everything that I'm going to teach you in this video your videos will do good so three things that I want you guys to keep in your mind when you are creating videos number one is Will somebody actually click on this video this is where good thumbnails come in number two is watch time how long are users watching your videos for and lastly engagement are people liking this video are they commenting on it or are they just clicking on your video and leaving right away cuz they get bored the YouTube algorithm takes all of these factors into play when they are deciding on boosting your video out to more viewers or not now let's talk about all the ways you can make money with YouTube automation if you don't already know YouTube has created so many millionaires but not a lot of creators will actually talk about it because it actually kind of makes them lose relatability With Their audience and they feel like then they're just making videos to make money and a lot that's why like a lot of times people don't really realize how much money is in YouTube so number one is AD Revenue this is just the money that you're making from the views but there's many more you can also make money from Paid subscriptions Affiliates Channel memb memberships merch Super Chat super stickers YouTube premium brand deals the list literally goes on for this but the most awesome thing about YouTube is that you can use it as a funnel to then funnel to other offers like digital products that you're selling e-commerce stores that you have can all be grown through your YouTube videos YouTube is the most stable platform out of all these other social media platforms what the best one to invest your time into especially because you can make so much passive income through your YouTube videos because there's not as much competition in the space so now you see how many ways you can make money with YouTube and you know the terminology now I want to talk about how to pick a niche I want you guys to pick a niche based on something that you at least like why would I start a YouTube channel about sports when I don't even like sports right so I want you guys to make sure that when you are venturing out and kind of you know productive scrolling and looking through YouTube or figuring out what you're going to do I want you to pick a niche and I want you to like this Niche because even when you start making money with it this is a long-term commitment this becomes your business so you want to just do something that you like and you'll thank me later also it's good to stay within one Niche or a couple sub niches with your YouTube channel because this is setting your brand for you and people are subscribing to you for that content so if you are switching around and posting a bunch of different stuff and one day you post Sports and the next day you post makeup people are going to unsubscribe to you and you will not grow a stable YouTube channel so I made a little list for you guys these are very popular Niche ideas I feel like when you see ideas visually you can definitely get an idea for it so here's a couple Niche ideas that you guys can go through and just kind of brainstorm these are the most popular ones on YouTube right now there's two ways to get ideas for your YouTube channel you can search through YouTube using keyword searches to gain ideas thinking about things that you or your family might be searching or you can use AI Trend search platforms like Trend assist AI because a lot of people are using Chach PT for ideas lately I've started to use platforms like Trend assist AI more because it's more based on specific market research made for beginners that are wanting to start and grow fast on multiple different social media platforms one of the main ones being YouTube so if you guys go to Trend assist. it will bring you to this page you can just log in and create an account and you'll be brought here this is very straightforward and easy to use you can literally just type in what are the top 10 faceless YouTube channel Niche types for 2025 these are all really good ideas but one definitely stands out which is the health Niche for multiple reasons mainly because it's educational content YouTube actually pays more per 1,000 views remember RPM your RPM is higher for this type of content versus content that's just made for kids so now let's ask it this give me 10 faceless YouTube automation Channels with the most subscribers in the health Niche and you can see here it gives us tons of examples to go by so here's one that Trend to says day recommended for us this channel healthy lawn life they started posting only 1 year ago and they now have over 400,000 subscribers and are getting millions of views and you guys can see here most of their videos is just stock footage Clips with a voiceover behind them if we go to social blade you can also see here that they are also making over $100,000 a year just from the views on this single YouTube channel so let's check another one okay so this is another Channel Medical Centric so we can look it up on YouTube so here's another example same type of videos and I just went to social blade typed it in and you can also see here they are making over $200,000 per year so now you can see kind of my process of market research there are tons of other YouTube channels across YouTube literally making videos just like this rocking up millions of views they're making thousands of dollars monthly and if they can't do it why can't you let's go ahead and just go through different faceless YouTube channels examples just to get some ideas check out this fan-made politics news channel as you can see these guys are literally just creating videos to discuss about news events without being an official news station this video got over 2 million views and all their videos is just mix of different topics on famous political figures which can all be sourced from the internet they have a lot of views and subscribers already and this channel is doing really well another faceless YouTube channel idea this one is all about food and it's completely faceless he has his face like in his main picture but all his videos are faceless he has gained over 4 million subscribers just from these simple food videos so if you're into food or cooking yourself you can also start a food Niche Cooking Channel you guys have to remember you don't have to take stock footage clips and put them together like YouTube automation can be anything YouTube Automation and especially faceless YouTube automation can even be you taking videos of your mom cooking and posting it it doesn't have to always be like the same exact thing that I'm showing you guys here just remember that all of these that I'm showing you here are examples so just keep this in mind that when you guys are looking through these channels I want you guys to gain ideas and um hopefully this helps you guys to really think that through as well and with food also like food is never going to go out of trend so it's a pretty awesome Niche to be in you don't have to be a Master Chef to make food videos here's another faceless YouTube channel that has over 1 million subscribers this is an ASMR Channel literally anybody can do faceless videos that they're making thousands of dollars monthly and if they can't do it why can't you so now that we did full market research I am now going to show you two different types of ways to make these videos come to life the first method will be creating videos using the power of AI the second method will be creating these videos manually so I'll show you guys how to use AI to create videos and I'll also show you guys how to create these completely manual AI nowadays can literally be used as a coworker so instead of you having to pay employees or pay people to make these videos all you have to do is just have a couple awesome AI platforms to put together and AI can bring these to life so much faster so the AI platform that I do use for AI created videos is in video AI you can create videos just like the ones we saw in minutes by typing in one simple text prompt and this AI will create a full-blown video for you in minutes so we're going to use Trend assist AI again so let's go back over to Trend assist Ai and let's ask Trend assist give me unique trending health related topics to create YouTube videos on so now we have tons of video topics here this one captured my attention as I do remember seeing this trending across social media so now let's just get more specific and ask Trend assist AI give me good titles for YouTube videos about we'll just copy and paste this here digital detoxing and the benefits of reducing screen time for mental health so now we literally have our topic and title ready to go next step is actually creating the video and by the way guys for both of these AI tools that I'm using today I did put the links for these down in my description box down below so you can just go through those if it's easier for you to access that way so the next platform that we you're going to is in video AI so after you click the link in my description box it will bring you to this page so now that we're here we see this box we're going to just ask the AI to create an educational YouTube video on and then we're going to just paste in what we copied from Trend assist AI digital detoxing and the benefits of reducing screen time for mental health remember the more detailed The Prompt is the better and I do actually recommend making all of your YouTube videos over 8 minutes you'll thank me later because you can actually have multiple advertisements on there if if the video is under 8 minutes you cannot do that so we can be even more specific here and just add create a 8 Minute YouTube video um and just add that in other things you can put to just help make this better is I always like to say the video should maintain a fast-paced rhythm use an American male voice use large subtitles divided into smaller segments for emphasis use a combination of slow and fast-paced clips synchronize with with the voice over and ensure a high level of Ed editing to enhance the visual impact of the video so just make sure that you guys do have these key components which is the topic of the video the tone of the voice the type of voice over whether you want subtitles or not the more specific you are the better the AI is going to do okay so now you can see our video is being generated as the AI is working just make sure you sign up you can create a free account to use I already have one but if you haven't made one you can make it here so now that this is done let's see what the AI made for us it is so crazy that the AI made this video this fast everybody is looking for the perfect digital detox but let's be honest it's harder than finding a needle in a hay stack so now you can see here's the preview of our video that we just made and here's the edit command box here you're going to be able to make a bunch of different types of edits using just simple text commands so we can just say add subtitles to the video or take them away change the intro and start with a joke add a call to action at the end to ask them to sub subscribe to your YouTube channel for more videos and another crazy feature here is you can even ask the AI to use your own voice you are able to clone your own voice with this system and I will show you guys how you can do that so if we come back to this edit command box and type in change voice over to Voice number one it is now using my voice so now you can see my own voice is added to this video just from this cloning tool day or even longer to allow our minds to reset and recharge this period of disconnection offers numerous mental health benefits if you don't want to use an automated voice over and rather have your own voice narrate the video you can clone your own voice and add it to your video to add even more of your personality to these videos let me show you how you can use this new voice cloning tool when you're on N Video AI just click on these three lines up here on the left hand side then under plugins just click on voices click here and you can add your voice so with this you have to submit a recording of at least 30 seconds and just mention I give in video AI the permission to use my voice this is just for you to use but if you don't mention this it will not work I know here it says to use high quality recording equipment but you really don't need to you can just use your phone or your laptop so once you film a voice just click click on choose file and you can upload it here check all of these boxes give it a second to work and then click done if you want to add multiple voiceovers you can click on this button here to edit and rename this file once the processing is complete you can then click on use and it will automatically add your voice to The Prompt so then you can add in whatever you want here to actually make the next video then when you're done just click on generate a video and they will literally use your voice to create the video with if you just upload One Voice by default they will use your voice for every single video you create if you want to add this voice to already existing videos that you made just go back to the command box and you can just type in the edit command box change the voice over to voice one or whatever you named your voice to be when you were renaming it so since we named ours voice one that's why we're calling it voice one and and when you're done just click on generate and the old AI voice over will now be changed to your own voice you can also completely change the language of this video so if you want to also start a Spanish Channel nid AI supports over 50 different languages so feel free to do that as well just make sure that do not you guys do not put a bunch of different languages on one YouTube channel your YouTube channels have to be separate from different languages and even I have Spanish channels so I think it's a great idea but the most important thing is just f on your main channel for now I didn't start Spanish Channel until way later on so that's kind of like a side quest and all you have to do to convert the language is just type into this text command box convert the video to Spanish and it will literally translate your entire video to Spanish another way to make edits with this is just click edit right here and you will see either edit by the media or edit by the script of the video which is what the narrator is saying you're also able to see what media matches up so if you ever want to change that you can just go in here and change whatever media you want to switch out the clips they have the best stock footage in the market and they are very very like always up on having the best stock footage in the market so this tool right here is alone very useful when you're done with your video just click download and you can download and then we can use this video for our YouTube channel now the way that we made the last video we were in the nid AI V2 this time I'm going to show you how the nid AI V3 works so and here we're going to just use the same topic I'm just going to copy and paste what we had and write create me a YouTube video about digital detoxing and the benefits of reducing screen time for mental health use generative media then just click generate a video with nid AI V3 you can create anything that you can think of from scratch using Nvidia ai's generative capabilities caught in this endless cycle of scrolling tapping and swiping um what if I told you there's a way out a way to rec it is so crazy how this entire video was made just by using Ai and it's the same process if you're wanting to switch out one of these clips you can just click on edit then click generative media click on generate New Media and then here you're just going to describe what you want the AI to make for you we're going to just say girl walking through woods with a black hoodie on then click generate a clip and you can see the AI created exactly what we wanted if you guys click on workflows you can see all the different types of projects that nid AI is capable of doing for you so definitely check these out also for more ideas just so you guys understand the pricing with Nvidia AI the first video that we made was with the plus plan that is $28 a month this video we use the generative plan of course you can try nid AI for free but if you want to use the generative capabilities I highly recommend that you go for this plan it is the one that I have and it does give you the most Bane for your buck with the $15 generative minutes this will save you hundreds of dollars that you would have otherwise had to spend on editing animating or other production costs now of course you can create these videos yourself but you can see that nid AI does this much faster you can also do this completely from your phone by the way guys they also have an app for iOS I put the link to access this AI tool down in my description box down below and you guys already know I got you guys I also reached out to them and got a code for you guys that you can use so you can use code Badd and Biz 50 when upgrading your plan okay guys guys now I'm going to show you how to make a thumbnail so I have this just pulled up it's called pixabay.com it's a free place that they have a bunch of photos and all I did was here I just searched for a couple keywords for the video that we're making so I just searched in person on phone screen right to match like the digital detox Vibe so I'm just going to search through here to just find a photo that matches the best of somebody just looking like they're consumed on their phone and also something that I feel like would look pretty good for YouTube as well so this video this photo right here definitely um looks pretty eye-catching it also looks it may have been made with AI but it looks very realistic so I'm going to go ahead and just click download and we're going to click download again so now we have this on our computer now I'm just going to go over to canva and I'm just going to type in here into the search of canva YouTube thumbnail and let's search for a YouTube thumbnail template this is just going to help us get the size of this so let's just look for one that we could also use even just like font what stands out I think this one looks really good so let's click on this one and then we're going to just click on customize this template we're just going to delete the image that's already on the screen just by hovering over it and clicking on the delete button then we're going to just go over to uploads and we want to upload our photo so I just dragged it into this box here and again if I didn't mention this is all like non-copyrighted photos and stuff on that pixabay website they have a couple other websites like that um that you can take photos from so now I'm just going to drag over everything that we have um because obviously we don't want it over our photo I Envision it kind of like the words being like next to her like this and we obviously don't need all of these so I'm just going to delete a lot of these and I'm just like Swip over them and then clicking delete on my keyboard just because it's faster so another thing is there's this like misted thing sometimes templates will have like weird stuff on it just make sure you delete that as well so now we are going to kind of just straighten these out cuz I don't want them twisted like that and we're going to go ahead and get this going so let's just straighten this out too and actually I'm just going to get rid of these boxes Okay so let me do a lot of creating thumbnails is all about I feel like just really like testing a bunch of different things to be honest and just kind of moving things around so it's really good and worth it to learn canva for multiple reasons so what I have here is I'm going to make a statement on this thumbnail that's going to capture people's attention so in my I'm thinking okay you need a digital detox think about the things that capture your attention as you were scrolling on YouTube and this will really help you out a lot when you're creating your own thumbnails so I'm just going to also zoom in a little bit to her so we can put these words on one side I don't know if you guys know this psychology but people's eyes naturally go to the left upper left part of the screen so it's always good to put your word your text or things that you want people to capture people's eyes on in that section so let's move her over a little bit I'm going to make her a little bit bigger and I always try to make the words as big as possible on the screen another reason why I do that is because 90% of users are on their mobile devices when they're searching on YouTube so we really want this to stand out so um let's see how this look so I think this is looking pretty good um I always recommend like just trying different colors I already liked the Bold text that they used but you can always try out different colors and different fonts to see like what's going to stand out the best best like this one is actually a little bit even more bold than the other one and we can make it even a little bit bigger so this looks really good as well so when you are done with your thumbnail we just again put together make sure this is stretched all the way shouldn't be any white this is already sized to a YouTube thumbnail we have our text here that's very bold we have the girl here that's going to be capturing attention Okay so when you're done just click on share and then click download we're going to download this as a PNG G click download again and we now have this downloaded to our computer okay so let's just say you are ready to upload this to YouTube you logged in with your Google account to YouTube created the channel you're going to go up to here and click on create then just click upload video then we're going to just click on select files and we're just uploading the video that we downloaded from N Video AI or whatever video you're wanting to do so the first thing that we need is a title for this video so we used Trend assist AI to get us that title so I'm going to copy and paste this from Trend assist Ai and we're going to load our description with lots of keywords but we'll just wait on that let's go ahead and first upload our thumbnail here so just click upload file and we're going to upload that picture so we here we have our thumbnail being uploaded it looks really good I always like to see how it looks on YouTube too this is a really great way to see it before as well down here I always select no it's not made for kids so just keep that in mind um when you say yes it's made for kids it's going to be put on the kids app which we don't want we want it to be pushed out to adults um same with the the age restriction there doesn't need to be an age restriction on this because anybody can watch this so just make sure that your set settings look just like mine this as well just say no to altered content none of your content is altered let's see what else here in the tags you just want to make sure that you can load your video up with tags so let's use Trend assist AI to get you the top trending tags so we're going to add the tags in description after so for now just click on next click next again next again and just make sure that your video is set to unlisted before you actually post it that's going to allow you to make edits before it's officially posted then just click save now our video is uploading and in the meantime let's go ahead and get our description and tags from Trend assist AI so now let's go back to Trend assist Ai and right here we're going to just copy and paste our title here so we just have it digital detox transfer your mental health by reducing screen time and we're going to tell the AI what we need so we're going to just say I just made a video uh YouTube video about digital detox transform your mental health to reducing screen time I need 10 tags for this video okay so it's giving us now 10 tags that we can use in our YouTube keyword search down here so just click show more down here scroll all the way down and here's tags

copy this here the title and we're going to just type to Trend assist AI again and say hey can you write me a YouTube description about copy paste in our title here and then say with keywords that are trending question mark okay perfect so now it has given us a description for this YouTube video so all we have to do now is just copy this and click copy and we are going to paste it here now one thing about you can just kind of delete the keywords too you could just kind of leave them there you don't have to point them out um so this is perfect this looks really professional I love how they used the Emojis and what's really amazing about this description that Trend assist AI made for us is it has so many keywords in the description I don't know if you guys know this but the description with keywords is just as important as the tags so by using Trend assist they're going to they're going to grab you the most words so if someone's searching on YouTube screen fatigue they're going to actually show your video popping up so it's really good to use Trend assist AI especially for this because it's going to give you those keywords in your description and everything also looks super professional and I think it looks great and they even put some extra ones down here that we can use use and even these we can also copy these and put these in our tags so now that we have everything else finished with our video now we're just going to click on Save and when you're ready for this video to go live just click on here click public click done click save again and our video is now live let's click on it and see how it [Music] looks everybody is looking for the perfect digital detox but let's be honest it's harder than finding a needle in a hay stack we are a species consumed smartphones tablets laptops screens illuminate our lives from sunrise to well past Sunset the average person spends over seven hours a day staring at another great way to get people engaged is to put a top comment so on the comment here we can actually write and have Trend assist AI write us one so we can say write me a you YouTube comment for my own video that tells my viewers to subscribe and like the video use emojis for this comment so it has now generated us a top comment here that we can use so just scroll over it click copy go back to YouTube let's go to the live video video and here you can just paste it in here I love how they Trend assist gave us also like emojis to use that are perfect for this so we can go back to YouTube and then click on comment and we then can click pin and it will actually pin this comment to the top so anyone that's watching will be more likely to interact with this video and guys just ignore the fact that this is a baddies and Business Club YouTube channel just ignore that I just wanted to post it on a channel just to show you guys um the example and the process of uploading a video now I'm going to show you guys how to start your YouTube channel the first thing that we need to bring this YouTube channel to life is a name for our YouTube channel a logo for our YouTube channel and a banner so I'm going to show you how to build this YouTube channel up and then I will show you how to make a video manually after that and all these food videos got me inspired to make a Food Channel so let's do it and it's going to be faceless as well and we're not going to film any videos ourself okay so I'm going to actually go back to Trend assist AI because I don't want to be wasting hours just picking a name so we're going to get their help on this and don't take this too hard because you can always change your name later but it is good to just get this out of the way and to get a catchy name so let's go back to Trend assist Ai and we're going to ask Trend assist give me 10 tww names for a YouTube channel about food now you can see it's going to give us so many different ideas for this channel that are also likely to just look good on YouTube so let's just scroll through here here and I would also right before you pick it just make sure you Google it and YouTube it just to make sure there's not any big channels or businesses using this specific name so I'm just going to go with this one dish Diaries because the word dish can just be easily seen as them registering food content always try to put a keyword for what you're doing in the title of your channel you can use this site called zarla to make your logo for free it's literally just zara.com logo maker and I'm just going to type in my channel name that I generated with cheses dayi to get started now just click create your free logo I love this website cuz it gives you a bunch of different random examples to choose from here you can just type in your keyword and see if they have it in their system but if they don't just choose something that's closest to your Niche so I'll just choose food and for Logos we don't really need a slogan so you can leave that out click next now it's going to ask you do you need a logo here I'll just pick I offer a service doesn't matter next you're going to see two choices we're going to just make it quick and simple so we'll just pick choose icons for me now you can see it's generated a bunch of different ideas for us to choose from you can scroll through all these designs to pick which one you like the most there's so many to choose from so for this demo I'm just going to choose this then just click customize icon and here you can edit your logo design if you prefer some more changes this will be a circle profile image on YouTube so we need to make sure the icon and the name fits within the borders of the circle so just don't make the font too large and next we need a YouTube channel Banner so on this site called canva there's a bunch of different design templates that you can choose from for your YouTube Banner this is also free to use I use canva and I have the free plan for beginners here it can be a little bit overwhelming to use but I promise if you master canva you will use it for so many things it will become a such a beneficial tool for your business Journey whether you have an online business or YouTube channel or anything so here's just your blank canvas you just see this rectangular box it's the exact size to upload to your YouTube channel as the thumbnail now go ahead and click design and a bunch of different templates will show here canva is a little bit weird with their YouTube Banner canva it's not the right size but we're still going to need to choose create YouTube Banner because when we upload it it becomes the right size in YouTube settings so here I'm just showing you what size your banner artwork should be because if you go on YouTube channels you can literally see all of the letter box style size so just make sure that you keep your artwork Within These Border Lines next just type in your Niche keyword in this case we're going to just look up some food templates just look at all of the these designs we don't even need to be professional graphic designers to create this awesome artwork so we just have to pick one that we can edit easier keeping the letter box size setting in mind so let's go for this one I can already see it can be easily edited just by me moving things around if you make a mistake up here you can just reverse your action to remove it the first thing I'm going to do is just make the font smaller I'm just going to click on it and drag it to the corner to edit the words we click on it and use your keyboard Enter key to read reposition the words above is your toolbar this button here can Center your text we want to get this on the center so by clicking effect another editing tool pops up from here and you can edit your font to a different color or style here you can adjust the settings to make your wording stand out more some of the elements on the template we might not need it we'll play around with it on the design to see how it looks just now you see me delete a white box that we don't need next I'm going to edit this text to suit my channel it's kind of like a slogan but it's more of just describing what my channel is about with a few words some elements we can keep some not we don't want to overload our B Banner design with just too many things the best designs are usually just super simple so after you finish your design just click up here and bring down the menu to download if for some reason the banner does not fit just go back and download to reduce the size you can do that here so just for the purpose of this video you guys will see I'm using an old Channel that I was just testing content on the subscribers is obviously here just ignore that you're going to obviously see no subscribers on your Channel to actually create your YouTube channel you're going to just go to Google and sign up with the Google account and then we're all automatically given a channel this way so first up just go to the drop- down menu and click YouTube Studio this is your channel internal dashboard this section is private and no one else can see this but you now just look for customization once you're here you're going to just click on upload for your profile picture and channel Banner upload the banner that we made for free from canva and just adjust it around and next we're going to do the same for your Prof profile picture you can just upload and click done so we'll just upload that logo then you can just put in your basic information below under name you can put in your channel name on this channel I'm going to name it dish Diaries like we took from Trend assist Ai and for the handle name you can just put your channel name if it's taken you can just put like a one or whatever you want here and the rest you can just leave out for now I just want to get some the most important things today just to get your channel going so after you uploaded your profile picture your banner added your channel name just click public and you are good to go and now you can view your channel homepage from clicking view Channel if you don't see any changes don't worry just give it a few minutes and YouTube will update it so now we have our YouTube channel page set up and ready to post videos on that looks so professional you see guys you guys don't have to pay anybody to do any of this stuff you can do this completely on your own or you can Master this and charge somebody else for it too you know just this right here is a service right that people actually charge other people's thousands of dollars for I mean if they're doing it you could technically do it too not every everybody knows about my YouTube channel or not everybody actually wants to do this stuff but I feel like it's super easy and if you're a beginner better put that money into something else and you can do this on your own like I just did in less than 10 minutes so now I'm going to show you how to create a YouTube video completely manual and I will be doing this from scratch using tools that are free if you value your time more it might be worth it for you to just get these AI tools and use AI to make your life way easier because they really do like put the script together for you they do like the videos and everything like that and it's much faster but if you are someone that you're not in that position where you can't pay this is also a way that works and what has been done for the past 10 years before AI came out so it's definitely doable so maybe you want to learn for yourself and you don't want to use AI I'm going to show you how to edit these videos manually so the first thing that we're going to do to start making these videos is we're going to go to pixels or pixabay to grab some clips to use so basically all you're going to do is just type in your Niche keyword to the search and scroll through all the clips you like for your video creation just for the purpose of this video I'm going to make a faceless video about pasta recipes you're going to just go through them and click download to store them in your desktop since my video is going to be about pasta I will be collecting a bunch of pasta video clips when you have all of your Clips downloaded just put them in one folder that way it will be easy to select them all together to upload to your editing software so now we're going to edit the video and this is the fun part of content creation for this tutorial we're going to use cap cut it is free to use so to start your video just simply click and drag all the clips that you want to use to the editing bar below and don't worry if the if the formation's wrong of them we can adjust it as many times as we want before we're done so here at this timeline we can now see we have about 4 minutes of Clips so our video length will be complete as a 4 minute long YouTube video ideally we want to make our videos at least 8 minutes because again I think I talked about this before in the video If if it's over 8 minutes you can put multiple ads on them so you make more money so when you're monetized you'll thank me later so now to get our script written that we can use for our video we're going to just go to Trend assist AI which specializes in YouTube content creation and we're going to ask the AI write me a short script for a 4 minute YouTube video about the top five healthy pasta recipes and let's see what this gives us so now here we have a script that we can use in this video and primarily I would have actually done this first I just wanted to get into the editing tips right away but I would have actually done this first because then in the pixa bay website you could specifically find Zucchini noodles and then match it up up to the specific script but now we have a perfect script with even timestamps so this can be really awesome and we can copy and paste this into our video and obviously into our editing system so now let's go back to cap cut and just click on text then we're going to just click default text and drag that down to our video we're going to drag this all the way across because we're going to have subtitles throughout this entire video and now we can just copy and paste what we took from the trend assist AI script that it wrote for us and right up here on the upper right hand side is where you're going to start adding the text when you're done copying and pasting over the first section it should look something like this and you can drag this around to where you want it to actually lay in the video you can do the same thing and repeat the process by then just selecting and pulling that bar across to wherever you want it pasting then from Trend assist a ey and putting it where you want in the video if you highlight all of the text font and The Orange Box together here you can change the color the style of the font and text and everything that you want to actually customize it to make it look even better they also have a text to speech option so you can actually make these subtitles come to life with that text to speech and test out some of the voices here and pick the best one I do love using Jesse so as far as music goes you can find a bunch of non-copyrighted free music that you can use very safely in your videos right here I just filtered it to being $0 to use them and they are all here for you if you want one of them you just scroll over it and you can click the download button right here and then we can import it into a cap cut and you're going to add the music just like how you added the text to add the music you're going to just click on audio and you'll see that a bunch of other music pops up here and you can technically find music this way as well I just feel like it's a little bit safer to just extract it from the file and you can actually just drag that file right into your video from your desktop too or you can search for a different sa here but I feel like the most important thing is to find non-copyrighted songs and the safest way is going through YouTube studio so now that our video is ready to go let me show you how it turned out welcome to Dish diarist today we are going to show you some great Pastor dishes each recipe has been tried thousands of times so now let's talk about YouTube shorts now YouTube shorts I look at it as a great way to grow your Channel and yes you can make money from it but you're going to make a lot more money from your lawn form content so that should be the priority you can use both skills that you learned in this video to make short form content it's literally the same thing except of making horizontal content you are making vertical content and I do have videos all about vertical content and editing those on my YouTube channel of course the fastest way is to use AI which I'll show you what shorts I was able to get by using nid AI come on fluffles you can do it I don't know if I can ah the moment of truth will he or won't he oh my did you see that packed with fiber protein and Omega-3s they help with digestion Boost energy and keep you Fuller longer much screen time can mess with your sleep and even make you feel more stressed try taking breaks like a quick walk or reading a book your so now I want to share my strategy of what I think led to my YouTube success how I literally grew two channels to over a million subscrib rers in less than just a couple years and how I was monetized within 6 months on both of these YouTube channels and if I had this knowledge back then I probably would have been monetized in 3 months um but just remember guys this is a long-term game like I always say nothing in life that's worth it is ever easy right like nothing that I ever really teach on my channel is easy because you have to back that up with actually wanting to do it if you go and open a business in a storefront today are you going to just open that store and just leave it and like not do anything with it not like talk about it not hand out flyers and like nothing no right a YouTube channel is the same thing like a business it can make you so much money but you have to really believe in it and want it to grow and actually put the work in and one of the biggest things I want you guys to remember is that quality is so much more important than quantity it does not matter if you are posting every single day on YouTube that's not what's going to make your YouTube channel grow what's going to make your YouTube channel grow is by posting quality content content that grabs attention content that's different than others that makes people interested so that's the mindset part of it the next part of it is the actual strategy behind it so I think that I was so successful with my YouTube channels because I didn't just rely on YouTube to grow them what I did was not only did I try to master you know lawn form content but it also puts so much time into mastering short form content I wanted to use my Tik Tok and my Instagram accounts and like any other social media have Pinterest Snapchat Facebook every other platform out there I funneled the audience to YouTube so then I knew that when people are searching my name on YouTube it's going to boost it they click on a video they say oh I saw her on Tik Tok oh I saw her on Instagram it's going to boost it so this is where YouTube shorts comes in so you guys can be creating YouTube shorts you can create YouTube shorts through N Video AI you can create them yourself you can record them yourself however you want to do it I do have videos on my YouTube channel just about short form content but I always use the short form content as a funnel to lawn form because once you break through on YouTube once you get monetized half of the battle is actually over because once you're monetize YouTube sees that like okay you put work in the account it has ads on it let me boost it even more so then YouTube gets money too you know so it's like worth it so just keep this in mind as you're growing your channels um spend time you know like I said invest your time into growing it there's no way to buy it like there's no fake followers on YouTube it's not a thing that's why I love YouTube too there's no fake followers there's no such a thing as fake views if you try to do that your channel will be Bann like you don't do that you know you don't have to do that there's no faking it you literally just have to always see how you can improve your thumbnails your titles are very important too like we talked about positioning and how you create your titles and how you create your thumbnails is really like just so important because that's what people are going to see first it's what's going to get people to click at the end of the day you don't have to have short form content platforms I know people that grew on YouTube without them so you don't have to have them I just feel like in my personal story that's what helped me to grow so fast but with other people I feel like they've grown just with YouTube so you can 100% Master YouTube like really focus on your thumbnails really focus on your titles on your keywording everything that we talked about in this video basically and you can just grow organically on YouTube but for me I just feel like that was a secret of mine that really helped me to grow congratulations you guys made it to the end of this free course I'm so proud of you guys for watching this whole thing and really learning this because not any life that's worth it

AI isn’t just changing operations behind the scenes—it’s revolutionising how we conceptualise and execute a content strategy. Through machine learning and natural language processing, AI is becoming a collaborator in the creative process, enhancing efficiency without compromising on the human touch that remains crucial to truly engaging content. The role of AI in content creation is multifaceted and continually developing. On the one hand, AI-powered writing tools offer invaluable support in refining grammar, ensuring stylistic consistency, and generating ideas. On the other hand, design and multimedia creation benefit from AI’s ability to analyse vast datasets, forecast trends, and propose design elements that resonate with audiences. Moreover, AI is being harnessed to enrich user interaction, drive SEO optimisation, and boost marketing efforts, all with a degree of precision that was previously unattainable. Table of Contents The Advent of AI in Content Creation Understanding AI Content Tools AI’s Role in the Writing Process Improving Content Quality with AI Design and Multimedia Creation AI in Marketing and SEO Enhancing User Interaction Operational Efficiency and Productivity Challenges and Ethical Considerations Future Outlook on AI-Driven Content Frequently Asked Questions The Advent of AI in Content Creation The integration of artificial intelligence into content creation represents a significant shift in how the material is produced and refined for audiences. Historical Perspective Artificial intelligence has become an instrumental force in the evolution of content creation. Initially, AI tools were simplistic, aiding in basic spell-checking and grammar corrections. However, as machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) have advanced, so too has the capacity for AI to engage not only with the technical aspects of writing but also with the more nuanced, creative elements. Content creation has been transformed from a purely human endeavour to one that utilises the speed and data-processing power of machines, balancing creativity with efficiency. Comparing AI and Human Writers The capabilities of AI in content creation have soared, with AI tools able to generate entire articles, suggest edits, and enhance readability. Machines leverage NLP to understand context and produce relevant content, often at a speed unattainable by human writers. Nevertheless, there are limitations to AI’s abilities. Human writers retain an edge in understanding complex nuances, injecting personality, and grasping diverse cultural subtleties that AI is yet to replicate fully. The creativity found in human writing is rooted in lived experiences and emotional nuances that machines currently cannot mimic. We see AI as complementing rather than replacing human writers, blending the strength of computational efficiency with the depth of human expression. For instance, ProfileTree’s Director, Michelle Connolly, opines, “AI expedites the technical side of writing, but the soul of the content—the relatability and emotional resonance—stems from the human touch.” By pairing AI with human oversight, optimal outcomes in content quality and engagement may be achieved. AI handles the heavy data-oriented tasks while humans infuse creativity and context. Our approach at ProfileTree centres on using AI to enhance the writing process and inform strategies and decision-making with data-driven insights, reinforcing the utility of AI beyond the act of writing alone. Understanding AI Content Tools In the realm of digital content creation, AI tools have opened up new avenues for efficiency and creativity. These advanced solutions are tailored to streamline the writing and design process, enabling creators to produce quality content easily. Popular AI Content Creation Tools A few stand out among the plethora of AI tools available due to their potent capabilities and broad usage. ChatGPT and Jasper have gained traction for their sophisticated language processing skills that mimic human-like writing. For visual content, DALL-E, Freepik and Midjourney offer artists and designers the ability to create stunning images through generative AI. Meanwhile, Acrolinx and Surfer focus on optimising content for search engines, ensuring it resonates with both audiences and algorithms. The art of personalisation is handled deftly by Phrasee, which specialises in tailor-made copy for marketing communications, while Lokalise takes on the challenge of localising content across different languages and cultures, making global outreach more accessible. How AI Tools Function These tools are underpinned by complex algorithms and machine-learning processes: Natural Language Processing (NLP): AI tools like ChatGPT utilise NLP to understand and generate human language, transforming user inputs into coherent and contextually relevant content. Machine Learning (ML): Tools like Jasper continually learn from vast datasets to refine their content generation, ensuring quality and relevance. Generative AI: DALL-E and Midjourney create images by recognising patterns and references from extensive image databases. SEO and Localisation: Acrolinx and Surfer analyse keyword density, readability, and other SEO metrics to improve content ranking. Lokalise incorporates translation memories and glossaries to ensure consistency in multi-language projects. By harnessing these powerful technologies, AI content creation tools are becoming an indispensable part of the digital landscape, particularly for SMEs looking to elevate their online presence. AI’s Role in the Writing Process In the dynamic world of content creation, AI significantly enhances both the efficiency and the quality of writing. Let’s examine how artificial intelligence aids authors from the initial research phase through to polishing the final draft. From Research to Drafting When we undertake the writing process, artificial intelligence serves as an invaluable asset, facilitating extensive research with speed and accuracy. AI algorithms swiftly sort through massive datasets, extracting relevant facts and figures to inform our content. As we craft content outlines and article outlines, AI tools help us rapidly generate a coherent structure, ensuring that all critical points are addressed systematically. AI’s capabilities extend to the drafting of first drafts. By processing the information gathered, AI can suggest initial paragraphs that adhere to the established outline. This enables us to produce comprehensive and factually accurate drafts more quickly than ever before. Editing and Refining Content Once a draft is in place, AI’s role transitions to fine-tuning the text to achieve consistency and accuracy. AI-powered grammar checkers and style editors scan our work, highlighting discrepancies and errors that may otherwise be overlooked. They assist in maintaining a uniform voice throughout the content, which is crucial for our brand’s credibility. Moreover, in the editing phase, AI tools recommend enhancements in word choice and sentence structure, facilitating the creation of compelling and readable content. This helps us ensure that our writing is not only polished but also benefits-driven, directly addressing the needs and interests of our target audience. By incorporating AI into our writing process, we move beyond the limitations of traditional content creation. Tools like these enable us to maintain a high standard of quality while adapting to the increasing demands for timely and relevant content, reinforcing our position as leaders in digital marketing and web design. Improving Content Quality with AI One of our key goals in digital marketing is elevating the quality of content creation. AI assists us in achieving elevated standards of quality content, enhancing efficiency in the process, and ensuring details like spelling and grammar are impeccable. Enhancing Creativity Through advanced NLP (Natural Language Processing), AI assists us in pushing the boundaries of creativity. It enables us to perform comprehensive keyword research, which informs our content strategy, ensuring each piece of high-quality content we produce is optimised for SEO. AI tools also suggest variations and expansions of topics that we might not have considered, allowing us to explore new angles and innovative perspectives. ProfileTree’s Digital Strategist – Stephen McClelland, says, “The ability of AI to generate creative content ideas allows us to expand our horizons and explore opportunities we may not have identified manually.” Maintaining Authenticity Despite the efficiency gains provided by AI in content creation, we remain ever-vigilant in maintaining authenticity. It’s vital that the content we produce resonates with our audience on a personal level. AI aids us by checking for tone, style, and voice consistency while leaving room for the human touch that ensures genuine engagement. Authenticity also requires us to employ AI to enhance detail-oriented aspects, such as ensuring faultless spelling and grammar. Ciaran Connolly, ProfileTree Founder, notes, “AI offers us a powerful tool for enriching content quality, but human expertise injects authenticity and trust into what we produce.” By harnessing AI’s capabilities and pairing them with our digital marketing expertise, we improve the efficiency of our content creation process and the creativity and authenticity of the finished product. Our dedication is to producing content that stands out, engages audiences, and fosters trust with our clients. Design and Multimedia Creation In the digital age, AI tools are revolutionising design work and multimedia content creation, making these processes more efficient while expanding creative possibilities. Automating Design Work AI tools are swiftly becoming integral to facilitating design work. These tools can analyse design trends and suggest elements that resonate with current tastes. For instance, they can swiftly generate multiple variations of logo designs, allowing us to prototype and refine ideas rapidly. This speeds up the creative process and provides a greater array of options to consider, ensuring the final design is both innovative and effective. Similarly, AI has the capability to create detailed images and layouts for web design. With tools that deeply understand colour theory and typography, we can automate tedious aspects of design and focus more on customising and personalising websites for our clients. This results in designs that aren’t just aesthetically pleasing but also crafted to perform well in search engine results, enhancing the site’s visibility. Creating Multimedia Content AI’s impact on multimedia content development is profound. Video production, for example, can be streamlined with AI algorithms that assist in editing, thus reducing the time needed to produce professional-quality videos. Furthermore, AI-generated music and voiceovers can be customized for presentations or social media content, offering cost-effective alternatives without compromising on quality. AI is also reshaping how we craft content for social media posts. Tools powered by AI can now suggest and even generate engaging posts tailored to specific audiences, complete with appropriate hashtags and images. This maximises engagement and helps maintain a consistent brand voice across various platforms. With these advancements, we are equipped to deliver content that’s not just high-quality but also aligned perfectly with our clients’ content marketing goals aimed at brand loyalty and audience engagement. Our expertise in using AI means we can provide SMEs with actionable insights and innovative strategies to stay ahead in the fast-evolving digital landscape. Moreover, as experts in our field, we are always exploring new ways AI can benefit digital marketing efforts. “AI isn’t just about automation; it allows us to understand and interact with our audience in ways previously unimagined,” says Ciaran Connolly, founder of ProfileTree. This understanding leads to content that resonates, informs, and converts, solidifying our clients’ online presence. AI in Marketing and SEO As marketing experts, we recognise that artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the ways we connect with our target audience and optimise content. AI’s integration within marketing and SEO equips us with powerful tools for data analysis, automation, and personalised user experiences, leading to more effective and efficient content strategies. Targeting Audience Understanding the preferences and behaviours of our target audience is crucial in crafting compelling marketing strategies. AI-driven analytics tools enable us to segment audiences precisely and predict consumer trends by processing large volumes of data. By employing AI, we’re able to develop highly personalised content that resonates with each subgroup within our audience, increasing engagement and conversion rates. Tools like customer relationship management (CRM) systems incorporate AI to create a detailed audience profile, which in turn informs the development of targeted social media content. Key Benefits of AI in Audience Targeting: Enhanced personalisation with AI-powered insights. Dynamic content adaptation for various audience subsets. Content Optimisation Strategies Our approach to content optimisation harnesses AI’s capability to analyse SEO elements and refine the user experience through intelligent automation. AI tools aid us in uncovering content gaps and opportunities, thereby shaping our content strategy with precision. These AI resources support our efforts in semantic keyword analysis, voice search optimisation, and the generation of well-structured, SEO-friendly content. This leads to improved organic search visibility and higher engagement rates. Additionally, we adopt AI for real-time content adjustments, ensuring our material remains relevant and impactful. Strategies for AI-Driven Content Optimisation: Utilise AI for dynamic content personalisation for individual users. Implement AI-augmented research to identify high-value keywords and phrases. We leverage AI in our marketing and SEO endeavours to enhance user experience, streamline content creation, and craft strategies that respond to the evolving digital landscape. Our cutting-edge content optimisation strategies, driven by advanced AI tools, empower us to create a competitive edge for our clients. Enhancing User Interaction In an age where AI is deeply integrated into content creation, enhancing user interaction has become a pivotal focus. Leveraging AI, we can craft personalised messaging and deploy advanced chatbots, thereby enriching user experiences while fostering stronger customer relationships. Personalised Messaging AI algorithms significantly improve the user experience by enabling personalised content. It’s not just about addressing a user by name; it’s about delivering messaging that aligns with their behaviours and preferences. We use data-driven insights to tailor the content, ensuring that our messaging is relevant and impactful. For instance, when a user visits a site for the second time, AI can display a custom message based on their interaction during their last visit. Customer Engagement and Chatbots AI chatbots are at the forefront of customer engagement. They’ve evolved to understand complex queries, analyse emotions, and respond with Lex—the language processing service made to enhance chatbot experiences. AI chatbots can assist customers 24/7, providing instant resolutions and greatly reducing wait times. Customers receive a personalised touch by conversing with these AI entities, which can significantly improve engagement levels and conversion rates. For SMEs, this means AI chatbots do not just solve queries; they become a vital part of the customer journey. In crafting these technologically advanced interactions, we embrace our commitment to innovation; as Ciaran Connolly, ProfileTree Founder, points out, “By intertwining empathetic design with AI, we deepen the connection between our content and viewers, leading to more poignant user experiences.” Operational Efficiency and Productivity In the realm of content creation, the use of artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming how we approach operational efficiency and productivity. Streamlining Content Production The integration of AI in content production has enabled businesses to process vast amounts of data with greater speed. These smart-systems assist in the initial stages of brainstorming and sorting through data to compile reports, thereby increasing efficiency. For instance, generative AI tools can produce draft content that professionals can refine, leading to improved productivity. Automation and Time-saving Automating routine tasks is another critical aspect where AI profoundly impacts content creation. Time-consuming activities such as data analysis and graphic design can now be handled by AI, freeing creators to focus on more strategic parts of their projects. The automation made possible by AI not only quickens the workflow but also enhances the accuracy of the end product. Challenges and Ethical Considerations Harnessing artificial intelligence for content creation confronts certain challenges and requires complex ethical considerations. This part of our exploration centres on addressing AI limitations and ethical implications, ensuring that opportunities for innovation are balanced with responsibility and inclusivity. Addressing AI Limitations While AI greatly enhances efficiency, content creators must recognise limitations in consistency and accuracy. For instance, AI may not always understand context the way humans do, leading to content lacking nuance or misaligned with audience values. Opportunities arise when we rigorously train these systems, improving output through iterative refinement. Yet, vigilance is needed to maintain the quality that reflects the discerning standards we set at ProfileTree. Navigating Ethical Implications The use of AI in content creation also brings forth ethical considerations. As we generate and share content, we must ensure it harbours no discriminatory biases and promotes inclusivity. We tackle these challenges, drawing from ProfileTree’s commitment to fostering ethical content creation. This involves a multipronged strategy that filters harmful content and incorporates diverse data sets to mitigate inherent AI biases, reflecting a world where everyone is valued. Challenges like these underscore our mission: to guide and empower SMEs through the evolving digital landscape with responsible, innovative, and effective strategies. Our dedication to clear and actionable insights stems from our belief that each piece of content should serve as a stepping stone towards tangible improvements in our readers’ digital marketing endeavours. As ProfileTree’s Digital Strategist – Stephen McClelland, says, “In an age where AI can draft a narrative, it’s our authenticity and commitment to ethics that write the true story of our brand.” Future Outlook on AI-Driven Content In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital content, artificial intelligence is poised to transform the industry. We anticipate significant shifts in how content is created, personalised, and delivered, which will present new challenges and opportunities. Anticipating Changes in Content Creation Artificial intelligence is set to redefine the way we produce and manage content. Content marketing is on the cusp of an evolution, with AI-driven content offering unparalleled personalisation at scale. This shift is expected to enhance user engagement and deliver content that resonates more deeply with individual preferences. While these developments herald exciting prospects, it’s crucial for us to consider both the benefits and limitations of such technologies. As AI-driven content becomes more sophisticated, the need for oversight remains to ensure originality and relevance. AI and the Future of Employment The impact of AI on employment within the content creation sector generates a mix of apprehension and optimism. Opportunities for content marketers may shift towards roles that emphasise strategic oversight and creative direction, while Google Bard and similar AI platforms could handle routine content generation. This could free up our time to focus on strategic elements like brand voice and narrative, which humans still manage best. At ProfileTree, we know that the key to harnessing AI effectively is a blend of human creativity and machine efficiency—ensuring content remains engaging and valuable to the audience. By maintaining an active role in guiding AI applications, we can ensure the future of content is both innovative and authentic, striking a balance that meets the needs of businesses and audiences alike.

Discover the best AI apps and tools for YouTube, learn how AI can help you save time, and see how easy it can be to make money online by leveraging technology. Whether you're just starting a YouTube channel or looking to boost views, this strategy will show you how to make video creation easier, monetize effectively, and unlock growth potential with the latest in generative AI. 9 comments AI on YouTube now is so much more than you think it's become a game changer for some creators building their entire workflow surround it and today I'm going to break down how we use AI in my YouTube agency and how it's helping us pamp out videos that get millions of views let's start with research on YouTube research is everything it's the first step like before anything else happens and this is where most creators keep things Hush Hush acting like it's a big secret but all they really do is look up a few similar videos and copy what's working in my team we've got a better system we use two AI tools for coming up with video ideas the first one is called No GPT this tool is a beast it doesn't take away the need to check out other videos but it makes the process way faster instead of sitting through entire videos at to X speed I just drop the link into now GPT and get a summary that summary is pure go gives us ideas that lead to titles and thumbnails but to get those ideas you first need to understand how others are tackling the same topic if we a great idea we dig deeper using the AI chat feature we ask followup questions to see what gaps there are and how our content can go above and beyond honestly the summary feature and the AI chat are the real MVPs here they're the only things we really use on no GPT the transcription feature doesn't really save us much time but it will be important later another tool we lean on is chat gbt of course but not just in the usual way most people use it to brainstorm ideas right also use it to dig deep into competitor and analysis after wrapping up research with no GPT we take those transcripts and upload them to Chad GPT we ask it to look for patterns and structure storytelling Hooks and the kind of info they're dropping aren't with this we can ask Chad GPT to highlight areas where we could amp up our videos for more engagement depending on what the analysis shows it might suggest making the video longer to cover missed points or it will Flack errors and proofread content bottom line after this process we have a clear road map for improvement for example Chad GPT helped us nail the perfect length and structure for cooking videos on the healthy and fast Channel and that's just one of many channels we manage now some of you might be thinking why not just do this all manually well human creativity is awesome but it has its limits it's easy to get stuck in your own ideas with chat GPT you can always start fresh just opening new chat droping new prompt and boom an endless stream of ideas you just need to sift through them take thumbnails for instance we design all our thumbnail Nails manually but during research we also upload competitors thumbnails into Chad gbt we ask it to pick out patterns and elements that make people click and let me tell you some of the suggestions are quite inventive stuff we wouldn't have thought of but they work we saw that with our Chad gbt guide video sure the thumbnail and title might look like everyone else's but the tiny tweaks Chad gbt suggested helped us catch way more attention and the script refined kept people hooked for way Longer Now video production pipeline is complete without script and right by this point we've already locked in the overall idea and the key info we want to include so typically we've got everything jotted down somewhere either in a document or directly in a Chad GPT Chad from there we use a set of refined prompts to generate the scripts we need our prompt system is built around four types of scripts script plans false scripts scripts for shorts and sales Focus scripts each type has its own set of prompts designed for specific scenarios for example with FSE scripts we've set up three main scenarios scenario one is based on audio messages a lot of our best ideas pop up during meetings and calls so we transcribe those and feed them into Chad GPT to generate scripts scenario two is built around the hero's journey idea we've got template for this where we paste it into Chad gbt type in the channel specific details and let it do the magic the third scenario uses pre-existing written content like an article we've got two options here either we blend this info into an existing script or transform the article itself into a script each promt has been designed and fine-tuned to give us solid results they are not perfect and we know that AI is great but can fully replace the human touch so after Chad gbt finishes up one of our script writers and editors jumps into proof fre tweak phrasing and give it a light polish but honestly at that point it's just Minor Adjustments when you think about how much time this whole process saves those small touchups are a breeze the key thing to understand here is that Chad gbt isn't wri in scripts from scratch it's a toll that works under the guidance of professionals if something it generates isn't up to par we rewrite correct and fine-tune until it's perfect sometimes scripts are entirely human written and AI just steps in for polishing making them smoother and easier to narrate so what you're hearing is still very much hum driven but enhanced with a bit of AI Magic once the script is ready and the story is said we move on to thumbnails and AI plays a big role here too remember how we use Chad gbt to analyze thumbnails earlier all that analysis gets input back into Chad gbt to generate rough draft of our thumbnail we have a detailed drum system for this where we describe the thumbnail step by step the AI generated thumbnail gives us a blueprint which then goes to human designer who brings it to life but even our designers get an AI boost we often need fresh bag grounds for thumbnails and instead of sourcing them manually we generate them using Crea Ai and designers sketch the basic layout with brushes and AI fills in the details the results are pretty solid especially after some color grading and a touch of blur another essential tool in our Arsenal is an upscaler like Remy or magnific our designers have the freedom to choose but the idea is simple sometimes there is no time for high quality Stills so we have to work with screenshots from videos and even if the video isn't 4K the quality can be roof for thumbnails the same goes for Logos or background elements that need a quality bump that's where upscaler like reminy and magnific come in magnific is especially great for upscaling images of people keeping all the facial details intact while Remy works best for Logos and nonhuman elements we don't just use this approach on my personal Channel or the AI Master Channel we apply this same streamline process to every channel that decides to work with my agency and I'm super proud of the results we're delivering we've been building this YouTube Agency for years now and we've partnered with some of the biggest names on the platform take M Vlog for instance one of the top channels about video editing or Flor on ham a massive investment Channel with a super charismatic host we've helped so many creators maximize their potential grow their audiences and boost their revenue because monetization isn't the only way to make money on YouTube you can sell merch Services courses there's a whole world of possibilities but to sell a effectively you need a channel that's not just entertaining but also strategically managed to drive sales that's where we come in if you're curious check the link in the description for a quick questionnaire fill it out get in touch and we'll show you just how high your channel can go when it comes to sound we keep it pretty simple most voiceovers are done by real people because there is just no replacing genuine Human Performance but we do use AI for some parts specifically 11 labs this tool is incredible for cloning voices and generating speech with high quality results but we only use it in specific cases for example if we know it as an issue like a Clen sound or siren during editing and can re-record will just generate that sentence with AI and swap it in another time we use it is for quotes any quote always sounds better when it's read by someone other than the host it gives the video a more Dynamic feel get the idea video editing is still very much a Hands-On process AIS roll here is mostly for automating smaller tasks like generating subtitles for shorts Cap Cod is our go-to for that and when it comes to Bolls yeah we could just use stock footage but people are so familiar with those clips now that they just kill retention so instead we generate AI videos using tools like runwayml or hyper even if these AI generated B- rolls come out looking a little quirky they are way more engaging than the same old stug stuff you can even fly it off as a fun element and it works to take things up a notch we sometimes create our own background music and sound effects using fil MOA I actually made a whole video on this where I break down how you can do the same so here's the takeaway AI isn't a toy it's a tool and if you know how to use it you've got the edge as creators we shouldn't be afraid of AI replacing us what we should be worried about is getting left behind while everyone else is leveling up their content with ai ai makes us faster more efficient and the content becomes better more engaging and feels way more more organic and yeah it helps channels grow faster and make more money no doubt about that so if you've been on the fense about AI it's time to start using it to build your channel and hey if you want to go all in our team can help you out the link to the questionnaire is in the description thanks for watching and I'll catch you in the next one",

As you can see, you can hire experts in a wide range starting from $10 and up. But why only Fiverr? Well, it’s the only trusted platform that provides you with experts at an affordable price, so I believe it’s the best option for you as a small business. Now, let’s talk about “AI + Outsourcing” strategies that can automate 90% of your work — so you can focus on creating YouTube videos without feeling stressed. With that said, let’s get started. Step 1: Set up your YouTube channel Well, this part is easy. You only need four things: a name, a description, a logo, and a banner image. And guess what? AI can handle most of it for you. For the name and description, you just need to use ChatGPT. Here’s an example: As you can see, it gave me some really great name ideas for my YouTube channel. In fact, I liked them so much that I picked one — “AI Made Simple” — for both my newsletter and my YouTube channel. Now, to create a logo, you can use an AI Logo Maker, or hire an expert. And since your logo represents your brand, it’s important to make sure it looks professional and high-quality. My recommendation is to use Fiverr Logo Maker since it combines “your input + AI technology + designs from expert creators” to give you a professional logo. Lastly, for creating a banner, write a prompt in Leonardo AI to generate one, or simply use Canva. Note: If you prefer alternative AI tools like Stability Diffusion or Midjourney instead of Leonardo AI, you’re free to use them. I Tried Tons of AI Logo Generators — These 7 Are the Absolute Best ------------------------------------------------------------------ ### Here are the top 7 tools you should try, even if you have no design experience! medium.com Step 2: Research high-demand content ideas For content research, my top recommendation is Perplexity AI. But why? Well, it: Finds the latest, up-to-date information instead of old blog posts. Checks multiple sources and gives real citations, so you know the info is real. Quickly summarizes multiple long articles and gives a clear, short answer to your question. In short, you ask something specific, and Perplexity gives you real-time information, well-organized and with trusted sources. Here’s how I use it: Well, I want to know the latest news about AI, and more. So every day, I go to Perplexity, ask for the latest updates, do more research, and get the information I need in seconds. It saves me hours. You should definitely try it. Step 3: Write engaging scripts using AI tools & more Now, we all know that every YouTube video needs a good script, and if you’re writing manually by yourself, it can take a lot of time. Trust me — I’ve been writing on Medium for years, and a single post takes me over 5 hours to finish. So once you’ve done your research with Perplexity, you can use ChatGPT to help generate a script based on your topic. But here’s the problem — while ChatGPT can generate you a decent script, it’s not enough if you want to create high-quality content. You need to make some tweaks or modify it so that your video stands out. Even add your expertise, your human touch, and your unique voice. A better option? You can hire a professional scriptwriter from a trusted freelancing platform like Fiverr. How do you do that? Just go to Fiverr, search for “script writing”, and you’ll find tons of experienced script writers who can create engaging, high-quality scripts. And if you don’t have much time to find the best freelancer or want some premium quality of work, you can simply hire any of the Fiverr’s pro script writers to complete your work. Step 4: Create voiceovers & faceless content Now, when it comes to creating the AI voiceover, the best AI tool I would recommend is ElevenLabs. It generates the most realistic speech with the help of AI, and it even has a number of voice options to choose from. Talking about the pricing, you can get started for free, and even the starter plan costs just $5 per month. Now, I have to be honest — there are other AI tools as well like Murf AI, but they are not so great or popular in comparison to ElevenLabs. Besides that, you can even hire freelancers within a $5 to $15 budget. Source: Fiverr Now, let’s talk about how you can generate AI images and videos for your faceless YouTube channel. The process is simple: ask ChatGPT to generate some prompts based on your script, and then use those prompts to generate images in Leonardo AI. Here’s an example: As you can see, it provided a number of prompts that I can use — I just need to copy and paste them inside Leonardo AI. Here are the images I got from the first and third prompts in Leonardo AI: You can download these images and add these visuals to create your faceless YouTube video. In a similar way, you can even generate 3 to 5-second videos using Pika and then add these visuals while creating your faceless YouTube videos. Step 5: Edit your YouTube videos Let me be honest — I’ve tried a number of AI video tools to edit, and no doubt most of them were insane. Here are some of the best ones — Descript AI, Adobe Podcast, Runway ML, Captions AI, Gling AI, and more. But I suggest hiring a video editor because if you try editing the videos, even with AI, it’s going to take a ton of time. And here are some of the best and pro video editors you can hire. Talking about me, I’ve hired a video editor from Fiverr who makes some of the best videos for me when I needed. Along with that, sometimes I even use Opus Clip and Hedra, and I love both of these AI tools. Talking about Opus Clip — I just need to upload one of my videos, and it automatically creates multiple short clips, picks the best parts, adds captions, and does everything for me. And Hedra helps me make a video by generating the audio, adding my own character or creating one with Hedra’s features, and then making an awesome video for free. Step 6: Design an eye-catching thumbnail Now, this is the final step where you need to create an attention-grabbing thumbnail for your YouTube video. Here’s how I do it: I use a powerful combo of ChatGPT, Leonardo AI, and Canva. To be specific, when generating a cover image or thumbnail, I give ChatGPT all the necessary details so it can create some attention-grabbing prompts. Here’s an example: Next, I copy one of the prompts I like into Leonardo AI to generate the thumbnail. Of course, I can tweak it however I want. Once I find the one I like, I download it and edit it on Canva. Yes, it’s that simple. Another easy option is to hire a freelancer from a freelancing platform. But how? Once again, visit Fiverr, search for “YouTube thumbnail”, and hire the best one based on ratings, reviews, and your budget. And if you want to hire the best pro thumbnail designers selected by the Fiverr team, here’s the link. Let’s wrap up If you’ve made it this far, you’re already ahead of 99% of people who are still struggling to start their YouTube channel, or want to use AI. The truth? You don’t need to do everything yourself. You have the right AI tools, and you can even outsource some of the work to cut your workload by 90% and focus on what actually matters. Here’s a quick recap of everything we covered: Set up your channel: Use AI tools like ChatGPT, Fiverr Logo Maker, and Leonardo AI to generate names, descriptions, logos, and banners. Find high-demand content: Perplexity AI saves you hours with up-to-date, well-organized research. Write engaging scripts: Use ChatGPT for a solid start, but hire experts when you want the best quality. Create voiceovers & faceless content: For this, you can use AI tools like ElevenLabs, Leonardo AI, and Pika. Edit your videos: AI tools are great, but hiring a professional editor can take your content to the next level. Design eye-catching thumbnails: Combine ChatGPT, Leonardo AI, and Canva, or hire an expert. Of course, there are other options too, and you can even automate part of the process using tools like Zapier, DryMerge, and others. But some of these options are useless, some are complicated, and most don’t always work as expected. Hope you like it. That’s it — thanks.
