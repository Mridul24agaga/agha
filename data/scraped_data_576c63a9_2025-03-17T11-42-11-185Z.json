By automating channel growth tasks and optimizing for viewer engagement, AI enables a more strategic approach to content creation. Harness the power of AI to stay ahead of trends, engage your audience effectively, and drive your channel's success. How AI is Transforming YouTube Strategy Artificial Intelligence is no longer a futuristic concept; it is a reality shaping numerous industries, including the world of YouTube. It offers tools that can analyze enormous amounts of data, recognize patterns, and provide insights that are beyond human capability. These features make it a powerful ally in creating and executing effective YouTube strategies. Whether you are a seasoned YouTuber or a beginner, AI can help you navigate through the multitude of video trends and viewer preferences. It can provide you with relevant content ideas, generate engaging scripts, and suggest optimal posting times, among other things. By leveraging these capabilities, you can enhance your channel's performance and growth. Leveraging AI for Video Content Ideas Using AI to Analyze Trends Analyzing trends is crucial for any YouTube channel to stay relevant and engaging. AI systems equipped with machine learning algorithms can process vast amounts of data from various sources, such as comments, likes, shares, and views, to identify emerging trends. They can track what type of content is gaining traction or losing interest among different demographics. Moreover, AI can analyze keywords and hashtags associated with trending videos to offer an understanding of the topics that resonate with viewers. By using these insights, you can create content that aligns with the current trends and captures viewer's attention. Generating Video Content Ideas with AI Coming up with fresh and engaging content ideas consistently can be challenging. AI tools can alleviate this issue by generating content ideas based on the analyzed trends and your channel's niche. They can suggest video topics that have high potential for engagement and viewership, streamlining your content creation process.

Creating AI-Generated Video Scripts Benefits of AI-Generated Video Scripts A compelling video script is the backbone of any successful YouTube video. It guides the narrative, ensures the delivery of key messages, and keeps viewers hooked. AI can assist in creating such scripts by considering various factors like video length, topic, target audience, and more. AI-generated scripts can also enhance the SEO value of your videos. They can incorporate relevant keywords to boost the video's visibility on the platform and beyond. Moreover, these scripts can adapt the language style to your brand voice, ensuring consistency across all your videos. How to Use AI to Create Video Scripts Using AI to create video scripts involves a few simple steps. First, you provide the AI tool with necessary inputs like your video topic, target audience, and key messages. The AI then processes this information, along with the data it has on current trends and viewer preferences, to generate a custom script. The resulting script usually includes a catchy introduction, a structured body with key points, and a persuasive conclusion. You can review and tweak the script as needed before filming your video. This process allows you to create engaging and relevant videos with less time and effort. Aligning Content with Viewer Preferences Understanding Viewer Preferences with AI Understanding your viewers' preferences is crucial for creating content that resonates with them. AI can analyze a variety of data from your YouTube analytics, like viewer demographics, watch time, likes and dislikes, comments, and more, to provide insights into what your viewers prefer. It can identify patterns in viewer behavior and preferences, such as which topics engage them the most, when they are most active on YouTube, how they interact with different types of content, and more. These insights allow you to tailor your content strategy to better meet your audience's needs and interests. Creating Content that Aligns with Viewer Preferences Once you have a grasp of your viewer's preferences, you can use AI to create content that aligns with these preferences. AI can suggest video topics, formats, and styles that are likely to appeal to your audience based on their past behavior and interactions. Furthermore, AI can help you optimize your video titles, descriptions, and tags to attract more viewers and encourage them to click on your videos. By aligning your content with viewer preferences, you increase the chances of your videos being watched, liked, shared, and commented on, ultimately boosting your channel's growth.

It can provide actionable insights like which types of videos are driving the most engagement, what changes can enhance viewer retention, how to increase subscriber count, andso on. By leveraging these AI-powered recommendations, you can optimize your channel's growth and reach a wider audience. Leveraging AI for Enhanced Channel Growth In addition to optimizing channel growth, AI can also help you with other aspects of expanding your YouTube presence. It can assist in identifying collaboration opportunities with other YouTubers who have a similar target audience, allowing you to tap into their viewership and gain exposure. Furthermore, AI can provide real-time analytics and performance metrics that enable you to track the success of your videos and make data-driven decisions for future content.

video The Man Who solved Life Hit 115,000 views in just 3 days and videos like brain rot doesn't have to control you are pulling in over 600,000 views if we go ahead and sort their videos by popular we can see an entire Library of videos that are getting Millions upon millions of views I spent 24 hours analyzing their entire Channel and what I discovered is absolutely gamechanging they're using AI Tools in a way I've never seen before and today I'm going to show you exactly how to recreate three of their most viral videos while other creators are spending weeks on research and editing you'll be able to create these videos in minutes I know it sounds impossible but watch this here's a video I made in just 15 minutes that's just as good as apertures viral hits in the vast expanse of the cosmos what defines the IAL of existence imagine a civilization so advanced IT defies our very understanding of life itself in this video I'll show you exactly how to create content like this from finding viral topics to generating professional videos with AI we're going to break down three specific videos that got them millions of views so before we get into creating the first video let me introduce the tool we are going to use to create these videos the tool I've been using is nid AI version 3 to get started open up their website I'll leave a link in the description below and make sure to select version 3.0 in the menu right here instead of version 2.0 once you've got that selected I want you to click on explore all flows right here once you do that you'll see all the possibilities open up and you can see that there's a lot to be done you've got AI shorts 15-second Clips script video screenplay animated ads Tik Tok Shop videos explainer videos anime style videos Minecraft animations now let's just start off simple let me show you how you can create a stoic Style video just like their most popular one so first we need to ensure the right mode is selected for that go to your text command and right below that click on workflows and now I will choose the one called documentary since I think it is the appropriate one for this topic now to keep things simple as we're just starting out I'll select 3 minutes for the duration of our video next up we need to describe our topic this is basically where you tell the AI what type of video you want to make now for this I've actually been using chat GPT basically I asked it to create a prompt for a video about a story that will be made about stoicism I will also mention the fact that I want this video to have dark Vibes as it perfectly fits the stoic Niche if you want to use that prompt structure too I will drop it below anyway I'm going to copy this paste that in right there and that's that now just know you can also just do the prompt yourself just in nid Ai and it will also create a story line and all of that good stuff for you I just prefer to have super accurate inputs and that's why I do this all right now next up you have to choose the style now by default if you came through one of the workflows that style will be selected so we've got clation however you can can obviously click on this drop- down menu here and choose any other style you want and then Additionally you can add all of these other things such as background music language captions and the list goes on whichever one you want to add you want to click on the plus icon so I'm going to click on language and make sure it's set in English if I want to change it to any other language just know that it's possible simply select the one you'd like to go with and that goes for any of the additional features you know what to have precise control over our final product I want to configure the voice over right away so click right here on voice voice actors button now I will set it to be male voice would be the one called heavy Northern English voice and then make sure you have the narrator selected now what is very important is that you click on media preference and then here you want to change only use stock media to only generated media by doing this you'll make sure that they're not taking any footage from their b-roll library but instead they're only going to use generative AI to get your movie done which is exactly what we want to do so I'm going to select that and there we go I'm just going to go with this and see what we get what the AI is now going to do is analyze are prompt as soon as all of that is done it's going to ask us some audience preferences and that looks like this I can now select the type of audience I want to create this video for now complete the remaining settings I will select the following options and now let's move on to see the result imagine for a moment you're standing amidst ancient Greek ruins at dawn the Golden Light washing over crumbling Stone what if I told you that right here over 2,000 years ago a philosophy was born that could change your life today must say that looks really good I mean let's analyze this there's an actual story line the overall aesthetic just looks really good the colors are absolutely amazing in my opinion this turned out just the way it should have however let's say that you're not happy with something that it created for example scene number one the opening in my opinion can be a lot better I want to actually replace this with something else and so what you would do is click on the edit button right there and then you want to select a clip that you would like to replace so I am going to select clip number one just like that I can then then click on generative media on the right hand side then check the duration of this clip which is 3 seconds click on generate media in the top left and then I'm going to describe a scene so just type in a prompt of your new shot and what you want to see once you've given it that prompt you want to click generate a clip just like that and it's then going to adjust the video and there we go so it actually did that and it's quite a cool shot I must say remember to click on replace and then save changes in order to actually apply these changes and just so you know you can customize every scene just like that and the same goes for music if you click on music script if you click on script and you've also got the settings button which is brand new this basically allows you to control anything there is to your video so you've got overlay presets transitions text the volumes everything there is including each voiceovers character it's all in here all right so that was fun we got a stoic video out of the way but let's do some more work let's go back to our model Channel I will scroll down a bit and I really love this video called Butterfly Effect if we click into it we can see that it's just a bunch of abstract B- rolls with with nature and random cinematic shots well this video got over 3 million views and I believe it has to do with its catchy title because obviously the butterfly effect is a famous concept but anyway let's go back to nid and for this topic I want to go with animated video the idea here is to create an educational video for kids that demonstrates the concept of a butterfly effect I want to create a story that vividly teaches that there are consequences to everything and essentially everything you do today will come back to you in the future and with that in mind we simply want to Pivot it into a lesson that teaches kids to be mindful and respectful in general I know it sounds dramatic but that's the point I really just want to get creative here and see what we can really come up with and so with that prompt done it's set to only use generated media I can now click on continue and actually generate the video but before we do it is going to give you these options as you can see so just watch me answering these should be pretty basic and let's click generate and see what we get have you ever heard of the butterfly effect it's the idea that one tiny action can change the whole world meet Lily she's about to learn how powerful her choices can be one morning Lily helps her little brother tie his shoes looks awesome however now I want to add captions and it is actually so simple after your video is generated you can just go in here and write add English captions at the bottom of the screen now click generate and let's see the updated result have you ever heard of the butterfly effect it's the idea that one tiny action can change the whole world all right now all of that was fun but now I actually want to put this AI tool to the test let's go big and see what it can actually do there is this workflow called hyper realistic film now let's again go back to our model Channel and there is a particular video they have which I think is just perfect for this case the video is called the most advanced civilization in the universe so with that in mind let's go back to our workflow and type out our idea then I'm going to choose that it should only use generated media and then I will keep the style as the one that is selected by default and so the language I will set to English the voiceover should be a male with a clear American voice and that is it I'm going to click continue so as you can see when it comes to generating movies and films it offers you whopping 10 minutes as Max duration but I will go with 1 and 1/2 minutes just to get the results faster I will also select science fiction for the audience obviously keep it YouTube and let's [Music] proceed in the vast expanse of the cosmos what defines the Pinnacle of existence imagine a civiliz ation so advanced IT defies our very understanding of life itself they harvest the energy of entire galaxies bending the fabric of SpaceTime to their will Stellar nurseries become their playgrounds black holes their tools their technology indistinguishable from Magic reshapes reality on a whim okay what an amazing video we just watched now let's say you want to enter International markets with your AI generated movies and produce it in multiple languages guess what you can simply type in translate The Voice over to Spanish and add Spanish captions as well now click generate and let's see the applied [Music] changes now let's just talk about pricing really quick you can try nid AI but if you do want to use this new AI generative capability it does have a monthly fee so I actually bought the one that is $96 a month this is the plan that allows you to make these generative AI fully animated videos and if you're already using nid AI for other projects that are not the AI animated ones you can actually just go to the add-on section and get generative seconds here this will save you hundreds of dollars that you would otherwise spend on editing animating and other production costs so go ahead and grab this deal while it's still around with my custom link down below and if you want to see even more ways to use inv video AI I actually made a video last month where I broke down eight different ways to use it in your content creation from crafting cinematic ads to creating clips that look like they're out of a Hollywood Blockbuster just click on the screen now to watch that next",

For instance, if the video is for a product launch, outline the key features, use cases, and desired customer reactions to guide the AI’s content creation. Detailed Script Prompts: Provide not just the script but also instructions regarding voice, tone, and the intended length of the video. Make sure to communicate the campaign goals and the target audience to align the AI-generated video with your strategy. Visual Descriptions: When aiming for a specific visual style, such as storyboarding or art direction, include detailed descriptions of the desired imagery, color schemes, and overall aesthetic. Art directors, for instance, use AI tools to explore and visualize concepts effectively. Storyboarding Assistance: Use AI to transform descriptive text into visual storyboards. For example, Arturo Tedeschi utilized DALL-E to convert text from classic movies into visual storyboards, capturing the link between language and images. Shot List Generation: Turn a script into a detailed shot list by using AI tools, ensuring to capture the desired flow within the specified timeframe. Feedback Implementation: Iterate on previously generated images to refine the visual style. Midjourney and other similar AI text-to-image generators allow for the iteration process, making it easy to fine-tune the outcome. Creative Experimentation: Embrace AI’s unique ‘natural aesthetic’ as cited by filmmakers like Paul Trillo, and experiment with the new visual styles created by AI as they go mainstream. By employing these techniques and providing specific, detailed prompts, you can guide AI video generators to create content that is closer to your desired outcome.

The beginning of prompt engineering The history of prompt engineering can be traced back to the early days of artificial intelligence when researchers were experimenting with ways to get computers to understand and respond to natural language. Learn in detail about —> Prompt Engineering Best practices for prompt engineering One of the earliest examples of prompt engineering was the work of Terry Winograd in the 1970s. Winograd developed a system called SHRDLU that could answer questions about a simple block world. SHRDLU was able to do this by using a set of prompts that were designed to help it understand the context of the question. In the 1980s, prompt engineering became more sophisticated as researchers developed new techniques for training LLMs. One of the most important techniques was backpropagation, which allowed Large Language Models to learn from their mistakes. This made it possible to train LLMs on much larger datasets, leading to significant performance improvements. In the 2010s, the development of deep learning led to a new wave of progress in prompt engineering. Deep learning models are able to learn much more complex relationships between words than previous models. This has made it possible to create prompts that are much more effective at controlling the output of LLMs. Today, prompt engineering is a critical tool for researchers and developers who are working with LLMs. It is used in a wide variety of applications, including machine translation, text summarization, and creative writing. Myths vs facts in prompt engineering Have you tried any of these fun prompts? In the field of machine translation, one researcher tried to get an LLM to translate the phrase “I am a large language model” into French. The LLM responded with “Je suis un grand modèle linguistique”, which is a grammatically correct translation, but it also happens to be the name of a popular French cheese. In the field of text summarization, one researcher tried to get an LLM to summarize the plot of the movie “The Shawshank Redemption”. The LLM responded with a summary that was surprisingly accurate, but it also included a number of jokes and puns. In the field of creative writing, one researcher tried to get an LLM to write a poem about a cat. The LLM responded with a poem that was both funny and touching. These are just a few examples of the many funny prompts that people have tried with LLMs. As LLMs become more powerful, it is likely that we will see even more creative and entertaining uses of prompt engineering.

A well-crafted prompt holds the key to unlocking accurate, relevant, and insightful responses from language models. In this blog post, we will explore the top characteristics of a good prompt and discuss why everyone should learn prompt engineering. We will also delve into the question of whether prompt engineering might emerge as a dedicated role in the future. Best practices for prompt engineering – Data Science Dojo Prompt engineering refers to the process of designing and refining input prompts for AI language models to produce desired outputs. It involves carefully crafting the words, phrases, symbols, and formats used as input to guide the model in generating accurate and relevant responses. The goal of prompt engineering is to improve the performance and output quality of the language model. Here’s a simple example to illustrate prompt engineering: Imagine you are using a chatbot AI model to provide information about the weather. Instead of a generic prompt like “What’s the weather like?”, prompt engineering involves crafting a more specific and detailed prompt like “What is the current temperature in New York City?” or “Will it rain in London tomorrow?” Read about —> Which AI chatbot is right for you in 2023 By providing a clear and specific prompt, you guide the AI model to generate a response that directly answers your question. The choice of words, context, and additional details in the prompt can influence the output of the AI model and ensure it produces accurate and relevant information. Quick exercise –> Choose the most suitable prompt Prompt engineering is crucial because it helps optimize the performance of AI models by tailoring the input prompts to the desired outcomes. It requires creativity, understanding of the language model, and attention to detail to strike the right balance between specificity and relevance in the prompts. Different resources provide guidance on best practices and techniques for prompt engineering, considering factors like prompt formats, context, length, style, and desired output. Some platforms, such as OpenAI API, offer specific recommendations and examples for effective prompt engineering. Why everyone should learn prompt engineering: Prompt Engineering | Credits: Marketoonist 1. Empowering communication: Effective communication is at the heart of every interaction. By mastering prompt engineering, individuals can enhance their ability to extract precise and informative responses from language models. Whether you are a student, professional, researcher, or simply someone seeking knowledge, prompt engineering equips you with a valuable tool to engage with AI systems more effectively. 2. Tailored and relevant information: A well-designed prompt allows you to guide the language model towards providing tailored and relevant information. By incorporating specific details and instructions, you can ensure that the generated responses align with your desired goals. Prompt engineering enables you to extract the exact information you seek, saving time and effort in sifting through irrelevant or inaccurate results. 3. Enhancing critical thinking: Crafting prompts demand careful consideration of context, clarity, and open-endedness. Engaging in prompt engineering exercises cultivates critical thinking skills by challenging individuals to think deeply about the subject matter, formulate precise questions, and explore different facets of a topic. It encourages creativity and fosters a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts. 4. Overcoming bias: Bias is a critical concern in AI systems. By learning prompt engineering, individuals can contribute to reducing bias in generated responses. Crafting neutral and unbiased prompts helps prevent the introduction of subjective or prejudiced language, resulting in more objective and balanced outcomes. Top characteristics of a good prompt with examples An example of a good prompt – Credits Gridfiti A good prompt possesses several key characteristics that can enhance the effectiveness and quality of the responses generated. Here are the top characteristics of a good prompt: 1. Clarity: A good prompt should be clear and concise, ensuring that the desired question or topic is easily understood. Ambiguous or vague prompts can lead to confusion and produce irrelevant or inaccurate responses. Example: Good Prompt: “Explain the various ways in which climate change affects the environment.” Poor Prompt: “Climate change and the environment.” 2. Specificity: Providing specific details or instructions in a prompt help focus the generated response. By specifying the context, parameters, or desired outcome, you can guide the language model to produce more relevant and tailored answers. Example: Good Prompt: “Provide three examples of how rising temperatures due to climate change impact marine ecosystems.” Poor Prompt: “Talk about climate change.” 3. Context: Including relevant background information or context in the prompt helps the language model understand the specific domain or subject matter. Contextual cues can improve the accuracy and depth of the generated response. Example: Good Prompt: “In the context of agricultural practices, discuss how climate change affects crop yields.” Poor Prompt: “Climate change effects 4. Open-endedness: While specificity is important, an excessively narrow prompt may limit the creativity and breadth of the generated response. Allowing room for interpretation and open-ended exploration can lead to more interesting and diverse answers. Example: Good Prompt: “Describe the short-term and long-term consequences of climate change on global biodiversity.” Poor Prompt: “List the effects of climate change.” 5. Conciseness: Keeping the prompt concise helps ensure that the language model understands the essential elements and avoids unnecessary distractions. Lengthy or convoluted prompts might confuse the model and result in less coherent or relevant responses. Example: Good Prompt: “Summarize the key impacts of climate change on coastal communities.” Poor Prompt: “Please explain the negative effects of climate change on the environment and people living near the coast.” 6. Correct grammar and syntax: A well-structured prompt with proper grammar and syntax is easier for the language model to interpret accurately. It reduces ambiguity and improves the chances of generating coherent and well-formed responses. Example: Good Prompt: “Write a paragraph explaining the relationship between climate change and species extinction.” Poor Prompt: “How species extinction climate change.” 7. Balanced complexity: The complexity of the prompt should be appropriate for the intended task or the model’s capabilities. Extremely complex prompts may overwhelm the model, while overly simplistic prompts may not challenge it enough to produce insightful or valuable responses. Example: Good Prompt: “Discuss the interplay between climate change, extreme weather events, and natural disasters.” Poor Prompt: “Climate change and weather.” 8. Diversity in phrasing: When exploring a topic or generating multiple responses, varying the phrasing or wording of the prompt can yield diverse perspectives and insights. This prevents the model from repeating similar answers and encourages creative thinking. Example: Good Prompt: “How does climate change influence freshwater availability?” vs. “Explain the connection between climate change and water scarcity.” Poor Prompt: “Climate change and water. 9. Avoiding leading or biased language: To promote neutrality and unbiased responses, it’s important to avoid leading or biased language in the prompt. Using neutral and objective wording allows the language model to generate more impartial and balanced answers. Example: Good Prompt: “What are the potential environmental consequences of climate change?” Poor Prompt: “How does climate change devastate the environment?” 10. Iterative refinement: Crafting a good prompt often involves an iterative process. Reviewing and refining the prompt based on the generated responses can help identify areas of improvement, clarify instructions, or address any shortcomings in the initial prompt. Example: Prompt iteration involves an ongoing process of improvement based on previous responses and refining the prompts accordingly. Therefore, there is no specific example to provide, as it is a continuous effort. By considering these characteristics, you can create prompts that elicit meaningful, accurate, and relevant responses from the language model. Read about —-> How LLMs (Large Language Models) technology is making chatbots smarter in 2023? Two different approaches of prompting Prompting by instruction and prompting by example are two different approaches to guide AI language models in generating desired outputs. Here’s a detailed comparison of both approaches, including reasons and situations where each approach is suitable: 1. Prompting by instruction: In this approach, the prompt includes explicit instructions or explicit questions that guide the AI model on how to generate the desired output. It is useful when you need specific control over the generated response or when you want the model to follow a specific format or structure. For example, if you want the AI model to summarize a piece of text, you can provide an explicit instruction like “Summarize the following article in three sentences.” Prompting by instruction is suitable when you need a precise and specific response that adheres to a particular requirement or when you want to enforce a specific behavior in the model. It provides clear guidance to the model and allows you to specify the desired outcome, length, format, style, and other specific requirements. Examples of prompting by instruction: In a classroom setting, a teacher gives explicit verbal instructions to students on how to approach a new task or situation, such as explaining the steps to solve a math problem. In Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), a therapist provides a partial physical prompt by using their hands to guide a student’s behavior in the right direction when teaching a new skill. When using AI language models, an explicit instruction prompt can be given to guide the model’s behavior. For example, providing the instruction “Summarize the following article in three sentences” to prompt the model to generate a concise summary. Tips for prompting by instruction: Put the instructions at the beginning of the prompt and use clear markers like “A:” to separate instructions and context. Be specific, descriptive, and detailed about the desired context, outcome, format, style, etc. Articulate the desired output format through examples, providing clear guidelines for the model to follow. 2. Prompting by example: In this approach, the prompt includes examples of the desired output or similar responses that guide the AI model to generate responses based on those examples. It is useful when you want the model to learn from specific examples and mimic the desired behavior. For example, if you want the AI model to answer questions about a specific topic, you can provide example questions and their corresponding answers. Prompting by example is suitable when you want the model to generate responses similar to the provided examples or when you want to capture the style, tone, or specific patterns from the examples. It allows the model to learn from the given examples and generalize its behavior based on them. Examples of prompting by example: In a classroom, a teacher shows students a model essay as an example of how to structure and write their own essays, allowing them to learn from the demonstrated example. In AI language models, providing example questions and their corresponding answers can guide the model in generating responses similar to the provided examples. This helps the model learn the desired behavior and generalize it to new questions. In an online learning environment, an instructor provides instructional prompts in response to students’ discussion forum posts, guiding the discussion and encouraging deep understanding. These prompts serve as examples for the entire class to enhance the learning experience. Tips for prompting by example: Provide a variety of examples to capture different aspects of the desired behavior. Include both positive and negative examples to guide the model on what to do and what not to do. Gradually refine the examples based on the model’s responses, iteratively improving the desired behavior. Which prompting approach is right for you? Prompting by instruction provides explicit guidance and control over the model’s behavior, while prompting by example allows the model to learn from provided examples and mimic the desired behavior. The choice between the two approaches depends on the level of control and specificity required for the task at hand. It’s also possible to combine both approaches in a single prompt to leverage the benefits of each approach for different parts of the task or desired behavior.

James Morse, SVP of Product at BrandMuscle, moderates this discussion. Cathy McPhillips attended MAICON when it first began in 2019 as an attendee and was inspired by the potential of AI. She noted that the conference has evolved from discussing the potential of AI to the current tools and use cases that are being leveraged right now. Cathy uses AI tools to make running her podcast faster and more efficient with minimal bandwidth. Helen also attended MAICON for their 2019 debut event and again in 2023. She noted that participants came from all verticals and pursued the common goal of understanding and helping one another with AI. She also emphasized the importance of responsible AI, rolling out a responsibility clause written by Marketing AI Insitute after the event. BrandMuscle now uses AI for automating the RFP process, contract lifecycle management, and optimizing old content. Many organizations are simply looking for a place to start when it comes to AI. They need simple, tangible examples to help them understand AI before they can work toward the bigger picture. It’s good to start with a problem, look at what tech you already have, determine what’s possible, then make an integration plan. When it comes down to it, humans are still needed alongside AI. They just need to be trained to use these technologies effectively. You will always find people behind marketing — they’re just finding more efficient ways of doing it.

okay thank you all for either attending today or listening to this later when you have a little bit of free time uh we're going to go ahead and get started today's session we're going to do a little bit like a fireside chat just without the Fireside uh it actually it is getting a little bit colder where Kathy and I are here in Cleveland but I don't think it's fireplace weather yet Kathy um but nonetheless uh let's go ahead and get started I'll start by introducing myself um James Morris I'm senior vice president of product at Brand muscle I'm going to play a moderator role today this is my first time doing a mod Ator role so um please be patient with me uh and then I want to introduce you all to my steamed guests uh first we have Kathy McPhillips she's the chief growth officer at marketing AI Institute we also have Helen Baptist the chief strategy and Market officer from Brand musul so thank you both for joining me today absolutely the overall approach we wanted to take with this is I think we're all getting questions around AI what that means from a marketing landscape we're hearing from you know Helen and I talk to local marketers and teams that oversee local marketing all the time we hear Kathy I know you're hearing from agencies and corporations all the time about what what the heck do we do with this so the goal is really to kind of Deep dive into what each of us are doing in our own worlds what we're seeing be successful um even things to be cautious of risks there um and where we aren't really pushing yet because either AI is not quite there and ready for it yet or even organization aren ready for it yet so that's really the goal of today so that anyone listening walks away from this feeling a little bit more confident about where they can be successful with AI and to make sure that no one feels like hey this is going to take my job that's not the goal of this we're not trying to say this is going away but potentially your job changes and what that looks like so to start um we have to discuss meon so the marketing AI conference which is hosted by marketing AI Institute was a few months ago now back at the end of July it's it's crazy to think that it was just just a few months ago now um but really Kathy can you tell us a little bit about the conference itself really how it started from conception where it's come to today and what's changed in the marketplace since you guys started this sure so Paul rer our CEO he started the Institute back in 2016 after at that point seven or eight years of being interested in artificial intelligence and he just he was reading stuff about space and technology which he has just a real passion for and it's the more he heard about AI the more he was like wait a minute I own an agency and there's so many applications I feel like this could help me streamline scale my organization and then it turned into like this passion project as a blog post a weekly blog post series on the blog which turned into the company so in 2019 he wanted to host an event here in Cleveland and at the time was 29 July of 2019 I came in as as an attendee I was working for a different company locally came to support Paul he was a friend of mine and I left there like oh my God like I don't know how I will use it right this second but I really know this is going to be a thing and I left with a lot of inspiration a lot of passion and a lot of I don't know what to do next and I think what's happened since 2019 in this year's event is I left there saying I know what I'm going to do next there was there were tangible case studies there were tools out there there are people that are doing it and talking about it and I think that was the biggest difference for me because quite frankly if you look at our team I'm our target audience I'm a year marketer which sounds crazy to say out loud um I have and I'm shifting what I'm doing because of these tools so I'm like show me all the things like this is so much fun so I think it's just really impactful on how the my day-to-day has changed because I'm able to be more efficient and be smarter and focus on the things I love doing I love being creative I love being strategic I don't love the reporting per se but I love the analysis of the reporting that AI can help me do so it's just making me help me be more efficient in my day and doing the things that I love and I know you all have a great podcast I mean you guys use all this technology almost every day right you're playing around with it you become more operationally efficient we have you know I use five or six tools every week for the podcast and I've taken what I think which I I have guessed not guessed I've looked and said for all the things that I'm doing I'm that could should have been 20 hours of work and I'm doing it in under three so and it's things that I am doing faster and it's things it's doing things I wasn't able to do before because of bandwidth because of skill because of so many other things that now I'm able to do all I'm producing our podcast I don't know how to produce a podcast you know but these tools are helping me do it and if if there was a professional podcaster who looked at what I was doing they would be like you probably could be doing it better and that's absolutely true but for what we need right now I'm able to do those things but there are also bigger things like Paul our CEO wants a speaker reel I can't do that I can project manag to speaker real but do we need the professionals are still needed in many capacities and quite frankly then they can do the things they love and not do these all these little things that we couldn't do before Kathy can I can you just talk a little bit about what so I was there as an attendee right and I feel like it was drinking from the fire hose and the rate of change is so fast what's really like changed since that time frame in July I think the biggest thing I've seen is that people are just getting smarter about the technology and instead of just going in and saying I'm going to try this tool this tool this tool they're being more strategic on why they're testing a tool they're finding a problem or a use case to use a tool versus just saying I'm GNA try chat GPT or I'm G to try anything else it's like I've got a problem and I'm gonna figure out how I can solve it using these tools and I think with that comes a lot of am I allowed to be doing these things can I be putting my data into a tool or my copy into a tool and where does where where is that data going where where is my IP where is it going so people talking about should I buy a tool or should I build a tool that's been a lot of conversations I've been hearing and that's a little bit out of my league like I get I can talk about it but I'm not the person from our organization who would be the person who would decide that but I want to be in those conversations because I want to know you know what the outcome is going to be what are the outputs I can get from this what's better about it than me using a tool that I've purchased and a lot of the tools you're a lot of the things where you're building your own tool is from the same people that are doing the other things it's just you're now doing they're branching off into different parts of their business and then to finish and then also a lot of people are trying to figure out you know with Microsoft coming out with everything they're doing and Google do we need all the smaller tools and my answer to that I think is yes but I think it just as as anything it just depends yeah Helen you mentioned it was that you attended this past year I think it was your first year attending meon what were I guess a lot of questions what were your immediate thoughts of the event you know how have the last few months evolved for you the team uh at Brand muscle Etc based off just your learnings and conversations yeah so I think uh I think it's interesting because in a prior company uh we were at the first event in 2019 I think Kathy uh if you recall um with the co-founder speaking at at your organization's event and then this year I got to go and for me it was really refreshing to be in a room where people weren't guarded about protecting their secrets or their secret sauce that there was a common goal towards understanding um what is actually happening and how we might help each other um and I think the mix of both B to C and B2 B and multi-vertical um really was different from most of the other events that I go to like the analyst relations and so maybe you become the Switzerland of analysts for AI um I think the other part for us is you know we tal there was a lot of talk about responsible AI um and making sure that people don't go Rogue and do things that are malicious or mal inent and uh you know I was on stage and asked the AI Institute for um the marketing AI Institute for for a responsibility clause and we actually rolled it out to our staff and it's included in our handbook and everybody has signed and agreed to the fact and a lot of the language is yours so that's the first thing that we did when we came back uh was make sure that the organization understands that it's okay okay to play uh but you have to be responsible with what you're doing but I think it to your point it goes even further now as like what are we putting into those open- Source uh large language models uh without risking our IP and making it available for others uh that is something that we have conversations about all the time but you know for me as a marketer I'm looking at every function there's a lot of talk about bdrs not being efficient and effective in in the new sales cycle uh world and so we're looking at ways to you know automate a lot of that through either conversational email or conversational chat um we're using it for automating our RFP processes where we're standardizing that that's a point solution that we're using again it's our model in their model uh we're using it for uh contract life cycle management we're using AI in that um we are revamping our website and migrating a whole bunch of old content to new content so how do you optimize that for um new brand voice and value propositions and uh across the board I think the other one that's really key for me is um in our own company for our own clients uh we're seeing more and more the Adobe stepping up as well for for not just verbal content but graphic content um and so our teams inter our graphic designers more than 100 of 140 of them uh are being tasked with how do you use that responsibly first but then how do we make sure that our IP is protected for the highly regulated industries that we're in um and the compliance pieces of that so if you think I think I talked about this at makon is if you think about liquor sales each County each state each brand has their own rules and regulations um and that is really the database that we've got around those things along with the US patent office and the the distilled Spirits Council Etc so th those are the kinds of things that we're seeing um you know how how does the job change you have to be a good prompt engineer uh you have to be a good QA person to really understand the nuances but I think to your point it's what problem do I have and how do I solve for that problem or the use case make it repeatable and scalable as well and I think if you take out the words AI from what you're saying you've been doing this for a long time you're everything you're doing you're seeing if there's technology to assist you you put that word AI you put AI on it and everyone's like oh no no no you're like you're already doing it you're just trying to find more efficient Technologies for what you're doing and I'd be remiss um going off script here for you James you're you're trying to moderate this but you two both spoke at the event so brand muscle is like doing really cool things and I came into your office one day and I was just like you guys are ahead you know just the things you're thinking about and the ways you're approaching things is just very very cool and for people watching this saying oh my gosh I'm so far behind if you're watching this you're not behind if you're interested in the topic it really is you know get on board you you will be behind soon but you're not right this second yeah I think Jeffrey Moore's book right crossing the chasm the chasms right here for y'all um and anybody can get on at any time um and I think Paul Paul from your Oran ganization says it the best like it's as nent as it's ever going to be right now so like you're not behind just get on board and try things so so let me ask you guys this you're hitting on use cases a lot and I think what we saw with open AI when they introduced their Enterprise version it was to really make companies feel more comfortable with sharing their data right this is locked in you don't have to worry about this that seems to have been at least the facade of concern for recent months is that what are they doing with my data so we've seen a lot of Point Solutions come up and appear that are solving use cases um Kathy for you and what you guys are seeing at The Institute how are those use cases evolving are you starting to see more complex ones that are you hit on this a little bit you think the you know are we going to go to the the Googles of the world Etc and microsofts that are kind of making this all in one place are still the use cases very much oneoff Point Solutions are they more holistic where's that going I think what I've seen and again I'm just one person what I've seen the most is really people trying to figure out I just need a starting point I just need a a win so I can go to our leadership and say this is right you know this is this is something we actually are going to save money time and everything on and again it's not about losing headcount it's about being more efficient being gaining that Competitive Edge whatever the case may be so I do think it's more focusing on that one thing um so I recently gave a presentation probably a few months ago to a group of CMOS and this group is amazing there's strategy every single week it's talking about strategy go to market strategies team build I mean all these big picture CMO topics I went on and talked for 20 minutes about using a just tool to edit a video people were like slow down you know so people the really smart people are still trying to figure this out so I think if you can bring it back to just some really finite tangible examples I think that's where we still are in a lot of instances in many instances there are things going concurrently it's like let's find those wins but let's think about a bigger picture and how we're going to scale it but right now we need to focus on the little things to get us to the big thing I think one of the biggest ahas that I had I think uh again through some CMO conversations is that you have to make the prompt be the best person of the task that you're trying to achieve so you're the bdr leader and you're writing a new sequence for right or you are the SEO expert and you need to make sure that the H1 H2 and body copy is optimized for for SEO so making sure that the machine understands the role that they're playing uh is is is a good starting place for me that's one of the key learnings that I've learned in the last couple of weeks um you know there are a lot of people who are much bigger experts than than I would ever be in this think part of it is making an investment on your own time to do some of this stuff um to not be afraid it's pretty scary it's the Wild Wild West um but you know um I've spent a couple of hours every week just playing around on a specific problem that I'm trying to solve at work um and giving people the prompts that I've written and keeping a prompt library right uh so that they are uh there for recordkeeping and can be optimized as your prompts get better um and I think that's kind of the two tips that I have is like who are you when you're writing this prompt and what prompt did you write and can you find it next time that you want to write it whether it's in a Google doc with a table of content as the the head for the prompt right um but I think investing time in this you know in the 4020 rule of of work which is 40 hours of work and 20 of self-development uh that's kind of where I spend some of my time as on self-development on AI at the moment yeah so we i' I have a Google doc of just my prompts that I've been keeping for myself I know it's all in any of the tools that I'm using and I do test out a few tools every time I'm going to do something just to see where I'm getting the best results and it's never the same so there are value in all these different tools but Paul said we should when if we get an Enterprise version we should you know we'll have our prompting Library we can share each other's prompts and I was like you don't want to see my prompts because they're so silly I'm still trying to figure it out but there you know once I get to a point like okay but one thing Chris Penn mentioned I don't know if it was at meon or just I talked to him quite a bit was ask the prompt ask the tool questions I am doing this and I'm trying to build whatever and then it gives it okay what questions should I be asking you so you can better give me a better output and it's remarkable you can get in there and figure out how to do that it takes a minute just to kind of you know just twist the line of thinking on how you're doing it but it is pretty cool and we've been doing some blog content at Brand muscle and similar to what Chris Penn's saying is just asking what else do you need to know from us to help with this content what's going to make this more impactful and you're right the questions feel like a complete interview style and they're great questions and you look back at going gosh I'm such a doofus why didn't I think about giving you that information to begin with uh I I'd also plug too for anyone who's listening is that there's great tools out there just by Googling so I struggle with mid Journey anyone who should you ask Chad GPT not Google so so good point good point I'm I'm looking more at YouTube videos YouTube's uh an area where I consume a lot of content embarrassingly enough but I found I so I am the worst at Mid journey promps to get images the way that I want them I'm horrible at this and I wish I should have it to credit this person but this individual I found on YouTube had a link to a Google doc to Kathy's point where he used it to train uh chat GPT on what mid journey is and then he asks chat GPT to create the mid Journey prompts for him to input to get the images he wants and it's incredible it uses different cameras or camera Styles or the camera settings um and it gives me everything I need but I would never have done this on my own I could not have told you how to coach chat GPT on what mid Journey does or anything and think goodness this guy has an eight-page document that does it so that's my plug the there's content out there there are tools that help help you um if you feel like a neoy just look around there's people that will help and if you try something and you get a really bad output it might be you it's might not be like just don't give up or something you tried a few months ago if it wasn't giving you a mid-journey if you look at you know mid Journey a year ago versus mid Journey now it's bananas like it is so good so all these tools are getting better every single day I'm just going to change subject for one quick second because I feel like uh there's a lot of talk about this in Hollywood obviously with the SAG and writer strikes and all those other things and and I've just signed a contract to do live video uh production um and the editing license was one where they wanted to be the only ones that could do the editing for the that next year right like that was part of the agreement and I'm like no no no no no we're going down to like three months because I know that if I put this in I can get new editing out of it um what kind of impact do you see beyond marketing right and I feel like some of those shows are marketing but because there's always product placement in them so how does that that intermix together Cathy so curveball question but I did I did just listen to Cara swisser was just on smartless um my favorite podcast and it was just that the way she was talking about AI um and how she was explaining it to three people who don't understand AI who are in the the in Hollywood it was it was pretty cool to listen to how she was explaining it I'm like taking notes you know I'm like I'm that's a great way to to explain it but they were like does is this my stuff who owns it are we getting royalties are um how long is this content going to be out there it was all these questions that were coming about that I just hadn't thought of because I'm not in that side of things but your point about even about having Li being able to edit this thing for three months do you want it even out there in three months because some of these things that we're talking about right now we might look back on this podcast and a year and be like I can't believe we were talking about yeah this you know the ones that the ones that we're producing yes because it's our core bread and butter uh but how how that we actually do those jobs a year from now may be changed right so how we do print production How We Do swag and fulfillment and all those other things but um core marketing branding materials uh I think you know the Gutenberg the the highberg print press has been around for however long been around for I think it'll be around for a while still I do think I think Kathy you hit on a really interesting point which is traditionally when we've had teams technical teams within the organization look at other software and tools they look at it once every year every two years Etc that's how often they revisit so we look at something we identify you know not yet it's not there yet and we think let's put this let's table this for a couple of years we'll come back and read this this I think what we're seeing and I'm sure you guys are seeing the same is that within AI tools you can't wait that long it's sometimes just a couple of months um Helen's working on a a new website an e-commerce website for um one of our sides of our business and we have two-dimensional product images that we want to be 3D images but we don't want to go take all the photos of everything so we're looking at AI tools and a month ago when Helen asked us this uh there wasn't anything great there there wasn't a good way to do this at least from a cost of Ive perspective and then uh last week a member of my team sent along he had found a new tool that had just come up and he thinks it it's promising in the next couple of weeks he's predicting we might be able to use it and execute it out but it's the evolution is absolutely insane here um everyone Compares it to Moore's Law and it's just not even comparison at this point it's absolutely insane how do you guys how is the Institute recommending teams manage this I mean what's the approach approach how do you how do you roll up in your sleeves and actually understand all the solutions out there and make sure you're staying on top of it I can't he to keep going back to this use case but really it's fig finding something that you need help with and going to the you know it's not even maybe maybe it's not even going to a tool that you're not already using if you're using you know it's going to a tech and saying going calling your customer success manager and saying can you do this if and if yes why are we not using it already why have you told me about this how can I get this I want my whole team to know about it or is this in your pipeline is this on your road map do you have something coming down that I should just wait on and can you give me a timeline because I need I have things I need to do or do you integrate with someone who can help us just so your Tech stack is you know staying kind of in um together or do I have to go out somewhere else so it's just there's no right path to take right now it's just um starting with I think who you are it's a pain to change Technologies um so starting with what you already have if they can help you I think is a very very important First Step because we don't know what we don't know and and and even the best customer success managers it just it's wor they don't I me they're trying to keep up too so having those early conversations now with with those folks is really important I think I think you bring up a really great Point Kathy which is every mtech vendor is probably looking at AI in some way or already has it and I think it's incumbent upon those companies in their qbrs which are usually crap sorry um I I was on that side of the house so I knew what was good and what wasn't um and I think the you know those companies need to be more forthright with what they are incubating Andor working on and not hold for big user conferences it has to be iterative to where they are at a point in time uh to the conversation that they're having in a qbr this month next month the month after um you know Salesforce had their dream Force last week and there's a big release there and I have no idea what it is yet it has and I'm I own the contract for for Salesforce here uh as the CRM holder right and so how do you uh and and like I'm a little you know minnow in the big ocean of of Salesforce world but how do you make sure that customers know that you what you have and or are working on and how can they help you iterate it quickly based on the needs that they have uh if you're a mtech vendor out there that's what we're doing on our side where James is actually piloting a lot of stuff with customers um across the board again highly regulated Industries where there are some things in our templates where uh they're really locked down right so if you're a local affiliate it for a finch serve a fin serve company uh they lock the templates down and they don't want them iterating on content because they don't trust them uh but could you open it up with AI and they're asking us to open it up and make sure that it's got grammar and spelling and those kinds of things in it um and so they're iterating with us to make our products better and so I would say those companies that have ai or are emerging into it need to start to do that with their customer as well so one of my tricks I do a lot when I'm looking at Tech and is I go to the the person who's in my role that company Elizabeth at Mark imuse is a good example I the product people are great the creators you know all those people know what they're doing but I want to know the person that's actually using their own tool for the job that I'm doing so yeah I do that a lot of different companies and that's you know just being Savvy and not stopping with customer success because oftentimes they could be wonderful people but they are not not fully informed so just being sure that you're talking to the right people or you're asking the right questions and if they don't know just say if you don't know can you just get back to me go to your product get the answer and then come back so being patient with them and just making sure that just doing your due diligence with those folks yeah I mean we have an we have an incubation team and James may not have been involved in the incubation at some stage there may have been some other product manager that was pulled away from him um and that actually happened right James I think the you know incubation happens in small groups like tiger team almost right in some cases and to your point it's about asking the right questions to the right people at the companies that you're working with as well so the last question I had kind of pre-planned in this one is uh Helen from a chief strategy officer Chief Market officer perspective how are you looking at Ai and leveraging it for our clients not just internal but as well as external um both short-term and longterm because I think those are a little bit hard to balance right now longterm especially not knowing where the longterm is like two weeks right um look I think uh the agents so we partner with a lot of agencies right so the agencies own the Crea a brand on our marketing Services clients which are Fortune 1000 you know whatever uh clients in in multiple uh verticals uh the agent gencies are coming to us and asking for help to optimize campaigns to optimize templates to uh be more efficient and effective uh but I think the the end of the day brand muscle is all about compliance and quality output right in terms of protecting the brand and protecting um our clients from legal ramifications and lawsuits um and I think that that's the balancing act between the agency and the mtech companies like us uh with where we're doing some services on behalf of agencies we're doing some services on behalf of our clients but at the end of the day understanding the IP for that client and their requirements is really the differentiator um and so this tradeoff of Time Versus cost is compromised will compromise quality and so we have to make sure that quality is is really uh taken into consideration on anything and everything that we're doing so we don't get into lawsuits I was talking to my my dad tonight at dinner you know I want to make sure nobody's doing a trademark infringement and or plagiarizing um and those are the kinds of things that I worry about from our side uh to protect us and our clients at the end of the day yeah so I think um just touching on that you know we talk a lot about our AI zag and our replace humans and and you know there's so much of the when I was when you were showing me what you were doing there was so much of the human input before about getting all these terms and conditions in all these different things by state by product by all these things and now you can automate a lot of that and you can use AI to help you with all of that but you need the person on the other side of that to check it so like a human is still very very much needed it's just indifferent you're just reskilling people on how to use these Technologies yeah and I I think a good place to look at Kathy and you know uh is Automotive right everybody thought that the AI robots were going to get rid of a lot of people uh I think there's some people on the picket lines uh you know but at the at the end of the day there are still humans involved in uh producing cars and so if you put that basic framework in front of yourself you will always see humans involved in marketing you will always see humans involved in sales uh people buy from people um and so uh you know it's what job does that person do doing redundancies in Outreach you know um email cadences and those kinds of things or te telephone calls can that be handled through a less expensive means of automation probably um getting to setting up that disco call as opposed to you know having somebody back and forth for four weeks you could have it done in days as opposed to weeks those are the kinds of things that I think we'll see change um but I'm excited about it you know it's scary as hell believe me uh but I think investing the time and learning and not I think you said it Kathy is not to be afraid to try you're GNA fail once or twice but you're get gonna get better every time you do it so so one of the things I gave a presentation a few weeks ago and I was talking about how when I started my career one of my biggest things I was trying to do was I was trying to get on National broadcast TV for one of our clients and I did this whole analysis took me probably 80 hours I'm not not even joking about okay we're in 200 dmas we want this National buy every Market needs to make sure that they're getting you know Equitable ratings so we're St we're filling in versus the national campaign yada yada so I spent all this time doing this and I think like and then I saw I didn't see this commercial until it was done until we went on the air and I was like that's what's running when I spent all this time doing this and you can't cancel it you can't change a commercial that you spent 30 grand producing all these things and now it's like you can start something and if it's not working stop so we have this luxury of being able to move so quickly and be so agile with with these tools with the creative with everything that we're doing so it is a great benefit to us right now well and I think the other thing I would say to you is that it's easier to do ab testing it is right so you can write your subject lines you can write your your headlines your seos you can test them in in in Ai and uh before you even go live into production so just just something else to think about well I love talking to you Kathy by the way know I learned something new from you both every time that I talked to either either of you individually or together so it's always a pleasure um Helen I know you're on the other side of the world right now it's uh late in Australia so I appreciate you um jumping on and doing this with us and Kathy thank you so much we love having you hopefully we can do this more often especially as we talk about this will probably be in about two weeks this will probably be dead in the water and irrelevant so can I just ask for last last minute plug Mayon 2024 is when September 10th through the 12th 2024 in beautiful Cleveland Ohio available now tickets are available now at Ma at macon.com such a bad marketer at makon m.ai AI okay and sponsorships are not available yet but count us in yes they you've never been to Cleveland in September it's beautiful best time of the year best time okay well thank you both I appreciate it we'll talk to you guys soon thanks thank you",
