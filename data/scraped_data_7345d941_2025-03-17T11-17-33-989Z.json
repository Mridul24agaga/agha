  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright buddy, let’s break this down. We’re looking at a website called \"AutomateTube,\" and from the vibe of it, they’re all about using AI to help you whip up videos. Think of it as a tool for anyone who's into video creation but maybe doesn’t have the time or skill set to do it all manually. Here’s the nitty-gritty of what they’re about and what they offer, as outlined in their content.\n\n### What’s the Deal with AutomateTube?\n\n**1. AI Video Generator**  \nThis is their bread and butter. AutomateTube is positioning itself as a platform that generates videos using AI technology. This means if you have an idea for a video but don’t have the skills or time to create it from scratch, you can use their tool to automate a good chunk of the work. It’s like having your very own video editor who’s available 24/7, but powered by algorithms.\n\n### Key Features and Offerings\n\n**2. Video Creation and Editing Services**  \nThey’re not just about making videos; they’re also about editing them. So if you’ve got raw footage or you need to spruce up existing videos, their platform has got you covered. This is great for content creators, marketers, or even businesses looking to create promotional material without breaking a sweat.\n\n### Account and User Guidelines\n\n**3. User Accounts**  \nTo get started, you have to create an account. They emphasize that you need to keep your account information accurate and secure. Shared accounts aren’t allowed, so each user has to have their own login. Also, there’s a minimum age requirement of 13, which is pretty standard for online platforms to ensure they’re compliant with regulations like COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act).\n\n### Content Considerations\n\n**4. Content Guidelines**  \nNow, this is crucial—when you generate or upload videos, you still own the content. But there’s a catch: by using their platform, you give them permission to host and display that content. They also lay down some serious rules about what you can and can’t upload. No illegal stuff, copyright violations, or misleading content is allowed. Basically, if it’s shady or could land them in trouble, don’t even think about posting it.\n\n**4.1 User-Generated Content**  \nYou’ve got the rights to your creations, but just know they reserve the right to use them on their site (kind of like a free advertisement for you, but still, it’s their platform).\n\n**4.2 Prohibited Content**  \nThis section is like the “don’t be a jerk” clause. They clearly state that you can’t upload anything illegal or damaging, copyrighted stuff without permission, or anything that would trick people. They want a safe and reputable platform, and I think that’s smart on their part.\n\n### Payment and Subscriptions\n\n**5. Payment Terms**  \nLet’s talk cash. All fees are listed in USD (so no sneaky currency exchanges), and payments are processed securely. They mention that prices might change, which is pretty standard, but they’ll give you a heads-up when that happens. Some features might require a subscription, so if you’re looking at diving deep into what they offer, be ready to pull out your wallet.\n\n### Legal Stuff\n\n**6. Limitation of Liability**  \nHere’s a kicker: they’re not taking responsibility for any damages you might incur from using their services. So if something goes wrong while you’re making videos, they're saying, “not our problem.” This is something to keep in mind; it’s a common clause to protect themselves from lawsuits.\n\n**7. Changes to Terms**  \nThey keep the right to change these terms when they feel like it, but they promise to notify users of significant changes. So you won’t be blindsided, but you’ll want to keep an eye out for updates. \n\n**8. Governing Law**  \nLastly, they clarify that all these terms are subject to the laws in whatever jurisdiction they operate under. It's just legal talk to protect them in case of disputes.\n\n### Overall Vibe\n\nAutomateTube is tapping into a growing need for automated, user-friendly video creation tools, especially in our fast-paced digital world where everyone is scrambling for content. They cater to a wide range of users—from casual creators to marketers and businesses. \n\nThe whole platform seems aimed at simplifying the video creation process without sacrificing quality, which is a big selling point. Whether you’re just looking to make fun videos for social media or serious content for your brand, this site is trying to be a one-stop-shop.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo wrap it up, AutomateTube is essentially an AI-powered video creation service that gives users pretty decent control over their content while setting clear boundaries about what’s acceptable. They've got a pretty solid setup for anyone eager to dive into video creation without getting into the nitty-gritty of editing software. If you’re in the market for bringing your video ideas to life easily, this could be worth checking out. Just be aware of the terms, keep your content clean, and you’ll be good to go.",

No credit card required Blog / 10 Automated Video Creation Tools, Tips, and Resources 10 Automated Video Creation Tools, Tips, and Resources I hope you enjoy reading this blog post. If you want my team to just do your marketing for you, click here. Author: Neil Patel | Co Founder of NP Digital & Owner of Ubersuggest Video content creation can be a massive headache. I get it. Even for seasoned marketers, creating compelling content is a challenge. The real uphill battle is trying to create that level of content regularly. That’s why we’re taking a closer look at automated video creation and some of the best tools your brand can use to expand its content strategy. Here’s the thing—automated content doesn’t have to be terrible. When you produce an hour-long, high-quality interview, you’ve also produced several pieces of smaller, high-quality content. All you have to do is repackage those valuable tidbits and present them to your audience. Here’s how. What Is Automated Video Creation? Automated video creation is the act of using video editing software to automatically create short, interesting videos you can use for marketing and promoting your content. Let’s say you recorded a podcast this week and released it to your audience. You received decent engagement, but you quickly noticed a problem. Many of your viewers aren’t watching the entire podcast. Some viewers love to sit and consume two hours of content at once. Others want minute-long highlight clips, and simply aren’t interested in long-form content. By identifying key moments and topics discussed in your podcast, you can create bite-sized clips and videos that are more digestible. Plus, having long-form content that’s well produced arms you with plenty of future clips to use. See How My Agency Can Drive More Traffic to Your Website SEO - unlock more SEO traffic.

Book a Call That’s where automated video creation comes in. Make no mistake, there’s a big difference between linking your podcast in your Instagram Bio and posting a 45-second highlight video with top-notch editing. If you’re making several pieces of long-form content every week (interviews, podcasts, etc.), sifting through hours of content to find highlights and memorable moments can quickly become time-consuming. By automating that process, you can regularly create custom, high-quality videos. As a result, you’ll add variety to your content, while being able to test unique marketing strategies quickly. For example, you can rapidly A/B test different format styles, or try two highlights against each other to see what resonates with your audience. 5 Tips for Automated Video Creation Before we dive into specific automated video creation tools, it’s important to understand how your automated video creation journey should unfold. Savvy marketers always develop a clear plan of attack for marketing initiatives, so we’re walking you through the general checkpoints of the automation process. 1. Determine Your Automated Video Creation Priorities Before you choose a platform, establish your video creation objectives. If you want to test a specific format, find platforms that support that testing. Beyond that, determine what features will serve your team best. If your marketing team has little to no experience with automated video creation, a tool that prioritizes ease of use can make the video creation process easier. Marketing teams with plenty of video creation experience might need automation tools that offer more customization. Are You Using Google Ads? Try Our FREE Ads Grader!

Get your free Analysis 2. Decide on a Platform As you narrow down your search, take a closer look at how each platform functions. Some platforms offer limited features aimed at supporting brands with little to no video marketing budget. Other platforms want to support your marketing efforts from start to finish. While many of these platforms sound similar, they focus on different elements that can elevate your content creation. 3. Upload Your Content So, you’ve established your video creation priorities, and you’ve chosen your platform. Now you can actually create your content. Upload your video and let the tool start to work its magic. If you’re focused on automating as much of the experience as possible, you won’t need to do much other than confirming certain edits. On the other hand, choosing a platform with plenty of depth means you’ll be able to customize your content fairly easily. 4. Choose Your Visual Elements When customizing your video content, visual elements like text animation effects can elevate the quality. Other effects like overlays and moving graphics can be implemented without much trouble, as long as you’re using the right automated video creation tool. Make sure your visual elements are consistent with your brand presentation. 5. Publish Your Content Once you’ve customized your content and created a high-quality video, it’s time to send your content live. With some tools, you’ll even be able to publish your content directly after editing. Instead of signing into each of your brand’s social media platforms, automation means you can post on all of them at the same time. 10 Tools for Automated Video Creation Now that you understand the process, it’s time to look at the automated video creation tools available. While many of these tools function similarly, they each have distinct features that make them unique. 1. Moovly Moovly prides itself on being a user-friendly, in-browser automated video creation tool. In addition, they offer a tool that doesn’t demand constant software updates or even any design skills. Looking for support with your footage-based videos? They can help. Want to experiment with cartoon or doodle styles? Moovly can create those videos, too. If you’re looking for a lightweight solution with plenty of customization options, Moovly might be the right tool for your brand. 2. Adobe Adobe’s priority when it comes to video creation is efficiency. Using AI technology, they save users time and effort when editing. Some of the more interesting features include auto reframing, where Adobe automatically reframes the subject of a video shot in widescreen when exporting to social platforms. Their AI also uses color match, changing your content’s color and light values, based on your customized reference point. To be clear, they aren’t just copying a specific color reference point onto your clips. Instead, the AI analyzes every selected clip and tweaks them until they properly match your reference point. 3. Wibbitz Wibbitz is an automated video creation tool that speeds up production by offering a variety of useful templates and one-click solutions. One feature marketers will appreciate is the easy customization options. Wibbitz provides users with access to logo watermarks, video intros and outros, text overlays, and a full-spectrum color palette. This automated video creation platform lets you maximize your reach by converting your best videos into impactful social media videos. 4. Kamua Another browser-based tool, Kamua claims their product will have you working nearly 90 percent faster, without any previous video editing experience. They also feature automatic captioning in over 60 languages, saving you from having to transcribe hours and hours of content. Kamua’s AutoCut feature actually automates video edits, by finding cut points in your content and letting you decide what to keep. Plus, their AutoCrop feature instantly turns your YouTube videos into TikTok videos. 5. Typito If you’re limited by a modest marketing budget, Typito could be a great automated video creation tool. Not only is it free to start with, but each of their pricing plans are designed with reasonable budgets in mind. Of course, it’s worth figuring out exactly what Typito is offering. They provide an easy drag and drop editor and a brand kit, along with 600,000 free images and over 500 free templates. 6. Rocketium Rocketium understands the digital media landscape is constantly shifting. That frequent change demands an approach to marketing that’s as flexible as it is accurate. That’s why Rocketium aims to accomplish two goals. Eliminating repetitive creative work is their first goal, saving brands the hassle of creating completely new content for new campaigns. From there, Rocketium aims to make targeted marketing even easier. They use an AI copywriter to help you craft the right visual for different products and unique target audiences. Teams with demanding content calendars should take a look at this tool. 7. Animaker Developing unique creative content within an automation tool might not sound optimal, but tools like Animaker prove it’s certainly within their power. Armed with their templates, you can make a video in five minutes, according to their official website. 8. OFFEO OFFEO’s appeal can be broken down into four subsections. Their near limitless supply of assets means that users will have access to hundreds of templates. Being easy to use and browser based, OFFEO lets you animate your content, leveraging the skill of their professional designers to provide you with high-quality animation. 9. Magisto As an end-to-end video marketing tool, Magisto aims to support users at every stage of the marketing process. When it comes to creation, you can expect the support of a computerized video editor. Magisto lets you host and distribute video content on your website using their native player. Take those optimized videos and then use engagement analytics to gain clarity about your marketing initiatives. 10. InVideo For the truly budget-conscious, InVideo offers some fantastic automated video creation support, absolutely free. While there are certain features locked behind paid subscriptions, there are plenty of tools available to users on the free plan. You can export 60 videos per month, with a maximum duration of 15 minutes. Transcription is automatic, as well as over 4,500 handcrafted templates. You’ll even have access to branding presets, intros, outros, and team sharing. If you’re on the fence about automated video creation tools, feel free to try InVideo out and see how it improves your marketing efforts. Automated Video Creation FAQs Can you automate video editing? Absolutely, you can! With the help of AI, you can begin automating your video editing, as much or as little as you’d like. How can I add subtitles to a video automatically? There are plenty of tools that can do this for you, some offering support in over 60 languages. Do I need video editing experience? While it’s certainly a positive, there are several user-friendly platforms that don’t require any previous editing or design experience. Do I have to pay for an automated video creation tool? Not always! Some tools are completely free; the only drawback is they lack some key features. Automated Video Creation Conclusion No matter what industry you’re in, there’s no getting around the fact that audiences want quality content. If your brand doesn’t produce something new and exciting on a regular basis, you run the risk of losing your audience’s attention. Instead of trying to constantly reinvent the wheel, consider using an automated video creation platform to break in-depth content down into digestible clips and share them on social media. It might seem like a simple solution, but it’s a powerful way to offer more consistent content, expand your reach, and potentially create a genuine moment of engagement with your audience.

Discover the best AI apps and tools for YouTube, learn how AI can help you save time, and see how easy it can be to make money online by leveraging technology. Whether you're just starting a YouTube channel or looking to boost views, this strategy will show you how to make video creation easier, monetize effectively, and unlock growth potential with the latest in generative AI. 9 comments AI on YouTube now is so much more than you think it's become a game changer for some creators building their entire workflow surround it and today I'm going to break down how we use AI in my YouTube agency and how it's helping us pamp out videos that get millions of views let's start with research on YouTube research is everything it's the first step like before anything else happens and this is where most creators keep things Hush Hush acting like it's a big secret but all they really do is look up a few similar videos and copy what's working in my team we've got a better system we use two AI tools for coming up with video ideas the first one is called No GPT this tool is a beast it doesn't take away the need to check out other videos but it makes the process way faster instead of sitting through entire videos at to X speed I just drop the link into now GPT and get a summary that summary is pure go gives us ideas that lead to titles and thumbnails but to get those ideas you first need to understand how others are tackling the same topic if we a great idea we dig deeper using the AI chat feature we ask followup questions to see what gaps there are and how our content can go above and beyond honestly the summary feature and the AI chat are the real MVPs here they're the only things we really use on no GPT the transcription feature doesn't really save us much time but it will be important later another tool we lean on is chat gbt of course but not just in the usual way most people use it to brainstorm ideas right also use it to dig deep into competitor and analysis after wrapping up research with no GPT we take those transcripts and upload them to Chad GPT we ask it to look for patterns and structure storytelling Hooks and the kind of info they're dropping aren't with this we can ask Chad GPT to highlight areas where we could amp up our videos for more engagement depending on what the analysis shows it might suggest making the video longer to cover missed points or it will Flack errors and proofread content bottom line after this process we have a clear road map for improvement for example Chad GPT helped us nail the perfect length and structure for cooking videos on the healthy and fast Channel and that's just one of many channels we manage now some of you might be thinking why not just do this all manually well human creativity is awesome but it has its limits it's easy to get stuck in your own ideas with chat GPT you can always start fresh just opening new chat droping new prompt and boom an endless stream of ideas you just need to sift through them take thumbnails for instance we design all our thumbnail Nails manually but during research we also upload competitors thumbnails into Chad gbt we ask it to pick out patterns and elements that make people click and let me tell you some of the suggestions are quite inventive stuff we wouldn't have thought of but they work we saw that with our Chad gbt guide video sure the thumbnail and title might look like everyone else's but the tiny tweaks Chad gbt suggested helped us catch way more attention and the script refined kept people hooked for way Longer Now video production pipeline is complete without script and right by this point we've already locked in the overall idea and the key info we want to include so typically we've got everything jotted down somewhere either in a document or directly in a Chad GPT Chad from there we use a set of refined prompts to generate the scripts we need our prompt system is built around four types of scripts script plans false scripts scripts for shorts and sales Focus scripts each type has its own set of prompts designed for specific scenarios for example with FSE scripts we've set up three main scenarios scenario one is based on audio messages a lot of our best ideas pop up during meetings and calls so we transcribe those and feed them into Chad GPT to generate scripts scenario two is built around the hero's journey idea we've got template for this where we paste it into Chad gbt type in the channel specific details and let it do the magic the third scenario uses pre-existing written content like an article we've got two options here either we blend this info into an existing script or transform the article itself into a script each promt has been designed and fine-tuned to give us solid results they are not perfect and we know that AI is great but can fully replace the human touch so after Chad gbt finishes up one of our script writers and editors jumps into proof fre tweak phrasing and give it a light polish but honestly at that point it's just Minor Adjustments when you think about how much time this whole process saves those small touchups are a breeze the key thing to understand here is that Chad gbt isn't wri in scripts from scratch it's a toll that works under the guidance of professionals if something it generates isn't up to par we rewrite correct and fine-tune until it's perfect sometimes scripts are entirely human written and AI just steps in for polishing making them smoother and easier to narrate so what you're hearing is still very much hum driven but enhanced with a bit of AI Magic once the script is ready and the story is said we move on to thumbnails and AI plays a big role here too remember how we use Chad gbt to analyze thumbnails earlier all that analysis gets input back into Chad gbt to generate rough draft of our thumbnail we have a detailed drum system for this where we describe the thumbnail step by step the AI generated thumbnail gives us a blueprint which then goes to human designer who brings it to life but even our designers get an AI boost we often need fresh bag grounds for thumbnails and instead of sourcing them manually we generate them using Crea Ai and designers sketch the basic layout with brushes and AI fills in the details the results are pretty solid especially after some color grading and a touch of blur another essential tool in our Arsenal is an upscaler like Remy or magnific our designers have the freedom to choose but the idea is simple sometimes there is no time for high quality Stills so we have to work with screenshots from videos and even if the video isn't 4K the quality can be roof for thumbnails the same goes for Logos or background elements that need a quality bump that's where upscaler like reminy and magnific come in magnific is especially great for upscaling images of people keeping all the facial details intact while Remy works best for Logos and nonhuman elements we don't just use this approach on my personal Channel or the AI Master Channel we apply this same streamline process to every channel that decides to work with my agency and I'm super proud of the results we're delivering we've been building this YouTube Agency for years now and we've partnered with some of the biggest names on the platform take M Vlog for instance one of the top channels about video editing or Flor on ham a massive investment Channel with a super charismatic host we've helped so many creators maximize their potential grow their audiences and boost their revenue because monetization isn't the only way to make money on YouTube you can sell merch Services courses there's a whole world of possibilities but to sell a effectively you need a channel that's not just entertaining but also strategically managed to drive sales that's where we come in if you're curious check the link in the description for a quick questionnaire fill it out get in touch and we'll show you just how high your channel can go when it comes to sound we keep it pretty simple most voiceovers are done by real people because there is just no replacing genuine Human Performance but we do use AI for some parts specifically 11 labs this tool is incredible for cloning voices and generating speech with high quality results but we only use it in specific cases for example if we know it as an issue like a Clen sound or siren during editing and can re-record will just generate that sentence with AI and swap it in another time we use it is for quotes any quote always sounds better when it's read by someone other than the host it gives the video a more Dynamic feel get the idea video editing is still very much a Hands-On process AIS roll here is mostly for automating smaller tasks like generating subtitles for shorts Cap Cod is our go-to for that and when it comes to Bolls yeah we could just use stock footage but people are so familiar with those clips now that they just kill retention so instead we generate AI videos using tools like runwayml or hyper even if these AI generated B- rolls come out looking a little quirky they are way more engaging than the same old stug stuff you can even fly it off as a fun element and it works to take things up a notch we sometimes create our own background music and sound effects using fil MOA I actually made a whole video on this where I break down how you can do the same so here's the takeaway AI isn't a toy it's a tool and if you know how to use it you've got the edge as creators we shouldn't be afraid of AI replacing us what we should be worried about is getting left behind while everyone else is leveling up their content with ai ai makes us faster more efficient and the content becomes better more engaging and feels way more more organic and yeah it helps channels grow faster and make more money no doubt about that so if you've been on the fense about AI it's time to start using it to build your channel and hey if you want to go all in our team can help you out the link to the questionnaire is in the description thanks for watching and I'll catch you in the next one",

In this post, you'll learn what video automation is and how to automate video creation using a spreadsheet, a no-code platform (like Zapier), and an API. You couldn't have missed it: videos have been the most popular form of online content for years now, and there's no sign of this trend slowing down. Video is everywhere, especially on social media and in marketing campaigns. Think about YouTube Shorts, TikTok videos, and Instagram Reels on the one hand, and personalized videos for your customers on the other. As the demand for video content continues to grow, you're likely searching for an efficient way to create these videos. If that's the case, you've come to the right place. In this post, I'll introduce you to a novel approach to creating videos at scale: using video automation software. Whether you need 10, 100, or even thousands of videos, with a video automation platform like Creatomate, you can automatically generate all of them in no time. While this might seem a bit technical, don't worry, there are also video automation methods that don't require any technical skills at all. 01Spring SaleImage 1#4980f102Summer SaleImage 2#4980f103Autumn SaleImage 3#4980f1…………99Holiday SaleImage 99#4980f1 99 videos generated We'll start this post with a brief introduction to what video automation is and how it works. Once you've grasped the concept, we'll delve into three methods for automating video creation: Using a simple spreadsheet Using a no-code automation platform like Zapier, Make, or Pabbly Using code Let's dive in. What is video automation? Video automation is the process of using software to generate video content automatically. It differs from the traditional method of creating videos, which involves lots of manual and repetitive tasks. With video automation, all you need is a reusable video design and dynamic data, which can be presented through a spreadsheet, no-code tool, or via code. Almost any type of video can be created automatically, as long as the design fits within a reusable template. Video automation is commonly used for creating content for social media, personalization, and other types of marketing campaigns. That's because these kinds of videos often follow a consistent design but only differ in content, making them ideal for automation. In addition to a template, you'll also need to provide content for the videos. This could include media like video clips, images, and audio files, as well as text, colors, and more. Chances are, you already have much of this data — think product catalogs, customer information, or items from an RSS feed. And now that generative AI has greatly improved, it's no longer just for experiments; it can actually help you create content for your videos as well. For instance, ChatGPT can write a storyboard based on your video topic and an image generator like DALL·E can create background visuals. For voiceovers, you can use a text-to-speech tool like ElevenLabs, and Creatomate's auto-transcription service can add animated subtitles to your videos. Let me give you an example. Imagine a real estate company wanting to showcase their listings on social media, of course, through videos. With each property having its own price, photos, and details, making all the videos by hand would take a lot of time. However, with video automation software, you create a video design once and input information about each property using one of the three methods. As a result, a unique video will be generated for each listing: Now, let's see how this works. The video automation process starts with a template, serving as the blueprint for all videos. Within this template, you can specify which elements you wish to change in each video. This could include text, images, video clips, audio, colors, and more. Creatomate comes with an online template editor, allowing you to create designs for any type of video you want to automate. It supports text animations, emojis, custom fonts, keyframes, compositions, and much more. We won't go into details here, but if you're curious about how the editor works, check out this quick guide. Once you have a template in place, it's time to automatically generate your videos. Let's find out how to do this. How to automate video creation? There are three ways to automate video creation: using a spreadsheet, a no-code platform, and via code. Each method has its own strengths and is best suited to specific use cases. Additionally, there's a difference in the level of technical expertise required, ranging from zero technical skills to familiarity with APIs and programming languages. Below, we'll explore each method in more detail, and I'll point you to related tutorials to help you get started. 1. Using a spreadsheet Creatomate comes with a built-in spreadsheet feature specifically designed for creating videos in bulk. You can use the spreadsheet to input content for your videos, such as text captions, images, and more. This method doesn't require any technical skills, making it the easiest and most accessible way to automate video creation. Check out our 8-minute tutorial to get started right away. Video automation with a spreadsheet is perfect for creating large batches of videos at once, especially when you need to produce a lot of content in a short time. For example, it's ideal for planning an entire month of social media videos in advance or preparing a cold outreach campaign with personalized videos for each prospect. You can manually enter the video content, or if you already have a document, such as a Google Sheets file or one created by ChatGPT, you can easily import it into the spreadsheet. With just the push of a button, all your videos will be generated. Once the batch is ready, you can download the videos and use them as needed.

Using no-code tools Unlike the spreadsheet approach, a no-code automation platform like Zapier, Make, or Pabbly enables you to build a fully automated video creation workflow. Setting up an automation is as simple as connecting multiple apps via a user-friendly interface, so you don't need coding skills for this method. Once a workflow is set up, videos are generated automatically, eliminating the need for any human effort. Not only can you automate video creation, but these platforms can also handle additional tasks for you, such as posting on social media, sharing via email, or uploading to your cloud storage. Check out this 7-minute tutorial to get started right away. Every workflow starts with a trigger, which is a specific event that initiates the automation. This could be actions like publishing a new blog post or article, adding data to your Google Sheet or Airtable document, or even setting it to occur at specific times each day. This dynamic data is then mapped to your template, allowing Creatomate to automatically generate a video for you. All three automation platforms support thousands of integrations, allowing you to build video generation workflows that suit your specific needs while using the apps you're already familiar with. If you're new to this, we recommend starting with Zapier, as it's the easiest platform to use. However, if you've used automation tools before or need more advanced options, Make.com might be the better choice for you. No-code tutorials:We've written a series of step-by-step tutorials that cover practical use cases. You can apply them in full, or use them as a starting point to set up your own custom workflows. Below, you'll find a selection of the most popular ones: 👉 How to Auto-Generate Instagram Posts 👉 How to Automate YouTube Shorts with AI-Generated Videos 👉 TikTok Automation: How to Create TikTok Videos using AI 👉 How to Automatically Convert Text to Video using AI 👉 Auto-Create and Schedule Social Media Posts with Google Sheets 👉 How to Automatically Turn Blogs and Articles into Videos 👉 Auto-Generate Videos & Images in Multiple Languages 3. Using code The API provides the most flexibility for automatically generating videos. Developers and those familiar with programming can seamlessly integrate video generation into their software, applications, and scripts. Creatomate's REST API is accessible through languages like JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Python, and more. Check out this quick guide to get started with the API. Generating videos using the API is as straightforward as sending a single POST request. Within this request, you provide the template ID along with the text, images, and other dynamic content you wish to insert. In return, you'll receive a URL where you can find the generated video. In addition to the two automation methods mentioned previously, where a template serves as the video design, you can also create videos from scratch. Using a simple JSON format that describes the entire video from beginning to end, you can compose videos entirely through code. This approach offers even more flexibility and control over the video creation process. For more information on JSON to video, visit the knowledge base or explore over 50 code examples on GitHub.

You've also learned about three different methods of automatically generating videos. Which automation method is best for you depends on your specific use case. Here's a quick recap: Video automation using a spreadsheet: It's best for bulk video creation. You don't need any technical skills for this. Video automation using a no-code platform: It's best if you want to create videos on autopilot. It doesn't require coding skills, however, some technical know-how might be helpful. Video automation using code: This is the most flexible way to create any kind of dynamic video, but it does require some familiarity with APIs and programming languages. To help you get started, we've created a series of video automation tutorials with step-by-step instructions. You can find them on our blog page. And if you have any questions, check out the FAQ section below, or send us an email at support@creatomate.com. Happy automating! Video Automation FAQs How does video automation work? The process is simple. First, you create a template in the online editor, which serves as the foundation for all your videos. Next, you set up a workflow to automatically replace text, images, and other content. This can be done using a video generation spreadsheet, a no-code platform like Zapier or Make, or by using a programming language. What are the benefits of video automation? The biggest advantage of video automation is greater efficiency. By letting software handle repetitive video creation tasks, you can save a significant amount of time, making it a cost-effective solution. What's the best video automation software? There are several video automation tools available on the market, each with its own unique features. For example, Plainly works with After Effects, while Shotstack is better suited for developers than for no-code users. However, we believe Creatomate stands out as the best overall option for automating videos. This is because of its versatile template system, three different automation methods, and its vast collection of step-by-step tutorials. Moreover, Creatomate offers key features for video automation, such as auto-sizing text and the capability to adjust the length of each generated video based on dynamic content, like AI voiceovers. That said, our opinion may be biased, so we recommend trying out each tool to see which one best fits your needs. Can I automate videos using generative AI? Absolutely! Video automation is powerful on its own, but combining it with AI tools opens up even more possibilities. One exciting use case is auto-generating faceless shorts for platforms like YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram. Once the workflow is set up, all you need to do is provide a topic, and Creatomate, along with AI tools, will handle the rest. For instance, ChatGPT can generate a complete video script based on your topic, including prompts for background images, which are then created by DALL·E. A text-to-speech tool like ElevenLabs produces AI voiceovers, while Creatomate adds animated subtitles using its auto-transcription feature. Best of all, this process works seamlessly with all three automation methods. Check out our tutorials for step-by-step instructions. Do I need video editing experience? No, you don't need any video editing or design experience. You can simply select a ready-made video template from our gallery. However, if you'd like to create your own designs, you'll have to familiarize yourself with the editor. Alternatively, you can hand over template creation to a designer on your team or hire a freelancer. How do I get started with video automation? Sign up for a free trial with Creatomate. You can automate your first videos within minutes by following one of our step-by-step tutorials, which cover both the spreadsheet method, no-code automation platforms, and the API. How much does video automation cost? Video automation is a cost-effective alternative to traditional manual video creation. For just $49, you'll receive 2,000 credits — enough to generate over 550 videos at 720p, 25fps, and 15 seconds in length. The exact credit cost per video depends on specific factors, and a detailed calculation formula is available in the documentation. If you need more credits, you can always upgrade to a higher plan, which offers even better value.

automation tutorial for beginners where I will show exactly how we grow channels from zero to over $10,000 a month without making videos and without recording anything with a camera I will show you everything from the best niches finding viral video ideas and even how to get instantly monetized in case you don't know who I am my name is Dave Nick and here are some of the results that I was able to get with YouTube automation so that you know that I know what I'm talking about here so one of the channels that run made over $199,000 not Revenue we stopped posting I also have this one with over 100 million views but unfortunately it wasn't monetized so $0 in that Revenue but this one did about $3,000 in ad Revenue so far this one is doing about $115,000 a month from ad Revenue this one did about $40 million views but $0 in ad Revenue even though it was doing like millions of views a day but I wasn't monetized and this one is doing about $1,000 a month but I haven't posted in a while and this one is doing about $300 a month from out revenue and I'm not really posting much $41,000 in the last year and over a million in total overall and this channel is doing about $4,000 a month just from out revenue and the lifetime of this one is $317,000 just from that Revenue this one is doing about 100 bucks a month and the lifetime of this one is $92,000 and this one is doing about $111,000 a month also just from ad revenue and the lifetime of this one is $697,000 again just from ad Revenue alone to make things easier for you have built this starter blueprint document that we will be foll and you can follow along during this tutorial as I will be completing each and every step live on the screen so you can see me building a YouTube automation Channel each time we complete a step you can just click on the box and we finish the step number one we continue with the step two and so on and so forth this is also going to contain really useful resources like example channels tools that I use and everything that I mentioned in this tutorial so I'm going to link it for completely free in the description box down below so the first step is actually choosing a high CPM Niche now to understand why you need a High CPM Niche you need to understand what is actually a CPM so CPM is cost per Mill or a metric that represents the cost in advertisers spend to put ads in front of your videos and a revenue per meal or RPM is how much you are being paid per 1,000 views and that's going to vary depending on the niche that you choose so if you choose a low CPM Niche for example funny cat videos that are mostly going to be watched by people that are just laying on their couch or by kids then advertisers are not really going to spend a lot of money while if you make tax videos or Finance videos or health Fitness or business or real estate videos those are most likely going to be watched with people that have higher buying power and so advertisers will spend more money and here I actually have a list of over a thousand different faceless YouTube automation channels in all sorts of different niches and it's available in this document so you can just open it up by going over to the first step you can click on the list and then you can open as many of these channels as you want and if you select a niche you can see for example the space Niche we have the NBA Niche we have Mysteries Niche like whatever Niche you choose you can just find example channels that are already successful and already making money so you can try and replicate what they're doing so let's open up this channel for example this is a completely faceless Channel and we can also check the statistics of this one to check the statistics what I do is I just copy their username which is this handle over here then I simply go over to a tool called view stats this is a completely free tool that was built by the biggest Creator Mr Beast so if I just open up this channel it's going to show me that they're approximately doing anywhere from 9,000 to 24,000 a month and I can see exactly what are their latest videos how those videos are performing and I can even find similar channels I also recently made a list of the highest paying 16 YouTube automation niches and they're all in this particular blog post which again I'm also Link in the documents so you can just click on the list of the best 16 niches and you can choose the one that you like let's say for example I'm going to choose the niche of healthy habits and productivity and this is an example Channel over here that is getting hundreds of thousands of views so what I'm going to do then is I'm going to open up this document which is going to allow you to create an avatar because by having an avatar for your audience it's going to be a lot easier to create content that actually appeals to them so more of them will watch and more of them will buy the products that you have so what I recommend you do right now is open up this file click on file then simply click on make a copy and just double this document so you can make some changes to it and that's actually going to give you a really good exercise to follow you really want to think about your target audience what is their age what is their gender who are you really trying to Target and specifically think about them then you can find similar YouTube channels within that Niche if I want to find similar channels to this one over here all I got to do is copy its handle go to view stats paste the link and then simply just click on similar channels and that's going to give me similar channels in this s Niche and then I can just start putting them in this document so whenever I want to create a new video I can always come back to this and I can see exactly who I'm trying to Target besides that there's also another tool that I found that I've been using to find viral niches on YouTube and discovered new channels that are trending right now and it's called Next Lev so basically all you got to do is just sign up to it but just bear in mind that I believe that this is not free so if you're just starting out then you can really skip this step but if you're more advanced then you can try it out but basically you just select the AI Niche Finder on the left- hand side and what I do is I just select the channels that have started out recently so I'm filtering by days since start and we can see that this channel started out 12 days ago and they already have 12,000 subscribers or this one over here they start 19 days ago only have nine videos and 4,000 subscribers so I really want to see like what is this channel actually doing to achieve these results and most of these are completely faceless so you can just open up and you can see exactly what kind of content they're posting and you can even find the ones that are in your Niche and you can see exactly what they did like for example Des only has six videos they started about month and a half ago and they are already getting about 74,000 views per video so their very first upload has 300,000 views that's absolutely crazy so yeah this really helps you find those new trending and like unicorn niches and unicorn channels that are already performing well so you can see exactly what they're actually doing all right so we have completed the step number one which is doing the research and coming up with the right Niche which is probably one of the most important steps because anything else that we do from this point is going to be based on the first step once we have the first step completed the step number two is to choose a channel name for this you can simply open up jet gp.com you can then copy this prompt that I left and just make sure to not collect a quote as well and then go back and then just insert your Niche here the one that you've selected previously now my Niche is going to be healthy habits and productivity for Content creators and I'm just looking for a very short YouTube title and YouTube YouTube name to stand out now it's going to give me these different ideas if I don't like something what I will just do is I will just sell it do 10 more and then hopefully we're going to get something that we actually like let's say for example I really like the fitf flow channel name all I got to do is now copy this and we have the step number two complete this step number three is to create a Gmail account so you're going to go to gmail.com you're going to click on create account and click for my personal use then I'm just going to paste the name and then I'm going to click on next I'm going to create my own Gmail and once you have that just take the box and step number three is done now an optional step but a very important one is that understanding that in order to actually earn money from ad Revenue like all of the channels that I ran that were actually monetized were able to earn money from ad revenue and are still making money from ad Revenue because my channel was approved in the YouTube's part partner program now the requirements for YouTube Partner program are 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time if you want to monetize long form videos with ads and for some people that can take 6 to 12 months so now you can actually get instantly monetized at dfy dave.com monetization so you don't have to wait and it's also going to be linked in the document but step number four is going to be to actually create the YouTube channel to create a YouTube channel you're just going to head over to YouTube You're Going to log into your Gmail account and then simply click on create a channel now I really recommend you adjust the handle and let's see if this one is available and if it is I'm going to continue with it if it's not I'm just going to add something generic and then I'm going to click on create a channel we have the step number four completed so the step number five is to create channel branding for this you can either use some AI tool like Leonardo AI you can just sign up to it for completely free and you can just enter a prompt so basically just go to image generation here on the left hand sign people are already generating logos and profile pictures but you just have to describe exactly what the photo should be about and an easier option would be to use photopia this is like a Photoshop alternative but it's completely free and the other one would also be to just go to cana.com and just search for logo designs or YouTube profile pictures and that's going to give you all sorts of different templates to choose from and then once you find the one that you like you just click on it and then you can easily customize the template and it's pretty easy to create this now I mostly use photopia for this and in fact in this document I also left the templates that you could just download for free so you basically just open this up you click on the download button you can click on file click open and then simply select that PSD file and then you can just customize this template that I made so I'm just going to add the first two letters of my channel name which is fitf flow so FF I could also change the colors and if you want to change the colors and branding all you got to do is just double click on this layer then click on gradient overlay click on this text then double click here and then if you want to change this to let's say pink make sure that this one on the left is slightly darker so I'm just going to keep it like this I'm going to double click here and then I'm going to select something lighter and here's how that's going to look like also drop shadow should also be changed to the same color so something like this and if you click okay this is how it's going to look like now I personally prefer the last color so I'm just going to download it like this click on file click on export ad click on PNG and just download this to your device now you can do the same thing with Banner so you can just click on this click on the download file go back to photopia click on open open the YouTube Banner PSD and this is how it's going to look like I also put the safe Zone area just so you know where you could edit because if you edit outside of this area then it's not going to show on your YouTube channel if you want to remove this just press on this button over here and it's not going to show anymore but if you want to change the headline you can just click on text and then just change the text and I also want to change the sub headline so I'm going to ask chat GPT to write 10 very very short slogans that I could potentially use so let's say I really like this one I'm just going to copy that then I'm going to go back to photopia then I'm going to click on sub headline and then I'm going to double click on this text and I'm just going to paste it now all I got to do is click on file click on export as and Export as a PNG file now as you go back to your YouTube channel you're going to click on customize this channel you're going to go to your YouTube Studio you're going to go to branding click on upload you're now going to upload this profile picture just click on done and then also upload the banner image once you're done with that as well you're just going to click on publish now keep in mind that your name your logo your banner are not as important as the actual content that you are creating because that's going to be the part that's going to be getting views getting you brand deals and making you money step number five completed step number six is to now optimize your YouTube channel for this I mostly use a tool called vid IQ I mostly use it to do research and to kind of spy on my competitors as well and also has AI coaches and all sorts of different things so I'm just going to go back to my YouTube channel I'm going to click on customize Channel then I'm simply going to go back to basic info and then I'm going to write a brief description full of keywords for this you can simply use the promt that also left in the document which you can just paste into chat GPT just change the niche name and paste that right here then just copy the channel description go back paste that right over here and just click on publish besides that one of the settings that you can change is if you go to the settings here and then you go to upload defaults I always recommend selecting the visibility to unlist it so that every single time that you upload a video it's going to be set to unlist it then just click save once you're done I also highly recommend that you take your Gmail or your email address that you previously made and just paste it over here so that potential brand deals and potential sponsors can reach out so just publish that step number six is now completed step number seven is to find your first viral video idea now to never run out of video ideas I have my content bucket here I'm also going to link this in this document so you can just open it up for yourself and you can also make a copy right over here so basically just click on these three dots and then you can just copy or duplicate this to your own notion account so you can just write and make changes but basically you're going to have these content buckets which are Discovery community and sales videos Discovery videos are there to just get your channel discovered and grow your overall audience those are the videos where you're not selling anything you're providing as much value and you're not inviting anyone to click any links in the description Community videos are those that are going to help you build your core audience think of q&as think of personal stories anything that is specifically for core audience and then lastly we're going to do a sales video and you're going to do these in cycles and then in terms of video Styles you can just go through these whenever you have a video idea you can think all right I'm making productivity videos now I'm going to make a video about top seven productivity apps then I can do I spent $1,000 on a productivity course here's what I've learned then if you're doing a tutorial then here's how to be productive or whatever it's a tutorial and listicles top seven productivity tips for beginners then you can do a testimonial here's how my client or my customer went from X to zed and that way you're never going to run out of video ideas but now to find specific video ideas that are performing well I just open up channels in my Niche that's why we previously made an avatar and that's why I told you to create a list of channels that are in your Niche and that are already getting results then you're going to go through their relatest 30 videos and if you have viq installed you're going to see the outlier score that's this thing right over here which shows you if the channel is getting more views than usual for example this one is getting three times more views like this specific video is getting three times more views than others but then there's also this one which got six times more views than others so you want to look into these videos you want to see exactly what they're talking about and you actually don't want to reinvent the wheel you just want to copy what they've done you want to copy the idea and sometimes even the concept of the actual video and the title and thumbnail and just make it better that's one of the ways the second way that I find viral video ideas is by going to Reddit and then I join a bunch of these subreddits and then I see exactly what people are discussing there by filtering by top and then you can also filter by what is actually trending this month and then you're going to see exactly what people are interested in or what people discussing because there it has like the most upvotes so you can turn those into videos if it makes sense for you and your Niche also you can find video ideas by going over to viq itself you log into your account you can go to the keywords section on the Le hand side and then you can just start researching different keywords it's going to recommend different ones depending on your channel but if you got an idea let's say for example I have the Tik Tok creativity program idea in mind I can see the search volume is very high the competition is very low this is a great video to make I could also click on questions and it's going to show me what people are asking for when it comes to this particular keyword if I go back to this Channel and I find some viral idea so for example if I search for leadership advice because I saw that that's the topic that this guy has discussed we can see that the keyword for this is not really good the medium search volume and the competition very high means that I shouldn't probably cover this specific keyword besides that vdq also does give you daily ideas but I never really found them useful maybe for some of your channels it would work but for me as giving some ideas and view predictions that they don't really think are true but sometimes it could be useful they also have a coach that is kind of like an AI coach which you can ask to do different things for you including to write a YouTube script so I could also ask you to write a script or come up with a video idea but again it's not actually going to be as high quality as if you do it in a way that I will show you in the step-by-step tutorial but it is cool that they have it inside of this tool as well besides that I also sometimes find video ideas by reading books and just listening to audio books as well like for example this is one of the tools that I've used is called blanket but basically they have summaries that are like 15 to 17 minutes long and then you just listen to these short books in like 10 or twox and that way it's like 5 to 10 minutes long and you can kind of get an idea or like turn these short books into actual videos now because your first video is also very important it's not going to be the best let's be honest like you're just doing this for the first time but because it's very important and it can potentially change everything there were channels that got incredible results for just the first video as you previously saw in the intro of this video I made this checklist that I go through to make sure that my videos actually have high potential of getting as many views as possible so I recommend you just s every single box before publishing the video so you're going to think about is this idea aligned with your target audience the Avatar that you made using that first document that I shared in this tutorial is this idea intriguing is this idea Mass Appeal and you're going to go through the script was the hook actually interesting and the hook is something that we're going to discuss in a second and then editing and all sorts of different things so this is going to be a checklist that could be very very useful to you before you finish coming up with a video idea now that the step number seven is finished we're going to take that box and we're going to go to step number eight which is to write your script now when it comes to your YouTube scripts you never want to start your videos with welcome to my channel this channel talks about XY Z because people are not interested in that they clicked on your video because they saw a compelling title and a thumbnail they're interested in something and if you start yapping about something that they're not really interested in they are going to click off so you want to make sure that those first 15 seconds have a very strong hook just imagine someone is scrolling their phone and they see your video they click on and there's like a boring one minute introduction they don't care you're wasting their time so in the first few seconds you want to give them multiple reasons to stay and watch the entire video so the here's an example document with a bunch of different cooks that you just use these are the ones that I've also used and basically if you start off with these sentences instead of Welcome to My Channel or whatever it's going to perform way better you're going to have higher watch time which is extremely important then you're going to have a short intro and then you're going to provide value and you're never going to Signal the end because watch time the view session as well is extremely important the longer can someone watch your videos the more YouTube will promote it to a wider audience because if you think about it YouTube is competing with other platforms they're competing with Tik Tok Netflix and so on and so forth so the longer you can keep someone on the platform the more YouTube will reward you for that now let me be honest with you YouTube scripts are extremely important it's the foundation of your YouTube YouTube video and I know that there are now all of these AI tools like C GPT where you could potentially generate the script but just bear in mind that it's not going to be as high quality as if you actually sat down and wrote it down yourself or if you simply just hired a script writer for5 to $15 per YouTube script they will do a way better job and that will actually be way more worth it but if you really don't want to spend any money here's an alternative way to do it for free so here's basically a prompt that you can copy and customize just change the variables in the brackets and then just go to chat GPT then just replace this and let's say this is what my video is going to be about I also want to explain that it will start writing the script but then it should ask me if I want it to continue or not so we're going to start off with this so it's going to start writing the script so now I'm basically just going to be talking with trpt back and forth I'm feel it actually creates a good video script and as you can see it's star softw welcome back to the channel everyone and today's video no one really cares about it imagine if I spend the first 5 minutes of this video telling you welcome to my channel on this channel I help people build an online business for free and do YouTube animation you wouldn't care about that so I had to have a strong hook in order for you to actually stay and keep watching this tutorial as you are but some parts of the script can still be used but you do have to make some changes to it now once you write the YouTube script the next step is creating a voice over now about a year ago I was spending over $1,000 per channel for voiceover artists because they had to pay actual humans and fiber and upwork but now we have really high quality AI tools that can do this almost instantly so this is one of the tools that I've used if I find some better ones and all of the tools that I mentioned in this tutor if we find any better Alternatives if some other ones come up in the market I will just change the links to them but as of right now this is the best one and this is the one that we use across different channels so basically as you create an account you can just go back you can start copy pasting parts of your script let's say I want start off from here all you got to do is copy let's say just the first sentence just to show you an example but you will copy like paragraph by paragraph you can select the voice here you can change the settings let's say for instance I really don't like this one and I want to change it to something that's going to be more like social media type of voice then I'm going to click on generate speech if it makes sense for my Niche and then I can just listen to the voice over and if it's actually good then I can just continue with it and I can just download a voice over to my computer now the very first one that you select might not be the best might sound a little bit robotic so make sure to just change and just choose the ones that you believe sound a lot better and that would actually make sense for your channel voiceover is extremely important and once you choose the one that you really really like I highly recommend sticking to it because it's going to allow you to build a brand and build something that people can recognize rather than changing a voiceover for every video step number nine completed now the step number 10 is video editing now before we start editing videos we need some visuals to show on the screen one of the options to find stock footage for extremely cheap is this platform called story blocks you see when you create an account on story blocks you can just select video and then if you need something for example I'm going to search for habits then I can just find a lot of different videos that I could just download with one press of a button if I want to download this video all I got to do is press download then select MP4 and just download it to my computer now just bear in mind that even though this is very very affordable and very high quality platform I've seen a few complaints even though I never had problems with this platform I really like it I've been using it for years but one of my friends who's doing over $100,000 from Just One of the channels that he started like 6 weeks ago already doing $100,000 a month he's been complaining quite a lot about this platform about story blocks and I've seen other creators like internet Anarchist and other ones also complaining about it so it seems like some people are not really satisfied with it so I just want to give you a heads up so the other alternative that they proposed was this hyper AI where you can basically generate stock footage yourself but just describing what you want to generate so if if I need for example healthy habits and I want to type in ultra realistic then I can just click create and it's going to generate that video it's going to take about a minute for it to finish which kind of sucks because it really slows down the process but it should be better and more original now if you want to edit videos yourself which means you're just doing faceless YouTube Automation and not really just YouTube automation then you can also just go to cap cut which is a free video editing software you're going to start a project from scratch and then on the left side you're going to upload all of the files that you need once once you upload the files you can just drag and drop them to the timeline and you can start editing you can also add different transitions right over here so basically you can just drag and drop that right away to the tag line and you can also generate captions if you click on auto captions right over here so they're going to show on the screen and you can easily customize it so for this I would also need to upload the voice over that I got from 11 labs and to generate the captions again I'm just going to go captions I'm going to go to autoc captions and click generate now that's going to take less than 60 seconds and now they're going to show up like this but put him in the center I would then click on animation and then I going just select the one that I mostly use which is this spring one then I'm going to select the Opera case I'm also going to make this slightly bigger so for example 15 I'm also going to make it bold and then I'm also going to add some Shadow perhaps and besides Shadow I also prefer to add some stroke so that the text actually stands out and I could potentially change the font so this is how that's going to look like let's watch it for a second and it starts doing these things I also highly recommend that the footage is changing every 3 seconds especially at the beginning of your video because again people get bored really really fast and if you're too slow with your video editing they going to leave which is going to cut your watch time and you're not going to make as much money as you wish to make so I'm going to make this very very fast and very very engaging and in between these I could also add some transitions again I could just select one of these let's say for instance this one if it fits properly I'm not a professional video editor because we usually for my channels higher video editors so for now I'm just going to click on export and now I can just export this and download to my computer now for video editors you could potentially go to platforms like YT jobs.co and you can just hire someone to edit your videos and you basically just go to the job section just bear in mind that this is like more advanced and it's not as affordable as if you just go to fiverr.com where you can just go to the video editing part and you're going to search for video editing here and you can find a bunch of people that are doing video editing for YouTube and can do it for quite cheap like10 to $15 it's just not going to be as high quality quity besides that I've also seen that a lot of people are now hiring video editors through Twitter so you can just search for those and you can find them there if you need someone that's more high quality more stable and probably a little bit more affordable if you don't want to bother with scripting voiceovers video editing hiring video editors all sorts of different things you could also just get fully done for your unique YouTube videos that you are allowed to 100% monetized so that's going to be available at dfid dave.com unique YouTube videos package it's also going to be linked over here and you can basically select how many videos you want and they're going to be delivered including the thumbnail including video editing absolutely everything now once we have the actual video step number 11 is to create a thumbnail now thumbnail are these small images that people are going to see on YouTube to decide whether they're going to click on the video or not and I made this guide that I highly recommend follow regardless of how experienced you are with YouTube or if you're just beginner it's going to be very very useful and I talk about how to actually create thumbnails that are worth clicking on thumbnails that are actually getting results so that guide is going to be available here inside of the document so you can just read through it for free but the general idea is that you should never repeat what's already in the title you never want to repeat that in the thumbnail as well because you have very limited space on YouTube so if you have a title make sure that the thumbnail text compliments or the thumbnail just compliments what's in the title so if this guy says 50 safety tips to conquer any threat then the thumbnail is going to say you should be worried and that way they give like two different reasons for someone to click on so you never really just want to copy and paste what's in the title and just put it in the thumbnail as well and you also want to make it very simple and very very bright if you make it way too complicated it's going to be very hard for a human eye to catch that and no one is really going to click look at how simple these thumbnails are the ones that got like Millions tens of millions of views they are extremely extremely simple to make a YouTube thumbnail again you can use photopia or any other free service or you could also just go to cana.com and then you can just search for YouTube thumbnail again this is something that I no longer do myself but we hire actual Freelancers and we pay anywh from $5 to $15 for a YouTube thumbnail which is a very worthwhile investment so I don't have to bother creating these thumbnails myself but if I were to create thumbnails myself I would probably go through some of these templates I would then click on one of them that I like I will click on customize this template and you just L around and just make sure the text in the thumbnail is also big and the elements are big so that people can see it even on their phone and I can find some elements here so I could basically just search for something if I want to find an avocado all I got to do is just search for avocado and that's going to give me these different images that I can just use I can just press on one of these and add them to the timeline let's say for instance I really like this one all I got to do is now upscale it then I'm going to look into the thumbnail that I'm trying to replicate and I'm going to try to create something similar now let me really really try to nail the point here and just create something that's very very similar to the thumbnail that we previously saw so I'm going to change the element colors here then I'm going to try and find some elements from the left side and then I'm going to customize that quite easily and let's say this is the thumbnail that I want to create all I got to do is click on share click download as a PNG file so that's going to be the highest quality one and then I'm going to just download this to my device I also highly recommend create multiple versions of your thumbnail so that you can ab split test inside of the YouTube Studio once we have the YouTube thumbnail step number 12 is going to be to optimize and publish our first video now again your title is also extremely important and for this I left out a bunch of different Frameworks that you could go through because I don't want you to go to chat GPT and generate the title because that's not going to get clicks it's not going to get views if it sounds like unlock your potential or Unleash Your creativity those are the words that no one really uses so I highly recommend you go through this framework of real YouTube videos that have performed incredibly well and just use these Frameworks for your own Niche and trust me you can actually apply these to literally any Niche just take these templates and Ed them whatever kind of videos you are creating I also took some of these from one of the newsletters that I've also linked here because they are giving away a bunch of these free title ideas so basically just select one of these you go through it and then they tell you what this person did right and what they did wrong and they also give you a framework that you can customize for your own YouTube video is really really useful so now just go back to your YouTube channel click on create click on upload video for the description again this is going to be a discovery video so I'm not going to try and sell anything I just want to make sure that I'm providing as much value here with the first video so that my channel grows as much as possible and then I'm going to Simply upload my thumbnail and for this we will have to verify our phone number so just click on verify enter your phone number and once you do you can upload a thumbnail that you previously made and in terms of the settings there are some settings that you will have to adjust first of all you're going to select that this video is not made for kids unless you specifically made it for kids then you're going to click on next click on next and just continue with it and now it's going to be set for first of all to unlist it but if you want to publish it right away then just click on public and it's going to go live as soon as you press publish you could also schedule these videos in advance this is what we mostly do and to kind of save you some time and get you better results I made a list of 11 YouTube settings that you should turn on to grow your channel faster so for example YouTube now has automatic chapters enabled which can really mess with your watch time and with their videos overall so what I highly recommend you do is open up the video that you've just published you're then going to go through the analytics we're going to scroll all the way down and where you see automatic chapters you're going to unselect this and you're going to save it so that way YouTube is not going to put automatic chapters but you're going to do that yourself you're going to go down to the description you're going to type in timestamps and you can check how I did it in the description of this video as well that you're watching and you basically just add time service for example intro and then here at the 38 seconds or 39 seconds we have tip number one whatever that might be and then you continue doing it and you have now your own custom chapters number two if you're going to be using one similar or same description to save some time all you going to do is go to settings you're going to go to upload defaults and you're going to just set a description template and you're going to click on save so that way every single time you upload the description is already going to be set so you don't have to write it again and again besides that you can also enable content reuse and short it's mixing you can do that in the detail section so you can scroll all the way down and you're going to change these from don't allow remixing to allow video and audio remixing and also to recommend changing the license to creative commment license so that others can also easily reupload these and help you grow your brand if that's your goal if that's not your goal then just set the standard YouTube license you're good to go you can also change the video category as you can see right now it just says that my category is people and blogs so it's going to be recommending it to not the best kind of audience that I want to attract so I will try and find some things that's going to be related to this maybe how to and style or science and technology would be a good fit and then if I find the right category I just click save if you want to add a branded Watermark all you're going to do is then just go back to your YouTube Studio once you're back at the YouTube Studio you're going to click on customization you're going to go through branding and you're going to click on video Watermark this is where you can simply upload the same profile photo or logo that you previously had and it's going to help you like brand the videos I also highly recommend you select it for the entire video as well and then publish after that you can also add some keywords you can go to the settings here and then once you're at the settings you go to channel and you can add some keywords related through your YouTube channel so just think about what are the keywords that people are going to be searching for and just add as many of them here or simply again just go back to vid IQ click on keywords and it's going to recommend the what kind of keywords people are going to be interested in when it comes to your YouTube channel or you can just search for something that's related to your content and then just see what are the related keywords to it so let's see people are searching for a lot of Habits Stay High or okay these are some songs that's not what we're interested in but for example habits that will change your life is a keyword that I could add once you're done adding your keywords just click on Save once we've completed the step number 12 step number 13 is a really fun one and you see even though YouTube is a great way to make money like the YouTube itself they pay really good ad Revenue if you know how to create high quality videos long videos and if your channel is monetized but it can sometimes be really long process to start making tens of thousands of dollars from ad Revenue every single month it can really be a daunting task so to achieve these results faster we've added multiple Revenue sources for example I promoted a lot of affiliate links with YouTube animation channels and this is one of the platforms that I've used if I go to my wallet you can see that so far we did over half a million dollars and withdrawals with this one single platform and affiliate marketing essentially means just promoting products as an affiliate products that you didn't create yourself you didn't create a website you don't do the shipping or customer delivery whatever all you're are doing is finding the right affiliate offer getting a link and then putting it in the description to make things easier for you I also have a list of the best reoccurring programs that means that if you refer someone once and they keep on paying for that software we're going to keep on making money an example of this is a software that I found and I promoted it as an affiliate and people are still using it and I'm making about $500 per month from it even though I promoted it in just one of the videos so on this list you're just going to find a bunch of different software to promote let's say for example you're creating content for Instagram content creators well now you can just go to one of these software tools you're going to try and find that affiliate program at the bottom of the website you're just going to click on affiliate program once you are there you're just going to click on become an affiliate once you do that you're going to log into your account and you're going to find your affiliate link which is going to look something like this you're going to copy that affiliate link and to make it look slightly better you could also go to some tool like beatly which is completely free you're going to click on create a new link you're going to paste a link here and you can customize the back hat you can then add those links in the description box of your YouTube videos so if your channel is talking about healthy habits and you found some product that really aligns with that audience that you can recommend them and you can say for instance hey these are the pills that I've been drinking to be more focused and I'm going to link them in the description whatever that might be brand deals and sponsorships are also a great way to start making money from your YouTube channel especially if you posted your first video and it started getting some results it started getting some traction so what I do is I have this brandal template that one of my employees actually sends out to a bunch of different companies in the niche of our YouTube channels and once they reply they try and get a deal usually we can get anywhere from 5,000 to $10,000 per video depending on the channel size depending on the content depending on the company etc etc and then I basically just give 20% to the brand deal manager who manages absolutely everything so they're going to be happy for it because they get paid like $1,000 to $2,000 per deal while the entire company gets like $4 to $8,000 profit every single time there's a sponsored video and this is effectively the template that we use I'm going to link it for free you could also just open up those competitor channels in your Niche and you can see exactly what kind of brand deals they're getting see what kind of companies are sponsoring their videos and just reach out to the same companies usually they have their contact details and their emails at the bottom of their website now if you want to go the extra mile and promote your YouTube videos and your YouTube channel so you can start getting even more views and you can use some free platforms like for example imer is one of the platforms that I used to use you can basically just upload an image that's going to be related to your YouTube video perhaps even a thumbnail I'm going to add a title in the description is going to be just click here to watch for free and then I'm going to paste a link to my YouTube video and to get a YouTube video link just go back to your YouTube Channel click on these three dots click on get a shareable link and then just go back to this platform and you can paste the video link click on two community and you can publish this now bear in mind that this is not going to get you as many results or as much results as you believe it would even though the platform gets millions of views the best way to actually get views is to just create high quality content that people want to watch but you could also promote their videos through Pinterest as well you can create simple pens in canva for free you can upload them here and you can just link your videos here and one of the platforms that I've also used was medium.com where I wrote These articles to talk about different things and then we basically just link YouTube videos in the blog articles themselves but as you can see one of my accounts actually got banned from medium probably because I used a lot of chat GPT but the traffic that we were getting was pretty good and every single one of these blog articles was promoting some kind of YouTube videos and as you can see 1.2 th000 monthly views in June and then in may we also did 1.3 th000 views from this platform so it's not a lot but it can just quickly add up especially for brand new channels now one of the members of our community one of the members of the the online business Club recently hit over a million views with one of their videos so they did a breakdown of like how they actually made over $3,000 with the first video and these are the tips that they gave like spend more time on the topic and concept before anything else like the video idea is extremely important only with the topic is interesting I should then develop the thumbnail first make several rough thumbnail drafts as I previously said you want to make as many thumbnails so you can ab split test ms1 as well once the thumbnail and title looks clickable interesting compared to other videos in the same category I should then work on the script and Concepts use more Boll to show points and not just like random Boll less text on screen AO Aragon or technical talk to keep viewers engaged and have a backup thumbnail ready to swap in if the performance isn't doing well for that first one so you can just change it right away and also some of the other members of the online business Club Community have been sharing their results with YouTube automation so for example Doris recently got her Channel monetized rough a little over $3,000 from just one of the videos in the less than 60 days and I also saw that for example David is now doing over $1,000 per month from one of his faceless YouTube automation channels which is pretty pretty cool and most of these members share exactly how they do it because we do monthly and weekly calls both with me and my theme so the JN calls we discuss YouTube automation I give my tips I share my channels they also share their channels and what they've done so we try and help each other grow and get as better as best results as possible so if this entire tutorial was helpful then I do recommend checking out the the online business Club as well which is not just a community but also a place where you can learn where you can grow where you can get tools resources participate in giveaways worth up to $88,000 a month get work from home jobs worth up to $2,000 a month and so many different things but either way I hope this

Video marketing is a great way to reach your audience on social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. But creating a lot of videos by hand can be really laborious, especially when you're trying to do it consistently or in large quantities. There has to be a better way. Fortunately, there is! Using a no-code automation platform such as Make.com, you can automate almost everything about creating marketing videos. Thanks to the platform's over 1,800 app integrations, you can build automated workflows that fit almost any use case, whether you're creating videos for social media, personalized outreach, or advertising. To create videos with Make, we'll use Creatomate's API. With its online video editor, you can easily create your own templates, which you can then use within your Make.com scenario. This allows you to automate video creation based on dynamic data or conditions you set up in your no-code workflows. Keeping this tutorial simple, we will only cover the basics, setting up a workflow that creates the following video with a few dynamic placeholders: Prerequisites As Make.com offers a wide range of apps, there are many scenarios where video automation may be useful. That's why in this walkthrough, we're sticking to the core concept so you can easily apply it to your own Make.com scenarios. Here are the apps we'll use: Creatomate: to create a template and generate videos. Sign up for free. Make: to set up the automated workflow. Instagram for Business: or any other app to use the videos. How to create videos using Make.com (Integromat)? The first step in creating videos with Make.com is to create a video template in Creatomate. Next, you can set up a Make scenario that uses the Creatomate API to generate a video based on that template. You can then use the video with any of Make's supported apps, for example, by posting it on Instagram as a Reel: Note: In order to keep things simple, we'll build a very basic Make scenario. Use any of Make's app integrations to tailor it to your needs! Let's get started by creating a video template. 1. Create a video template in Creatomate The videos will be based on a template. You can pick one from the gallery, customize it to fit your needs, or make one yourself. But let's keep it simple for now and use a template as-is. Log in to your Creatomate account, go to the Templates page, and click the + New button. You can use any template from the gallery you like. For this tutorial, we'll use the Quick Promo template from the Featured category. The 1:1 Square size is fine and click Create Template: Each template that you create in Creatomate's template editor is composed of elements (also known as \"layers\"). Any of these elements can be automatically edited in our Make.com scenario. In order to do that, you have to mark them as dynamic. You can do this by selecting the elements, then checking the Dynamic setting in the property panel. In this example template, there is no need to make any changes, since the elements Text-1, Text-2, and Video are already dynamic. However, this is an important point to keep in mind when creating your own video templates: Now let's move on to the next step, where we will build our Make scenario. 2. Set up a Make.com trigger Feel free to use any other module, such as Airtable or Webhook, as we only use the Basic trigger module for demonstration purposes. Log in to your Make account and click + Create a new scenario. As a starting point, create a Basic trigger module, which can be found under Tools. Give this module two dummy input fields: Name -> Video, Value -> https://creatomate-static.s3.amazonaws.com/demo/video1.mp4 Name -> Text-1, Value -> Hello World! Then, click OK: Let's right-click this module and select Run this module only to make sure it works: Next, we'll use this data in the next step to generate a unique video. 3. Generate the video In this step, we'll create a video using Creatomate's API. To do this, we insert the data from our trigger module into the video template from step 1. Click + to add another module. Search for and choose Creatomate as the app and Render a Template as the action. First, create a connection using your project's API key, which you can find under Project Settings in your Creatomate dashboard: Next, select your Quick Promo template in the Template ID field. Make.com automatically pulls in the dynamic elements and lists them under Modifications. Now, let's map the data from our trigger to the template as follows: Set Video to Tools - Basic trigger -> video Set Text-1 to Tools - Basic trigger -> text-1 Once done, click OK: Note: Text-2 is also a dynamic template element. If you don't insert new data for a modification, it will use the template's default data instead. That's fine for the Text-2 element in this tutorial. Just to make sure Creatomate can generate a video for us, click the Run once button located in the bottom left corner: If the test runs successfully, the module turns green. To view the output provided by Creatomate, click the magnifying glass icon. You can also preview the video by visiting the URL: Next up is the last step of this tutorial. 4. Process the video In this final step, I'll show you how to post the video as an Instagram Reel. However, feel free to choose any other app integration that works best for you. Note: Certain app integrations in Make, like \"Facebook Pages\", take a file as input, whereas others, such as \"Instagram for Business\", expect a URL. If you want to use an app that requires a file, you'll have to add a module to fetch the file first. Check out this tutorial as a reference (step 4). Click + to add another module. Search for and choose Instagram for Business as the app and Create a Reel Post as the action. Choose your account or create a connection, then pick your page. In the Video URL field, select Creatomate - Render a Template -> URL: If you want, you can add a caption in the Caption field and adjust the other settings to your preference. When you're done, click OK: Again, click Run once. If everything's set up right, the video is automatically created and posted on Instagram: What's next for video creation with Make That's it for the basics! With your new skills, you will be able to automate videos with Make.com. With so many apps and automation features in Make.com, there are many opportunities for video automation. As a source of inspiration, here are a few Make.com triggers for your next video automation scenario: New records or responses in Airtable New posts in WordPress New items in RSS Feed New media in Instagram You could, for example, use these triggers along with these actions: Send an email in Gmail Upload a file to platforms like Dropbox, Google Drive, or Slack Post a video on Facebook For more help and inspiration, check out our blog page with step-by-step tutorials.
