Instead, it provides more than 30 AI features dedicated to video editing. Moreover, it offers the Gen-2 feature, which changes the game for AI video generation by creating videos from text or images. While Gen-2 is certainly exciting in terms of AI video generation’s future possibilities, its current limited accuracy may still need improvement. Key Features: Wide range of valuable tools for video editing Green Screen video background remover Automatic prompt suggestions Previews to select from before generating a video Remove objects instantly from videos Pricing: Runway offers a free plan with 125 credits and limited AI tools. The paid plans range from $12 to $76 monthly per user. 7. Visla Visla is another powerful AI video app that provides many valuable video editing and recording tools for its users.

Once you have this script, you can input it into another AI engine, which will scan a library of stock images and videos to find content matching your script’s words.

However, while the lip-sync accuracy was impressive, I sometimes find the movements of the AI avatars generated to be stiff. With its API integration, you can automate hundreds of personalized videos overnight, which no other platform has managed so smoothly yet. Elai best features Custom AI avatars: Create lifelike digital presenters tailored to your brand Text-to-video conversion: Transform written content into engaging video scripts Multilingual support: Generate videos in 75+ languages with natural-sounding AI voices Scalable video production: Create hundreds or thousands of videos quickly using API integration Interactive elements: Add clickable buttons and quizzes to boost engagement Elai limitations Time investment: Requires time to master all features, despite being user-friendly Limited avatar customization: Offers a limited range of avatar customization options Slow processing for large projects: Experiences significant delays with large-scale video projects Elai pricing Free Basic: $23/month (billed annually) Enterprise: Custom pricing Elai ratings and reviews G2: 4.6/5 (90+ reviews) Capterra: Not enough reviews 9. Runway (Best for cinematic AI video generation and editing) via Runway What if you could instantly generate futuristic, high-quality video output or add complex effects without traditional VFX software? I tested Runway to see if it delivers. The text-to-video feature stood out to me. I typed in simple prompts, and within minutes, the AI-generated video was delivered and needed only a few minor adjustments. Another highlight was the Motion Brush tool. It allowed me to add flowing animations that typically take hours quickly. The image-to-video tool also worked well. I uploaded a still render and generated a 360-degree rotation that looked incredibly realistic. Its ability to automatically generate background music was a nice touch. Runway best features Text-to-video generation: Create videos from detailed text descriptions Motion brush: Add targeted animations to specific areas of your video Image-to-video: Transform still images into dynamic video sequences AI-enhanced editing: Streamline the editing process with intelligent tools Realistic AI avatars: Generate lifelike digital humans for your videos Runway limitations Time investment: Requires time to master all features, despite being user-friendly Longer processing for complex generations: Takes longer for complex generations, especially at higher qualities AI interpretation discrepancies: May result in interpretations that do not perfectly match your vision Runway pricing Free Standard: $12/month per user Pro: $28/month per user Unlimited: $76/month per user Enterprise: Custom pricing Runway ratings and reviews G2: Not enough reviews Capterra: Not enough reviews 10. Synthesys (Best for scalable AI video creation with lifelike avatars) via Synthesys.io I tested Synthesys to explore its capabilities as an AI video editor, and it performed quite well overall. The multilingual AI avatars generated were realistic, with smooth expressions and movements, which worked effectively for professional video content. However, avatar customization felt somewhat limited. The text-to-speech feature and the various video templates on the platform were accurate, but the rendering times for longer videos can often be frustratingly slow. The platform’s video templates were useful and saved time, though some options were fairly basic. Synthesys best features Lifelike AI avatars: Choose from a diverse range of ultra-realistic digital presenters Multilingual support: Generate videos in 140+ languages with natural-sounding AI voices Custom avatar creation: Design unique AI presenters tailored to your brand Video templates: Access a library of customizable templates for quick video creation Batch processing: Generate multiple videos simultaneously for high-volume production Synthesys limitations Steep learning curve: Takes time to learn all features, despite being user-friendly Limited avatar expression flexibility: Limits the flexibility of avatar expressions based on user preferences Synthesys pricing Free Personal: $20/month (billed yearly) Creator: $41/month (billed yearly) Business Unlimited: $69/month (billed yearly) Synthesys ratings and reviews G2: Not enough reviews Capterra: 4.4/5 (20+ reviews) 11. Visla (Best for comprehensive AI-powered video creation) via Visla Need an AI platform that lets you handle storyboard, script, B-roll, voice-over, subtitles, and more for different video styles? Visla does that and more. The AI script generation feature is a timesaver, crafting well-structured scripts from basic product briefs. AI avatars were quite lifelike, though I found the selection somewhat limited for more niche industries (imagine not being able to make your AI chef avatar wear the iconic white chef hat). However, the text-to-video tool was efficient, automatically pulling relevant stock footage and adding animations, but the customization options for advanced users felt restricted. Visla also provides solid branding tools, making it simple to keep visuals on-brand with logos and color schemes. The multilingual adaptation and collaboration features were helpful, especially for teams across regions. Visla best features AI script generation: Creates professional scripts from basic product information Realistic AI avatars: Offers a diverse range of lifelike digital presenters Text-to-video conversion: Transforms scripts into fully-fledged videos automatically Extensive stock library: Provides access to millions of high-quality stock footage and images Brand kit integration: Ensures consistent branding across all videos Multilingual support: Offers AI-powered translation and voiceover in multiple languages Collaboration tools: Enables team-wide cooperation on video projects Visla limitations Learning curve: Requires a moderate investment of time to learn AI content fine-tuning needed: Requires fine-tuning of AI-generated content to match specific creative visions Visla pricing Free Pro: $9/month Business: $39/month Enterprise: Custom pricing Visla ratings and reviews G2: Not enough reviews Capterra: Not enough reviews Also Read: 10 Best AI Screen Recorders in 2024: A Professional’s Guide 12. Hour One (Best for quick-scale AI avatar videos) via Hour One I tested Hour One’s AI avatar video creation and found it helpful for producing videos quickly, especially for internal communications. The AI avatars were lifelike enough, though not as polished as I expected. The avatars’ voice-to-expression matching was a bit off at times, affecting overall realism. The multilingual capability was highlighted, allowing me to create localized versions with accurate lip-syncing across languages. Overall, Hour One is effective for quick, scalable video creation, but there’s potential for improvements in avatar quality and expression syncing. Hour One best features Semi-realistic AI avatars: Create custom digital humans or choose from a diverse library of premade avatars Text-to-video conversion: Transform scripts into professional videos with AI-powered scene selection and editing Multilingual support: Generate videos in 140+ languages with perfect lip-sync Custom branding: Incorporate logos, color schemes, and other brand elements into your videos easily API integration: Automate video creation by connecting Hour One to your existing content management systems Hour One limitations Time investment: Requires time to master all features, especially for complex video projects, despite being user-friendly Lack of nuanced creativity: Lacks the nuanced creativity found in human-produced videos Limited stock options for specialized industries: Provides extensive options but may feel limited for highly specialized industries Hour One pricing Free Lite: $25/month (billed annually) Business: $95/$120/$160 per month (billed annually), depending on usage Enterprise: Custom pricing Hour One ratings and reviews G2: 4.5/5 (120+ reviews) Capterra: Not enough reviews 13. Colossyan (Best for handy AI-powered video creation) via Colossyan Reviewing Colossyan was interesting. The platform offers plenty of features for anyone to create AI videos, but there are areas for improvement. Multi-language support is a strong point, with accurate translations and lip-syncing that make content localization easy. However, while the AI avatars looked realistic, a noticeable head wobble made them feel a bit unnatural, and their expressions didn’t always match the tone of their voices. The PowerPoint integration was smooth, quickly converting slides into dynamic videos with animations and voiceovers, which saved time. Interactive elements like quizzes added engagement, but some advanced customization options were lacking. Also Read: How to Video Record Yourself Presenting a PowerPoint Colossyan best features AI-powered text-to-video: Transform scripts into professional videos with just a few clicks Extensive language support: Create and translate videos in 70+ languages Custom avatar creation: Design unique AI presenters tailored to your brand PowerPoint and PDF import: Convert existing presentations into engaging videos easily Interactive video elements: Add quizzes, hotspots, and branching scenarios to boost engagement Collaborative workspace: Work together with your team seamlessly on video projects API integration: Connect Colossyan with your existing tools and workflows Colossyan limitations Time investment: Requires time to master all features, especially for complex projects, despite being user-friendly Semi-realistic avatar interactions: Offers interactions that may feel semi-realistic compared to specialized 3D modeling tools Rendering time: Takes longer to generate complex videos with multiple scenes and effects Colossyan pricing Starter: $19/month (billed annually) Pro: $61/month (billed annually) Enterprise: Custom pricing Colossyan ratings and reviews G2: 4.6/5 (410+ reviews) Capterra: Not enough reviews Summarize this article with AI ClickUp Brain not only saves you precious time by instantly summarizing articles, it also leverages AI to connect your tasks, docs, people, and more, streamlining your workflow like never before.

The Ultimate 6-Step Guide To Creating Video Tutorials Turn your texts, PPTs, PDFs or URLs to video - in minutes. On average, each minute of a live-action clip shot with equipment costs between $1,500 and $10,000.Â Â With this in mind, we understand why you're looking for a way to create tutorial videos for a more - shall we say - reasonable price. ð¸ But fear not; creating video tutorials that look professional (regardless of your budget) is possible. And luckily, you've stumbled upon the right article to show you how.Â This ultimate guide will walk you through the answers to the biggest questions around this topic: What is a tutorial video? A tutorial video, or instructional video, is a type of training video that teaches someone how to perform a task, how to improve specific soft skills, how a piece of software works, or how an internal system works. Itâs typically done with a screencast and audio narration, sometimes even with webcam recording depending on the requirements of your video script. Whenever someone has to learn something, a video tutorial will make it possible. Why tutorial videos are best for learning According to several studies, an instructional or tutorial video is the best way to acquire new knowledge. Why? Thatâs not all. The research proving how effective video tutorials are is endless: What software is used to make video tutorials? Creating video tutorials can be done with a range of software, from basic to professional. While creators generally consider needs, budget, and technical expertise when picking one, youâre here to learn how to make a tutorial video without equipment. So, focusing on the âno equipmentâ part, do you know what makes an excellent online video maker? There are plenty of options, but in terms of speed, budget, and flexibility, Synthesia comes out on top. Why Synthesia? Synthesia is an AI-powered video creation tool you can use to make videos with no equipment, from plain text and its built-in screen recorder. An AI video editing software like Synthesia makes creating tutorial videos possible for anyone, from individual content creators to businesses, because: Tutorial video examples and types 1. How-to video tutorials How-to videos teach something in consecutive steps, focusing on the how. Theyâre more like watching a friend teaching you step-by-step how to do something. This type of instructional video works best for the more technical topics where itâs easy to break down the âhowâ into actionable steps. Example: Technical video on troubleshooting equipment With the internet being used in almost any business, a simple step-by-step guide with router reset instructions like this one will come in handy. Create how-to videos for any task that will save time, minimize workflow disruptions, and make your employees more independent. 2. Screencast video tutorial Screencasts or screen recordings teach something that happens on your computer screen while you perform the task and narrate it. This type of tutorial works best for teaching digital software topics. It can be as simple as creating a screen capture with dedicated screen recording software like OBS, ScreenRec, or Movavi Screen Recorder. Or it can be more complex instructional content where you start recording, stop, alternate with some interactive elements, continue recording, and so on. Example: Over-the-shoulder video recording for software use This video tutorial shows an instructor using Google Forms to analyze user research data. Itâs practical and easy to follow, making it highly effective. Create explainer videos for any task your employees could learn more easily by first watching you do it. 3. Step-by-step video tutorials Step-by-step tutorials teach something in a series of limited steps, usually 3-5 steps, without going too deep into the subject. This type of instructional video works best for surface-level teaching. Example: Strategic planning training tutorial This video tutorial breaks down the five steps to setting impactful Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Without going into excessive details, it uses visuals and examples to give learners a solid understanding of the topic and an overview of the process. Create training tutorials for topics that need a clear and structured approach. 4. Interactive video tutorials Interactive tutorials teach something by simultaneously presenting information and involving the audience with interactions like quizzes, prompts, clickable links, etc.Â This type of video works best for creating experiences where learners get instant feedback. Example: Interactive video tutorial course This interactive course teaches the use of two different software combined, Easygenerator and Synthesia. While many software tutorials come as screencasts, this one is looking to engage the audience and make learning more effective by using interactions throughout the course. Create interactive tutorials for topics that could use practical activities in the learning process. 5. Micro-learning video tutorials Micro-courses teach a topic in a series of short videos of under 3 minutes each, presenting each step concisely in an individual video. This type of tutorial works best for complex topics or big training that could otherwise overwhelm the audience. Example: Tool onboarding instructional videoÂ Asana is a handy tool for managing projects. If your employees are using it, including an Asana tutorial video in your onboarding process will help new hires make the most of it. Create micro-learning instructional videos to give your employees upskill or reskill opportunities. How to make a tutorial video step-by-step Creating instructional videos with no equipment is a straightforward process when using Synthesia. Here are the six steps to follow when creating your tutorial video. ð Step 1: Pick your video tutorial style Lacking traditional recording equipment is not an obstacle to creating effective video clips, so don't let anyone tell you otherwise. On the contrary, you can make a video tutorial that stands out and reaches all your goals using video creation platforms as endless boxes for creativity. These platforms are perfect for making instructional videos in different styles, such as: Presenter style According to some studies, the most engaging training videos feature other people or \"peers,\" which is why presenter-style tutorial videos are so popular. Traditionally, the presenter was an actor, an instructor, or an employee who was recorded giving the tutorial in a studio setup.Â So, how do you make a presenter-style video, also known as a talking head video, without camera equipment? The answer is AI technology. With video generators such as Synthesia, you can choose a human-looking avatar, give it a natural voice, and add it to your video in one click. Screencast or screen recorder video This type of video recording style is perfect if you need your customers or employees to understand how to use a platform, software, or app. Once you create video tutorials that basically share your screen with the audience, you'll make your viewers very happy. Â \"65% of customers say video is their favorite way to learn how to use a product or service.\" Synthesia is a video tutorial software that offers a screen recording functionality for you to: Interactive tutorial videos Interactive instructional videos are most known for reinforcing learning since you can interact with the video you watch in real-time. What do we mean by this? The viewer must click, respond, or perform specific steps while watching the video.Â Animation Animation is another style you can choose if it suits your brand identity better. This type of video is ideal for illustrating complicated concepts. The only thing you should keep in mind is that if you don't have experience in animation, you may have to resort to a specific platform or hire the services of a specialist.Â Step 2: Set your goals and objectives When creating a video, getting lost in the process can quickly happen to anyone. That's why we recommend setting some goals and objectives before designing your tutorial. Your goals and objectives will differ from someone else's depending on what you want and need. However, everyone should keep one universal goal: ensure your how-to video is easy to understand.Â To keep you on track, it would help if you could answer: Step 3: Write your tutorial script In this life, it's not always about what you say but how you say it. Remembering this will keep you away from scripts that could bore your viewers to death and, more importantly, help your audience understand your tutorial. Because yes, a solid script is just as important as the right visuals in creating good video tutorials.Â So now the question is: how do you write a good script? ð Here are a few tips you can use not just when you make a video tutorial but really with all the videos you'll ever want to create from now on: Step 4: Choose your template Making sure your video looks good can be difficult when all your design skills are reduced to knowing how to modify the font and change the background of your PowerPoint slides. Luckily, for all the non-designers of the world, a tutorial video maker like Synthesia offers professional-looking templates and other video editing tools to make your video look like a designer created it.Â Synthesia is the best software for making videos that train, teach, or just explain specific concepts. Of all the tools you could use, this one is particularly handy because it turns text into videos and has over 60 templates you can duplicate or fully customize, so you don't have to create engaging video tutorials from scratch. Unlike the Movavi screen recorder or other free plan capture software that only lets you record video from your screen, Synthesia is an all-in-one AI tool. You can use it to capture your screen and put that recording into a video template. Then you get to customize the template to create individual high-quality videos or even a full online course with many micro-lessons. Step 5: Create a lifelike AI avatar and narration As we told you at the beginning of this video, you don't need any equipment for making tutorial videos that stand out; you have to wait for AI technology to work its magic.Â Thanks to the creation of avatars and voiceovers, you won't need to hire actors, cameras, lights, sets, microphones, or pay for editing and voice software. Synthesia will generate a human-sounding narration of your text with an AI avatar of your choice using text-to-video technology. Plus, you can create a custom avatar of yourself or a team member (with the person's explicit consent). Learn how Cyber Inc. accelerates expansion into 6 markets using Synthesia, one of the best video tutorial software, and a Custom Avatar. Step 6: Review and publish You can't make a good tutorial video without reviewing it multiple times. So the final step in this journey is to examine the clip you made without equipment.Â For that reason, we recommend double-checking grammar, graphics, transitions, voiceover, templates, and any other errors.Â It is also important that your video fits the brand and identity of your business or company. So, whether it's going to be a YouTube video for your company's YouTube channel, an explainer video for your knowledge base, or a fun instructional video for social media platforms, before you publish it, make sure it looks the way you want it to.Â And check that it plays well on both desktop and mobile devices. Once you've reviewed your content and are happy with the result, share it with the world.Â The good news is that if you notice any mistakes in the future or simply want to update the script, it is possible to make these changes with Synthesia at the click of a button. Create your next tutorial with AI Now you know it's possible to create fantastic video tutorials with just your computer and the help of an online video editing and creation platform like Synthesia.Â Your recording environment and budget will no longer limit you, and you can start using it as both a video maker and a marketing tool.

It's okay if you don't have a million-dollar budget, fancy camera equipment, or Neil deGrasse Tyson to narrate your tutorial video.Â Here is an overview of the 6 steps to creating a video tutorial: What are the benefits of making tutorials with AI? Using AI to create tutorials makes you way more efficient.

Also feel free to connect with me via Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Podcast or YouTube. While last year was all about chatbots and image generators, this year, generative AI tools that help us create and edit videos are all the rage. Now, these aren’t (yet) as advanced as AI image generators, so don’t think you can just type “make a new Star Wars movie,” and it will create a blockbuster for you. Instead, what they do is automate many of the tasks involved in video editing, such as cutting footage to insert, re-ordering scenes, adding audio effects, generating captions, and adding avatars, graphics, or animations. However, they are becoming more powerful and flexible by the day, so who knows what they will be capable of soon? Whether you want to speed up the process of making corporate how-to videos or try your hand at becoming the next Stanley Kubrick, here’s a rundown of some of the top generative AI platforms for creating and editing videos today. Five Of My Favorite Generative AI Video Tools Synthesia Synthesia is a generative AI video tool that is particularly great when it comes to creating digital avatars and bringing them to life with realistic voice and animation. It’s used by businesses to create training materials as well as by marketers for promotional and advertising content, and it would also be a great choice for educational videos. The avatars it creates can speak in multiple languages and accents, with convincingly human gestures and facial expressions. This means it’s easy to create content and then quickly localize it for different markets, products and services. It’s relatively easy to use – you simply type the script and hear it spoken back to you. Like many of the tools here, it offers a free account that gives you access to many of the basic features, meaning you can easily find out if it’s right for you before spending any money. Descript Descript is something of a disruptive player in the generative video market as a startup launched by one of the co-founders of Groupon. By gaining a reputation as a powerful tool for social media content creators and TikTok kids, it’s hit a marketing sweet spot, but it’s also used across a wide range of corporate and educational use cases. Descript users start with a script and then build their video out from there. You just pull in footage that can be manipulated and enhanced with AI, as well as audio that can be imported or generated from text, mimicking the user’s voice. You can then edit and re-arrange the timeline simply by snipping and moving the text. Descript stands out from other AI video editing tools – particularly ones that are available free online – with its user-friendliness and range of features. Everything is set up to make it quick for anybody to start producing and editing videos. Handy features such as eye-contact correction and “one-click” studio-quality sound are signs that the team is looking to add valuable innovations as the tool evolves. Adobe Premiere Pro with Sensei Another example of an industry-standard tool being given a generative AI makeover for the modern age. Adobe Premiere Pro has long been a video editing tool of choice for professionals and enthusiasts and now has a suite of new features powered by Adobe’s Sensei generative AI platform. Functions like transcription, inserting and re-ordering scenes, color correction, and audio adjustment, such as remixing music to match the timing of visuals, can now be streamlined and automated using natural language. It also has a text-to-speech feature that simplifies the process of creating captions and transcripts. This reduces the time that creators need to spend on manual tasks, allowing them to focus on more creative elements of their work. Adobe is going all-in on generative AI, adding tools and capabilities across its entire Creative Cloud suite, and video production is just one area where it is leading the field today. Pictory Pictory aims to automate the process of turning scripts and blogs into videos with minimal user effort. It’s great for those who want to make quick, snappy videos for marketing or just for fun. It can also be used by educators and online course creators to make lively learning material. One of the tasks it specializes in is automatically creating highlight reels showcasing the most important, exciting or interesting moments from longer videos. It then makes it simple to quickly repurpose them as trailers or social clips to engage more viewers. Generative AI is clearly going to make a big splash in the world of marketing, and there are plenty of tools designed to fit the needs of marketers. User-friendliness is a key feature of this platform, which focuses on making it simple to create the type of videos that millions of businesses across the world need every day. Runway Runway is different from the other platforms I’ve highlighted here because it does – to an extent – offer straightforward text-to-video generative AI. This means you can type “Sun rising over a beach at sunset,” and it will create a completely synthetic video. Alternatively, you can upload an image and bring it to life. When I tried it, the results were sometimes not exactly what I was hoping for, but they were impressive nonetheless, and it’s mind-boggling to think what this technology might be capable of in the not-too-distant future. As with ChatGPT and any generative AI tool with language-based input, the results can be greatly improved by taking some time to learn about the best ways to communicate what you want it to do. Other Great Generative AI Video Tools Beyond the five tools listed above, there are many other tools rapidly developing in the field of generative AI video creation, with the most noteworthy ones listed below for their innovative contributions and capabilities.
