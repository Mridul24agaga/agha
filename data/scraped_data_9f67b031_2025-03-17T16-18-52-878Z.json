Try CapCut Commerce Pro now! *No credit card needed A content creator, once struggling to gain traction with their faceless YouTube channel, found a breakthrough using AI-powered editing. By leveraging an all-in-one content production tool, they transformed their videos with dynamic visuals, engaging voiceovers, and seamless edits. Within months, their retention rates soared, and their subscriber count doubled. Their success wasn’t just about the content—it was about how they presented it. In this article, we’ll explore powerful strategies to keep your audience hooked and watching until the last second. Plus, we’ll show you how an AI-powered editing tool can streamline the process, ensuring your videos are as engaging and professional as possible. Understanding the Power of Audience Retention Audience retention is one of the most critical metrics in YouTube’s algorithm. The longer viewers watch your content, the more likely your videos are to be promoted on YouTube’s homepage and suggested feeds. High retention rates also play a major role in YouTube monetization, as they directly impact ad revenue, sponsorship opportunities, and overall channel growth. The challenge? Maintaining interest without appearing on camera. The solution lies in creating dynamic, fast-paced content that provides value while leveraging AI-driven production tools to simplify content creation. Crafting a Hook That Captivates in the First 10 Seconds First impressions matter. Viewers decide within seconds whether to keep watching or click away. Open your video with a bold statement, an intriguing question, or a dramatic visual that immediately grabs attention. Use text overlays, quick transitions, and compelling voiceovers to create an immersive experience. Successful faceless channels in niche video ideas such as finance, tech reviews, or motivation have mastered this technique, ensuring their audience stays engaged from start to finish. Using AI-Powered Editing to Maintain Engagement A well-edited video can make the difference between high retention and viewers dropping off early. CapCut Commerce Pro offers features like auto-captions, intelligent scene transitions, and AI-powered pacing adjustments to keep videos flowing smoothly. Instead of spending hours manually editing, content creators can automate time-consuming tasks, ensuring professional-quality results with minimal effort. A top-performing faceless YouTube channel in the finance niche increased its average watch time by 35% simply by incorporating AI-enhanced editing into its production workflow. CapCut Commerce Pro also provides high-quality background music, AI-generated B-roll, and customizable animations that enhance the storytelling experience. By leveraging these features, content creators can create engaging videos without investing in expensive editing software or hiring professional editors. Whether it’s an explainer video, product review, or storytelling content, CapCut Commerce Pro ensures seamless execution that maximizes viewer retention and aligns with effective YouTube monetization tips. Optimizing Video Length for Maximum Watch Time Video length plays a crucial role in audience retention. While longer videos can generate higher ad revenue, they must be structured strategically to maintain interest. The sweet spot varies by niche, but data suggests that faceless videos in categories like education and storytelling perform best between 8 and 15 minutes. Use AI-generated analytics to track where viewers drop off and adjust future content accordingly. A fitness-based faceless channel, for example, increased its retention by 20% by structuring videos with a strong introduction, valuable mid-section content, and a rewarding payoff at the end. Leveraging AI-Generated B-Roll and Animations One of the biggest challenges with faceless YouTube channels is keeping the visuals engaging. Repetitive static images or dull stock footage can cause viewers to lose interest. CapCut Commerce Pro offers AI-generated B-roll, animations, and text overlays that automatically sync with your script, making your content visually dynamic without requiring extensive editing skills. A tech review channel saw a 50% increase in watch time after integrating AI-powered visuals to enhance storytelling, proving that strong visuals are just as important as compelling audio. Perfecting Voiceovers with AI A monotone or robotic voiceover can kill engagement. The best faceless video strategies involve high-quality, natural-sounding voiceovers that captivate the audience. CapCut Commerce Pro provides advanced voice synthesis with customizable tones, allowing creators to generate professional voiceovers that align with their content style. A popular motivational channel used AI voice customization to match emotional storytelling, boosting retention by 40% within a month. Strategic Pacing and Pattern Interrupts Keeping viewers engaged means preventing monotony. Successful faceless channels use pattern interrupts—quick cuts, sound effects, zoom-ins, or sudden changes in pacing—to keep viewers interested. AI-driven video pacing tools can automatically adjust timing to match audience preferences. A top-ranking faceless YouTube channel in business education improved its engagement rate by 30% by strategically inserting visual and audio shifts every 10-15 seconds. Crafting a Strong Call-to-Action Without Losing Viewers Many creators make the mistake of placing a call-to-action (CTA) too early, causing drop-offs. Instead, integrate subtle CTAs throughout the video. For example, use AI-generated lower-thirds to remind viewers to subscribe or watch the next video without disrupting the flow. Placing a final CTA in the last 20 seconds—when viewers are most engaged—can drive higher conversions. A faceless travel channel increased its subscriber rate by 25% simply by refining the placement of CTAs using AI-powered insights. Leveraging AI Analytics to Improve Content Strategy Understanding what works—and what doesn’t—is key to improving audience retention. AI analytics tools track audience behavior, highlighting which sections cause drop-offs and which keep viewers engaged. This data allows creators to refine their scriptwriting, pacing, and visual elements for future videos. A niche financial education channel improved its average watch duration by 45% by making data-driven content adjustments based on AI feedback. Real-World Success Stories of Faceless YouTube Channels A YouTube creator in the tech niche struggled with low retention rates until they incorporated AI-driven editing techniques. By using CapCut Commerce Pro’s automatic scene transitions, voice enhancements, and AI-generated B-roll, they saw a 60% increase in watch time and a surge in subscriber engagement. Another educational channel teaching language skills saw dramatic growth after utilizing AI-powered subtitles and overlays to keep their videos engaging and accessible to a wider audience.

Building a successful YouTube channel is no longer a big deal, even if you are camera-shy or just don’t want to face the camera. By creating a faceless YouTube channel you can create captivating content and educate viewers, build a loyal audience, and start a new side hustle. On average, YouTubers with faceless channels make between $12K and $120K per year, and the best part is that you don't need fancy equipment or advanced editing skills. With the help of Al, you can focus more on the ideas and less on the technical details by making the content creation process seamless. But you might be wondering, “what exactly a faceless YouTube channel is, and how can I start one for myself?” Don’t worry because in this guide, we are going to cover: What is a Faceless YouTube Channel? Benefits of Using Artificial Intelligence for a Faceless YouTube Channel Faceless YouTube Channel Ideas How to Start a Faceless YouTube Channel Let's get started! What is a Faceless YouTube Channel? A faceless YouTube channel is one where you can find videos related to a specific niche, but nowhere will you be able to figure out the person behind it. So, when you decide to start a faceless YouTube channel, you won't show your face in the videos and use methods like voiceovers, animations, and graphics to share your content. Not only does this help you share your ideas and connect with people online, but it also helps you maintain your privacy, which is a common concern these days. As one of the faceless YouTubers, you may either choose to use a pseudonym or stay completely anonymous. Using this approach puts the main spotlight on your content rather than your identity, which lets your work stand on its own merit. Basically, it's all about the content, which keeps you free from the influence of how people think you look or personal fame. AI faceless video generator Create videos without ever facing the camera Create now Benefits of Using AI for a Faceless YouTube Channel Using AI to produce videos for your faceless YouTube channel is like having a superpower that sparks your creativity and does all the heavy lifting for you. Below are some ways in which artificial intelligence can make it easier for you to run a faceless YouTube channel while maintaining efficiency. Democratization of Content Creation Thanks to the advancements in AI, it has become easier than ever for anyone without technical expertise to produce professional quality content. This has made it particularly easier for faceless YouTube channels, where the creators might not have extensive editing skills or resources to produce top-notch content. However, with advanced AI tools, they can easily focus on content ideas and leave the technical complexities to the software. Improved Consistency In Content Creation AI can help you automate and optimize the whole production process. From generating voiceovers to streamlining the editing process and converting your ideas into polished professional content, it helps you stay on track. AI technology is particularly beneficial if you struggle to maintain a regular posting schedule, as it automates some of the most time-consuming tasks. For example, creating and editing content can take up a lot of time. However, with tools like invideo AI for video creation and editing, VidIQ and TubeBuddy for providing keyword suggestions & SEO scoring, you can easily streamline the process and maintain consistency. Then, there is thumbnail and graphic creation, which again can be made easier with AI tools like Snappa and Adobe Express. By handling these time-consuming tasks, AI lets you focus on creating great content and maintaining a regular posting schedule. Lower Production Cost Another great benefit that comes with integrating AI is the reduced production cost in your content creation process. With AI, you will no longer need expensive equipment, studio space, or even a large production team on different levels. It can easily handle tasks like graphic creation, editing, and even composing voiceovers and music, so you won't have to hire specialists for every aspect of video production – which typically costs a lot. By automating a majority of the processes involved in video production, AI saves you money and a great deal of time, letting you produce more content with fewer resources. This can be ideal if you are just starting out or on a tight budget. Scope For Experimentation And Creative Freedom Using AI for your YouTube channel lets you explore different content styles and formats, which is a great benefit if you're just starting out. You can try out different video types, animations, and storytelling methods, all while AI handles the technical stuff. This creative liberty no longer lets you stay bound to the boundaries and helps you discover what resonates best with your audience. You will have sufficient time to focus on the creative side of content creation while the AI takes care of repetitive and technical tasks such as video editing, audio processing, thumbnail and subtitle generation, etc. Faceless YouTube Channel Ideas Now that you have clarity on the benefits of using AI for your faceless YouTube channel, the next thing you might be wondering is, \"What kind of videos can I create without showing my face?\" or \"How can I engage my audience without a personal on-screen presence, wouldn't it be tough for me?\" Here are various faceless YouTube video ideas that cater to different interests and skills. You will explore the options that let you focus on what you love while keeping your identity anonymous. Motivational The first category you can cater to is the motivational niche, which is a pretty popular space not just on YouTube but every other social media platform. Motivational content often stands out for its unique ability to connect deeply with the audience with its impactful messaging and appeal. So, if you are good at inspiring others through your words, the motivational category can be just the right thing for you to get started with. For example, you can take a look at some popular motivation-focused channels like Chispa Motivation, which was started back in 2014. The channel has over 844k subscribers and a total of 314 videos with over 145 million views. It has grown significantly over the years, and the content typically revolves around inspiring and advising people looking for guidance in life. MotivationHub is another great example of a channel with a substantial following that features faceless YouTube videos. It has a massive following of 3.23 million subscribers and features 339 videos on the channel. This channel typically partners with other top motivational speakers and creates content that's not just inspiring but transformational. Now, think about starting your channel in this space. You can be the person behind such a transformative space to inspire others and help them follow their dreams – all without showing who you are. Isn't that a cool idea? Fact-based Videos Do you have a passion for sharing knowledge and enjoy researching various topics? If you just said yes, you probably found the right category. Fact-based YouTube channels are a great way to learn new and intriguing facts about the world around us. The focus is typically on short, digestible facts across various topics like science, history, culture, literature, and more. So, if you are still wondering how to start a YouTube channel without showing your face, this category is a perfect option, as the focus is more on information and less on face-to-face interaction on the screen. You can produce content without having to appear on the camera because the format is less intimidating and allows for a broad range of topics, which maintains the freshness and diversity in content. One such example in this category is the YouTube channel \"Interesting Facts.\" It has 3.57 million subscribers and 118 videos where you can see a lot of interesting things. It also covers the content in a specific format of the top 10 list, which is a great idea if you are interested in similar content ideas. Business and Marketing It's a lucrative and engaging category if you have expertise or interest in business and marketing but prefer not to be on camera. You can discuss topics like market trends, business strategies, or business case studies, which are specific subcategories that typically attract a good number of viewers. MagnetsMedia is one of the best examples in this category. Created in 2018, this channel covers content on marketing, business, and success and has garnered over 1.21 million subscribers, which shows significant growth in the space. Some of the most popular videos on the channel typically revolve around business motivation and real-life case studies that are quite detailed and informative for someone interested in the domain. You, too, can take inspiration from this case and create a faceless YouTube channel, especially if you are genuinely interested in the business or marketing domain.

Virtual Tours This category has seen a significant rise in popularity as it lets people experience the world from the comfort of their homes. Don't trust?

Biography Videos Biography videos are another great yet easy choice if you want to start a YouTube channel without appearing on the screen. This genre specifically focuses on sharing stories about the lives of famous personalities, which typically requires using voiceovers and animations instead of a person speaking on the screen. \"Biographer,\" a popular YouTube channel with 255k subscribers, is one of the examples of successful faceless channels in this space.

Let's get into the nitty-gritty of creating a successful faceless YouTube channel, especially if you are new to it! Step 1: Select a Niche When you are starting a faceless YouTube channel, the first thing you need to do is select the right niche for your content. As easy as it sounds, it might be a bit difficult since there are so many things to consider while you are on it. Here are a few things you need to keep in mind while getting started. Explore Your Interests And Expertise The best way to clearly understand your niche is to start by exploring your interests and passions. For example, if you love technology, you can consider having a tech channel, but make sure to pick a sub-niche that can be profitable. Go Specific The more specific your content is, the better. Let's suppose you are interested in technology; consider narrowing it down to a sub-niche like personal audio Technology. El Jefe Reviews is a great example of this, focusing specifically on wireless earbuds, headphones, and speakers in the tech category. You can also check out our guide on how to find your niche as a YouTuber. Experiment And Evaluate Viewer Response Once you have some clarity on your niche, do not forget to experiment with different topics with it. This approach will help you fine-tune your niche depending on your target audience's preference. At this stage, make sure you ask yourself - What are my hobbies or areas of expertise that I can share without showing my face online? Is there a specific sub-niche within my area of interest that is unique or maybe underserved? What kind of faceless content am I excited to create and share with my audience regularly? Is there a sustainable and diverse range of topics I can cover in this niche? Step 2: Create a Content Strategy If you are wondering how to start a YouTube channel without showing a face, the next step is to create the right content strategy for your channel. Let's first understand what a content strategy means and why it is important. A content strategy is like a road map for creating and managing content that sits right with your channel's goals and audience interests. But here is the thing: it's not just about what you will create but also how and when you will share it. It is important because it helps you maintain focus, consistency, and relevance so that your channel grows and engages your audience effectively. Now that you might have gained a pretty clear idea of what a content strategy is, here's how you can prepare one: Define Your Channel Goals Start by setting clear expectations for your channel. These goals could be anything from becoming a full-time YouTuber and creating a steady revenue income to publishing high-quality videos regularly. Ultimately, these goals will guide the direction of your content and help you measure success in the long run. Research Your Target Audience The next important thing is to know your audience inside out. It's all about understanding their demographics (age, gender, location), psychographics (motivations, values, lifestyle), online behaviors (content preferences, social media usage), and offline behaviors (buying habits, hobbies). Once you have a clear idea about this, you can tailor your content to meet their preferences to ensure that it speaks to them. Research Competitors Looking at what other faceless YouTube channels are doing in your niche. Go through their channels, watch their videos, and understand the content types and how frequently they are posting. You can also go through the comment section to understand how the audience is reacting to a certain kind of content or opinion presented in the video. This will help you identify any gaps in the market and opportunities where you can create unique content and capture the attention. Plan Your Content Once your competitor research is done, the next thing you need to do is develop a content calendar. This schedule will outline what type of content you will post, when, and how often. You need to remember consistency is key, no matter what platform you are using. It becomes a special case for YouTube since the competition is always high. Creating this calendar will not only help you organize but also build audience anticipation for your upcoming videos. In the end, you need to ask yourself a few questions: Have I clearly defined my channel's goals? Are there specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound? Do I truly understand my target audience? Have they researched their demographics, the psychology they follow, and their online and offline behaviors? How does my content differ from my competitors? What unique value or perspectives am I offering that sets me apart? Is my content calendar realistic and sustainable? Can I consistently create and post content as per my schedule? How will I measure the success of my content strategy? Step 3: Create Faceless Videos Using invideo AI Once you have your content strategy ready, the next step is to create a video using AI for your no-face YouTube channel. For this step, we will be using invideo AI, which streamlines the whole process and makes it easier for you to make a faceless video within minutes. Follow the steps given below to understand how you can do it: 1. Sign up on invideo AI and create an account. 2. Give a detailed prompt mentioning how you want your video to turn out, the duration, your niche, language, tone, voiceover, CTA, and anything else you feel the need to add. Then click on \"Generate a Video.\" 3. When the process is completed, you will be asked if you want to make any changes to the prompt. If you feel like you want a few aspects of your video, like the audience, look, and feel, to be a bit different, you can change them here. Once done, click on \"Continue.\" 4. Next, you will be directed to the screen below, where the tool will process and give the final output in the next few seconds. 5. Once the video is ready, you will see a window, as demonstrated below, where you can add it if you want any changes or export it. Go to the edit section if you want to make any changes to the script. Alternatively, you can simply use the ‘magic box’ feature to give a prompt for any suggested changes. For example, “Please change the media for the second scene. The visual should show employees working productively.” Now, click on \"Generate\", and wait for a few seconds. Voilà! It looks perfect now. If you need any more changes, just give it a prompt or command and it’ll take care of those. 6. The final step is to download your video and see if it has turned out how you wanted it to be. Here are a few more things to note: You will be allowed to export up to 4 videos per week with a watermark. You can upgrade to a paid plan if you want to eliminate the watermark and export more. 7. Click on \"Continue\" to proceed, and you will now see the \"Download\" option.

Below are a couple of things you need to ensure for the same. Getting The Keywords Right The first and probably one of the most important aspects of optimizing your content is ensuring keyword optimization is on track. It's all about identifying and using specific words and phrases (keywords) that your potential users are most likely to type on the search bar when searching for specific content. In this case, you must align your video content with the keywords your target audience uses. Okay, and how to do it? Let's understand one by one. Primary Keywords: These are high-volume search terms that are directly related to your main topic. These keywords are often broad and highly competitive but usually have good search volume, which is why you must include these in your content. Secondary keywords: These are somewhat less competitive than primary keywords and are slightly more specific. Long tail keywords: These are very specific phrases with lower search volumes but high relevance and less competition. Longer keywords usually address specific queries or niches. So, how to find the right keywords for your content? You can use paid tools like vidIQ, SEMRush, and Ahrefs or you can explore YouTube's auto-complete features in the search bar to see what queries related to your topic pop up. To add more depth to your research, you can also check out competitor's videos to see what keywords they are targeting. When it comes to implementing these keywords, here's how you can proceed: Place your primary keyword close to the beginning of the title. The description can contain primary, secondary, and long-tail keywords, but ensure the placement does not look forced. It must naturally fit with the context of what your content is talking about. Include a mix of all types of keywords in the tags. You can include the primary keyword in your video file name before uploading it. Mention your keywords in your script because YouTube's algorithm can pick up spoken words as well. Let's take an example to understand: Suppose you are creating a video about \"Boost your productivity with these top tools.\" Your primary keyword might be \"productivity tools,\" while a secondary keyword could be \"best productivity apps 2023,\" and long tail keywords might include \"how to improve efficiency with productivity apps.\" The most important thing to remember here is that the key is to use these keywords in a way that feels organic and improves the viewer's understanding of your video content. On the other hand, if you overuse keywords, it looks spammy and negatively impacts the viewer's experience. Convert text to video with AI Just type in your idea to generate a video Get started for free Captions For SEO And Accessibility Captions are not just important for viewers with hearing impairments, but they also reach your video's SEO. By including keywords in your script (which will be reflected in the captions as well), you provide additional text for YouTube's algorithm to crawl, enhancing your content's discovery ability. Using Cards And End Screens These are powerful tools for keeping your audience engaged and helping them navigate through your channel. You can use cards to suggest related videos or promote your channel during the video. End screens, which appear in the last few seconds, are perfect for encouraging viewers to watch more of your content or subscribe to your channel. This is a pretty good strategy that boosts viewer retention and increases the likelihood of your content being recommended by YouTube's algorithm. Implementing Timestamps These work as a road map and help guide the viewers directly to the sections they are most interested in watching. This improves user experience by saving them time and effort while providing clear signals to YouTube about the structure and content of your video, which positively influences your SEO ranking. Select Appropriate Categories Choosing the right category for your video holds great importance. It helps YouTube understand the context and subject matter of your content, which is a categorization that plays a vital role in ensuring that your video is suggested to viewers most interested in similar topics. This potential increases your video's visibility and reach on the platform. Posting Regularly And Maintaining Consistency Consistency is one of those aspects of being a content creator that many people struggle with. They have the best content out there and a loyal following, but one thing that is stopping them from leading their game is consistency. Thus, it is important for a creator who is about to start a YouTube channel without showing face to build a loyal audience and signal to YouTube that your channel is active. Regularly update your video content, including titles and descriptions in thumbnails, and further refresh its appeal and relevance. This ongoing engagement with your content shows YouTube that you regularly provide valuable and updated content, which ultimately positively influences how your videos are ranked and suggested to viewers. Step 5: Find YouTube Monetization Opportunities The final step to follow if you are making YouTube videos without showing your face is to look for monetization opportunities. Let's look at how you can generate income from your channel. YouTube Partner Program It is a popular method for earning revenue if you create content online. By displaying ads in or around your videos, you can earn money each time a viewer watches or interacts with your ads. So, if you are looking for an option that requires minimal effort from your end, joining the YouTube Partner Program can be a good starting point for monetization. Make sure to check the eligibility and terms. Sponsorships Brand sponsorships are a highly lucrative option for YouTubers. Brands pay to promote their products through your channel, offering a more direct advertising approach than ads. However, it is important to know that successful sponsorships depend on how effectively you can attract relevant brands that align with your content and audience. This requires a substantial subscriber base and a well-defined audience, which takes its own time to establish. LIVE Stream For Super Stickers, Super Thanks, And Super Chat If you have included LIVE streaming in your content strategy, you can leverage YouTube's paid digital goods like Super Chat, Super Stickers, and Super Thanks to boost your income significantly. These features allow viewers to financially support your channel during LIVE streams, a more interactive and faster way to earn revenue. Creating A YouTube Channel Membership Another option you can go for is creating a YouTube channel membership – a way for your most dedicated subscribers to support you through a monthly fee. In exchange, they get exclusive perks like custom emojis, badges, and members-only content. This can create a stable, recurring revenue stream and also make a stronger sense of community around your channel. Using The Merchandise Shelf Leveraging the merchandise shelf helps you sell branded merchandise through your YouTube channel. One thing you need to note here is that this can be a more consistent and potentially lucrative option than ad revenue, especially if you have established a dedicated fanbase that is willing to purchase your branded products. Revenue From YouTube Premium YouTube premium viewers can also contribute to your earnings, as you can get a share of the subscription fee when they watch your content. This method can provide you with a supplementary income stream, which is less predictable and generally smaller as compared to other methods. Affiliate Marketing Affiliate marketing is another great way to generate income from your YouTube channel, where you earn a commission for each sale made through your affiliate link. This option is perfect if you can integrate product promotions organically into your content, and these products sit right in what your audience is interested in. All you need to do is join an affiliate marketing program, create relevant videos, and provide the product links in the description!

money online in my personal opinion but you might be stuck on choosing a niche cuz a lot of people get stuck at this point in fact this is the point where I most often get stuck when I'm starting new channels but luckily I've been doing this for almost a decade at this point and I can just straight up show you what are the best niches to do with doing this and in this video I'm going to be ranking 15 of the top faceless YouTube automation niches and I'm going to be putting them into what is known as a tier list a tier list is simply a list that goes from s and then a b c d with the S tier being the absolute best and the D tier being the worst s are the gold mines of YouTube automation niches so without further Ado let's get straight into it starting with Niche number one which is health and wellness this is a niche that will always be relevant on YouTube as long as we're biological humans which is for the foreseeable future at this point and for this reason it's a very Evergreen niche since people will always be interested in it there's a ton of demand tons of advertisers want to put ads on this type of content think of how many Health companies out there that you see ads for on YouTube and also think about the alternative monetization sources like affiliate marketing or selling your own health course and getting sponsored content from Health Brands and there's so many sub niches under this too like gaining muscle losing weight diets Health remedies and for ranking the side hustle I'm doing it based off of all of those factors and I'm going to be putting it at the a tier it's a great Niche and definitely definely something to think about if you're at all interested in doing this and channels like body Hub are a brilliant example of a faceless Channel within this Niche that gets millions of views per month and likely makes a lot of money now it's time for Niche number two which is finance and investing now finance and investing content with channels like Chris invest for example which are completely faceless he likely uses whiteboard animation software like videoscribe to help generate his videos these types of videos are not only Evergreen but they're also incredibly High CPM and I just wasn't aware of How High CPM this Niche can be until I created my personal channel here and I saw that channels have the potential of making 30 to even $50 per thousand views which beforehand I thought was impossible so it's high CPM Timeless potential people will always be interested and how to grow their money plus there significant affiliate marketing opportunities and for this reason I'm putting finance and investment related videos at the S tier of faceless automation channels now it's time for Niche number three which is Travel and Adventure over the past few years I've been traveling a ton myself I'm sitting right here in Costa Rica at an Airbnb and before I ever go anywhere new or sometimes if I'm not traveling and I just want to vicariously live through other people I look up travel related content I watch top 10 videos about the best things to do in particular places and take for instance this channel called world according to Briggs this is a channel that makes lists like this is completely faceless and does other types of content like the best countries to retire to and the worst cities and states in particular countes and there's even sub niches within this that talk about travel Finance like scary hary for example that talk about where money could go the furthest in the world and the best thing about this is you don't have to actually go out there and travel if you don't want to you can generate the content like world according to Briggs does with a voice over on the video and then primarily even stock footage content and one of the best places of getting stock content if you going to run a channel like this is from a website called story blocks.com which this video right here is actually brought to you by big thanks for story blocks for sponsoring this video and story block offers unlimited downloads of diverse and high quality media for one predictable subscription cost so if you're going to go out there and doing this you're looking for stock content make sure not to use one of those websites where you have to pay for every single piece of footage that you're using I just recommend using story blocks and I generally do not take sponsors on this channel but the only reason I took story blocks is because I've actually been using them for years and years and years within my YouTube businesses and I use them on almost all of my channels even on make money matth sometimes we overlay some stock content and it's always from story blocks plus any music in the background of videos story blocks is brilliant for that it's got every piece of stock content that you could ever want plus they now have Da Vinci resolve templates if you're using that to edit videos and to get started with unlimited stock media downloads at one set price feel free to head over to story blocks.com makemoney or simply check out the link down in the description and a lot of these channels that I'm going over today are using stock content within their videos so whatever Niche you're in I do think it's really good idea to join something like story blocks and get access to a huge library of Clips so you don't have to worry about that again you could just get Clips whenever you want so going back to the travel Niche it can certainly work it's a great Niche there's tons of demand in it a lot of people are interested in travel content as evidenced by channels like world according to breaks pulling in millions upon millions of views per month but that being said some individual locations are pretty Niche when it comes to travel and there can be seasonal demand when it comes to this Niche but that being said there are ways of making your content more applicable to a broad audience like world according to Briggs does and for all of these reasons combined I'm putting Travel and Adventure at the B tier this is definitely an amazing niche if this is something you're interested in Niche number four are compilation videos these are videos like taking Tik Tok compilations or even just videos from YouTube putting them all together into your own video and re-uploading on YouTube and a lot of channels do this they pull in millions of views doing so but there is a big problem and that problem is that a lot of these channels don't ever get monetized or even worse they get hit with copyright strike so for that reason I do not recommend compilation videos whatsoever unless you're making a compilation of your own videos or you're doing a compilation where you get permission from the people whose videos that you're using within your videos and channels like daily dose of Internet do just this and they do incredibly well but you just want to be careful if you're doing this and I don't suggest compilation videos whenever you use content within your own videos make sure you have an original voice over and script for your video and make sure to follow the guidelines of fair use so I'm putting compilation videos at the D tier of our tier list Niche number five is list videos and this is how I actually originally got my start on YouTube making top five and top 10 videos about all kinds of subjects and they can certainly work amazing I mean one of my main inspiration channels when I was just starting doing faceless channels myself was a channel called top fives which did all kinds of scary and mysterious top five videos and there's tons of channels out there like for example the finest which create top 10 videos on tons of different subjects and they pull in millions upon millions of views per month now you can do list videos on a variety of different niches but that being said most list videos are going to be entertainment based so that means you're relying pretty hard on just ad Revenue but you can pull in a ton of views for this reason I'm going to throw a list videos under the B tier Niche number six is mysterious videos channels like future Unity produce this type of content they get tons of views and if you go on future Unity you search their Channel within Spanish or espanol they have a whole another Channel pulling in millions of views per month and then you'll notice they translate their channel into almost every language and all of those pull in tons of views so there's definitely broad Market appeal across multiple languages for this Niche which is definitely something good going for it that being said cpms are going to be a little bit on the Lower Side It's Entertainment based there's not as many advertisers wanting to put their ads on mysterious videos and there's not really many products you can promote from a channel like this either whether it be your own products or doing affiliate marketing so monetization is a little bit limited it can be offset somewhat by the amount of views you can get and if you did promote a product it'd be something like merch where you barely make any money from it so I'm going to put mysterious videos under the C tier Niche number seven is luxury and high-end products this Niche covers the Finer Things in life like luxury cars watches designer Brands and whatever else comes to your mind when you think of luxury you can start a channel that talks about the most luxurious watches of all time or the top Mansions of the world's billionaires channels like King luxury do just this and they get over 8 million views per month which is crazy now cpms within this Niche are not going to be as high as a straight Finance channel that talks about financial topics however you can still do pretty well in terms of Revenue within this Niche and you can even promote affiliate products from it if you wanted to like make money online courses or something like that it's not going to be the best fit cuz a lot of people watch that kind of content just for entertainment and so therefore we'll give this a c tier rating D number eight is psychology and channels like Philosophy for life are a brilliant example of doing this these can get decent views there isn't a huge broad Market appeal for this type of content always depending on which Niche you're doing in like philosophies for Life primarily focuses on Ancient philosophers and like stoic philosophy and so I'm going to put this under the C tier Niche number nine is the make money online Niche now the funny part about mentioning the make money online Niche is the fact that you're watching a make money online Channel right now and at this point you might be saying but Matt you're in front of the camera I don't want to do that I just want to run a faceless Channel well if you scroll back on my first videos on make money mat you'll notice that they were completely faceless and I got to the point of making $27,000 per month selling a $100 course with this original Channel and I never even showed my face the make money online Niche is Evergreen plus I'm going to let you in on a little secret the cpms are really insane within this Niche like we're talking incredibly high and when I started doing this Niche I was shocked once I got this Channel monetized at how high they were because there's so many advertisers like myself for example who pay to put ads on this type of content so you can potentially do really well within it in terms of Revenue obviously don't do this Niche if it's not something you're personally interested in but when it comes to ranking it that's going to be a pretty high factor plus Evergreen demand plus they can get pretty decent views like you're not going to see it make money online Channel getting 100 million views per month but there are examples of them getting 5 to 10 million views per month and the massive cherry on top of this Niche is the fact that there's so many alternative monetization opportunities like for example sponsorships making your own course promoting another course like for example we have our course tube Mastery monetization which teaches how to run faceless YouTube channels up on digistore 24 people can sign up to Bronto as an affiliate and we've paid out well over $600,000 to Affiliates for doing so so the possibilities with earning within this Niche are basically endless and I'm placing this within the god tier of YouTube automation niches the S tier our next niche number 10 is self-improvement and I personally connect with this Niche a lot because if you know anything about me you know where I started from I was a broke teenager at the age of 13 I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life I basically went through a dark period in depression but what did really motivate me to improve myself was self-improvement content on YouTube and think about all the people you could help with in this Niche just leaving everything else aside it's really awesome just for that reason alone and channels like Charisma on command are a great example of a faceless channel that pulls in millions upon millions of views per month tons of affiliate get marketing opportunities within this Niche cpms are pretty decent as well and for all those factors combined I'm going to put it under the B tier Niche number 11 is Tech content channels like top 10 Zone and future Tech talk about tons of the newest Tech related gadgets without ever even stepping in front of a camera and also you can sign up for affiliate networks like the Amazon affiliate program and then put your affiliate link under your video so you can get a small percentage anytime someone goes under one of those videos and buys from it so there are some affiliate marketing opportunities the amount you make per sale on that is admittedly a little bit low compared to other niches out there where you can promote High payout partner products that pay out a lot more per sale like for example if you're promoting a course where you can get 50% of $1,000 and you get paid up $500 per sale that's not typically going to happen with a tech Channel but the demand is huge tech companies love sponsoring content cpms are high so I'm going to put it under the B tier it's a definitely a solid Niche definitely something to consider if you're at all interested in technology Niche number 12 for faceless YouTube automation niches is educ ational content these can be channels like real life Flor that talk about geography content and just interesting educational content in general or even channels like Brett in Tech which talk about different Technology reviews and they do educational content teaching people how to use some of the latest features on different computers and phones and everything you can teach people things like language learning coding or any other professional skills you might have and the awesome thing about this Niche is that you could download a free screen recorder like OBS record your screen doing it that's probably what Brett in Tech does for example and you can pull in a lot of views plus there's alternative monetization opportunities you could roll out your own course if you wanted to sponsored content is pretty big within this niche as well as affiliate marketing which would be pretty good for example one of my students Ki he runs an educational Channel teaching people about the best AI software out there for different uses and then he puts affiliate links to Al those software that he talks about and he's making over $10,000 per month with a pretty small Channel only getting like 60 to 100,000 views per month not to mention ad revenue is pretty good so for all these Reasons I'm throwing educational content up there at the B tier D number 13 is sports videos there's a lot of channels that do this the wrong way too though where they just re-upload different sports clips and while they can get a lot of views you'll typically not get monetized but channels like non-stop sports are doing things the right way where they have an original voice over on it and if I was personally going to do a sports channel I would focus mainly on like the lives of the players and behind the scenes and stuff like that with an original voice over on it because of said monetization and there's not too many alternative ways of monetizing this Niche either eventually you can get sponsorships and for all these reasons I'm putting it at the C tier Niche number 14 are scary story channels channels like Mr nightmare he pulls in millions of views per month that's awesome that being said not too many alternative monetization opportunities you could potentially get sponsored but realistically there's not many companies that are going to sponsor scary story videos unless your Channel's absolutely huge ad revenue is kind of limited but you can still make decent cpms depending on the topics of your scary stories for all these Reasons I'm putting it at the C tier Niche number 15 are animal videos channels like animal facts do just this there's a huge Market just think of how many times you've probably seen animal videos popping up on YouTube I love to watch videos of dogs for example but there can be limited monetization opportunities in the beginning even though that can be offset to a large degree by the amount of views you can get I'm going to put animal videos under the C tier Niche number 16 is 360 videos this is a bit of a unique one that I've talked about just once on my channel here before and channels like 3D VR 360 do this got tons of subscribers get millions of views and essentially the way 360 videos work is you'd have to pay an animator to create these 360° videos where on YouTube you can actually pan around the video and look around and you got to look up some of these 360 videos yourself just to see examples of this they can certainly get tons of views there's not too much competition within this Niche right now but that being said it's pretty expensive to create this type of content like you could be looking up there in the hundreds if not if not over $1,000 doar per video to get a really good animator to make content like this or you could pick up a 360 camera which aren't cheap either so it's expensive to create but can get a ton of views I'm going to put it at the C tier keep in mind there are channels within all these niches that are making a ton of money so take this with a grain of salt but that being said this is how I would rank it and if you want to see the finished tier list I will show it to you right now here is the finished tier list for YouTube automation faceless channels so you can take a look at it
