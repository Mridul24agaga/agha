AI videos can change how you approach content creation by making the process faster, more efficient, and often more affordable. Whether you’re a business looking to enhance your video marketing strategy or a creator aiming to produce engaging content, AI video generators offer an innovative solution that drastically reduces the complexity of video production. The trick, however, lies in personalization. While these tools excel in streamlining workflows, it’s important to customize your content to match your brand’s voice and goals. With the right AI video generator, you can maintain your creative vision while saving hours of editing time. These tools are designed to assist you, not replace the human touch, allowing you to focus on storytelling while the AI handles the technical heavy lifting. With so many options on the market, choosing the best AI video generator is crucial to maximize output and ensure high-quality results. Luckily, we have researched and compiled a list of the best. What is an AI Video Generator? An AI video generator is software that uses artificial intelligence technology to create engaging AI videos automatically. These tools can help anyone in the video creation, from newbies to advanced users. In simple terms, an AI video generator can perform different tasks such as: Generate video from text (e.g., automatically generate a video based on a video script). Generate animated videos from still images. Generate short video advertisements, social media videos, or instructional videos. Adding virtual characters and voices to videos. Automate video editing and post-production. How Do AI Video Generators Work? The computer science of how AI generates videos is beyond my understanding and, honestly, not what this article is about. But in simple terms, what I understand of it is: Machine learning, which is just ‘an extremely powerful computer’, knowing language on some robotic, mathematical level, scrapes the text and converts it into computer language: numbers. As computers understand everything in these terms, the combinations of numbers they receive from the text will correspond to number patterns within videos that express the same ideas as the text. They will match. It’s like turning a script into a movie, but instead of a director, you have an algorithm working its magic. Thus, a video is born. What Makes a Great AI Video Generator? The best AI video generator should allow you to do anything with it. Here’s what makes the best ones stand out: 1. Customization Whether you need lip-syncing, voiceovers, realistic facial expressions, or background music, these AI tools let you control every detail of the video creation process. From explainer videos to YouTube Shorts, you can customize AI-generated videos to match your brand, vibe, or even the tiniest detail you imagine. 2. Templates Library Great AI video makers come with pre-designed templates and models to spark your creativity. Need to craft a training video, tell an engaging story, or educational content? The library makes the entire process faster and more intuitive. All you need is to pick a template, and you’re halfway there. The templates aren’t just about speed; they’re about turning your ideas into video content that pops. 3. Smart Subtitles and Captions Want to go global? Many top-tier AI video generators support language translations, making adding multilingual subtitles and even translating your content easy. Whether you’re creating videos for social media platforms or a worldwide audience, these AI tools help you speak everyone’s language. 4. Effortless Ease of Use Nobody wants an AI tool that feels like homework. The best AI video editors are intuitive and designed to simplify the process. No steep learning curves or endless tweaking but straightforward tools that help you create professional-quality videos faster. 5. Picture-Perfect Quality High-quality videos are a must, and these tools deliver. Export videos in HD, 4K, or whatever format you need without compromising quality. Some even offer video upscaling, so your finished product looks sleek and polished on any screen. Why Use AI Video Generators? Now that we know what an AI video generator is let’s examine the advantages of using the best one in your video production process. 1. Efficiency and Time Savings Using the best AI video generators will help you save time and mostly money while increasing your video content output. Note that we said ‘increasing’ since an AI video generator should not be your only way of making video content. The technology is not that good yet, and most consumers can tell the difference between AI-generated videos and videos created by experts. That said, unlike traditional editing, which requires hours of painstaking work, AI-powered tools allow you to create polished videos quickly without advanced editing skills. This speeds up the video creation process, enabling you to deliver fresh content to multiple platforms without delay. 2. Consistency and Error Reduction AI generators also provide consistency and error reduction. With AI, you get high-quality, error-free content every time. The technology ensures that even the finer details, such as subtitles and metadata, are accurate and consistent, making it ideal for everything from training videos to YouTube content. Feel free to use AI video generators to turn your blog posts into videos or create fun, short-lived social media content. However, when crafting that important explainer video that introduces your brand to the world, you might want to consider a more personal touch. 3. Versatility Lastly, AI video generators are incredibly versatile. Whether you need a video in Quicktime format for Apple users or a Windows Media file for Microsoft users, AI tools can handle a range of formats. With customizable templates and transitions, you can personalize your videos, allowing you to create content that aligns perfectly with your vision. What Types of Videos can I make with these Tools? AI text-to-video technology simplifies the creation of high-quality videos for various business purposes. Here’s how you can use it: Explainer Videos: Simplify complex concepts with engaging animations, natural text-to-speech voiceovers, and clear visuals. Perfect for showcasing products or ideas in your media projects. Training Videos: Deliver interactive, customizable AI-generated content to onboard customers or train employees. From step-by-step processes to educational tutorials, create videos with ease and professional quality. Product Promos: Use the best AI video generator to visually highlight your products, capture attention on social media platforms, and drive sales. Add brand identity and voiceovers to every project. How-To Videos: Generate AI videos to create impactful instructional content. Present clear, step-by-step visuals with narrations or AI avatars, making learning accessible for viewers.

HeyGen: Best AI Video Generator for Personalized Video Experiences HeyGen emerges as a promising AI video generator tailored for businesses and content creators aiming to streamline their video creation process. This tool is designed to simplify crafting professional-quality videos, offering features that cater to both seasoned creators and beginners. With HeyGen, users have two straightforward options for creating video scripts: utilizing the built-in GPT Writer or simply pasting an existing script. The platform’s standout feature is its library of over 120 AI avatars representing various ages and poses, making it perfect for crafting engaging spokesperson videos or internal announcements. The pre-made video templates, complete with text, images, avatars, and music, further accelerate the video creation process. One of HeyGen’s highlights is its extensive library of 300+ AI voices across 40 languages for seamless text-to-speech conversion. The voice cloning feature adds an extra layer of personalization, offering realistic human voice replication, though this feature is reserved for paid plans. Additionally, captions can be added effortlessly to enhance accessibility. However, the user experience comes with a learning curve. Initially, the interface may feel less intuitive, and understanding certain functions, such as audio syncing with avatars, can be a challenge. For instance, lipsyncing accuracy is only visible after submitting the video, but the results are impressively realistic and add a professional touch. While HeyGen offers a free plan, it’s worth noting that it provides only one credit for video generation, which may be limiting for those looking to explore the platform extensively. Despite this, HeyGen holds immense potential for businesses to create polished spokesperson videos, internal communications, or engaging marketing content with minimal effort. Pricing Free- $0 Creator- $29/month Team- $89/mo/seat Enterprise- Contact sales 15.

One standout feature is Colour Match. It addresses color inconsistencies by seamlessly aligning hues across different clips, making it indispensable for multi-camera setups. For social media enthusiasts, the Auto Reframe tool is a game-changer, effortlessly converting 16:9 horizontal videos into 9:16 vertical formats tailored for Instagram Stories or YouTube Shorts. Interview editors will appreciate the auto audio ducking feature, which smartly adjusts background music volume during dialogue, ensuring clarity without manual tweaking. At the heart of these tools is Adobe Sensei, the AI engine driving innovations like Auto Classification for efficient tagging and Morph Cut for smoothing jump cuts. Even without its AI-enhanced capabilities, Premiere Pro remains a leading video editing software, offering a robust suite of tools for creators.

But while AI brings speed and efficiency, it also presents challenges, such as balancing automation with authentic human storytelling. This guide dives into the pros and cons of using full-scale AI video generator tools, real-world scenarios where these tools are best leveraged, and most importantly, a list of the best AI video generators on the market today. Copy Link Author Isaiah Shelton Updated on November 22, 2024 Copy Link TABLE OF CONTENTS TABLE OF CONTENTS How AI Has Changed the Video Production Industry The Pros of Leveraging AI In Video Production The Challenges of Leveraging AI In Video Production When to Use an AI Video Generator The Best AI Video Generators (2025) InVideo Synthesia Runway Veed.io Pictory DeepBrain AI Elai.io HeyGen Lumen5 Designs.ai How AI Has Changed the Video Production Industry In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has dramatically reshaped the video production landscape. From automating tedious editing tasks to generating scripts and even entire videos with text-to-video generators, AI has introduced a new layer of efficiency and creativity into the industry. As AI tools become more accessible, many companies have adopted them to streamline workflows and produce content faster than ever before. However, while this technology offers several advantages, it’s important to recognize that its impact on video production comes with both opportunities and challenges. The Pros of Leveraging AI In Video Production One of the key benefits AI brings to the table is its ability to automate the more mundane and time-consuming aspects of production. For example, AI can be used to generate scripts, edit footage, and even handle administrative tasks like scheduling and call sheets. At Lemonlight, we embrace AI to enhance our pre-production process through our proprietary platform, HERO. By leveraging AI to automate tasks such as generating production documents in real-time, we’ve been able to reduce production timelines significantly, allowing our creative teams to focus on what truly matters—crafting meaningful and engaging video content that resonates with audiences. The Challenges of Leveraging AI In Video Production However, while AI has made significant strides in optimizing the production process, it’s important to acknowledge its limitations. When overused or relied on entirely, AI-generated content can often feel impersonal and lack the nuance of human creativity. Videos produced solely by AI video generators may look polished, but they can miss the authenticity and emotional depth that audiences crave. We recognize this delicate balance at Lemonlight. While AI helps us work more efficiently, it is never a replacement the human ingenuity that drives the success of our videos and keeps our clients happy. Our team of experienced creatives ensures that every video we produce maintains the authenticity and emotional resonance that only human-led storytelling can achieve. When to Use an AI Video Generator There are times when using an AI video generator may be the right fit, particularly for companies with specific needs or limited resources. While these tools can’t replace the expertise and creativity of a professional production team, they can provide value in certain use cases. Here are three scenarios where it might make sense to leverage an AI video generator company: Low-Budget, High-Volume Content Creation When companies need to produce a large volume of content quickly and at a lower cost, an AI video generator can be a useful tool. If the content is relatively straightforward and doesn’t require complex storytelling, an AI generator can help companies meet tight deadlines and budget constraints without sacrificing output. Test Campaigns or Prototypes AI video generators are ideal for companies running test campaigns or experimenting with new content formats. If you’re launching an A/B test to evaluate different messaging or trying out a new video style, AI-generated videos can serve as a cost-effective way to gather data before investing in a professionally produced video. This approach allows companies to iterate quickly and gather audience insights before committing to a full production. Internal or Informational Videos Internal communication videos—such as training modules, company updates, or informational briefings—don’t always require the same level of polish as externally-facing content. In these cases, an AI video generator can provide a quick and easy way to produce content that gets the job done without the need for extensive creative direction. For businesses needing rapid turnaround for informational purposes, AI video tools offer a practical solution. Ultimately, AI is a powerful tool in the video production process, but it works best when used in harmony with human creativity. As you explore the best AI video generator companies below, consider both the benefits and potential drawbacks of using AI in your video content strategy. At the end of the day, the most impactful videos combine the best of both worlds—efficient production processes powered by AI and the irreplaceable touch of human creativity. The Best AI Video Generators (2025) So you’ve decided to give AI video generators a shot, but where do you start? With the market currently flooded with options (and more on the way), it can be intimidating for novice users to decide which tool is best for their needs. That’s where we come in. Although Lemonlight champions the importance of human creativity in video production, we understand as thought leaders that it’s important to stay up-to-date about the newest technologies in the industry. That’s why we put together this list to hopefully help you on your search. Each tool offers its own set of advantages, but we feel there should be something for everyone here. Enjoy!

Today we're going to look at the five best AI video generators. These tools let you turn simple text into stunning visuals, and many of these are free to try. So, you could follow along. I partnered with Zapier on this video, so let's check these out. First up, we have Synthesia. This is a powerful AI video generator that lets you create videos using realistic AI avatars and voiceovers in over 140 different languages. Synthesia offers a free plan so you can test it out. You get three minutes of video generation per month. And I know that's not very much; however, it is enough to get a feel for whether you want to shell out $18 per month for the starter plan. With free, you get nine AI avatars, and if you go with one of the paid plans, you get lots more video generation and also many more different avatars to choose from. Once you finish signing up, you'll land here in the main Synthesia workspace, and building an AI avatar video is very similar to pulling together a PowerPoint presentation. Right up on top, you can start a new video from a template or from scratch. You can also turn files and links into a video. You can dub a video or translate a video into another language, and over here, you can even turn a PowerPoint presentation into a video. Let's test this out with just a blank canvas. Let's click on this option. Here, we see lots of different templates with AI avatars, and keep in mind, we can customize all of these avatars, and we can also specify what the avatar should say. Right up on top, let's go with this new one right here. Let's click on Use Template. This drops us into the editor that you can use to build out your AI avatar video. Over on the left-hand side, you can add additional scenes. This is kind of like PowerPoint, where you could add additional slides to your presentation. Here, we see a few different examples. I'll click out of this. Over here, we have the main scene. You can click within the scene, and you can edit any of these different objects. For example, I could edit the text. Over here, I could select this shape. Up on top, you can also add additional objects to your slide. For example, you can add another avatar. You can add text, shapes, media, and you can even record your screen. When you select any of the objects in your scene, for example, I selected the AI avatar, over on the right-hand side, we have all the different properties related to this avatar. Let's say that maybe I want to change out the avatar. Here, I could click on Alex, and I could see all the different options. I'm on a free plan, so I'm limited by what I can choose, but you get a feel for all the different options that are here. For now, I'll stick with Alex. And here, we could adjust other properties as well. Now, down at the bottom, I can also see the talk track that the avatar will say within this scene. So over here, let's delete the text that's just placed here, and let me type in my own. Welcome to the Kevin Cookie Company. I'll have Alex say this. Now, up on top, we can preview her saying this text, or I could also generate it where it'll turn this into a video and she'll actually speak this text. Let's test that out. Once the video is all done generating, let's preview how it turned out. Welcome to the Kevin Cookie Company, where we believe that every great day starts with a cookie. We're thrilled to have you on board as part of our growing team. Let's now take this to the next level by automating video creation using Synthesia. Zapier connects Synthesia to thousands of apps. You can get started with Zapier for free at the link below. You can set it up so when you get a new lead in an app like HubSpot, Zapier detects this and then triggers Synthesia to generate a personalized video. Then Zapier can connect to your email and automatically send this video to the lead. The lead gets a customized video from you without needing your involvement. This isn't something that you could do with just HubSpot or just Synthesia. It's the connection that Zapier makes between all of these different apps. With Zapier, you can connect apps like Synthesia to Trello, ClickUp, Google Sheets, Monday.com, and thousands more, even if the apps weren't designed to speak with one another. Zapier lets you set up these automations just by describing what you need. No coding needed. At number two, we have Sora. This is OpenAI's video generation tool. You'll need a premium subscription starting at $20 per month to be able to use it. Once you finish signing up, you'll land here in the main Sora interface. Sora is a generative AI tool. What that means is it's generating new video based on all of its training data. Over on the left-hand side, we land in the featured view and here we can see all sorts of different videos that other Sora users have pulled together. Over on the right-hand side, I see one of a mouse with some interesting ears. If I'm curious about what type of prompt someone typed in to get this video clip, here I could click on it. This opens up a larger view of that video and down at the bottom, I can see the prompt. Maybe that serves as some inspiration. I'll close out of this view. Back on the main screen, we have what's called the composer and this is where you can describe the video that you would like Sora to make. I'll type in a description, a warm and cozy Kevin Cookie Company shop filled with freshly baked cookies. Down below, we have a few different options. Over here, you can upload an image if you'd like to incorporate that into the video. You could also set the style of your video, the aspect ratio, the resolution, also the length of the clip. With the $20 per month plan, you can only generate up to 10 seconds and you need a higher plan if you would like additional time. Over here, you could also select the number of variations. I'll stick with two and then you also have a storyboard option if you would like more control over what happens within the generated clip. For now, I'm good with just this prompt. So over here, let's send that to Sora. And once it's all done, you can preview how the clips turned out and look at all of that steam coming out of the cookies. You might want to wait a minute or two before you take a bite. At the very bottom, you have a few different options. You could go back, you could edit the prompt again. You could also recut it. Maybe you want to extend the clip. Here, you could remix it if you want to change anything that appears within the clip. For example, maybe instead of having these jars, I want a different shape to show up. You could also blend two different clips together and here you could set it up as a looping clip. Let's say you really like one of these clips and you'd like to download it. Here, I could simply click on the clip and right up on top, we have the option to download. Third on our list is invideo AI V3. This is a generative AI tool that creates full length videos rather than short clips like Sora. invideo offers a variety of different plans and you can get started for free and you get a generous 10 minutes per week of AI generation. So, what does that mean? You can type in a prompt for the video that you would like to create, it'll write a script, generate voiceovers, and also find matching stock media. However, it won't generate any new clips from scratch using AI. For that, you need one of the premium plans. You have the plus plan and the max plan which give you 60 seconds of generative credits. That's not very much, so if you're planning on creating lots of clips from scratch using AI, you'll have to go with the generative plan which starts at $96 per month and that gives you 15 minutes of generative credits. I'm now here in the main interface and we have a text field where you can type in your prompts for the video that you would like to create. Now, the beautiful thing is you can type in anything that you've ever imagined and using generative AI invideo will make it for you. So, it makes video creation accessible to anyone. Let's test this out. Create a 30 second ad video for YouTube promoting the Kevin Cookie Company. Use a friendly teddy bear as the mascot. Use wide cinematic shots and close-ups of chocolate chip cookies from time to time. Let's see what it comes back with. On this next screen, we can choose whether we want to use stock media or generative media. Again, with generative media, the AI is creating the video clips from scratch. We have a few different settings here. I think all these look good, so let's continue. It finished generating the video, let's now preview how it turned out. In a world of rushing and noise, there’s a place where warmth awaits. Meet our cuddly bear who knows the best moments are shared. Hehe. With finest ingredients, and a dash of magic, we bake cookies that bring people together, Kevin Cookie Company, where every bite tells a story. Mmm. Visit KevinCookieCompany.com and taste the love today. That is very impressive. I really liked how it turned out. Down below, we could also continue refining the video simply by using natural language and the AI will make changes. So, let's test this out. Use epic rock music as the background music and let's see if it can make that change. Let's have a quick listen. I'll go back just a little bit and let's play it. Mmm. Visit KevinCookieCompany.com and taste the love today. It's subtle, but I like it. Once you're ready to download, simply click on the download icon. Here, you could select various settings. I'll go with 1080p and let's continue and we now have a finalized video. At number four, we have Pika. An accessible and also fun AI video tool that's free to try. Once you finish signing up for an account, you'll land here on the main Pika interface.

With a paid account, which starts at $8 per month, you get access to their more advanced models, which they say have better motion and Pika scene support. So, let's go with 1.5 with a free account to test it out. Underneath the text field, Pika offers a few different modes. For example, we have something called Pikaffect and when I click on that you can upload a video or photo and then you can apply different effects to that video. For example, one of my favorites. You can generate a proposal video. Try pulling that one on your girlfriend. That'd be a lot of fun. Over here, you have something called Pikascenes. This is where you can upload a character an object or location and it'll use that as part of your AI generated video. And lastly, there's also something called Pikaddition. You can upload a video and a photo and it'll incorporate that photo into your video. Let's test this one out because I think it's a lot of fun. Let me select a video and over here. I'll select an image. Now that I've selected both a video and an image, let's combine them. Down below, let's click on this icon. And let's now play the video. Not bad. Next up is Runway ML.

Down below we can now describe the shot that we would like. I'll type in some text. This person works at a cookie store and is serving fresh cookies to customers. Down below we have a variety of different settings. As an example, here you can control the camera. I'll leave it set to the defaults. You can adjust the aspect ratio. Down below, you can select the model and also how long you want the clip to be. With Runway ML, you can only select up to 10 seconds. For now, I'll leave it set to 5 and then let's click on generate. Over on the right-hand side, it's now generated our video. Let's play back to see how it turned out. There's the picture input and here's the output. Look at that. He looks a little bit like me. Not exactly, but pretty close, and it also has the red shirt. It's a polo shirt, so it doesn't match my shirt, but that's pretty close. I like that. Right over here.

I hope you enjoyed this article and that it got you excited about AI video generation. Now is a great time to explore these tools and see how you can use them to improve your work! FAQs How do AI video generators handle different languages and dialects? Many AI video generators, like Synthesia and Deepbrain AI, support multiple languages by using sophisticated natural language processing models. However, handling regional dialects and accents can be more challenging. These tools often rely on extensive training data to accurately mimic accents and dialects. The quality of the generated speech can vary depending on the available data and the specific AI model used. Can AI video generators be used for live video content creation? While AI video generators are primarily used for pre-recorded content, there is ongoing research and development on using AI for live video production. Tools that can generate live video content need to process data in real time, which is a complex and resource-intensive task. Current technology is still evolving in this area, but advancements in real-time AI processing could make live AI-generated videos more feasible in the future. What are the data privacy implications of using AI video generators? Data privacy is definitely a concern with AI video generators. These tools often require access to large datasets, which can include personal data, to work well. Companies like DeepMind and OpenAI implement strict data privacy policies and use anonymization techniques to protect user data. Also, users should be aware of the privacy policies of the AI tools they use and take steps to safeguard their data, such as using secure networks and avoiding the sharing of sensitive information. How do AI video generators integrate with existing video editing software? Many AI video generators are designed to integrate seamlessly with popular video editing software. For example, RunwayML offers plugins and APIs that can be used with Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects, which allows users to incorporate AI-generated content directly into their video editing workflow. What are the ethical considerations when using AI to create videos? One major concern is the potential for creating deepfakes or misleading content, which can spread misinformation. It's important for users to adhere to ethical guidelines, such as clearly labeling AI-generated content and avoiding the creation of harmful or deceptive videos. Creators should be mindful of issues related to copyright and consent, and they need to make sure that the use of AI does not infringe on the rights of others or violate privacy.

Now, these aren’t (yet) as advanced as AI image generators, so don’t think you can just type “make a new Star Wars movie,” and it will create a blockbuster for you. Instead, what they do is automate many of the tasks involved in video editing, such as cutting footage to insert, re-ordering scenes, adding audio effects, generating captions, and adding avatars, graphics, or animations. However, they are becoming more powerful and flexible by the day, so who knows what they will be capable of soon? Whether you want to speed up the process of making corporate how-to videos or try your hand at becoming the next Stanley Kubrick, here’s a rundown of some of the top generative AI platforms for creating and editing videos today. PROMOTED Five Of My Favorite Generative AI Video Tools Synthesia Synthesia is a generative AI video tool that is particularly great when it comes to creating digital avatars and bringing them to life with realistic voice and animation. It’s used by businesses to create training materials as well as by marketers for promotional and advertising content, and it would also be a great choice for educational videos. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne, Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton, Contributor The avatars it creates can speak in multiple languages and accents, with convincingly human gestures and facial expressions. This means it’s easy to create content and then quickly localize it for different markets, products and services. It’s relatively easy to use – you simply type the script and hear it spoken back to you. Like many of the tools here, it offers a free account that gives you access to many of the basic features, meaning you can easily find out if it’s right for you before spending any money.

More Newsletters Descript Descript is something of a disruptive player in the generative video market as a startup launched by one of the co-founders of Groupon. By gaining a reputation as a powerful tool for social media content creators and TikTok kids, it’s hit a marketing sweet spot, but it’s also used across a wide range of corporate and educational use cases. Descript users start with a script and then build their video out from there. You just pull in footage that can be manipulated and enhanced with AI, as well as audio that can be imported or generated from text, mimicking the user’s voice. You can then edit and re-arrange the timeline simply by snipping and moving the text. Descript stands out from other AI video editing tools – particularly ones that are available free online – with its user-friendliness and range of features. Everything is set up to make it quick for anybody to start producing and editing videos. Handy features such as eye-contact correction and “one-click” studio-quality sound are signs that the team is looking to add valuable innovations as the tool evolves. Adobe Premiere Pro with Sensei Another example of an industry-standard tool being given a generative AI makeover for the modern age. Adobe Premiere Pro has long been a video editing tool of choice for professionals and enthusiasts and now has a suite of new features powered by Adobe’s Sensei generative AI platform. Functions like transcription, inserting and re-ordering scenes, color correction, and audio adjustment, such as remixing music to match the timing of visuals, can now be streamlined and automated using natural language. It also has a text-to-speech feature that simplifies the process of creating captions and transcripts. This reduces the time that creators need to spend on manual tasks, allowing them to focus on more creative elements of their work. Adobe is going all-in on generative AI, adding tools and capabilities across its entire Creative Cloud suite, and video production is just one area where it is leading the field today. Pictory Pictory aims to automate the process of turning scripts and blogs into videos with minimal user effort. It’s great for those who want to make quick, snappy videos for marketing or just for fun. It can also be used by educators and online course creators to make lively learning material. One of the tasks it specializes in is automatically creating highlight reels showcasing the most important, exciting or interesting moments from longer videos. It then makes it simple to quickly repurpose them as trailers or social clips to engage more viewers. Generative AI is clearly going to make a big splash in the world of marketing, and there are plenty of tools designed to fit the needs of marketers. User-friendliness is a key feature of this platform, which focuses on making it simple to create the type of videos that millions of businesses across the world need every day. Runway Runway is different from the other platforms I’ve highlighted here because it does – to an extent – offer straightforward text-to-video generative AI. This means you can type “Sun rising over a beach at sunset,” and it will create a completely synthetic video. Alternatively, you can upload an image and bring it to life. When I tried it, the results were sometimes not exactly what I was hoping for, but they were impressive nonetheless, and it’s mind-boggling to think what this technology might be capable of in the not-too-distant future. As with ChatGPT and any generative AI tool with language-based input, the results can be greatly improved by taking some time to learn about the best ways to communicate what you want it to do.

From client testimonials to product demos, company overviews, and traditional commercials, videos are a powerful way to communicate online. But production can be time-consuming, and you might lack the technical skills to create high-quality content. AI video editors aim to automate the creation process and make it more convenient to use video as part of your marketing strategy. Some solutions even offer features to improve SEO or make your content more accessible. On this page, we’ll share five expert tips to leverage AI in your video strategy. Then, we’ll share some of the best AI video editors on the market today. Let’s jump right in! Essential features to look for in an AI video editor Now that you know some of the many ways AI can help with video production, let’s narrow our focus to today’s star: AI-powered video editing software. Here are some of the key features to look for: Automated video creation. The best AI video editors enable you to quickly produce videos from long-form content, PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, and more. Customizable presenters. There’s no need to hire actors and purchase cameras when you can use AI avatars or voiceovers. Better yet, you can often change the appearance, voice, language, and other settings to match your requirements. Multi-platform optimization. Once you’re done editing, you should be able to share videos directly across multiple social networks. This means that your video editor should be able to optimize the shape, size, and format of videos for each platform. Real-time previews. Whatever changes you apply to your video, the content should update instantly in the editor so that you can preview the new version. SEO features. Good AI video editors also come with SEO features like keyword research and optimization for tags, titles, descriptions, and more. Automated content analysis. It’s important to choose a program that enhances the efficiency and creativity of video production. Therefore, you’ll want to look for features like label detection, face detection, and object tracking. A review of the best AI video editors Now we’re ready to discuss the best AI video editors. Let’s get straight into the top ten options. 1. Synthesia Synthesia is one of the most well-known names in the industry, and has partnered with corporations like Heineken, Zoom, and Xerox. You can use the tool to auto-generate studio-quality videos from a range of sources including PowerPoint presentations, websites, PDF files, and even simple text. With a strong focus on ease and convenience, you’ll find the process very straightforward. Once you generate a script from your source material, you’re able to replace the AI avatar, colors, fonts, and layouts, share the clip with colleagues or clients, and embed videos anywhere. One of the standout aspects of Synthesia is that there are tons of customization options. If you don’t want to use avatars, you can access voiceovers in over 130 languages. Plus, you can clone your own voice and generate closed captions to maximize accessibility. Key features Over 160 avatars Over 130 languages with one-click translations Options to create your own avatar or clone your own voice Closed captions Aspect ratios Screen recorder Over 300 pre-designed templates Millions of royalty-free images, icons, soundtracks, and videos Live collaboration with reviews and comments Brand kit Video embeds Video analytics Pros Very easy to use Highly customizable avatars One of the only AI video editors that lets you track video performance Regular updates Cons Unused monthly minutes don’t carry over Not suitable for long-form educational or corporate content as the best available plan is still limited to 30 minutes a month Ease of use Synthesia is very easy to use, and since there’s a free option, you can try out the tool without even needing to hand over your credit card details. From start to finish, the process only takes a few minutes. To begin, you’ll upload a document or insert a link to a page you want to use as the basis of your script. Then, you’ll enter the customization phase, where you can swap out the avatar. You’re also able to share the video with clients or colleagues before you export it from the editor (via link or embed). The tool works great for industries like education, sales, information security, customer service, and more. Price You can use Synthesia for free, but this option is limited to 36 minutes of video per year, 60 templates, and six avatars. Paid plans start at $22 a month, but you can reduce this cost by paying yearly. 2. Pictory Primarily aimed at content marketers, Pictory offers plenty of features that enable you to cut down on the time it takes to create quality content. You can generate videos from text, images, scripts, and blog posts. Not only can you auto-create video, you can also instantly gain subtitles, captions, and transcriptions. Plus, Pictory provides a range of different video makers and templates depending on where your content will be published. You’ll find options for social media videos (including Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn), product videos, promo videos, educational videos, and more. The audio-to-text option also makes it possible for users with visual impairments to create shareable videos. Key features A brand kit Millions of royalty-free videos 15,000 music tracks 51 hyper realistic AI voices from ElevenLabs 60 text-to-speech AI voices, covering 29 languages Sharing and collaboration features Bulk video downloads Automatic subtitles Automatic video highlights Six video export options Free online courses Pros A user-friendly interface Excellent customer service A great selection of avatars and voices Cons It’s one of the more expensive options (with no free plan) Some customers have encountered performance issues Ease of use Pictory makes it simple to generate videos or repurpose long videos into catchy bite-sized ones. All you have to do is import your footage into the platform. Then, you can customize the video, which doesn’t require any expert editing skills. You can easily locate elements, audio, visuals, styles, and more using the left-hand sidebar. In addition to simplifying the video editing process, Pictory also offers a library of tutorials to help you get to grips with the platform. Price There’s no free Pictory plan, but it does offer a 14-day money-back guarantee. Plus, there’s a free trial that lets you create three video projects. After that, plans start at $19 per month, but if you want to collaborate with team members, you’ll need a Teams plan which costs $99 per month. 3. Descript Descript is another well-established name in the AI video editor industry. Not only do you get access to a feature-rich editor, but you can also auto-edit podcasts, which makes this a great tool for content creators. You can repurpose existing content as clips using a range of templates, transcribe videos with powerful correction features, and instantly capture screen recordings. You’ll also get a suite of powerful tools. Some of these options enable you to remove backgrounds, type over dialogue to correct mispronunciations, and even rotate eyeballs to direct them at the camera. Additionally, Descript highlights moments to create social content or teasers in different ratios, sizes, and formats. Key features Multi-language transcription in 23 languages Speaker detection Filler word removal Green screen compatibility Eye contact correction Dynamic captions AI voices Video and screen recording Stock templates Live collaboration and commenting Shareable pages and links A social post writer Unscripted recordings Pros An intuitive interface that feels like editing a document Lots of free resources and a helpful community Ethical implementation of AI technology Cons The accuracy of transcriptions could be better, especially with name identification Loading times are a bit slow Template options are handy, but the selection is quite limited Ease of use Descript prides itself on its easy-to-use editor that looks and feels like editing documents. You’ll find a variety of settings in the right-hand sidebar where you can add captions, change layouts, select colors, and apply effects. Better yet, some settings like the green screen feature come with easy toggles so that you can enable them with just one tap. And, since you can create chapters and remove retakes, it’s a great choice for podcasters and YouTubers. Price Descript offers a free plan, but it’s limited to one transcription hour, one remote recording, and one watermark-free export per month. Paid plans start at $12 per user per month, but to unlock all AI effects, you’ll need the Pro plan, which costs $24 per user per month. 4. Runway ML Runway is an AI research company that focuses specifically on the creative industry. Their Gen-1 editor lets you upload existing clips or shoot a new video directly in the mobile app. Then, you can select an image, write a text prompt, or choose a style preset before accessing advanced settings like structural consistency. The Gen-2 editor goes a step further by letting you generate videos from text and images. After that, you can apply options like motion brush, lip sync, upscale, frame interpolation, and more. Besides being a more technical AI video editor, you can only create videos up to 16 seconds in length, which makes it best for short social clips or animated videos. Overall, this tool is best suited for those with a background in video production or at least some industry experience. Key features Text-to-video creation Image-to-video creation Upscale resolution Green screen compatibility 3D texture options Custom AI generators Custom voices for lip sync and text-to-speech Different export options Configurable team spaces Video analytics Pros Unique features like the lip sync functionality The ability to edit on-the-go with the mobile app Cons Even the “unlimited” plan actually has credit restrictions (although you can buy more credits) Some customers report unreliable text prompts Ease of use Unlike other AI video editors, Runway comes with a steep learning curve. While it won’t take too long for creatives with video production experience to get comfortable with the editing process, most beginners will be completely unfamiliar with terms like frame interpolation. That said, there is plenty of blog content that features detailed tutorials on how to use each of the options. Additionally, you can get started with footage packs (that work a bit like templates), if you don’t want to create videos from scratch. Price Runway offers a limited free plan of 125 credits (with no option to buy more). Plus, you can’t upscale resolutions or remove watermarks. Therefore, you might prefer the Standard plan which costs $12 per user per month. If you want to remove all restrictions, the Unlimited plan costs $76 per user per month. 5. Vidyo.ai Vidyo is one of the best AI video editors if you want to quickly generate short social clips. It’s primarily designed for podcasters, content creators, and marketers. And, with a strong emphasis on speed, you’ll find many handy one-click settings. You can instantly generate subtitles, insert templates, split screen views, add brand kit outros, and auto-generate descriptions. You might even repurpose video content into show notes, social content, and blog posts. Since Vidyo is designed for social platforms, you can immediately publish work to LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. With the power of AI, you’re able to remove filler words and awkward pauses to make your videos more captivating. Key features AI captions Instant video resizing Video clipping tools Social media templates Virality predictions Clip auto-generation from computer files or links from YouTube, Dropbox, or Drive Custom brand templates Auto-detection of highlights and chapters Video data retention Full video transcripts Six export options Pros Simple to use Great for very short videos Excellent performance Cons A limited free plan that only allows one video upload at a time May be too simplistic for those looking for deep customization or very precise control over the video editing workflow Ease of use Since the aim of Vidyo is to help you launch engaging short-form content for social media, the process is very simple. All you have to do is upload a computer file, or insert a link from YouTube, Drive, or Dropbox. After that, you can set your preferences for formats, platforms, and templates. To save time, the AI-powered tool automatically selects, edits, and captions moments from your video. Plus, you can customize the clips before you download them or share them straight to social media. Price The Vidyo free plan is limited to 75 minutes per month, and you can only publish directly to TikTok. After that, there are two paid options at $29 per month and $41 per month. Or, you can access custom pricing options which usually range from $60-$90 per month. 6. Raw Shorts Raw Shorts is an AI video editor that enables you to quickly create animated videos from text like spreadsheets, articles, and blog posts. The tool works great for explainer videos, social videos, and promotional videos. You’ll customize content in the drag-and-drop video maker, where you can apply templates or select over 300,000 royalty-free clips. Additionally, you’re able to optimize videos for different social channels, and even schedule an editorial planner to auto-post content later in the week. Raw Shorts doesn’t offer as many features as other AI video editors. That said, it’s particularly useful for creating simple social videos, or more in-depth explainer videos, since clips can be up to ten minutes long (with the Business plan). Key features Integrations with YouTube, Vimeo, Box, Dropbox, and Drive Three social video formats Text-to-speech functionality with multiple voices and accents Scene saving features when you want to reuse moments Privacy controls Team collaboration tools 50 media libraries with graphic assets Standard and premium music libraries Pros Promotes a very speedy workflow thanks to its scene saving feature Simple to use Lots of designs Flexible pricing options Cons Slow export times Interface can be glitchy Not the best customer service Ease of use While there are some drawbacks to using Raw Shorts, customers agree that the platform is very easy to use. All you have to do is upload your document or script, and the tool scans and analyzes the main concepts for your storyboard. After that, Raw Shorts even matches your project with relevant media assets and generates voice narration. Then, you can quickly review the first draft or use the drag-and-drop editor to make changes. Plus, there are detailed tutorials and an extensive knowledge base. Price Raw Shorts provides a free starter option, but you’re limited to YouTube publication. Plus, your videos will include watermarks and the Raw Shorts video outro. Therefore, you’ll be better off opting for a paid plan. The Essential plan costs $20 a month while the Business plan costs $30. A unique feature of Raw Shorts is that, if you need a smaller plan, you can also pay per export, purchasing credits on demand to download your video in HD. 7. Adobe Premiere Pro As the name suggests, Adobe Premiere Pro is a premium solution, so you won’t find any free plans. That said, this powerful tool offers tons of AI features to streamline your workflow, including text-based editing to refine, reorder, and trim clips in the same way that you would a document. You can also choose from professionally-designed templates, and built-in effects and transitions. Additionally, you’ll get access to powerful color correction and grading tools, noise reduction, dialogue enhancements, and speech-to-text captions in 18 languages. The most powerful AI tool for WordPress Turn your ideas into ready-to-publish content at lightspeed. Elevate your content Key features Text-based editing Background noise removal Speech enhancement Speaker distinction Music and video synchronization Color match tools Auto reframe for different social platforms Multicam support Three-point editing Green screen Over 50 audio effects Over 75,000 Adobe Stock music tracks Pros Responsive speed and fast rendering Great for teamwork and collaboration Very large community, so it’s easy to find help online Cons Some techniques require you to install additional apps Interface can be overwhelming for beginners Ease of use Although there is a Learning Mode option and plenty of resources online, Adobe Premiere Pro is not suitable for beginners (unless you plan on investing time into learning the platform). In fact, it tends to be a better fit for users that are already familiar with Adobe, or those who plan to focus on video production full-time. Price You can make the most of a seven-day free trial. After that, plans cost $22.99 a month (with an annual contract) or $34.49 a month (on a month-to-month basis). 8. FlexClip FlexClip is a great AI video editor for beginners, since you can choose from over 6,000 pre-designed templates. These are organized by industry, so you’ll find options for sports, business, ecommerce, weddings, and more. You can generate videos from text, URLs, or articles. And you can turn text into natural-sounding AI voices to narrate or explain your video. There are plenty of other AI features including background removal, subtitle generation, auto-translation, and more. Better yet, FlexClip has all the resources you need to create engaging videos. Not only can you trim, merge, reverse, or speed up videos, you can also animate elements, add sound effects, insert transitions, etc. Key features Over four million royalty-free videos and images Over 74,000 music tracks and sound effects Over three million dynamic elements like emojis Collaboration tools Cloud storage Background removal A chroma key tool Screen recordings A GIF maker Video translations Unlimited video length (with paid plans) Pros A smooth user experience Very quick translations A great selection of templates Regular updates A generous free plan and affordable paid options Cons Text-to-video feature can be a bit slow Ease of use The FlexClip interface functions very similarly to the Canva graphic design platform. You’ll see a preview of your video to the right while you can insert templates, text, music, subtitles, and more from the left. This AI video editor also promotes a speedy workflow, since you can quickly access recently-used elements, and undo or redo actions. Plus, there are tons of articles and video tutorials to help you master the tool. Price The FlexClip free plan is decent. Resources are limited across projects, but you can create 12 projects a month and generate videos up to ten minutes in length. If you need more resources, paid plans start at $9.99 a month (billed annually), which makes it a great choice if you’re on a budget. 9. Deepbrain AI Deepbrain AI helps you create powerful videos using realistic avatars and natural text-to-speech voices in over 80 languages. The company achieves this through avatar gestures, 3D avatar options, a custom dictionary, conversational avatars, and more. You can create videos from scripts, text, topics, URLs, documents, articles, and generative art. Plus, you’ll find a range of customizable templates for TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram Reels. There are options for business, news, commerce, and other industries. This makes Deepbrain a great option for tons of use cases. For instance, you can provide 24/7 customer service solutions, create believable-looking brand ambassadors, and more. Key features Voice uploads and in-editor voice recordings Over 80 AI avatars and models Custom Studio AI avatars Gesture control and multi-avatars One-click translations Auto captions Custom fonts and logos Screen recordings Over 100,000 stock videos Over 6,000 music tracks A pronunciation dictionary Pros Very realistic avatars Fast performance Wide template selection Excellent customer service Great for corporate videos Cons Video previews don’t include the avatar gestures, which users have found to be mildly frustrating Ease of use Deepbrain works like many of the other AI video editors on this list, although you can’t preview your video while you edit. That said, all the settings are easy to find and apply. Plus, there’s a help center, blog, and community forum available to help you get started. Price There’s no free Deepbrain plan. The cheapest option costs $24 a month (billed annually). But if you’re using this AI video editor to complete team projects, you’ll need the Team plan, which costs $72 per month for three seats. You’ll also find enterprise options if you contact the Deepbrain team. 10. Designs.ai Video Maker Designs.ai is an online video editing and production tool which combines high-quality stock content with AI technology to help you save time and improve accuracy. You’ll get access to a huge library of assets including 500,000 audio files, 50 voices, and 20 languages. Additionally, you can see video changes in real time and optimize them for various platforms.

Prices start at $19 a month, but if you require more than a single seat, you’ll need the Enterprise plan, which costs $169 per month.

Here are some things to look out for: Efficiency and speed. AI video editors take care of many tedious tasks like audio transcription and color correction. But, it’s important to find a tool that aids this process, so look out for features like real time customizations. Cost-effectiveness. The cost of AI video editors varies, but it’s important to prioritize value for money. A certain tool may seem expensive, but if it handles many tasks like transcriptions and translations, you won’t need to rely on additional tools. This can help you save money. Ease of use. If you’re a beginner, it’s important to find a user-friendly tool. Automated features significantly improve usability. Plus, you can check if there’s built-in training features, and make sure the interface is intuitive. Integrations. Your preferred AI video editor should integrate with other tools and platforms that you use. Therefore, it’s a good idea to look at compatibility with operating systems, cloud storage services, file formats, and more. Customization options. Ideally, you want a tool that lets you adjust the video length, style, and tone. Plus, there should be features to enhance your content, including visual effects, background music, avatars, animations, and more. If you can find a tool that contains all of these factors (and more), you’re less likely to need to switch to a different program down the line. Five tips to fully harness AI for your video strategy Before we discuss the best AI video editors, let’s explore five things to keep in mind to fully leverage the power of AI within your video strategy. 1. Use AI for video scripts and complementary content You might be more familiar with AI as a tool for content writing, due to the popularity of software like ChatGPT. There are a variety of AI tools that generate text based on prompts. Written content is a significant part of video creation. For example, producing outlines can help you include all the essential information in your videos. You might even go as far as writing a script to dictate the entire structure of your video. That’s when an AI tool like Jetpack AI Assistant can come in super handy. Jetpack AI Assistant allows you to speed up the content creation process for all your pre-production materials like video plans, outlines, storyboards, and more. It can also provide you with video titles and summary suggestions. After the video’s done, you can even use it to provide a transcript — a benefit for search rankings and users alike. Worried about sticking to your brand guidelines? You can adjust the tone of generated content to reflect your brand personality. You’ll also get access to features like AI-powered translations, which is perfect for those with an international audience. 2. Produce accessible content Your video should be accessible to everyone — including those with hearing and vision impairments, cognitive disorders, and other disabilities. Accessible content can help you broaden your reach. It also ensures compliance with regulations and laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). In the context of video, this means providing transcripts and subtitles. If you want to reach people beyond your local area, you may also need to consider translations, so people can watch or read the information in their preferred language. All of this provides another opportunity to use AI to accelerate the process while being inclusive. 3. Increase discoverability Search engine optimization (SEO) refers to techniques that you can apply to your content to make it search engine friendly. This can improve visibility in the search results and drive more organic traffic to your pages. There are various ways that AI tools can help you improve video SEO. Before you ever begin production, you’ll find programs that assist with keyword research, so you can choose topics that are the most relevant to your audience. Beyond this, AI can take care of the heavy lifting by optimizing written content like titles, metadata, transcripts, permalinks, and more. Plus, certain AI tools can even generate schema markup for your content to help it get featured in the rich snippets section of Google. 4. Use AI to add finishing touches One of the most daunting parts of creating videos is the post-production process. If you lack technical skills, you might not know how to refine your videos so that they look and sound professional. You can leverage the power of AI to improve the quality of your content — erase background noise, correct color contrast, add voiceovers or music, overlay text like calls to action, and more. 5. Improve promotional efforts Once you’ve recorded and edited your video, you’re ready to publish it on relevant video hosting and sharing platforms. One of the best parts about using AI video software is that you’re able to post your content directly to social media websites. This way, you can get your video seen by a wider audience, which gives you a greater chance of earning conversions. You can even add your videos to emails or landing pages to make them more engaging and increase their effectiveness. Again, you’ll find that AI tools can be helpful in a wide variety of ways. Not only can you use the programs to edit your videos, but you can also generate all the copy you need to finish off your campaigns, whether you use them for ads, social media, emails, or something else. Frequently asked questions By now, we’ve tried to cover every aspect of AI video editors to help you choose the right one, but you may still have questions. Let’s take a look at them. What is an AI video editor? The main purpose of AI video editors is to automate manual, time-consuming tasks associated with video creation and editing. So, you might be able to generate videos from long-form content or text-based sources. Plus, you can quickly improve the quality of clips with features like automatic object detection, background noise reduction, voice enhancement, and more. What are the benefits of using AI for video editing? The main benefit of using AI for video editing is that it reduces the time needed to produce video content. You can also minimize the cost of video production. With AI video editors, even complete beginners are able to create content. Are there any limitations or drawbacks to using AI video editors? AI video editors provide many benefits, but there are some drawbacks to consider. First, AI has been linked to misinformation campaigns, primarily with regard to deepfake technology, which has led to concerns about the ethics of AI. Additionally, there are quality concerns about AI content. While AI does a good job of mimicking human creativity, it isn’t a like-for-like substitution, so content may lack personality. What makes a good AI‑powered video editor? The best AI-powered video editors enable automatic video creation. With that in mind, you should also be able to enhance videos easily. And, these editors should offer a high degree of customization, enabling adjustments to avatars, music, voiceovers, color, and more. How much does an AI video editing tool cost? You can use AI video editors for free, but usually, you can only create a limited number of videos or generate short clips. Plus, you might not have access to the most advanced features. Typically, paid solutions remove these restrictions, although the cost varies. To give you an idea, you can purchase simple editing tools for $9-$20 per month. But if you need to support team members or create lots of videos each month, this price can increase to around $20-$100. What is Jetpack AI Assistant, and how can it help me? When creating videos, it isn’t just the visual content you have to think about. Most videos require a solid outline, a good script, a strong title, a clear summary, and more. You can use Jetpack AI Assistant to automatically generate written content for your videos. You can even adapt the tone easily across different projects and automatically translate content to serve a global audience. Where can I learn more about Jetpack AI Assistant? Jetpack AI Assistant enables you to quickly generate all kinds of written content like paragraphs, titles, tables, lists, and more. You’ll also get access to auto-translations, tone adjustments, and spelling and grammar corrections. You can learn more about the tool on the Jetpack AI Assistant page. Alternatively, you can check out the Jetpack blog and knowledge base. The best AI video editor for your content Videos are popular with online audiences because they’re more engaging than other types of content. But it can be difficult to create good videos if you’re not familiar with technical equipment or editing software. Fortunately, you can use the best AI video editors to automatically generate content, transcripts, and outlines. Plus, you can use these tools to add background music, customizable avatars, and overlay text. If you’re on a budget, there are free tools like Synthesia and Vidyo.ai. Meanwhile, Deepbrain is great for corporate videos, while Descript excels for social content. If you want to get the most out of your AI video editor, you can use it alongside Jetpack AI Assistant. This way, you can simplify the pre-production process by generating video scripts and outlines. You can also automatically produce video titles and summaries and translate content into different languages. Get started today! This entry was posted in Photos & Videos. Bookmark the permalink.
