Misleading or Harmful Automation Practices Avoiding Misleading Content: Content creators should refrain from using automation for practices that mislead or deceive viewers, such as clickbait, false information, or deceptive tactics. Prioritizing Ethics: Prioritize ethical content that provides value to the audience rather than seeking short-term gains through unethical automation. 5. Transparency and Disclosure Disclosing Automation: If your content incorporates automation, declaring this to your audience is ethical. Transparency helps build trust and authenticity. Clear Communication: Letting viewers know that some elements of your content are generated or automated ensures they understand the process. 6. Automation in Moderation Balanced Approach: A balanced approach to automation ensures that it complements, rather than replaces, the creative and personal aspects of content creation. Content Quality: Prioritizing content quality over quantity is ethical, ensuring viewers receive valuable and engaging content. By addressing these ethical considerations, content creators can harness the power of YouTube automation while maintaining transparency, authenticity, and a solid moral foundation in their content creation journey. Ethical automation practices foster a trustworthy relationship with viewers and contribute to a YouTube channel's long-term success. Conclusion Clearly, YouTube automation is more than just a time-saver – it's a catalyst for the future of content creation.

Lydia Sweatt · 9 min read · Sep 21, 2023 Monetization Summary: Learn what YouTube automation is and follow our step-by-step guide to launch your automated channel. Discover expert tips to start earning and potentially hit up to $500K in 90 days! Install Extension Research shows that with an investment of around $250 per video, some creators have generated returns upward of $20,000 per video through effective automation strategies. That’s some serious cash. Although it may seem unbelievable, these figures are based on actual performance data from established automated channels. It actually happened on YouTube! That stunning achievement comes from Noah Morris, a YouTube automation expert who made seven figures in one year. He manages more than 20 faceless YouTube channels, each optimized to scale revenue, by dedicating just one day a week to oversee the entire process. Luckily for you, we interviewed Noah to get an inside view of the automation world. In this guide, we’ll explain how to start your YouTube automation journey and get paid! What Is YouTube Automation? YouTube automation is the process of outsourcing the daily tasks required to run one or more YouTube channels. Successful channels often build a dedicated team—comprising a thumbnail designer, scriptwriter, video editor, and voiceover specialist—to ensure high-quality video production. Others use a mix of human creativity and artificial intelligence. There are plenty of AI tools on the market now, and they do a decent job of video editing, voiceover, and other creative tasks. Read more: Learn more about automated video content creation How Much Does it Cost to Start a YouTube Automation Business? There’s no perfect answer to this question, as it truly depends on the number of channels involved, the topics they cover, and the level of consistency on YouTube. However, when we spoke to Noah, he said it took him about 12 videos at an average cost of $100 per video to break even. He also said beginners might need around 35 videos and $3,000-$3,500 to start seeing returns from automated content. How Much Money Can You Make from YouTube Automation? This number varies, but if we’re talking about the highest payout possible, it’s well over $100,000. In fact, Noah made twice that in one month with his automated channels. “In November 2022, I did around $200,000 in YouTube AdSense revenue,” he says. And in just 90 days, he made $500,000 with automated content! How to Do YouTube Automation with a Faceless Channel Ready to get started? We’ll teach you how to choose the right topics, stand out on YouTube, and build a solid team that understands your automation goals! Watch the video for an in-depth explainer, or scroll down to read the tips and tricks. 1. Target a High-Paying Niche on YouTube Did you know that some YouTube channels earn more money because of the topics they cover? It’s true! Some niches are extremely valuable and bring in thousands of dollars per month, if not hundreds of thousands. If you want to be successful (and earn the highest AdSense revenue), Noah suggests focusing on sports, celebrities, and crime-related content because they lead to higher RPMs. “Some of these channels, especially in Q4, can get insanely high RPMs. I’m talking $14 to $15 RPMs,” Noah says. RPM stands for revenue per mille and is an estimate of what a creator makes from ad revenue and fan-funding on YouTube. An RPM of $10, for example, means you made $10 for every 1,000 video views on your channel. According to experts, focusing on American viewers can significantly boost monetization since advertisers are willing to pay higher rates in this market. They live in a bigger market and advertisers pay more to capture their attention (and money). 2. Find a ‘Content Gap’ in Your Niche You can’t beat the best channels until you know what they are, what they do, and where you fit in. So, the next step is to find a gap in the YouTube market. Essentially, you’re figuring out how to “niche down” so you aren’t targeting broad, oversaturated topics that are hard to break into. This part can be tedious, but Noah shared some tips to speed up the process. For unbiased research, use your browser's incognito mode to review competitor video views and uncover potential content gaps. Go to YouTube and type your niche into the search bar. For example, you might type the word “basketball.” Look for videos with high views that belong to small channels. Chances are, those channels were just created and may be automated. How to Identify a Content Gap If you can only find two or three channels with high views and low subscribers in your niche, those videos may represent a content gap on YouTube. This means people enjoy those videos, but few channels are supplying them! Make similar videos so you can stand out and grow your channel. 3. Study Your Competition Starting a faceless channel on YouTube is just as competitive, if not more, than starting a regular channel. So you need to learn how creators make automated content that feels fresh and entertaining. You should also know how and why those videos get millions of views. The best plan of action is to study the competition in your niche. Watch their popular videos and take note of what makes them successful on YouTube, whether they have good storylines, emotional appeal, or superb editing. Try to emulate all of that goodness within your content. How to Stand Out and Diversify Also, ask yourself, Which topics are missing from the conversation? You can answer this question by looking at channels in your niche that aren’t directly competing with your videos. If their content is related to yours (and performed extremely well), try those concepts on your channel too. “Normal YouTubers, they would usually create topics based on [their] feelings, but you really want to make decisions based on data and what did well in the past,” Noah says. 4. Build a Team Now that you’ve found a lucrative niche and some video topics, it’s time to build your team! You need about four people to run a YouTube automation channel: Voiceover artist Video editor Thumbnail designer Scriptwriter Scriptwriters For scriptwriters, Noah suggests hiring someone who is passionate and knowledgeable about your niche. After all, they’re building the framework of your YouTube videos. You want them to be good! Voiceover with AI For voiceovers, you don’t necessarily need a human. You can generate AI voiceovers using tools like Speechify and Lovo AI. Designers and Editors According to Noah, finding a good thumbnail designer and video editor are the hardest parts of YouTube automation. An editor who spruces up videos specifically to hold viewers' attention is the best person for the job. Likewise, a thumbnail designer who provides a simple, attractive, and emotional snapshot of your content is a fantastic choice. You can find both creatives, including scriptwriters, on YTJobs.com! 5. Keep Improving Your Videos Your videos may be automated, but that doesn’t mean the work ends! You are the “director” of your channel, so it’s on you to understand the audience more and more each day. You want to improve your content, get more watch time, and influence the YouTube algorithm to recommend your videos. Here are a few tips from Noah: Look at the most-replayed scenes from your YouTube videos and incorporate them into future content. Regularly monitor your comment section to gather real-time feedback and identify what aspects of your content are resonating with your viewers. What is it about your content that pushes them to comment, like, or subscribe? And, of course, frequently review your YouTube Analytics to identify trends, optimize content strategies, and improve overall viewer engagement and retention. Will YouTube Automation Hurt My Channel? YouTube automation is legit when you do it the right way, and it’s totally worth it considering the money you could make. But keep in mind that YouTube does not reward repetitive, low-educational content. If you’re automating a channel using wind or rain sounds on a loop, there’s a strong chance you won’t get monetized. You can use AI in the process, but make sure you’re creating original content viewers find engaging — preferably, something that has a storyline.

Understanding the Fundamentals of YouTube Automation YouTube automation is all about delegating the day-to-day tasks required to manage a channel so that you can focus on high-level strategy and growth. This process involves outsourcing activities like video editing, thumbnail creation, scriptwriting, and voiceovers to either freelancers or AI tools. The primary goal is to maintain a steady stream of high-quality content without the need to be involved in every step, freeing up your time while still engaging your audience effectively. By leveraging a mix of human creativity and automation software, you can scale your channel, tap into high-paying niches, and build a sustainable, hands-off revenue stream. Understanding these fundamentals allows you to evaluate which tasks to automate, how to set up an efficient workflow, and what tools or personnel to invest in for maximum impact. Automation Best Practices and Pitfalls Successfully automating your YouTube channel requires a balance between efficiency and content quality. Best practices include clearly defining your niche, researching your competition, and identifying content gaps that your channel can fill. It’s crucial to build a dedicated team of professionals or reliable freelancers to handle specific tasks—whether it’s scriptwriting, video editing, or creating eye-catching thumbnails. However, pitfalls exist: relying too heavily on automation without adding a personal touch can result in generic or low-engagement content. Additionally, using reused content without sufficient transformation may lead to copyright issues or demonetization. To avoid these risks, always ensure your content is original, adheres to YouTube’s guidelines, and resonates with your target audience. Regularly monitoring your analytics will help you spot trends and adjust your strategy accordingly, so you remain competitive and compliant.

Any part of the YouTube process you can automate will help save you time and grow your channel more quickly. In this post, we’ll cover ten of the best YouTube automation and AI tools to save you time and help increase your views. All of them are either free or affordable. TubeBuddy – optimizes your channels and videos for increased views and subscribers VidlQ – automates several tasks including topic ideas, trends, title & tag generation, and more AWeber YouTube automation – automates sending emails once a new video is published YouTube Studio – automates generating subtitles and chapters for your videos Zapier – automation tool which integrates with other popular tools you’re already using Headliner – automates creating video overlay’s for a podcast Invideo AI – creates videos from ideas Pictory – create videos from your script Runway – creates lip sync videos and generates videos from video clips, images, and text Buffer – automates social media marketing on other platforms where you promote your YouTube videos If you want to grow your YouTube channel, but don’t want to put in seven hours of work for every minute of video you publish, keep reading! What is YouTube automation? YouTube automation is a combination of native and external tools and platforms that can: 1 – Handle repetitive tasks such as publishing. 2 – Optimize your videos for search and feeds. 3 – Create, auto-generate, enhance, and edit videos. 4 – Bulk edit video descriptions, tags, and more. 5 – Automate the marketing and promotions of your YouTube videos and channel, plus collect behavioral data and personalize your marketing efforts. Automation is the process of using tools to automate actions you’d otherwise do manually (or not at all). YouTube automation can help you get more views and subscribers, make more money, and save tons of time. Some of YouTube automations include automatically sending emails with your new videos, creating transcriptions, generating SEO-friendly titles and descriptions, promoting videos on social media, and more. Sometimes when people talk about “YouTube automation,” they’re referring to websites where you can auto-engage in comments, buy views, subscribers, comments, and other types of engagement. However, auto-engagement, buying subscribers, or paying for views, comments, and other engagement is against YouTube’s terms of service. So we won’t cover any tools that promote those actions in this post. Is YouTube automation legal? Yes, automation and AI are “legal” within the YouTube platform, as long as you follow its community guidelines and AI policies. We’ve listed highlights from the platform’s automation and AI policies below 👇 YouTube automation policies To use automation in a way that abides by content policies, thoroughly review YouTube posting policies before you publish. Never publish: Fake engagement Impersonation Spam Scams Deceptive practices Excessive posting of affiliate content that violates YouTube’s spam policies External links that send users to the above type of content (content that violates their policies). Any content that violates YouTube community guidelines Ok to publish: Affiliate content Monetized videos created with AI tools AI-generated videos (within guidelines) YouTube AI policies YouTube encourages the use of generative AI to create videos, as long as users follow its community guidelines and policies on the responsible use of AI-generated content. Channels and creators must disclose when realistic-type content is AI-generated. For example, if your AI-generated videos contain representations that might be mistaken for a real person, place, or event — this must be disclosed. To meet disclosure requirements, transparency tools are provided by YouTube Studio. Disclosure labels that appear in the video description. In-video labels for content related to sensitive topics such as health, finance, elections, news, etc. Here’s an example of YouTube’s disclosure label in the description text and in-video. It is perfectly YouTube-legal to use automation and AI tools to create, enhance, optimize, and promote your YouTube videos. Before you do, though, carefully review YouTube’s Community Guidelines to ensure that your content abides by all of YouTube’s policies. What are YouTube automation AI tools? YouTube automation AI tools are tools that incorporate artificial intelligence for smarter, more competitive results. Nearly all of today’s automation tools incorporate AI for better and quicker results. How does YouTube automation work? To use YouTube automation, determine what tasks you need help with and look for tools that can automate those tasks. Some of the most common automation tasks YouTubers use are: Generate videos from text or scripts. Turn other content into YouTube videos (such as blog posts and podcasts). Optimize your YouTube channel and videos for search and feeds. Cross-post YouTube videos to other social media channels. Automate email campaigns and collect behavioral data to promote your YouTube channel and videos. Connect all your tools and apps to one main dashboard. How to get started with YouTube AI automation tools To get started with YouTube automation: 1 – Identify the most time-consuming and repetitive tasks. 2 – Choose automations that match your level of experience. 3 – Consider how the pricing fits your budget. 4 – Check out verified reviews on sites like Capterra Begin by identifying the most time-consuming and repetitive tasks in your workflow. Then browse some of the best automation tools available to find which are the best for you. The reviews below will give you ideas on what kind of tools to look for and which apps to use. Are you new to automation and AI? Don’t worry — it’s much easier than it sounds! Choose programs that are ideal for beginners and start with one or two. Consider your level of video editing experience, plus your budget, when choosing the best automation tools for your needs. How to make money with YouTube automation To make money with YouTube automation, create high-quality content tailored to your target audience. Automation can help improve the quality and efficiency of your videos and marketing campaigns. However, you’ll want to avoid the temptation to push out massive amounts of content. Keep in mind that publishing tons of content — is something that anyone can do, thanks to AI and automation. So it won’t help your videos or channel stand out to simply produce massive amounts of videos for your niche. The greatest benefit of automation and AI is that it frees up your time to engage with your audience, get to know them better, and develop ideas for content that they’ll fall in love with. Then, you can use automation to help you produce, publish, and promote videos more quickly. Using this strategy, the chances of earning income from your channel are greater than ever. Some of the ways you can earn income from your YouTube channel include: Ad revenue Affiliate marketing Sponsored content Product & merchandise sales Crowdfunding The top YouTube automation tools Below are our favorite YouTube automation tools for creators who want to build, grow, and promote their YouTube channels more quickly and efficiently. 1. TubeBuddy TubeBuddy is probably the best-known tool for YouTubers. It includes a plugin and browser extension with tons of tools that can help you upload, manage, and grow views on your YouTube videos. What does TubeBuddy automate? TubeBuddy has tons of useful features, but try these three first. They’re the easiest to implement, and will save you the most time by replacing tasks you’re already doing. Automations: Get AI tag suggestions, translate titles and descriptions into other languages, and automatically run YouTube approval checks. Bulk actions: Change cards, end screens, descriptions/titles, delete comments, and create thumbnail overlays — in bulk. For example, if you have a new video to promote, you can add a link to it in every video description or card; no need to manually edit each and every video. Defaults: Create multiple default profiles, descriptions, and tags for your different topics and choose the one most relevant to the video you’re uploading. (YouTube only allows you one.) How does this help you? Most of the tools in TubeBuddy help you save time by offering automatic or bulk actions you’d have to do manually. You can also use TubeBuddy to grow views by promoting one video across your channel, or you can easily add tag suggestions to make your videos more likely to show in search results and suggested videos. Reviews TubeBuddy has a 4.6-star rating on Capterra. Cost TubeBuddy has a free plan that offers keyword tools, but it doesn’t include bulk actions, defaults, or limited automations. TubeBuddy’s paid plans start at $3.75/month. 2. VidIQ VidIQ helps YouTubers create better content and get more views and subscribers. What does VidIQ automate? Based on your YouTube channel and answers to questions VidIQ asks you, it will automatically generate for you: Topic ideas, trends, and success stats Keyword opportunities AI-optimized titles, descriptions, and tags Competitor stats Monetization reports and tracking You can also use VidIQ to promote a specific link or topic across all your YouTube descriptions at once. How does it help you? VidIQ is valuable because it helps you reduce the time it takes to research good content and keyword ideas for your target audience. We use it for the AWeber YouTube channel, and the information it gives us is well worth its monthly fee. I especially like the bulk description tool (available on paid plans only). It can help you get a ton of views on new videos without a lot of work. Reviews VidIQ has a 4.4-star rating on Capterra. Cost VidIQ’s free plan offers limited automation features. Get more features with their paid plans: starting at $17/month. 3. AWeber YouTube automation AWeber is an email marketing tool that you can use to easily and automatically promote your new YouTube videos via email. What does AWeber automate? AWeber can send emails to your subscribers any time you publish a new video to your YouTube channel. All you have to do is ask your YouTube subscribers to sign up. Once they’re subscribed to your emails, they’ll be notified of your new videos in their inboxes, instead of having to check YouTube all the time. You can also set up daily, weekly, and monthly emails with new videos, in case your upload schedule is sporadic. Note: AWeber offers other email tools and automations for small businesses like automatically adding new customers to your email list, sending abandoned cart emails, and more. How does it help you? Most YouTube videos reach less than 15% of the people who are subscribed to the channels those videos were published to. This limited “organic reach” means that even if you have a lot of subscribers, your videos aren’t reaching most of those people. Sending an automated notification email to your subscribers gets around all that. There’s another benefit to these notifications, too. Because of the way YouTube’s algorithm works, if it sees you have an engaged audience, it will show your videos to more people. Sending an email notification is a way to get your audience engaged. It’s enough of a signal to influence YouTube’s algorithm in your favor. Those early views also encourage the YouTube algorithm to rank you higher for searches and suggestions. And the best part? You’re starting to build an audience that’s not controlled by YouTube. No one can take your email subscribers away from you. Reviews AWeber has a 4.4-star rating on Capterra. Cost AWeber’s free plan includes one YouTube email automation and up to 500 email subscribers. Paid plans start as low as $12.50/month and include YouTube automations and anything over 500 subscribers. Get started with AWeber for free 4. YouTube Studio It may seem weird to have the official YouTube Studio on this list of best YouTube automation tools, but it’s worth pointing out what you can automate without any extra software. YouTube Studio lets you upload, manage, and get analytics on your YouTube videos. But there are a few built-in automations that can save you a ton of time. What does YouTube Studio automate? In YouTube Studio you can automatically generate subtitles and chapters for your videos. Subtitles increase accessibility since people can watch your videos without sound. Chapters allow people to jump directly to the section of your video that they need. That can be particularly useful for demos or longer videos. YouTube also automatically gives you real-time stats on your videos. Monitor them to see what types of videos are ranking, getting new versus returning traffic, how long people are watching on average, and more. How does it help you? Since you must use YouTube Studio to manage your YouTube channel anyway, it’s worth your time to see which features they offer that save you time. YouTube wants your channel to grow — so pay attention to the information and accessibility they offer to grow views, subscribers, and engagement. Reviews YouTube has a 4.8-star rating on Capterra. Cost YouTube Studio is free. 5. Zapier Zapier is a tool that allows you to connect thousands of separate apps and create automations. It works using “triggers” and “actions.” What does Zapier automate? Everything you create in Zapier is an automation, which means you can set up hundreds of automations that directly relate to your business. For example, you could post a message in Slack every time you publish a new video. Here are two types of Zapier automations that are useful for every YouTuber: 1. When you publish a YouTube video, create new posts on all your social media channels like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. 2. When you publish a YouTube video, create a new post on your blog. How does it help you? Growing your YouTube channel doesn’t just come down to SEO and ranking for suggestions. It’s important to get your new videos in front of your audience — wherever they are. Without spending any extra time, you can automatically notify people on all your channels when you’ve published a new video. Reviews Zapier has a 4.7-star rating on Capterra. Cost Zapier offers a free plan that includes up to 100 tasks/month Zapier’s paid plans start at $19.99/month, billed annually. 6. Headliner Headliner is a tool specifically designed for podcasters who want to make their podcast content available on YouTube without a ton of extra work. What does Headliner automate? By simply plugging your podcast RSS feed into this tool, you can create an engaging video overlay to make your podcast more interesting to watch on YouTube. Headliner offers templates and pulls elements from your RSS feed to offer you a ready-made video automatically. How does it help you? With 2.7 billion monthly active users, YouTube is an important place to showcase your podcast. But many people don’t have the time, resources, or video experience to turn their podcast into a video. Capture the YouTube audience by creating a video from your podcast using Headliner in minutes. Reviews Headliner has a 4.5-star rating on Capterra.

a lot of these vertical videos that are less than 60 seconds Long YouTube have been really pushing their shorts and the end users are really enjoying this type of content and this means for you as the business owner you need to deliver this type of content to your audience because that is what they want also if you take a look at these reels that I have here on the screen right now they may not look like they have much in common but but they all have one thing in common and that is that they all have tens of thousands of views and likes as well I'm going to teach you how you can do this on Automation and add a personalized touch so that they don't look like they were made on automation hi I'm Helena and I am an AI and automations expert I would really appreciate if you can like And subscribe to my channel because that's going to help me out a lot now with that being said there is a three-step process to creating these type of reals on automation the first step is that we're going to use chat GPT to write our script for us the second step is we're going to bulk create these videos using a tool called canva and then finally the third step is we're going to use an RPA tool called make.com to schedule and post all of these videos in for us in fact we can actually make up to a thousand of these YouTube shorts in less than half an hour so let's get go okay diving into step number one we need to write our prompt a prompt is an instruction that we give to an AI tool in this case we want to tell chat GPT to write YouTube scripts for us now if we just say something generic like write me a YouTube script you're going to also get something very generic back the better your prompt the more specific that you can get the better the results that you can get let's take a look at the prompt I have written I'm going to point out the different components that you want to think about and include in your own prompts as well in my example here I gave chat GPT a role next I told it the task that I wanted to do in this case is to write the script for my YouTube shorts in our example we're going to write YouTube shorts for the artificial intelligence Niche I want to generate some different YouTube shorts that give exact prompts for different use cases that will be helpful to my audience after I explained the exact task that I want chat jpt to do I gave it the structure to follow after that I gave chat jpt the exact example of what I want the output to look like and finally I to it the format that I want the output to take in in this case I want it to be in a table where I have 10 of these YouTube scripts all in the one place after I generate 10 I can generate 10 more and 10 more after that now you may be wondering why can't I generate a 100 at once because currently chat GPT has a context window this means it can only generate a certain amount of text at one time I'm going to copy this prompt right here and then put it into chat GPT it's just been over a minute and chat GPT went to work for us after we put in the prompt it has generated all of these prompts that I can use as my YouTube short scripts it has generated 10 at a time and after I generated 10 all I needed to do was to tell it to generate 10 more without repeating the ones that it has already done I just repeat this process over and over again until I have all of the scripts that I want I'm just going to copy this table right here and then paste it right inside of my YouTube short script that is stored in my Google Sheets after you have finished this step you can move on to step number two we want to bul create our videos and we're going to use a tool called canva to do this we're going to create a new design and we're going to search for YouTube shorts once we have clicked on this we'll be taken to the dashboard that looks like this you can be as creative as you want with your YouTube shorts so if you need some inspiration just click on design and scroll through these templates that are already pre-made by canva there are hundreds of them to choose from but what I find is that for my content I like to add a bit of a personal touch I pre-recorded a couple of videos that are just a couple seconds long of myself that I'm going to use now now to upload your own videos simply click on upload and then click on the upload file button to upload your videos I have already done so if I can see my videos here let me show you what they look like now I'm sure you have seen this style of video before where the person is pointing to different parts of the screen and different text will appear as they are pointing now all that's left to do is to actually put in all of our text to do so we're going to scroll down the left navigation here until we hit book create I believe this is a premium feature but I think it's only 10 20 bucks per month now we can choose to enter the data manually or upload the data I'm going to click on enter data manually and then paste all of this in and then press done at the bottom great after I've done so I am going to go up here to text and then actually add in where these texts are supposed to be I want the heading to be at the top this is what the prompt is going to be about I'm going to call it prompt right here and I can modify this text by clicking on effect this is where I can add a background to it I want this background to be white I can also modify the font size as well as the font style but in this case I like the default font now I'm going to repeat the process for my part one text part two textt and then part three text I'm going to drag over the first part now I don't want this text to show up for the whole video so what I'll need to do is to click on this text and then go to show timing this is where I can see how long this specific text is going to show up for I'm going to call it part one to remind myself and then I need to match it with the video so that it shows up when it's supposed to okay I have fixed my video durations now let me show you what this looks like you have the prompt at the top then the first part of the prompt will show up followed by the second followed by the third now all we need to do is to connect the data so that the right text shows up at the right time we're going to go back to bulk create and this time we're going to connect the data it's very simple to do so for the prompt I'm just going to click on this text and I'm going to click on connect data now all I need to do is to select the column that this text is supposed to match with in this case it will be the big idea column I'm going to do the exact same thing for part one click on part one then click on connect data and then click on part one and I'm going to repeat the process for part two and part three now we can click continue all we to do is to click create just with one click within a second we have all of our YouTube shorts created now to make my Youtube shorts even more engaging I can choose to add in some music so to add in some music all I need to do is to click on the elements tab go over to music and scroll down to audio click see all and this is where I can find all of the music that I can use after listening to a couple I like this one the best and I'm just going to drag it onto my canvas now let me show you what this YouTube shorts now look like let me play a couple for you you can see that now we're writing chat GPD prompt for for crafting High converting SEO titles the first part of the prompt shows up followed by the second followed by the third okay now let's go on to the next chat GPT prompt for engaging Tech blogging part one shows up part two shows up followed by part three and we have the music Here's another example here chat jpt prompt for Instagram brand storytelling you can see part one of the prompt followed by Part Two And Then followed by part three so our shorts are looking pretty good before we can move on to step number three we actually want to download and save all of the YouTube shorts that we have just created in order to do so we're going to go up here Click Share and then click on download it's very important that you check this box right here to download every single one of these files as their own separate file now I'm going to click download now before we move on let me show you a different style of shorts that you can create as well so I'm back onto the canvas and this time I'm going to upload a different video of myself here's this one right here in this case I'm just going to put one chat GPT tip in here I went back into chat GPT and I asked it to give chat GPT tips that I can use and I'm going to copy these tips right here and go back into canva go down to bog create and enter in all of this data right here and all I wanted to do is for this text to show up after about maybe 0.5 seconds after this video starts playing okay I added a title that says chat tip and I also added a white background because it just stood out more after I made the changes that I wanted I'm just going to press on generate all of the designs and just like that we have all of our YouTube shorts made let me show you what this looks like so I'm going to turn around and you can see the chat gb2 tip right here and then this is the next tip and then after a couple seconds we see the next tip right over here I just wanted to show you this different style just to show you that you can really play around with this and be as creative as you want you can make the prompt into you know six different parts one different part or just have a tip just like this with you in the background smiling or running or doing some sort of action and these YouTube shorts are so easy to make and they get so much engagement so we are now ready for step number three now we want to post all of these shorts on automation it's simply just going to take too long to do everything manually imagine we have a thousand of these shorts it's going to take us hours to upload all of them onto YouTube I am going to upload all of my videos into my Dropbox folder I'm going to click on upload then I'm going to upload the entire folder that we just downloaded from CA now that we have our folder ready with all of our videos inside we are now ready to use make and schedule all of these videos to go out on automation now that we are in our make account we are now ready to create our automation so you want to click on create a new scenario this will get us to a blank canvas where we can start creating this automation the first step of this automation is we want to create a repeater we want to create a loop of uploading a video and after the first video has been uploaded then it's going to upload the second video followed by the third followed by the fourth Etc in order to do this the module that we will need is the repeater module and the initial value is going to be one and we want this to repeat for as many times as the number of videos that we just created so if we created a th000 videos we want to put a th here after we have a repeater down then the next node that we need to add is Dropbox in our example if you have uploaded all of your video shorts into uh Google Drive then your module would be Google drive in this case we're going to select Dropbox and then here we want to select download a a video we need to connect this to our Dropbox account if this is the first time that we're logging in simply click add and then press save and then log into your Dropbox account right here and give make the ability to access all the files in it after we have created our Dropbox connection the next thing is to actually select the first video then post it onto YouTube then the second then the third Etc so we need to connect it to the right video to be posted at the right time the good thing about CA is that it actually numbers these videos in sequence so the first video that we created is called 1. MP4 the second one is called 2. MP4 Etc this actually makes our scheduling so much easier now we need to select the file that we now want to upload we're going to select from the dropdown select a file and then I'm going to click on the blue button right here where it says click here to choose a file I'm going to select the folder that we just created and then you can see if I press the plus button again I have to select the specific video that we have just created I'm just going to select the first one the next thing I'm going to do is actually turn on the map the reason I do this is because if I don't what this repeater is going to do is that it's going to select video six every single time and upload it into my social media accounts which is not what I want I wanted to upload the first one then the second one third one Etc right so how I'm going to change this is I'm going to toggle on the map option and I'm going to erase out the six and I'm going to fill it with I the I is going to equal one on the first iteration it's going to equal two on the second run it's going to equal three on the third one Etc right and it's only going to get as high as what we set in the repeater in this example what this is going to fill in is is that it's telling Dropbox go into this folder find this file called in this case I would be1 1. MP4 and then on the second iteration is going to find two. MP4 followed by 3. mpp4 and this is going to allow us to schedule all of the videos that we have just created in the right sequence okay now that we have our Dropbox module configured we're now ready to post everything automatically onto YouTube so we're going to click up here to add a new module and this time we're going to search for YouTube and after we find YouTube we're going to select upload a video and if this is your first time connecting to your YouTube channel you need to press add right up here and enter in your username and password to your Google account so that make has the permissions to be able to up upload onto your YouTube channel I have already done that then we need to have a title for our video if you do want a unique title for every single one of your YouTube shorts what you would do is to rightclick unlink here and add in a new module probably add in open AI or CLA and write in a prompt to generate a unique video title for every single one of your YouTube shorts in our example here though because all of the videos are about chat GPT prompts I can just give it a generic Title Here called a chat GPT prompt but you can get as wild as you like remember that there's no script for creating these videos it's part of the fun is just to be creative so the the file has already been selected so the video file that was just downloaded from the Dropbox module is going to now be uploaded into YouTube we also need to select a video category and then from here we can choose the Privacy status so we want to choose private your video is going to be private and at the date when it's going to be published is going to turn public when we select the publish at date this is where we have to think about how far apart do we want to space out our videos do we want to post once a week do we want to post every day now in order to determine the time frequency we need to click on the publish at field and go over to the calendar tab from the calendar tab at the bottom we can see a number of different functions and the one we want is ADD days what the add days function is going to do is that it's going to take the time now and add a number of days to the video so that they're spaced apart by that many days the first part of the function is that we need to add in the time now and thankfully make already have this variable pre-programmed you can see it's it's literally just called now so I'm going to click now so what this function is going to do is that it's going to add days it's going to take the time now and if I put two here it's going to add two days if it's if I put seven here it's going to add seven days Etc except because we are running this in a loop we want it to add by the number of days times the number of times this Loop has been running so what we need to do is actually go back to the star tab click on the I and then go over to the X tab here and then go down to the operator click on the multiply and then put in our number okay because if we don't do this what what this operation is going to do it's going to take the time now it's going to take the number of days that you want in between these videos and it's going to schedule all of your videos two days from today or seven days from today but when you multiply it by the number of times this Loop has been running that's when you get the spacing right so the second video is going to be 7 days apart from the third video and the third video is going to be 7 days apart from the fourth video that is what this is going uh to do now okay so this is how we put in the publish at date and after this we're all done we're going to save our work and then press run once after this automation has finished running you can see all of the YouTube shorts that we have just created has been uploaded into my YouTube channel and what I want you to see here is that they are spaced perfectly 7 days apart the first one will be uploaded on June 20th followed by June 27th July 4th Etc I'm going to leave a link to this make automation below once you get and download this file simply go to your make account click on the three dots where it says more then press on import uh blueprint to download this automation so that you don't need to make it from scratch as always thank you so much for joining me for today's tutorial I hope you learned a lot lot out of this and let me know Below in the comments if um you tried it out and what your results are and please make sure you like And subscribe I've also got a free Ai and automations training which you can access below as well thank you so much and I'll see you again soon",

million subscribers getting a ton of views the owners Behind these channels are doing a business model called YouTube Automation and the channels you're watching are making yeah let's say a pretty good amount of money in this video I'll break down how you can utilize a few free AI websites to start your own faceless automation business today literally right after watching this video the thing that most people don't know is that all of these fa channels follow the same exact four-step framework to create their videos they might do it in slightly different ways but the core strategy and the tools that are used are always the same if you watch this video to the end you'll have learned the formula that are making people hundreds of thousands of dollars and you'll be able to apply it to as many channels as you want to before we get into that you need to understand what YouTube automation is the simplest way to describe it is that you create YouTube videos without ever showing your face and Outsource the video creation of Freelancers so you can focus on more important parts like strategy and actually turn the channel into a passive income Source but I'd say that's a pretty outdated description now Outsourcing can be really expensive and cost hundreds of dollars per video when you can actually get the same results using AI so I'll show you how to create an automated faceless YouTube channel entirely with AI for free saving you thousands of dollars in the process I've spent countless days and nights researching AI software and picked out the best ones that literally anyone would be able to use regardless if you have any prior experience or not to show you how you then apply all of this I've picked out a great Niche and will show you how to create a video in it using these exact tools but it's important that you know that this framework that I'm about to share with you can be applied to all niches Sports history motivation it doesn't matter so I've recently seen stoicism well so I chose that as my Niche and people are creating these motivational videos about stoicism and how others can use it to improve their lives take this channel for example it's bringing in millions of views with this concept so it's been proven to be a viral Niche I saw that their most viral video was about seven things you should do every morning so as any professional YouTuber would do I completely copied that same topic but before we get into creating the video I'll reveal a little Golden Nugget that the pros don't want to share now most faceless channels make the majority of their income from ad revenue and that's the money that they're getting paid for people watching The Annoying ads that you get when you click onto a video and some channels make a lot of money from this Mr Beast for example is making $13 million a month from his ad Revenue but what most people don't know is that you won't get paid for your videos right away you actually need 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time which can be a huge hurdle when you're just starting out it took me six months before I started making any money with this channel you're watching right now however that was a year ago and today there's a little bit of a loophole around this problem a few months ago I came across this website that has YouTube channels that have been grown organically to meet YouTube's monetization requirements so when you start posting on one of these accounts you'll get paid right away from your first video which is huge when I first heard about this I thought it sounded too good to be true but after giving one of these accounts a try it actually worked perfectly I'm not going to go too deep on this but this is what people are doing to instantly get a return on the content that they post it's not mandatory to get success but it'll sure as hell help when you're struggling in the beginning of your journey so the site is called tick accounts go ahead and Google it yourself you'll see the accounts they have on there they're at a stock pretty often but I'm sure some of you watching this will be lucky enough to visit when they're available now that you know that let's get into how to create the actual video the first step of this framework is to write a script this is actually the most important step of the formula so listen up writing good scripts is really hard especially if you've never done it before but the good thing is that you don't have to be a genius script writer to create good scripts with the evolution of AI you can create really good scripts using softwares like chat GPT if you just know how to enter a good prompt in the last couple of years I've spent many many hours experimenting with different prompts maybe a bit too many but the good part though is that I combined everything I learned into this prompt template that you can use to create YouTube scripts for any Niche now I know it might seem a bit complicated at first but it's actually super simple to use what you want to do is fill in all of the blank spaces with information about your own video so in this first box where it says Niche I'll switch that to stoicism since that's my Niche then in type of script I'll write something like motivational and educational then you just continue to fill in all these boxes that are highlighted with bold text if you scroll down a bit you then want to fill in additional details like length type of audience and specific keywords that can help your video get shown to more people now writing scripts manually takes a lot of time and often doesn't turn out very good unless you know what you're doing so if you want to pick up this template and use it yourself you'll find it inside of my free community I have Linked In the description so you just go down here click the free link and join it then in the top Channel The Prompt will be linked like those other packages I've given out before also in the community if you're interested in actually getting some kind of mentorship by me and my team of experienced mentors now this is where we're going to share the extra sauce that I don't include in these videos we'll I have weekly calls private mentoring now that's a good one and a bunch of other stuff that you'll have to find out by yourself so click the link in the description and pick up the template anyway once you filled out all the boxes then go ahead and hit generate and chat GPT will analyze ize all the information you entered in the prompt and turn it into an engaging script with all the parts needed it starts off with an engaging hook designed to raise curiosity in the viewer on what's about to come in the video next part of the script is the main part where the stoicism motivation is shared with the viewer and then lastly it's finished off with a conclusion summarizing everything that's been said in the video so once it's done you have to read the script through and make sure everything looks good it usually never makes mistakes but it's always a good idea to double check just to give you some perspective writing a script like this yourself would have literally taken hours if not days to complete I think you can start to realize how crazy important it is to learn how to use AI when doing YouTube automation anyways now you need someone to read out the script for you a couple of months ago you had to find a voice artist send your script wait a couple of days for the result and on top of that it's all super expensive but that's not the case anymore since I voices have gotten so good that they sound like real humans and you can use them for free now the biggest website for this is called 11lbs they have thousands of ultra realistic AI voices to choose from and they're also the cheapest so click the link in the description and sign up for an account with your email how it works is that you type in your script into this box hit generate speech and it'll create a voice over but first you want to pick a voice you can go with one of their standard voices here to the right or you can go with a custom some professional one which I'd recommend doing the professional voices I think are the voices that have been cloned by professional voice actors so that they sound super realistic now to access these you want to click on voices and then on Library here they have thousands of voices to choose from with different nationalities tones gender and age literally any voice you're looking for you'll be able to find here if you want to hear what a voice sounds like this one for example just click on it and you'll get a preview of what it sounds sounds like after all the most important quality of speech is that it is clear since I'm creating a video in the stoicism Niche I want to deep mail voice to find that we'll have to add a few filters first we have to set the language to English and accent to American now click on these three lines and set category to professional as I said the professional voices sound a lot more realistic and I promise you you won't be able to tell its AI then I'll set the gender to male and keep age at any now you just want to start listening to them one by one until you find one you like we all know that mornings can be chaotic the rush and as you can hear they sound just like a real human I'll just listen through a few more of these and get back to you once I found one after looking around for a bit I found this one that I liked now to use it all you got to do is click on ADD and it'll be visible in your library so go back to this page and you'll see your voice here now all you got to do is paste your script from chat CHT into this box and hit generate speech then just wait a few seconds and you'll be able to hear what it sounds like we all know that mornings can be chaotic the rush to get out the door if you're not satisfied you can play around with the settings and just regenerate it until you get a result that you like and then once you're satisfied download it by clicking this button the next step when creating a video like this is to collect visuals like uh videos and pictures that'll be shown throughout the video and if you just know what softwares to use and how to use them you can create some really crazy stuff I've tried multiple AI softwares and there's this one software all the top guys in this industry will try to gatekeep from you you might have heard about image generators like mid journey and Leonardo AI but this software I'm about to show you does the exact same thing but even better because you can not only create ultra realistic images but also turn them into videos with just one click to find the software you want to click the link in the description that'll take you to a site called lumabs doai how it works is that anything you prompt in this box will be turned into a video now just to show you how it works let's say we want to create a drone image of Manhattan type in something like this hit enter and it'll turn it into this image but that's not even the coolest part because with this software we can even turn it into a video if you click on it you'll see this button in the middle middle that says make video you want to click on that and once you see the image pop up above the prompt box type turn this image into a video and as you can see it did just that and the result turned out really good now we want to apply the exact same concept into our own video for the visuals and since you're probably not a prompt wizard yourself I prepared this template that you can use to generate literally any image you want for any Niche so use this prompt to start creating visuals for your specific video to show a very specific example uh since our video is about stoicism I want to create images related to that topic like ancient statues this prompt template we're going to use works the same way as the one we used for the script you just fill in the highlighted boxes with instructions for your own image like main objects colors Vibe and style in this case when wanting to create an ancient statue it could look something like this once filled in now hit generate to turn the prompt into an actual image and I think it turned out good so I'll repeat the same process as before and click on make video it can take some time for it to be created so just wait a few minutes and your animated image will be ready to go once you've generated the video you want to continue doing the exact same process until you have enough visuals to cover the entire voice over I'll get back to you when I'm done so the next step of the framework is to put all of the assets together in an editing software and actually turn it into an interesting video that can be posted on YouTube I get questions from you guys all the time about how I edit my videos and it seems to be appreciated but the reality is that you really don't need to edit like me to be successful on YouTube especially in the beginning when you don't have a huge budget to splurge on editors instead start off by editing your own videos when you're just starting out it doesn't matter if you've never edited a video in your life before this because I'll show you exactly how to edit a video so that it has all the elements need need it to go viral and the style I'm about to show you can be applied to any Niche the first thing you'll need is the place where you'll actually edit like the software and there are tons of them out there so it can be hard knowing which one to use since I want to show you how to do this for free I'll use cap cut in my opinion it's the best free editing software out there and if you know how to use it you can create videos that are as good as any expensive software like Premiere Pro so click on the link in the description and you'll be able to download it to your computer or just use the we app honestly that works just as well too now the first thing you want to do is to create a new project and import the visuals combined with the voice over now drag the voice over to the timeline and start adding in the visuals one by one until you've covered the entire voice over and to make the switch between the clips look more smooth we want to add a transition which is one of the editing effects that you'll need to get the hang of it's actually super simple to do just click on transitions in the top left and choose from one of their pre-made ones that don't go with anything crazy just something that makes it look a bit smoother like a fade or blur transition drag it down between two clips the same as you did with the voice over and visuals now instead of repeating this between each clip there's a much quicker way to do it if you look to the right you'll see this button that says apply to all and if you click on it the transition will automatically be added between all Clips saving you a ton of time now pay attention this next step is really important to increase the watch time and retention of your video a few years ago there was a study that was done on what impact captions have on a video and the results show that it increased retention by 25% 25% increase in watch time on YouTube is a huge difference and can be what separates a video with 100 views compared to a million views to add these you want to click on text in the top left and then on auto captions now choose English as a language and hit generate to get the entire voice over transcribed in only a few seconds I'd recommend you spice them up a bit by changing the font color and size to create a style unique for your channel like this that way it'll be easier for people to recognize your channel and know it's your video now all that's left to do is export the final video we all know that mornings can be chaotic the rush to get out the door the pr that's how you create faceless YouTube videos completely with AI now the point I want to make with this video is that you don't need to spend hundreds of dollars on hiring Freelancers to do this stuff for you AI softwares are getting better by the day and if you just know how to use them correctly you can use a few websites to automate all of the work related to creating your videos for a fraction of the price compared to hiring Freelancers since you watch this far I just want to share a little secret with you cuz you must be somewhat interested in changing your life with YouTube just like I did I've opened up the applications again for the program where I help people start their own channels and earn a full-time income in just 90 days yeah that's right you heard me 90 days it's less than a term in school what I do in the program is personally help you apply all of these steps into your own channel and turn it into a profitable business however there's a lot more to it and believe it or not finding a niche is the most important step of the entire process almost where most people fall short and fail on their own so if you want to start your own YouTube automation Journey the right way and guarantee that you're going in the right direction click on the link in the description and I'll review your application and see if you're someone I want to work with and also if you're interested in monetized YouTube or Tik Tok accounts don't forget to check out tick accounts they're great for starting out anyways that's it for this video see you",

Ask me in the comment section! #youtubecashcow #facelessyoutube #sidehustles 758 comments in this video I'm going to teach you step by step how to create a YouTube automation video using Ai and other free tools my name is Alex let's jump straight into it now when it comes to YouTube one of my favorite types of videos is ancient history so for the purpose of this video I'm going to be creating a YouTube automation video about ancient Egypt now you can literally make videos about anything simply use the formula that I'm going to teach you in this video Let's jump straight into it now the first thing we're going to need is the script which is going to be the backbone of our video and we're going to use our good friend chat gbt okay so we're on chat gbt and now we're going to get it to create our script and what I'm going to type is create me a script for a YouTube video which is about ancient Egypt and the rise of their empire I'm going to press enter and as you can see it's literally creating our script in a matter of seconds guys so we've got our script and now we're going to move over to getting our narrator to actually do a voice over of it so we're going to be using AI for that now what I'm going to do is go on to clipchamp now I think clipchamp is still one of the most underused Ai and it's completely free so what we're going to do is go to record and create we're going to go to text to speech and we're just going to play around with different voices that we can potentially use for our video now I'm going to use Tony I'm going to grab my intro I'm going to go and paste that into here I'm going to actually change the voice pcture just a bit to see how it sounds and play hello fellow history enthusiasts Welcome to our Channel where today we embark on an exciting Journey Through Time to explore the ancient civilization of Egypt in this episode we delve into the fascinating topic of ancient Egypt's rise to power and the birth of their Mighty Empire and it's as simple as that you just save it to Media now that's about 28 seconds in terms of the editing for our video there are different options now we can use platforms such as invid pictur Etc to have the AI completely generate our video but as you probably know and as most of us know the quality of those videos aren't great and anyone who's telling you that you can just simply press a button and your YouTube automation videos are going to be crazy for you is lying and you won't be able to get monetized and to be honest you won't be getting that many views now there is going to be an element of having to do certain parts manually and I really think that that section should be when you're editing the video but I'm going to show you how it's not difficult at all and you can probably do it in less than 5 10 minutes now we're going to be using cap cut because that's very popular right now and most people have access to it for free or use a similar program but it's completely free and it's good software so guys let's jump over to cap cut okay guys so now we're on cap cut what we're going to do now is essentially we're going to drag our voice over which we got from of AI into the timeline we're going to right click and we're going to press separate audio and we're just going to remove that black screen and delete it and now we have our audio hello fellow history enthusiasts Welcome to our Channel where today we embark on an exciting Journey so basically now what we need to do is actually fill our video now in terms of filling your video there are numerous places you can get stock footage from you can go to pixabay pexels free pck guys there's so many resources online now for free that it's silly for you not to use them now guys so what you want to do is find one of these freest stock video websites and look for content for whatever video you're making so I'll do some research and find some ancient Egypt videos and I will then start dragging them onto my timeline and guys this shouldn't take you long this should take you maybe like 5 minutes open up a few of these stock video websites you know for example if you're doing a video about planets type in you know planets and some space Stuff Etc you can also use Graphics guys you just need to be creative but let's move over to a timeline where I've already got stock videos on so okay guys so I've downloaded a bunch of ancient Egypt stock videos and I've got my AI narrated voice now what I'm going to do is basically now combine or shorten all of my stock videos to make it a clear looking aesthetic now a quick recommendation here is when it comes to YouTube It's All About watch time it's all about user retention so what I'm going to do is basically have a bunch of different stock videos and I want it to change every 3 to 4 seconds so that the viewers watching my video will be intrigued they will constantly be getting fed new visuals so you just want to basically clean up your timeline exactly how I've just mentioned so for example I've got all of these I'm just going to short them up and then obviously you know as time goes what you need to do is find a pattern that works or a sequence of your stock videos which suits the narration of the AI so for example let's listen to it so far hello fellow history enthusiasts Welcome to our Channel where today we embark on an exciting Journey Through Time to explore the ancient civilization of Egypt in this episode we delve into the fascinating topic of ancient Egypt's rise to power and the birth of their Mighty Empire the story of ancient Egypt begins around 3100 BC when the upper and lower Nile region reunited under the first pharaoh Nur guys make sure you stick around until the end so that I can show you my YouTube automation video that I've made in this video now of course guys you know you need to play around with the AI voice as I showed you earlier on clipchamp you can make it slower you can use a female there's so many different options I just really picked one quickly just to show you how easy it is take time to pick certain things and then in the future you can just keep using that same structure now what I'm going to do next is have a small intro in this video because he says you know welcome to the channel Etc so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go over to canva I'm going to type in YouTube video video intro now you've got so many different templates here I'm going to just literally pick one which I think will suit my video for example something like this press customize template guys this is so easy to do you know and again once you've done this once you can use this for a bunch of different videos and what I'm going to do is I'm going to type on C ancient EG and see what we have now what I'm going to do shorten shorten this all the way down to like 4 seconds maybe and that's it and then I'm going to download that and guys as you can see it's really not hard it's just about understanding what software what AI to use to create your different components okay so now what we want to do is I think it's beneficial to add some captions to this video so I'm going to press text I'm going to press Auto captions and I'm going to press create and this is a good reason to use cap cut because you're able to just Auto create captions which can be really useful for your video and the way it creates the captions is you don't necessarily need to have the captions at every point in your video you can like you know just delete this part and then play around with it so for example on that canva clip I will delete this part so I don't Welcome to our Channel where today we embark on an exciting journey through for the purpose of the video I will not spend too long on this text there is so many different options on YouTube Library there is a bunch of royaltyfree music that you can use but on platforms such as pixel Bay Etc where you got your stock videos there's also going to be audio that you can use in your videos so you just want to kind of pick something that matches the video for the purpose of this video I'm just going to go onto cap cart see if there's anything you know that would suit this video and if there is any issues with my audio once I upload my video it will say you know this has got copyright Etc you can't use this or you won't be monetized and then I can simply change it on YouTube Studio or I can just come on here and you know reexport it so it's not really difficult guys now what you want to do is just bring down the audio just so that it's in the background okay guys so now you want to play around with this some more add your AI Voice add your own voice over add your captions the way you want to do your text add some elements from canva and essentially that's how you'll be creating your video now the final steps that you want to do when uploading your video is creating a thumbnail and choosing the title now we're just going to run through this quickly just so that I can make sure that you understand every step of the process now the first thing you want to do is understand the title of your video now this can be done of course before you choose the topic you know do some research but what I really recommend you doing is downloading vid IQ there'll be a link in the description and it will give you information on certain keywords certain topics on YouTube and you know how competitive they are and the overall score in terms of if you should be creating that type of video or not if you really think you have a good idea and that your video can be really good then go for it but it's important to understand this and see what videos have done best and why you know like this one for example why did ancient Egypt eventually fall Immortal Egypt timeline and you know obviously that thumbnail is epic you know it looks really good and you can see the styles of videos that are coming up on the first page and from there you should be able to understand what keywords should be on your title how you can potentially Stand Out Etc and this will also from this research you'll be able to see potentially what type of thumbnails you should use now for the purpose of this video we're going to be using an AI called Blue Willow to create for us a thumbnail Blue Willow is currently in the basa stage and you simply need to have access to Discord and if you do have access to Discord make sure you join my community link in the description but what you need is a Discord account so we're going to go on Discord and we're just going to type in Blue Willow AI free AI art generator now what you need want to press is join the free beta now if you've Used Blue Willow or mid Journey before you already know the rou but essentially we want to create an image for our thumbnail using this now I'm going to type in imagine and then I'm going to put ancient Egypt epic Rise of an Empire then I'm going to put a 3X two and let's see what it creates now you just simply wait okay perfect so you've seen already now let's just go for one of them I think Rise of an Empire this number four looks good so I'm going to pick u4 I'm going to wait for that to be scaled to high quality I'm going to press save image ancient Egypt now if you've got two options here if you think in your Niche that a thumbnail without text is good and that this is clickbait enough then guys that's fine go ahead with it but if you want to add text to your thumbnail just to incentivize people to press it more then we're going to go over to canva and just finalize it what I'm going to do is type in YouTube thumbnail I'm going to press enter and I'm going to pick a template which I think would suit my video I like this one here into the nature I'm going to press customize this template I'm going to drag in my blue willow image which I've just generated and there's my image I'm going to then press position to back I'm going to remove this travel blog I'm going to type in Rise of an Empire I'm going to go to effects I'm going to bring up the lift to Max intensity and I'm going to play around with that's how easy it is to create thumbnails using Ai and smart free tools guys remember with YouTube automation you don't want to go into with the mindset that you're just simply going to press a button and everything's going to be done for you there are going to be a few different ways that you're going to need to have some manual input but trust me that manual input is going to transform the way your videos are viewed are edited everything guys use the formula that I've used in this video and you'll be able to create YouTube automated videos which are really really good and that will generate you a lot of views if you've enjoyed this video make sure you subscribe and drop me a comment and join my Discord community and if you want me to make more videos about YouTube automation let me know guys my name's Alex let's grow",
