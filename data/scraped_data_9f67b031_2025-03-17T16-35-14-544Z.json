Several successful YouTubers, like Andrei Jikh and Nate O'Brien, have openly credited these courses for helping them build thriving channels. But with so many options available, how do you choose the right one to kickstart your faceless YouTube journey? That's where I will help you. In this article, we'll unveil the top 7 FREE YouTube automation courses specifically designed for beginners in 2024. You will learn everything in these YouTube automation courses, from the basics of automation to advanced strategies for niche selection, content creation, and monetization — regardless of whether you are looking to build a side hustle or a full-time income. In this article Part 1: What Is YouTube Automation? Part 2: The Top 7 YouTube Automation Course Free For Beginners Online Business Academy by Dave Nick Tube Money Masterclass by Dylan Miller Pro University by Philipe Reis Tube Mastery 3.0 by Matt Par Jet Video Academy YouTube Shorts Mentorship Program by Robert Benjamin BecomeCreator by Prabhjeet Part 3: No skills Required: Best AI Tool To Automate YouTube Video Generation In 2024Reface Alternative: FaceMod How to use Virbo Part 4: Criteria for Selecting The Best YouTube Automation Courses Conclusion Part 1: What Is YouTube Automation? YouTube automation allows you to leverage existing systems, tools, and outsourcing video creation to streamline the video production process. Doing so, you can build and scale your YouTube channel without being the sole content producer or on-screen talent. You can delegate every task like scriptwriting, video editing, voiceover, and even thumbnail design, and only focus on strategic growth and management of your YouTube channel. How Does YouTube Automation Work? Content Creation: Instead of filming yourself, you can utilize stock footage, animation, or hire scriptwriters and voiceover artists to create engaging content. Video Production: Outsource video editing, thumbnail creation, and other technical tasks to professionals or utilize AI-powered tools. Channel Management: Automate tasks like uploading videos, scheduling posts, and responding to comments using various software and platforms. Monetization: Leverage multiple income streams, such as ad revenue, affiliate marketing, sponsorships, and product sales, to maximize earnings. Quoted from YouTube partner channel Part 2: The Top 7 YouTube Automation Course Free For Beginners 1.Online Business Academy by Dave Nick Dave Nick’s Online Business Academy offers courses on several topics like YouTube, Online Business, Artificial Intelligence, Copywriting, and Affiliate Marketing. However, its standout offering for YouTube automation is the YouTube Automation Systems 3.0 course (US$ 995) — a comprehensive program that promises to equip you with the knowledge and strategies to build and scale a profitable, faceless YouTube channel. You'll learn how to identify lucrative niches, create engaging content (even without showing your face), optimize your videos for maximum visibility, and monetize your channel effectively. Pros Lifetime access to course materials and updates. 30-day refund policy or if less than 10% of the course is consumed Cons High price point (US$ 995) compared to other courses. Dave's marketing style is overly aggressive or \"guru-like.\" Testimonial: “I owe my success in YouTube automation to Dave Nick's incredible mentorship and comprehensive training.” — StartUp Online on Medium. Course Highlights: High-Ticket Niche Mastery: Identify profitable niches with high earning potential. Faceless Channel Creation: Build a successful channel without appearing on camera. Traffic Generation Strategies: Drive massive views and subscribers through various techniques. Monetization Beyond Adsense: Explore multiple income streams beyond ads. Scaling and Automation: Learn to build a team and automate your channel for growth. 2.Tube Money Masterclass by Dylan Miller Similar to Dave Nick's course, Dylan Miller's Tube Money Masterclass also offers a comprehensive approach to creating and automating faceless YouTube channels. However, unlike Dave Nick's focus on high-ticket affiliate marketing, Dylan emphasizes the creation of \"cash cow\" channels that generate income primarily through ad revenue and other monetization methods. Pros Comprehensive and detailed training on YouTube automation. Covers a wide range of topics, from niche selection to monetization. 90-day money-back guarantee. Lifetime access to course materials and updates. Cons Mixed reviews from students, with some reporting unsatisfactory results. Lack of community support or forums for interaction with other students. Testimonial: \"The Tube Money Masterclass gave me the knowledge and tools I needed to start my own successful YouTube channel. I've been able to generate a steady stream of passive income without having to show my face or create my own content.\" - Melinda Caldwell Course Highlights: Pick a Profitable Niche Optimize your channel's branding, layout, and metadata for maximum visibility. Master YouTube SEO to rank your videos higher in search results and get more views. Learn how to increase subscribers, views, and engagement on YouTube. Learn how to outsource tasks like video creation and editing for your YouTube channel. 3.Pro University by Philipe Reis While many YouTube automation courses focus on the \"faceless\" cash cow model, YouTuber Pro from Pro University takes a different approach, aiming to empower you to become a successful YouTuber, regardless of whether you choose to be on camera or not. With a growing community of over 800 students, 5,000+ community members, and a track record of helping launch over 500 successful channels, YouTuber Pro offers a comprehensive curriculum designed to guide you from 0 to 100,000 subscribers in just 6 months. Pros Comprehensive and structured curriculum for YouTube beginners. Suitable for both beginners and experienced creators. Emphasis on building a sustainable business, not just a faceless channel. Lifetime access and 24/7 support. Cons No refund policy. Some students will find the pace of the course too slow. The focus is on organic growth, not on paid advertising or shortcuts. Testimonial: \"I've struggled with YouTube for years, and now that I've joined Pro University, it's just like Mr. Reis mentions in his videos: YouTube is like baking a cake; when you know the right strategies, it works every time.\" - Jesse Clardy Course Highlights: YouTuber Pro covers the entire YouTube journey, from channel creation and branding to content strategy, video optimization, monetization, and team building. Philipe Reis is a successful YouTuber himself, so his real-world experience is valuable. Bonus lessons on topics like video editing and affiliate marketing Private Discord Community. 4.Tube Mastery 3.0 by Matt Par Tube Mastery 3.0 teaches you everything you need to become a successful YouTuber and online entrepreneur. From how to choose a profitable niche, to what type of content you should create in the niche, to how to optimize your YouTube channel, Matt Par teaches everything. Pros Comprehensive and covers all aspects of YouTube channel creation and growth Taught by a successful YouTuber who knows what it takes to succeed Active and supportive community Up-to-date with the latest YouTube algorithm changes Cons Can be expensive for some people Requires a significant time investment to complete Testimonial: “Some videos just take a little while for the algorithm to pick It up Here's a video I made about a year ago that took 4 months before It ever made any real money Now It's generated over $14k Stay patient. Stay consistent The more videos you put out the more seeds you plant. The more seeds you plant the bigger the harvest Is when harvest season comes” — Devon Canup. Course Highlights: Learn how to: How to choose a profitable niche for your channel How to create high-quality videos that people will want to watch How to optimize your channel for growth How to promote your channel and get more views and subscribers How to make money from your YouTube channel Note that it is not a “get-rich-quick” course, completing the course by itself will take some time. 5.Jet Video Academy Jet Video Academy are video lectures offered by two friends Greg Kononenko and Alen Sehovic who found success on YouTube and now teach others how to do the same — and they are known for their \"Evergreen Views Formula.\" Unlike courses like Channel Profits (another prominent course I chose to exclude from this list) — which primarily targets beginners with basic channel setup and common mistakes to avoid, or Automate Channels. Pros Build a successful channel without needing to appear on camera. Choose any niche that interests you for your YouTube channel and create content you're passionate about. Cons Not suitable for those seeking active engagement strategies or rapid growth. Limited strategies for advanced users. Testimonials: \"My first $1000 to be exact... the first sale of $87 came through...\" - Mike Course Highlights: Covers all aspects of YouTube channel creation and growth, from setup to monetization. Valuable resources like profitable niche ideas, channel examples, and thumbnail templates. 6.YouTube Shorts Mentorship Program by Robert Benjamin While other YouTube courses like Jet Video Academy and Tube Mastery offer comprehensive training on various aspects of YouTube, YouTube Shorts mentorship program zeroes in on the explosive potential of YouTube Shorts. You'll receive a personalized growth plan tailored to your niche, weekly check-ins for continuous improvement, and a guarantee of growth within 30 days or your money back. It is important to note that no other course offers this level of focus, support, and assurance for YouTube Shorts. Pros Learn from a YouTube expert who specializes in the short-form video format. The average participant gains over 25,000 subscribers, with no one gaining less than 1,000 subscribers. Cons The US$ 297 investment is definitely a barrier for some creators, but the guaranteed results could justify the cost. Shorts-only focus. Testimonial: \"Being a busy mom, I never imagined I could grow a YouTube channel. Robert's mentorship changed that. His focus on Shorts was perfect for my schedule, and his guidance helped me gain 15,000 subscribers in weeks! Now I'm on track to monetize and turn my passion into profit.\" - Priya S., Lucknow, India Course Highlights: 6-Step Course Personalized roadmap for your channel's growth, outlining posting frequency, content topics, and more. Weekly Check-Ins Bonus Resources like viral title tactics, and optimization strategies. 7.BecomeCreator by Prabhjeet Led by Prabhjeet, a YouTube veteran with over 30 million subscribers across 100+ channels offers a unique approach to YouTube success: faceless automation. Unlike other courses focused on individual effort, Prabhjeet's expertise lies in building and scaling channels without relying on your face or voice. Pros No need for on-camera presence to build a successful YouTube channel. Get direct guidance and mentorship from Prabhjeet and his team. Cons More emphasis on building faceless presence on YouTube Not suitable for people looking to build a YouTube channel in any niche.

faceless videos are currently breaking the algorithm performing even better than those channels where there's someone sitting there showing their face the thing is that not many people know you can literally go viral with your first upload don't get me wrong this is true if you have no experience but the algorithm is changing a couple of years ago it was almost impossible to go viral with your first video but that's just not the case anymore if you apply the things I'm about to share with you you'll be able to blow up your first video this channel was created just 6 months ago today it has 20K subscribers and has got over 100k views on three videos which is just crazy for a channel that's small their most viral video has 150,000 views and with YouTube paying around $6 per th000 views they made around $900 with this one video that probably took no more than 20 minutes to create they're posting these simple disturbing dark web stories and their entire video is literally just a voice over a still image of a character with a rain effect over and some sound effects in this video I'll show you how you can use AI to copy their strategy and start your own YouTube automation business today after watching this video you'll know all the tips and tricks creators use to boost engagement and blow up their videos you don't need any prior experience college degree or anything like that I'll go through through the entire blueprint everything from creating the stories itself generating a voiceover with AI that sounds realistic creating our character and even how to edit it all together if you don't have the patience to watch the coming 10 minutes or so of this video this business model is not for you but before we get into the tutorial though let's take a quick look at the video I was able to create with the tools I'm about to share with you this happened to me about a year ago I was living in This Old House I just rented it had that classic creepy house Vibe creep floor the blueprint I use to make this is actually pretty simple and only consists of a few Key Parts quick pause I just want to mention before I show you the entire tutorial that I do actually have a free community where I help over 20,000 of you guys every day I even hired a mentor that will host calls on social media growth every week but the cool thing is that it's completely free I don't ask for a single dollar anyway I linked it in the description for those interested thanks for supporting me guys if you've ever created a channel before you probably already know how to do this so skip to this Tim stamp if you want to move on to the next step however if you haven't created a channel before do this head over to YouTube and click on your profile picture then you want to press switch account and view all channels click create new channel and you'll be able to pick a username if you have a good name in mind go with that if you don't I have a method you can use find a viral channel in your Niche and copy their channel name then head over to chat C GPT paste it and ask it to generate 10 suggestions for similar names to a YouTube channel in the Reddit Horror Story Niche then press generate and pick a name you like I'll go with this one right here cuz I think it had the right Vibe then paste it into YouTube next we need to create a channel description head back over to chat GPT and ask it to create a fitting description for a channel in the Reddit Horror Story Niche press generate and paste in this one too lastly we need to add tags to improve our Channel's seo seo stands for search engine optimization by adding the right tags to our Channel we'll be shown when people search for different keywords finding popular keywords can be hard if you don't know what you're doing but I've actually found a website that'll give you all the most popular keywords for your Niche head over to vid IQ and click on keywords to the left here you'll be able to enter your Niche and it'll give you the most popular keywords so I'll just type in my Niche and copy these matching keywords then you want to head back to YouTube and enter them in the tag box like this now let's create our first video and the first step is the script here's one thing for you to accept script writing is what makes up literally 90% of a good video you can have the craziest editing on YouTube but if your script sucks your video won't go viral you can really make any topic interesting just by choosing the right words and structuring your video the right way just think of all the creators that are just sitting in front of front of a camera without a planned script or any fancy editing like this guy or this guy they're all getting hundreds of thousands of views without any insane editing they do have a good voice and great Charisma but it won't help you very much since you're starting a faceless channel in this case let's pay attention to their choice of a good topic and the fact that they had an interesting script you have to do the same or your videos will flop there are three ways you can go about when creating a script first one is get your mind going and write it yourself I usually always recommend my students to write the scripts themselves when starting out but since we're creating Reddit Story videos that'd be a real headache to come up with second option is to create it with AI some will say you can't create a good script with chat GPT which really isn't true it all comes down to what prompt you're using I've tried hundreds of prompts and yeah most of them get you shitty results you can't just ask it to create a YouTube script in your Niche and expect your video to go viral you got to be more specific than that tell it what it'll be used for what it'll be about who the narrator is type of grammar length I've done some experimenting and came up with this prompt layout that I'll leave in the Google Doc I mentioned earlier it's basically a prompt that'll have all the information chat GPT needs to create a good and engaging script as you can see there are these blank spaces you'll need to fill in based on what you want your video to be about here's an example of how I did it just pause the video right now if you want to take a closer look at it then you want to generate it and make sure it sounds like it's written by a human this is really important if it sounds robotic people will notice and click off of your video so if it does adjust the prompt and regenerate it a couple of times till you get one you like once done it's time to generate a voice over to create a voice over you want to head over to 11 Labs if you've never used it before create an account with your Gmail by following the instructions on the homepage then once logged in click on voice Library most gurus will just tell you to go with some saturated voice like Adam which just won't get the job done you need to pick a unique voice for your channel when people hear that voice they should think of your channel and since pretty much all of their pre-made voices have been used a million times by a million different channels you need to create your own voice to do this click on add a new voice and then voice design you'll then be able to choose the characteristics SS of the voice since we're creating a Horror Story video we're looking for a deep and slow male voice I've tried a bunch and these gave the best results so feel free to copy them press generate use voice and you'll be able to use it on your script pick the voice you just created and start generating 500 words at a time this will make it sound much more human if you generate the entire script at once it'll sounds super robotic add commas capital letters and exclamation marks to add emotions to The Voice voice click generate and repeat this process till you've gone through the entire script it might sound a bit slow but I actually have a crazy trick to make it sound exactly like a real human that I'll show you later once you've got the voice over ready we need to generate our character the channel I showed you earlier usually has some kind of creepy character with a detailed background like this to generate one of these characters we need some kind of AI image generator you can really use anyone you like but I'll go with Leonardo AI since it's free create an account with your email address if you've never used it before and click on image generation set the size to the YouTube format which is 169 and use this template I've created for you to create a prompt I'll leave it in the Google Doc I mentioned earlier Leonardo will then turn that text prompt into an image basically you want to fill in these boxes with your own design idea here's the specific prompt I'm going to use I'll leave this one in the document to if you want some inspiration then you just generate it a couple of times until you get a character you like and download that image now that we have our voice over and character ready it's time to edit it all together and make an actual video out of it you really don't need any fancy editing software that'll set you back hundreds of dollars like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe After Effects there are tons of free editing softwares out there that have all the features we need for example cap cut so after logging in create a new project and upload the voice over and the character image start by dragging the voice over file to the timeline then choose the razor tool and cut out all the pauses like this after that delete the Dead Space and overlap the clips to remove the small pauses and increase the [Music] pace basically what all this does is make the flow and pace of your AI gen generated voiceover sound a lot more natural usually AI voiceovers have long weird pauses and those are the ones we're cutting out anyways listen if it sounds natural or not and if it does sound good and you're satisfied repeat this process on the entire voice over till you end up with something like this so this happened to me about a year ago I was living in This Old House I just rented it had that Classic this happened to me about a year ago I was living in This Old House I just rented it had that classic creepy house Vibe creaky floors flickering lights and of course now add the character image to the frame and extend it so that it covers the entire voice over down in the timeline otherwise the image will disappear in the middle of the video then you want to click on this ratio button and set the size 16x9 which is the format for long form YouTube videos but we're not done yet if we want our video to go viral it needs to be even better than the channel I showed you earlier and if we take a look at one of their most viral videos videos You'll see they're using this rain effect to add this click on the effects Tab and search for the one called rain drag it to the timeline like you did with the other elements and extend it so that it covers the entire video once again then you want to click on effects again and add the one called noise 2 to get that retro video look once done it should look something like this the video looks good but it's too light we want the corners a bit darker so that the character isn't Focus to do that you can just follow these simple steps press on adjust over here and add a new adjustment layer click on it and drag vignette up to around 20 this way you'll get these darker Corners now that's it for the visuals the things the viewer actually sees but there's a whole other Spectrum we haven't even touched on yet in which we can make our video even more engaging sound design sound design is actually a completely different video Topic in itself since it's so complex to give you the simple rundown it basically consists of two components first sound effectss this is what will make the viewer feel everything that is happening in the video finding the sound effects independently on YouTube look at the job done but it's timec consuming and annoying to find trust me I'm speaking from experience so to make things easy for you I've actually put together a Google drive folder that I'll leave in the description with all the most viral sound effects out there I don't really ask anything for it so you can just use it whenever you want in a video like the one we're doing you want to keep it simple adding a bunch of random random sound effects is not the move since it'll just turn out unprofessional I'll just be adding a rain effect in the background for the scary Vibe by the way I'll put this specific one in the folder as well so upload it like always and drag it to the timeline make sure to listen and see if the volume needs to be adjusted because you don't want it to be too loud the second part of sound design is the music or soundtrack the music is what will determine what the viewer feels when watching your video so in this case we want the viewer to feel both scared and excited finding the right music can be difficult so I like to use websites like pixabay they have hundreds of copyright free songs you can use in your video you can just search or filter according to what you need and you should find something pretty quick so head over there and search for the type of music you're looking for press download and add it to your video like you did with the sound effects upload it to cap cut drag it to the timeline and adjust the length and again make sure the music is not too loud and that's pretty much all that goes into creating a video like this lastly you want to click export and choose the 1080P and 60 frames per second to get the best possible quality here's how it turned out this happened to me about a year ago I was living in This Old House I just rented it had that classic creepy house Vibe creaky floors flickering lights I know it's a lot to take in all at once so if you want to learn more about this stuff and chat with me one-on-one I've created a free Discord Community where me and my mentors dive a bit deeper into the stuff for those of you that might not have so much money I've actually hired new mentors that host webinars and classes for the entire Community not just the paid growth program this means you can get knowledge and tips on how to grow for free without having to spend anything just look out for this link in the

This is especially true for generative AI tools. With big marketing budgets and a lot of buzz, these platforms make it seem like “AI video workflow” actually means “let AI make your videos.” Don’t fall for that! There are many steps in a video creation process and many ways to introduce AI tools. You get to decide what video workflow automation looks like for you. If you’re new to AI tools, you may be surprised by just how helpful they can be. And for video creators, right now is the best time to begin incorporating AI into your workflow: AI won’t take your job — but someone using AI might. So let’s take a look at how you can build an AI video workflow. AI video tools for content development and preproduction The first stage of a video workflow is sometimes called the “development stage.” This is when you’ll brainstorm ideas, plan your content strategy, or flesh out your video idea. For some creatives, this is not the most fun part of your video workflow. Thankfully, there are plenty of ways to incorporate AI tools in your content development process so you can get to the next stage of video production faster. Here are just a few ideas: Stay aligned by using meeting assistants Content strategy and planning can involve a lot of meetings with your team, clients, or collaborators. Depending on the video topic, you may also be using this stage to conduct interviews. That’s why AI meeting assistants are ideal for this stage of your process. After configuring an AI meeting assistant tool, it runs in the background of your video conferences and calls. These tools will automatically transcribe meetings to capture the conversation, take notes, generate meeting summaries, and even create lists of action items. Some of the most popular AI meeting assistants include Supernormal, Fireflies, Krisp, and Circleback. Streamline content strategy and planning AI tools can also be used for content strategy and development. From researching keywords to reviewing content performance, harnessing AI can offer insights and focus to help drive strategy and planning. Google’s Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool can help creators analyze and distill written content. Other NLP tools like ChatGPT can spark ideas and help with content planning. A simple text prompt can help creators map out a whole content calendar. For example: “I want to create a series of video essays about the history of the Olympic Games. What are some ideas for topic clusters that will help me get started?” Source: ChatGPT AI-powered SEO and research tools like SEMrush and MOZ’s Keyword Explorer can help develop your keyword strategy and inform your topics and scripts. Incorporating AI tools into the analytics process can help video creators see what’s working and iterate on their successful content. Create video outlines and talking points Once you have a solid video idea, it’s time to begin preproduction. The preproduction phase includes a lot of hammering out logistics, like finalizing the budget and scouting filming locations. It also includes a lot of creative planning, like writing scripts and storyboarding. AI can make this phase of video production less of a headache, especially if you’re struggling to make your video idea into reality (writer’s block is real, people). Use a simple text prompt with an NLP tool like ChatGPT or Jasper to help kickstart your process. Just remember that AI tools like this are a starting point, not an end product. Source: ChatGPT Tip: When you’re using ChatGPT and other similar AI tools, be detailed and thorough in your prompts to get the best results. Draft scripts with genAI writing assistants In our article about AI tools for content creators, we covered some of the top AI writing assistants and how creators put these tools to work in their content process. Platforms like ChatGPT, Jasper, and VEED.io are all popular natural language processing tools that can help content creators draft video scripts. Source: Synthesia Just remember that AI can make big mistakes and even deliver plagiarized content. Always edit your video scripts so they’re in your voice, conduct plenty of research, run plagiarism checks, and disclose when AI has been used in your content creation process. Create storyboards with text-to-image generators The storyboarding process helps video producers visualize each scene before filming begins. And when it comes to video workflow automation, storyboarding is a great place to start. Generative AI tools are great for storyboarding because the final output isn’t intended to be public (meaning creators don’t need to worry about unintended plagiarism). With simple text prompts, you can generate a complete storyboard document pairing visuals with lines from your script. And, while you can use almost any text-to-image generator to create your storyboards, there are also plenty of tools already made for this purpose, like Boords and StoryboardHero. Source: Boords By incorporating AI tools into your content development and preproduction processes, you can cut down on prep time and start making your vision a reality. Simplify video production with AI video tools Now the preproduction pays off and you can start bringing your vision to life! When it comes to using AI video tools for production, you can enhance traditional video production or experiment with AI video generators. Your approach will depend on your goals, brand, and final product. Here are some common tools for AI video production. Generate short video clips from text prompts and images Let’s say you need a shot for one section of your video, but production would be way out of budget. AI video generators like Pika and Runway take a simple text prompt and produce a short video clip. In this clip, I used Pika to generate \"a sweeping scene of the sun rising over Ancient Greece.\" Source: Pika Creators can also add still images to those text prompts to generate a unique final product. Using AI video generators can be handy depending on the clip that you need, but as always with AI tools, it can require some trial and error to get the result you want. Kickstart or streamline video production with a text-to-video generator One of the tools we talked about (and tested) in our AI tools for content creation article is Pictory, a text-to-video generator. Text-to-video generators allow creators to start with a video script (or even a blog article) to generate a video using stock footage, music, and AI voice overs. By pinpointing key messages in your video script, this platform and others like it will suggest appropriate video clips. Creators can also upload their own clips, combining unique visuals with stock music and voice overs. Create more content with fewer takes using digital avatars Another popular approach to AI video workflows is the use of digital avatars. Platforms like Synthesia and HeyGen offer a selection of digital avatars, or you can create your own. By recording a short sample video, you allow the platform to train and create an AI-powered digital avatar that looks and sounds like you. Then, it’s just a matter of adding a script for your new AI avatar to read, and voilà! You’re ready to create multiple unique (if slightly uncanny) videos, without ever turning on your camera. Make it easier for (human) on-screen talent to nail the first take with a smart teleprompter If digital avatars are not for you, AI video tools can still support the production stage of workflow. There are plenty of teleprompter apps out there, but Speakflow’s AI-powered software allows creators to control the speed of the scroll with their voice alone. The app can “hear” the on-screen talent as they speak, and will scroll to match the speed of the speaker. Adjust your video framing or background Platforms like NVIDIA Broadcast App and Camo are “virtual webcams.” The AI features powering these platforms allow creators to remove background noise, replace or adjust their video background, and even autoframe to keep on-screen talent front and center — while recording or streaming content. Adjusting these components during filming means less time in postproduction. Speaking of postproduction … How to automate video editing and postproduction Once you’re finished with your video production phase, it’s time to enter the postproduction phase. In this phase, creators edit, adjust, and enhance footage until they have a final product. Some of the best AI tools for video are made to automate postproduction tasks. Make your video look better with AI-powered editing tools The best part about using AI video editing tools is that you can make small changes with big impact. And, smart use of AI video tools can reduce the amount of time spent in production and postproduction. Adjust visuals Generative fill AI video editing tools have already made it possible for creators to adjust static images. For example, now it’s possible to adjust an image’s aspect ratio, expand the image, and even add or remove objects. Now, video editors like Adobe Premiere are beginning to incorporate generative fill features. Soon, it’ll be much easier to make small changes to a scene in-post rather than requiring a second take. Correct eye contact If you or your on-screen talent were reading from a script or teleprompter, their eyes probably strayed from the camera here and there. Depending on the type of video you’re editing, you may be able to make it work — or you can use a tool like Captions to adjust the speaker’s pupils on an already recorded video. Enhance video quality Topaz is an AI tool made for enhancing video quality — literally. If you’ve filmed the perfect scene, but need to stabilize a shaky camera, Topaz is the tool for you. You can also use Topaz to upscale your video quality, add more frames per second, and even transform your standard shot into a cinematic slow motion. Automate video editing with a speech-to-text editor Anyone who’s edited a video (or podcast, for that matter) knows that a lot of postproduction time is dedicated to removing weird dead space, sniffs and sneezes, filler words, and tongue-tied mispronunciations. Speech-to-text editing platforms like Descript make that way easier. By processing the audio of your recorded video into text, you can remove filler words or dead space in your video as easily as you uh remove them from you know, like … um … a Word document. Correct botched audio or generate voice overs If your video voice over was almost perfect, but one mispronunciation is ruining the whole take, fear not. An AI voice generator like ElevenLabs can actually clone a voice, so you can easily correct a small mistake in voice over (or generate multiple VOs) without ever turning on a mic. Tools like this are also useful for translation and dubbing. We previously mentioned Synthesia, which allows creators to generate digital avatars (complete with AI voices). One of their coolest features is the ability to translate a voice over with just the click of a button. Talk about simplifying video distribution! Add captions for accessibility and engagement One of the most important video marketing trends we’ve seen in recent years is the proliferation of silent video. As short-form video content on social media becomes more popular, most people (over 90%) will watch videos without sound. Adding captions to your video content makes it more accessible, engaging, and effective. And while it used to take ages to add captions, now you can use platforms like Simplified and CapCut to add stylized captions to your videos in a snap. Start building your AI video workflow today As you can see, there are plenty of ways to incorporate AI video tools into your creative process without sacrificing your creativity. The first step to building your AI video workflow is pinpointing the stages and steps where you’d welcome automation. Experiment with offloading your least favorite and most tiresome tasks, and soon you may find more inspiration for the most gratifying parts of your creative process.

As viewers gravitate towards more visually engaging formats, creators and marketers are tasked with the ongoing challenge of producing high-quality videos and distributing them across platforms to reach, build, and engage their audiences. The constant juggle of uploading content, managing trends, and staying on top of administrative tasks can be overwhelming — and it can detract from the creative process. This necessary evil can dilute your focus and energy, making it harder to consistently deliver top-notch content. Maximizing YouTube's potential through automation Automation can play a critical role in addressing some of these challenges by streamlining the content creation, scheduling and distribution processes. It can also lend a helping hand in tracking trending topics and monitoring the competitive landscape, making it easier for you to remain relevant and ahead of the curve. Enter Make’s YouTube app integration, which makes it easy to build workflows that automate YouTube in meaningful ways. By automating your YouTube workflow, Make frees up valuable time, allowing you to concentrate on what you do best. Using Make's YouTube app modules Make’s visual drag-and-drop interface gives you the ability to connect and automate processes across applications in just a few clicks. Not only does this help save time on otherwise manual tasks — it also opens up the opportunity for system optimization by leveraging new and exciting capabilities, such as AI tools. Here’s how you can get started with automating YouTube using Make’s YouTube app integration. Streamline video uploads With an increasing number of media platforms, managing content creation, scheduling, and distribution has become increasingly complex. Each platform has different requirements to consider and account for. To navigate this challenge, creators and marketers have turned to content storage and management systems. By integrating these systems with media platforms like YouTube, the manual effort of uploading and distributing video content can be eliminated. Make lets you build scenarios to seamlessly connect these systems to ensure that content is efficiently published across multiple channels, giving you more time to focus on producing high-quality content that engages and grows your audience. Make’s YouTube \"Upload a Video\" module supports the automatic uploading of video content. This module can seamlessly integrates with Make’s suite of AI integrations, enabling you to build sophisticated scenarios using YouTube and various AI applications available on Make, such as OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Perplexity AI, and many others. These integrations can automate the generation of video descriptions and tags to enhance your content's discoverability and optimize your overall YouTube strategy. Get started with the \"Upload a Video\" module using these templates: The \"Upload a Video\" module is especially suitable for uploading short-form video content, like YouTube Shorts. Please note that the file size limitations depend on the Make plan that you use — you can review maximum file sizes in the pricing plans overview. Watch trends A big part of retaining a loyal audience is remaining current and authentic in your expression. At the same time, keeping track of topics relevant to your audience, competitors, fellow brands and creators can be daunting. Make’s YouTube \"Watch\" modules simplify this process, making it easy to stay updated on industry trends. There are three \"Watch\" modules: \"Watch Videos in a Channel\". \"Watch Videos by Search\". \"Watch Videos in a Playlist\". These modules helps you monitor for content that’s relevant to you and your audience, whether it’s from thought leaders, competitors or potential partners. What’s more, you can use the \"Watch\" modules in tandem with AI apps — for example, the below templates demonstrate how to use OpenAI's GPT models to summarize video transcripts. By combining this with notification features in your scenarios, you can easily stay informed and quickly digest new content.
