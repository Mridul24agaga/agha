I share my personal experiences and strategies for making money online, but results are not guaranteed. Always do your own research and consult a professional before starting any business or investment. This content is not financial advice. 73 comments I went from being stupidly broke to making millions of dollars not Revenue in less than 2 years and today I decided to do something no one has ever done I decided to share the entire process for completely free and you see YouTube automation is not something that works just for me there are thousands of other faceless channels that are now recording videos and making millions of dollars a year like this Indian guy who makes a million dollars a month or this American who makes $200,000 a month or this Brazilian who makes almost a million a month and even I personally helped over 4,000 people make their first $10,000 online with this now this doesn't mean that you will guaranteed make money right now from this but at least it shows you that this doesn't just work for me but for thousands of other people around the world in this free stepbystep tutorial you will get a full blueprint to start your faceless Channel free prompts that I paid $400 for free templates and resources to save you at least $100 a full guide to get views and subscribers and of course have to actually earn your first dollars from faceless YouTube automation my advice to you right now is to put this video in full screen and close all other tabs you want to prove to yourself that you are serious about building an online business this is not going to be easy but it's very very worth it if you can focus but if you can't watch this free tutorial until the end that this is probably not going to work for you and that's okay step one let's first prove the concept so we know that this is actually worth your time so here's one one video that I posted on one of my channels this video was posted 2 years ago it accumulated over 900,000 views and it made me about $37,000 from ad Revenue now what I really like about faceless YouTube automation is that it really is pure passive income again I posted this 10-minute video I forgot about it maybe 3 days later but I continue to get paid every single day for the last 2 and A2 years from this one single video and when you have hundreds of videos on your channel that quickly adds up now this video made about $39 or was earning $39 per 1,000 views and and again it continues to make money now from 67 million views in this channel I made about $836,000 from ad revenue and I have some other channels where I've done over a million dollar in that Revenue so far or this channel where I've done about 30 $349,000 now this Mone is doing about I believe $5,000 a month right now so it's pretty stable and I continue investing in new YouTube automation channels every week every Sunday I add new channels to this list which I'm going to share with you also for completely free it's a list of channels that are just starting on YouTube and they have less than 30 videos but they already make over $5,000 a month so here's one example over here this channel has five videos and their first video got 1.6 million views now we know that I'm sometimes being paid $39 per 1,000 views but let's assume that they're only making $9 per 1,000 views we can then see their total views on the channel so it's 3.6 million we're going to copy that number we're going to head over to Gro and we're going to ask it how much money they potentially made from this channel from ad revenue and that's going to tell us they've made about $33,000 from this channel that was started about 3 months ago and again on this list I've added lots of different channels from different niches like this one made over $330,000 from eight videos or this one over here made $100,000 from their first five videos and if you scroll through this again we can find over 400 channels on this list all making money with faceless YouTube automation like if I open up this channel over here we can see they only have 13 videos and 100,000 subscribers and if we open up any of these videos we can see that they are completely faceless they are getting brand deals so they're being paid as well and they're promoting different links in their description step number two understand that this is not a getrich quick scheme you're not going to go to some magic AI tool press one button and have a viral video that's going to print money out of nowhere if it was that easy everyone would do it and it wouldn't have any value meaning you wouldn't make any money set your expectations so that you think that for the first year of doing this you're not going to earn a single dollar you're just going to be posting videos and you're not going to earn anything even though that's very hard as we've seen all of these channels it's started with just a couple of videos and made hundreds of thousands of dollars and even I myself made my first $10,000 within 2 and A2 months but the only right mindset shift that you should have right now is that this is going to be extremely hard it's going to be harder than you can even imagine you're going to be doing it every single day for hours for the entire year and you're going to earn precisely 0 and you're only going to be doing it so you can acquire skills so that on year number two you can potentially start making money and this mindset shift will allow you to not quit like 99% of the people that are watching this video that will go and try this they will make their first video that is going to suck they're going to post it they're going to think it's good but it's not going to get views they're not going to make money and they're going to quit after 24 hours and guess what they are going to miss out on hundreds of thousands of dollars that they could have otherwise make if they just stuck to the plan and they did this for a longer period of time look my very first faceless video was posted 10 years ago and at that time I was just posting videos without making a single dollar and I didn't even know that you can make money from this but today you have proof that this can make you money it's just going to take time and you just have to stick to the plan and not quit and I'm going to share with you this guide this is completely free in a second I will show you where to get it but let's go through it together as well because most people over complicate YouTube you just have to think about what does YouTube as a platform actually want what is their goal their goal is to keep people watching and therefore the metrics of success on YouTube are click through itate or the CTR and average view duration so you just have to make videos that people click on and watch it sounds simple but we will get into the step-by-step process throughout this tutorial now if you're a little bit more advanced with YouTube you can skip this part there should be chapters down below and you can just skip if you're completely new then I recommend you watch this as well as I'm going to go over some terms that we're going to be using so you can understand this business a little bit better so you're going to hear me talk about CPM CPM stands for cost per meal and it shows how much money advertisers are spending for 1,000 views in your channel and then RPM is how much you are being paid for each 1,000 views because you split the ad Revenue with YouTube now what shows in your YouTube dashboard is what do you get into your bank accounts you don't even see the full amount of money so for example if I made $800,000 from this channel that means that YouTube essentially got $1.5 million and they just left me with $800,000 so I never saw that 1 million or whatever but this is what goes into my bank account now really interesting question that I get asked quite a lot is doesn't matter what country you're posting videos from and absolutely no I started my first channel from an Eastern European country now I live in Dubai I lived in America I lived in Bali I travel constantly as well and it doesn't matter at all so YouTube algorithm does not favor or penalize content based in the country of origin you could be sitting on the moon right now but if you're posting content that is appealing to a worldwide audience or is in English then you are probably going to get worldwide audience now what is the retention rate well the retention rate on YouTube is one of the most important metrics because it measures the percentage of a video that viewers typically watch and we're going to go over how to actually increase your retention rate because that's going to allow you to make more money and get more views now what is CTR CTR stands for click through rate and this is a metric that measures the percentage of viewers who click on a video thumbnail and watch the video after seeing the thumbnail and the title of that video so before you open up this video you saw that small image and you also saw the title and you decided hm this is something that I should click on now if you're completely new to this let me just quickly explain how YouTube creators actually make money from views that they are getting so YouTubers make money from ads through something that's called YouTube Partner program that we're going to talk about later on in details so when you watch a YouTube video you might have seen these ads that show before and after or during videos that you watch on YouTube so Those ads are paid for by companies that advertise on YouTube and so YouTube gets paid by the advertisers by those companies and they just share that money with us with YouTubers who made those videos YouTube keeps part of the money usually 45% and then gives the rest 55% to the YouTuber so YouTubers earn money based on how many people see those ads and this is called CPM or cost per 1,000 views and CPM can either be higher or lower depending on what category of videos you create if you make cat videos you're going to attract audience that is not really appealing to advertisers so your CPM is going to be lower and you would be paid less for 1,000 views while if you make higher quality videos in nichas that we're going to discuss later your CPM is going to be higher and there you will be earning more per 1,000 views that you are getting on those videos It's relatively simple it's relatively easy step number three probably one of the most important steps and that is choosing the right Niche for your YouTube channel the most common question I get asked every single day is what you should make your videos about or in other words what is going to be your Niche it's very important but unfortun Ely there is not one single Niche that's going to fit every single person you have to figure it out for yourself and there are some simple steps that can help you do this number one you can choose what's already working I personally like to see YouTube channels that are getting results because it proves to me that if one human can do this then there is high chance that I can do this as well if one human makes over $5,000 a month from their Channel and theyve made over $300,000 from a single channel that means I could at least make 10% of that and in fact one of the things that got me into YouTube is when a few years ago I saw someone almost the same age as me post a video like this where they shared their earnings and I was like how is this guy making $300 a day from his bedroom this is insane and it inspired me to start my own channel so seeing successful channels is very powerful and I'm going to share with you this document this list of over 400 channels that are making at least $5,000 a month and you can find it in the description box of this video just go to school.com slob PF go to the tools category over here open up this post click on see more scroll a little bit down and you're going to find Niche ideas list of 400 channels making $55,000 a month if you don't find any inspiration there then you can also look into highest CPM niches so in this document I've talked about what are the top three niches that pay the most amount of money per 1,000 views and those are software and AI tools which can sometimes pay up to $100 per 1,000 views online business is what can pay over $10 per 1,000 views and then finance and investing like this guy over here he's making over $20 per 1,000 views or you can ask yourself these questions who am I what are you good at what do you enjoy what industries audiences groups are you familiar with or part of and then you have some knowledge about that Community then ask yourself who are going to be the people watching these videos that you are posting what is their story what is their personality what do they value how do they spend their time genuinely spend some time thinking about that audience because you're going to be making videos for that specific Avatar and I need you to focus only in one Niche because if you post a little bit of this and a little bit of that you're never going to build a real channel that attracts the Right audience that can make you money then ask yourself why should they watch your channel rather than almost any other channel that is in that same Niche are you just using some magic AI tools to generate content that they can see is low value or are you putting more effort than you competitors and then you can do some competitor analysis in that free community that I previously shared you're also going to find my competitor analysis worksheet this is also Freight notion template where you can just go through a channel that you found that is in your Niche and then you're just going to ask yourself these questions what kind of videos are they making how did they start how do they make money look into the description box what are The Things They are promoting what Can you steal from them what you don't like about that channel so that you can avoid it what is their target audience Etc you can answer these questions in this worksheet so for example let's say I really like this format and this is something I'm passionate about these animals and I can see that this channel is getting a lot of views and I want to create a similar channel for step number four you need to open up Google Document and you need to find at least five competitor channels that you're going to be replicating especially when starting out you don't want to reinvent the V and you don't want to risk you want to choose something that's proven to get results like I'm going to take this channel as an example and I'm going to put it over here now I need to find at least four more channels that are doing similar kind of content that I can put on this list so I'm going to type in main keywords into the search bar and I will try to find a few channels here's another one over here they have 100,000 subscribers with only 15 videos and we can see that they also started only 3 months ago so I'm going to take this link and I'm going to paste it in this box here's another Channel as an example and here's another one here as an example as well in less than 2 minutes I found on five competitor channels the more of them you can find the better it's going to be but five should be a minimum at the end of this video we're also going to do a Q&A I'm going to answer your most common questions so that you can avoid making mistakes you can save time and do things the right way step number five we need to choose a channel name when you're inside of a refer Community you're going to find the YouTube automation starter blueprint this has a promp that you can copy and paste from this Google Document you can head over to Gro or to chat GP you can paste in that prompt and just describe your Niche so for example I make videos about why sucks to be X animal and then it just gives me different video ideas or different channel name ideas in this case tail Tales is a good one so I'm going to copy this name you see I would never be able to make money from my YouTube automation channels if I was not approved into the YouTube Partner program that means that my channels first need to have 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time and then I need to wait up to 1 month to get a the partner program so I can monetize my videos and for all of that time if I'm not monetized I would be making 0 to battle that you can go to dfy dave.com monetization and just get an instantly monetized YouTube channel so you can make money from day one and not have to wait 6 to 12 months and miss out on thousands of dollars that could have otherwise been yours like if you look into this channel for example if they posted their very first video and got 1.6 million views that would be about 14,000 ,000 just from out Revenue which they would have missed out if they were not monetized from day one that's why I always first get my channel monetized before starting to post content because it saves a lot of time it saves a lot of money and it allows me to start and make money from day one step number seven now we need to create a Gmail account so go to gmail.com click on create an account for my personal use enter the name of your channel and click next select your birthday over here create a password for your account and click next then read their terms of service and privacy policy and if you agree just click I agree then head over to youtube.com and click on create a channel and here you can pick your handle and again stay tuned until the end of this video as we're are going to be doing Q&A and I'm going to answer some of the most common questions on how to get views and subscribers next up we need to create our Channel branding that means our logo and our channel art as well here's how channel art looks on some other channels so what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to head over to canva.com which is this free graphic design tool now when I'm on canva I usually just click custom size to start editing from scratch and then I select 1080p by 1080p to start with a profile picture now I would go over to Leonardo AI which is a free AI tool that allows you to generate images so we're going to click on image creation on the left side we're going to select one by one dimension select this format over here choose your own animal my favorite animal is lemor I'm going to describe what kind of profile picture I want and I would then just click generate and then when I get the profile picture that I like for example this one over here I would then click on the download button go back to canva drag and drop that design go back to my YouTube channel click on customize this channel continue upload a profile picture that I've just created with Leonardo click on reset size on the left hand side select 1920 by 1080P and click on copy and resize now we type in some cheesy text and on the left side I would choose one of these fonts because I'm really trying to kind of recreate like what my competitors are doing over here but I'm still trying to stay a little unique with my own designs and with my own thoughts and ideas I'm going to go to elements and I'm going to search for some of these then I'm going to click on the share button click download as a PNG this is going to be the highest quality image so download it to your computer then go back to your YouTube channel click on upload for channel art and double click on that design which you just made in Cana and click publish now keep in mind that even though I got paid $39 per 1,000 views in this video that's not how I get paid for every single one of them sometimes I get paid $10 for 1,000 views sometimes $20 for 1,000 views and it just really depends on which need Niche you choose some niches pay more some of them pay less so perhaps with your channel you might only be paid $4 for 1,000 views and that's completely normal for step number 10 we will need to optimize our Channel description so we can rank higher on Google and YouTube so we're going to use this prompt that I made for you inside of that document and if you wish you can either use Gro or you can use chat GPT I personally prefer Gro it's a little bit more powerful at the moment so I'm going to paste this prompt and I'm just going to type in the name of my channel so this is the name and I'm going to describe what my Niche is all about then we're going to get this entire bio created for us so we're going to copy this we're going to go back to our YouTube channel go to the description paste that in here and click publish if you're wondering this is how my channel looks as right now I have profile picture I have channel art channel name and then I also have my description at the end of this tutorial we're going to go over a Q&A to talk about how to get use and one of the most common lessons and mistakes that beginners make all right now we need to find our first video idea and there's multiple ways to do this the very first one and the free option is to just look at your competitor channels and see what's working well for the last 30 days so you would open up a channel you would look into their latest 30 videos and then you would see which ones are getting more views than the rest so for example this one it seems like people really like the snakes 61 million views while all the other ones are getting a few hundred, views so that one really stands out and hey you can do the exact same thing on literally any channel in any Niche so if you look into these YouTube automation channels like can scroll we also have some channels in different categories let's say for instance this one talks about the universe and space I can open up one of these let's say this is your Niche I would just look into which ones are getting more views what topics are people interested in so I can see that there are some that got 6 million views while the other ones are getting a few hundred thousand views so it's seems like this is attracting a wide audience or another way to find viral video ideas is to use external AI tools for example I use vid IQ for this with vid IQ I usually just do keyword research and I look into outliers so what I mean by that is if we head over to the outlier section in the left hand side we can just type in the word that we're trying to Target let's say for example I know that deep seek an AI tool has been going viral lately if I type in deep seek I can see which videos are getting more views and what topics are getting more views in the rest we can see the outlier score and obviously the higher the outlier score the higher chances is that that video got more views if you don't want to pay for viq there is a free option as well it's called glow AI so you can just click on try for free at least as of the time of me recording this video it's free otherwise please don't pay for it because BQ can do a lot better things but the only reason I would use this is if it's still free so go to the search bar on the left side and type in the keyword you're trying to Target let's say we want to Target Elon Musk we can see which videos on Elon Musk are getting more views but we also don't are not interested in videos that were posted years ago we're only interested in the most recent ones so click on filter and then filter out by last 6 months and click apply or if you want to be even more targeted and more urgent click on filter and select only less month and then click apply and that's going to show you videos that started getting more views over the last month with that particular keyword that you want to make a video about so I can see that this channel only has 100,000 subscribers but this video got them 300,000 views which means they're getting views Beyond Their audience which means that this topic is viral and we can see that on average they only get 12,000 views but this one again got almost 400,000 views so this is a viral topic so we could take this and recreate it for our own channel our very next step is to write the script for this YouTube video idea we found and there's two different ways to do this you can either write that YouTube script yourself with the help of AI and that's a free option or you can just Outsource the entire process to a freelancer let me show you how to do the first and then I'm going to show you how to do it for free so if you would like to Outsource this to a freelancer I made this script template or this drop post template you can copy and paste from a free community so effectively you would go over to appwork I personally prefer it over Fiverr upwork is a freelancing platform where you can hire Freelancers from around the world you just need to go over here as you sign up as a client click on post a job and then you can take this template take the title and then paste the title in here so we're in this case interested in a shortterm project so click on continue with that enter the title then select the skills that are required for this job so in this case you're just interested in someone who has the skills related to script writing and YouTube so I would just search for those here so I'm going to type in YouTube I'm also going to type in script writing next I'm going to select the scope of this entire project I will just select medium this is going to last more than 3 months because we are building a serious business here and now yes this can actually become full-time when it asks you for a budget I personally prefer to just set the fixed price this is obviously something that's going to change but I select the fixed price and I just add some random number that is a little bit higher just to attract higher quality Freelancers but that doesn't mean that you will be paying this much then click on next to generate the description and this is where your going to need this template where you can just fill in the blanks so I'm going to copy this from the document I'm going to paste it in here and now we're going to select that we are looking for a script writer for my animal stories Channel and then I'm going to copy the name of my YouTube channel or the link of my YouTube channel and I'm just going to insert it over here now we're interested in about 2,000 word scripts then I'm interested in having at least two scripts per week and no chat GPT is allowed because I need humanik script scripts that people will actually listen to so I'm not going to allow any AI over here turn around must be within 48 hours and you can of course adjust these things you can of course do more scripts per week you can do longer scripts Etc and optionally you can ask them to write a cook for that YouTube script so you know that they're actually quality and they're actually qualified for this job now I really also recommend adding some example channels and those are going to be the competitor channels from your list just so they can get an idea as to what kind of scripts we are looking for I'm going to paste those here and then I'm going to scroll click review the job post and for a script like this I would pay anywhere from $25 to $100 for like the highest quality script that will be way over 3,000 words long but you could be on a lower range paying $25 to $50 and be completely fine now if you don't want to pay anyone to write the script for you and you want to do it yourself here is the chat GPT prompt that I engineered that you can use for free from that free Google Document from our free community so when you open up this prompt you're going to copy that and I personally prefer to use now Gro instead of chpt it's slightly better you get better results and it's better at reasoning so I would paste that entire prompt over here that I wrote it's it's massive and you just need to follow up with these four so I'm going to change the niche in this case it's about animals stories video format is going to be long form style of writing is going to be the same as example transcripts and you will see exactly what it means in a second and brief description of what the video is about well in this case it's going to be why it sucks to be born as a Lor so that's a basically the video idea that we came up before this step now I just need to go to these example competitor channels the reason being is because I want to copy how they are using words and their style of speaking because it's working very well a lot of people especially when they use AI Get Robotic voiceovers and robotic scripts the number really listens to cuz you can kind of smell that it's Ai and it's low fword and no one really watches those videos they never get any views they never get any sales never make any money so what I like to do is I like to hear how these people who are probably writing these scripts themselves and not using AI I want to see what kind of words they're using what kind of phrases they're using so I click on show transcript which shows it on the right side then I click on toggle Tim stamps and then I can copy this entire script so this is basically word for word what they've said in this entire YouTube video so I'm going to copy that and then I'm just going to go over to Google Docs so I search for Google docs on Google I open up a blank brand new Google Document and then I insert that transcript over here I copy the title of this transcript or of this video I click file I click on download as a PDF document and then I go back to Gro and now I'm going to remove this for a second and I'm just going to insert this PDF file that I just got this entire transcript now I do recommend you do this with multiple videos just so you have a bigger sample size so again you open up the video you click on the description box you click on show transcript you click on toggle time stamps and then you copy the entire transcript word for word from this YouTube video so this is going to be a really good sample size that we're going to have now we're going to go back to Google Docs just open up a brand new Google Document so you can paste that transcript in here and you're going to copy the title again paste the title in here click file click download as a PDF document go back to Gro and then upload that PDF document as well now you can just say remember the style of writing a scripts you can write similar scripts for me in the future now as you do that you are going to wait for it to remember the style you're going to copy the prompt once again then you're going to paste it in here enter your Niche once again and now once again I would enter the brief description of this YouTube video and then if you want it to be a little bit better you can also select thing which will make this script longer to write so it will be a longer process but it should be higher quality now I'm not going to do that just to save us a little bit of time so here we go we got now a full script written so here let's actually read it never picture yourself as a cute fluffy lmer swinging you through the trees without knowing the nightmare you're about to wake up into seriously being born a limmer might sound like a Disney movie audition but it's more like sign up for survival horror game with no save button this is a really good script if you compare it to chat GPT when you just asking to write a script on this topic that one would sound really robotic now you can see we asked C GPT specifically for this script to be over 2,000 words long because every script that is over 2,000 words long is over 8 minutes long and the reason that's important is because with 8 minute videos you can put more ads and you can make more money for the same amount of views that you are getting the reason I got paid $39 for 1,000 views is because my videos were over 30 minutes long so the longer you can make these videos the more you can make money and also if you checked out the growth guide that we talked about in the step number two you would understand that YouTube really values High retention if you can keep people longer on the platform they can make you more money so YouTube is going to reward that now if we take this entire YouTube script that now Gro has created for us I'm going to copy this just to check if it's 2,000 words long I'm going to go over to wordcounter.net paste it in here and we can see it's only 1.6 th000 words long so what I'm going to do is I'm going to expand on this script so I'm going to take some part let's say for example this paragraph over here and I'm just going to ask Gro to expand this part to 700 words for example and I'm going to submit it and then I was going to rewrite that part and then I will just basically puzzle this entire transcript or this entire YouTube script into a new Google Document so I would go over here and I would take this part by part I'm going to take this part for example just like this and then I'm going to find it in here and I'm going to replace it and I'll go back to Gro and I'll find another part that I can expand upon for example this part over here and I'll just ask you to expend this part as well to 700 words and I will submit that and if we were to go back to our Google Document we can see that even with this already now our script is 2.4 th000 words now we're going to add another over 700 to make it over 3,000 words long which is absolutely perfect next step for this one we need to now turn this YouTube script into a voice over and you can either read this script yourself if you want to keep it really low Coast or in this case completely free you can is go to Google search for free online voice recorder open up online voic recorder.com open up the script that you just wrote yourself where you got someone to write it for you and then just start reading it into the microphone just like this so allow the microphone on here start reading the script into your microphone and once you're done just save it like this and download the voice over to your computer that's one of the ways to do it now if you have a little bit of money you can invest $29 per month you can go to this AI tool it's called 11 labs and you can then just submit your voice over and realistic AI will just create a voice over that's realistic what am I talking about but if you click on instant speech right over here you can just paste your script let me just show you how it works let me just take some random part from here I'll just take one sentence and I'm going to copy and I'm going to paste it in here on the right side we can select which voiceover we want you can even clone your own voice which is pretty creepy but let's go to top picks let's see for instance this voice over is a sample enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do let me actually try this one out I think it's a little bit boring I think it's a little bit monotone if you think the same you would just replace it with a different one cuz they have over a thousand different voices and like a thousand different energies and accents and you can choose in between different genders and ages and everything hi there I'm cie I'm friendly and sometimes a little sarcastic let's make something great together this is the voice to choose it's smooth friendly quite Posh but not too Posh and it has Authority add to basket this one is actually really good so if if I were to select this voice over here I can now just enter my script and click generate speech using this voice SoCal family this is really good so now I would go back to my YouTube script and I would take the entire thing so I would take it paragraph by paragraph going back to this AI tool called 11 Labs I will click generate speech I took the first paragraph then I take the second paragraph and picture yourself cute fluffy lemur swinging through the trees without knowing the nightmare you're about to wake up into seriously being born a might sound like a Disney movie audition but it's more like signing up for a survival that's great now I just downloaded a voice over over here and again this is just the first part but we're not done yet because you really need to cut out these silences if you heard like in between these lines it's very slow and when it comes to social media it's very important that your videos are somewhat fast based especially in the age of Tik Tok so what I do is I just go over to kep cut.com this is a free video editing software and it's online so you don't have to download anything you just click a new video right over here and if you upload your voice over like this you can essentially see what's going on on the track now I do recommend you despite the fact that this is a software that you can just use on the web I do recommend you install their app on your computer because it's going to make it a lot easier so just click on create a project from scratch simply import that voice over and here it's going to be much much easier to cut out all the silence cuz you can actually see the track and I just basically press contrl B to cut out this part then I just drag then I remove this part so any any anywhere that I see a gap in these audio lines I just remove so I can cut out the silence and if we play it later you'll see that it's much faster and it's much more easy to listen to people are not going to get bored with this so let's listen to it now never picture yourself as a cute fluffy lemur swinging through the trees without knowing the nightmare you're about to wake up into seriously being born a Lemma might sound like a Disney movie audition but it's more like signing up for now it's a lot more fastpaced so now we need to do the same thing with the entire voice over so we would go back to our script we would copy the next paragraph paste it into level Labs again generate the voice over download put it in there and then cut out this next step for this one we need to start editing our YouTube video that means we need these visuals to show up on the screen we need to actually create the video that people are going to watch while listening to our voice over and there's obviously multiple ways that you can do this in literally any niche it doesn't need to be the same one as this but you can use this template that I made and you can either hire someone on appw work to do the work for you and then you just focus on running your YouTube channel as a business rather than working on video editing and script writing and all these things cuz I personally don't do any of those things myself I just Outsource it I spend over $100 per video that's fine but I know that in the back end I will make money from ad revenue from Brand deals and all the other things that we're going to talk about later down this tutorial if you stick with me until the end but let's actually take this job post template and I'll first show you how to hire and then I'm going to show you how to edit yourself for free in case you don't want to spend any money so we would go back to upwork just like this we're going to click on hire talent and post a job so we're again starting here from scratch we're selecting a long-term project we're going to click on continue and then we're going to take the draw post title from here so video editor needed for a faceless YouTube channel we paste that in here we can select which skills we are requiring which is in this case video editing that's what I'm mostly interested in then I can select other skills video post production and click scope of the video or scope of the project in this case it's going to be more than 6 months intermediate and yes this can become fulltime because I am serious about this Channel and I want it to work out now the fix price again I'm just going to select something which is again going to be completely different when I actually hire that person and from here we're going to take this template we're going to copy that we're going to paste it and just as you see these example Channel URLs this is where you're going to open up your five competitor channels you're going to copy the links of these and you're going to insert them over here now as you're done with that just click on review job post and finalize the job post people are then going to start messaging you here on upworks you can check your messages over here and you can just start talking to them start negotiating and you should be paying anywhere from $50 to $200 per video depending on what kind of quality you're looking for especially if it's animation and it's long form video and $50 to $200 is a really good spot now if you don't want to pay for video editors and Fiverr and upwork you can also do it yourself it is going to be longer and it is very hard to edit it's a long process it might take you 12 hours to edit a video but it's going to be completely free to do it this way so one of the options is to find some footage first of all you can go to playphrase.me for example if you want to use some footage for movies and these are actually copyright free and these are also just a few seconds long so you are allowed to use them if you have a unique commentary and the way it works is you just type in the keyword over here so let me look at my script so I started over here with a lemur so I'm going to copy this and I'm just going to search for a lemur over here I'm going to type in that keyword and then it's going to find movie clips that mention that and it's going to show let's see right over here if I don't like this one I can just change to the next one I don't like this I want the actual leware on the screen and when I find the clip I like I can just click on download video right over here and it's going to be onto my computer now if you want to make these animations well you can simply take this so let's say for instance I'm going to use this scene over here you can then take a screenshot so I take screenshot on Mac by pressing control command and three at the same time and then I'm just going to crop this out because I'm only interested in the scene I'm only interested in the animation visual just like this click crop click done and then we're going to go back to Gro gro.com again this AI tool we click on attach the file we click on upload files from our computer select files we're going to go to our desktop and find the screenshot that we just made and then we're going to type in create a promt template that I can use to generate images like these in Leonardo AI which is this AI tool that we use for creating images with AI it's completely free so you can just click on launch the app they give you 150 credits a day for free that's most likely not going to be enough for the entire YouTube video but it is going to give you 10 different scenes for free and then you can log into Morrow and generate they're going to give you 150 credits more in case you don't want to pay for uh their subscription but you can click on image creation and on the left side I do recommend you select illustrative Al be the model or you can select any of the other ones but this one works the best for these kinds of animations so now I'm going to go back to Gro and I'm going to take this entire template that I've created for me and I'm going to paste it in here I'm going to select 16x9 aspect ratio for YouTube I'm going to fill in the blanks and then I'm just going to click on generate and here we go now we got the animation created so you can pick whichever one of these you like the most if you like this one then you can use it if you like this one you can use it and you can do the same thing for literally every scene now you're going to see that this is a static image you can download it as it is or you can go back to Leonardo you can click on motion on the left side click on gutad and then just select an image that you'd like to animate or I personally use apob AI you can just click on create a model from scratch then just upload that image and then go to the left side select image to video so they're going to animate it click to upload image select Ultra and click generate so now they're going to create an animation of this image for example in the past I've created these dinosaurs so I just made a static image in Leonardo and they became animated inside of this AI tool so basically let me show you how that looked like in image creation you can see my dinosaurs they were static it was a static image like this but I put them into this AI tool and how they came to life and the same thing is going to happen with this lemore that we created with Leonardo as well now we just need to start putting these visuals together in out of cap cut so I'm going to click on import this is my first scene so I'm just going to drag and drop that if you would like to add for example slow Zoom then just click here to add a key frame then select the last part of this scene add another key frame and just do a little bit of Zoom so just increase the scale and let's watch the first few seconds of this video a picture yourself as a cute fluffy lemur swinging through the trees now I'm going to generate the next scene which is going to be this Lim where being very very scared in a forest so now it's going to generate that next scene while I'm still waiting for the first animation for the first image to be animated here we go the next scene I'm going to choose this one for instance and I'm going to download this image to my computer go back to cap cut and just upload that again now a really cool thing about cap cut is that you can also generate captions quite easily so you can just click on captions you can click on auto captions and click generate if you would like to have captions throughout this video Even though some people say it is a little bit distracting but I just wanted to let you know that there is an option for that as well so they're going to show up automatically you just need to either choose an animation template pick the one you like the most let's say for example this one is really good and it's really fastpaced so it's going to be easy to watch through the trees without knowing the nightmare you're about to wake up in so now I'm continuing to edit this entire video inside of cap cut let's look back into the animation if it hasn't been generated yet I'm going to go and generate the next scene which is going to be related to Disney audition so I'm going to use that for the next scene I'm going to go back to Leonardo and just submit it like this click generate and again to add this slow Zoom you just need to add a key frame like this then drag this add another key frame and increase the scale to somewhere around here so let's watch the first few scenes they look really nice you just want to try and replicate almost the exact same style of editing that a successful channel has that you are trying to replicate if your editing is worse or slower or lower quality or it seems more AI or low f word it's probably not going to work as well as their channel so really study how they're doing it and try to do it better than them now once you're done editing your video Let's Pretend This is over 8 minutes long you're going to click on export right over here you're going to select format to be MP4 and then just export this video to your computer now by the way let's look at this animation that was now created over lemore as you can see now he is alive he's moving and it looks pretty realistic so now we have this first scene that we can also use all right our next very very important step is creating YouTube thumbnail that's a small image that you see before clicking on someone's YouTube video so we have title and we have thumbnail and this is extremely important because you can have the best video editing the best script writing but if no one clicks on your thumbnail and title and you're not going to get views so we call this packaging of the product that you're creating so video is a product but this is packaging and packaging is extremely important now now before we get into three different ways that you can create YouTube thumbnails I'm going to give you some AI tools that I use to actually get it done in seconds so you don't need to have any experience we need to go over the basics of what actually makes a good YouTube thumbnail because if you put too much text and if you make it too much too complicated it's not going to get views now looking at the most popular YouTube Creator in the world we can see that he uses really strong colors it's always very bright and colorful and he keeps it extremely simple so you can write under understand what's going on in the thumbnail itself and you can kind of right away understand what the video is about and he's using a lot of these colors like red blue green and yellow and he really bums the saturation so these thumbnails really stand out when you see them on YouTube so if you're using text you need to put up to six words maximum anything above that is going to be too much for people to understand so human eye craves something simple so imagine when someone is scrolling their phone or YouTube feed and they have thousands of different options of videos to watch you have to make your simple and easy to understand so they can click on it brightness and contrast is always very very important put the central idea in the thumbnail itself and you also want to want the thumbnail to complement the title so you never want to repeat the text so if this text over here says white socks to be born as a commod dragon we're not going to put that exact same text in the thumbnail because we have a limited space to convince someone to click on of our YouTube thumbnail so we want to make sure that this is complimenting instead of repeating exactly what the title says so it always has has to be something different that's what best YouTubers do so now that we understand the basics of what actually makes good YouTube thumbnails we got to keep it simple we got to keep it bright and colorful let's look at this example thumbnail what do you think about this is this a good thumbnail it has different colors it sucks it really really sucks this is the worst thumbnail that you can put on a YouTube channel for multiple reasons first of all why are we asking people to subscribe multiple times we have multiple elements asking them to subscribe why are they going to subscribe what how are they even going to subscribe they haven't even clicked on the video there's no option to subscribe from the thumbnail so if there is if he said subscribe on the thumbnail where am I going to subscribe first of all I'm just seeing you for the first time I'm not going to subscribe I haven't even opened up your video so remove these elements we don't need subscribe we're not going to ask them for something and asking people before even giving them anything is a completely wrong approach imagine if somebody just constantly asking you for a favor you're going to be like hey just like but if they did something first you wouldn't subscribe without even asking so remove that watch now of course I'm going to watch you don't have to tell me to do that so let's remove this as well we don't need that wrestling Channel putting our YouTube channel name in the thumbnail it's absolutely pointless they're going to find out who we are if we made a good video so remove that too many elements as well too many things making it really really complex so remove all the unnecessary Parts remove that remove that remove that we don't really need that it doesn't need to be super aesthetic it needs to be simple and easy to understand the text I would say is a little bit harder to read so when using text and when using fonts you want to make sure that it's something easy and simple to understand as well so you can easily read what's going on on now would that out of the way so now we understand how YouTube thumbnails work let's actually go through three different ways that you can make YouTube thumbnails either for compl or just hire someone to do it for you one of the options is to use this AI tool it's called pixels let me show you if you go to pixels.com it's going to look like this it says viral thumbnails and titles in seconds and it really is true so you can just log into your account after signing up for this platform and you can either just describe what your thumbnail is going to be but what I've discovered to work the best is the recreate feature so you you can click on recreate you can select the inspiration weight medium or high works very well let's say I'm going to go with medium then you find a thumbnail that you like let's say for example this one click on copy link address you can then go over to pixels you can paste in that thumbnail here let's say I'm going to select high in this case and generate I could also type in what changes I want to happen with this thumbnail so I can tell it like hey change text to this or change this element or change these colors and it's just going to create a similar thumbnail to the one that already exists on YouTube now this doesn't mean that we're literally downloading someone's thumbnail and posting it because that's illegal but we are recreating it in our own way which is exactly how most YouTubers run their channels they see what's working well and they recreate it in their own way so we're pretty much doing that thing so here we go here's the thumbnail that this AI tool recreated and you can do this exact same thing with any channel so let's go for example this one history of humankind let's open up this video as an example we're going to copy the link address we're going to go over to pixels and we're going to recreate it just going to paste it in here we're going to click High remove this this part and click generate so now pixel is going to recreate that thumbnail once again it's one of the easiest and fastest way to get a thumbnail done and I believe it's like $29 $30 per month which is much cheaper than paying $10 $15 per YouTube thumbnail because with $30 a month you can generate 20 different thumbnails and you're good to go for a full month so let's see here's how it recreated this thumbnail over here so we can see that it is different from the original one and you could also adjust some other things you can describe what it want to be different with your version of the thumbnail the second way that you can make thumbnails is to just Outsource it to a freelancer so you can use this template prompt you can go over to appwork you can click on post the job and then you can just copy and paste the title again the exact same way that we did with the script writer and video editor so we paste the title in here we select the skills graphic design in this case we're going to copy the template which we're also going to customize a little bit we're interested in someone who has Photoshop skills because we really want high quality thumbnails we don't want them to use AI to create these thumbnails and let's go to the budget in this case I'm also just going to set the fixed price but this is going to be different so we're going to negotiate this and I usually pay $5 to $10 per YouTube thumbnail so if you're posting three videos a week that's going to be $15 to $30 per week being spent on YouTube thumbnails which again is one of the most important aspects of your YouTube channel because you can spend so much time creating your video and then your thumbnail sucks and it was all for nothing because no one clicks so it's a small investment but in my opinion with the biggest Roi now I'm going to set some example channels here which again are going to come from our five competitor channels so I'm going to use that as an example as to what I'm looking for and then we have the requirements how many thumbnails we want let's say I'm going to be posting three videos per week so three thumbnails per week my preferences which you can also adjust and then just click on review the jaw post and just submit it lastly if you want to create thumbnails yourself you can just head over to canva.com and you can select cust custom size right over here and select 1920 by 1080p so that's effectively YouTube thumbnail design now if I want to recreate the thumbnail that we saw on that channel all I got to do is select the background color right over here it's already white on the left hand side I'm going to upload this image I'm also going to flip it on this side make the element much bigger so most people will just like put it like here or somewhere you have to make it big you have to really really make it big something like this then you click to add the text type in your text and on the left side you can select which font you want I really recommend selecting something that stands out so something that's more bold so this font works really really well I'm just going to make it a little bit bigger because we said that thumbnail elements need to be big then on the left side I'm going to go to elements I'm going to search for Arrow and I'm going to try to find a curved one just like this I'm going to flip it and here is the thumbnail that I can now click share on click download download as a PNG file and click download one of the more common questions I get asked is Dave I want to get more views on YouTube so should I spend money promoting my videos with Google ads or should I pay for shout outs what should I do to grow my channel and the answer is before you go out there and you spend money promoting your videos you want to make sure that your videos are actually worth watching because the best way to get views on YouTube is to just make videos that the algorithm is going to promote to just make videos that people want to watch so how is it that some channels Post 10 videos and get zero views and some channels post one video and get millions of views like for example this channel has 19 videos they're posting regularly almost every single day but they get one view per video well this channel over here their first video got 800,000 views and off of just six videos they already have almost 100,000 subscribers literally just from six videos so what is it what's the difference well the difference is in novelty is there something new that's been provided is there uniqueness in these videos is there value in these videos that are being posted so that's what we're going to talk about today it may sound a little bit boring but that's the difference between a channel that's that's going to be posting hundreds of videos getting zero views and a channel that can post three videos and get millions of views and make over $100,000 and in fact in this list that we will also be discussing you're going to see that lots of channels end up making hundreds of thousands of dollars without that many uploads because they do the things that I'm going to do about in this short lecture so first of all we need to go over educational versus entertainment videos so if the goal is to make $110,000 a month as fast as possible educational videos where you teach something is the best way to do it now there is a time and place when you to choose entertainment videos but you always want to aim for a channel that teaches something whether you are teaching Health and Longevity or whether you are teaching skincare or whether you're teaching yoga or whether you're teaching finance and business and investment or whatever it is as long as your videos are solving a problem for a viewer it opens doors for you to then sell a product to sell a school Community to sell a w digital product to sell something that's going to get you to $10,000 as fast as possible because with entertainment videos you usually have to rely on millions of views now if you don't have any skills to share so there is no problem that you think you can solve and teach people but you're actively participating in the entertainment industry so you're watching videos or you're reading blogs or articles and you're up to date with what's going on then you can then create entertainment videos it's just worth noting that entertainment is going to be slower to get you to $10,000 a month because you can really sell products because there is no particular problem that people are coming to your channel to solve they're just there to spend their free time so let's go over some bad examples and what to avoid when creating YouTube channels I'm going to open up a few links over here and I will also probably link these below so that we can see uh if they improve this one has even got gotten removed so if we look at this channel over here they have 18 videos I would assume a lot of that is from shorts but if we look at this video it got two views and I got asked why did this video only get two views well if we open it up first things first if we look at the title does this solve a problem is this appealing what is this video actually about so now it's I can guess that it's entertainment but it doesn't really speak to me and the thumbnail we can see there's black on the left and right side so it's not really formatted properly and it's only 3 minutes when I open it up I can see it's really AI generated and when I watch it I can genuinely sense that this has just been created with some AI tool and it just pushes me away so now if you ask yourself would you watch this would you save down spend your time watching videos like these would you click on something like this if the answer is no then you probably shouldn't post it now let's look at some other examples let's open up this one so this was a rain Channel where they post rain sounds seems like it got deleted but that's a bad idea posting long videos where it's only you posting sound effects and rain sounds and meditation sounds because it is insanely hard to stand out with a channel like that provide value and then s a problem and sell a product as well okay I see the reason why these are actually not showing up so here we go and let's open up this one as well forgot to add this one element we look at this channel over here they're also not getting views now why are they not getting views well because of these titles they're too broad they're not solving a specific problem so it's not super targeted to solving a problem so this channel talks about AI how AI is transforming sour social media in 2024 the key impacts now this is too wag too broad it sounds too aiish it sounds like a buzzfeed article and it honestly doesn't seem to solve any like there's no urgency for me to click on this video It Doesn't Really solve a specific problem if you look for example at this guy over here and by the way even if you're are posting faceless videos you should be looking at personal brand channels you should be looking at the topics that they are talking about because again people just want to solve a problem and they don't really care about whether it's faceless or personal brand you're interested topic and if it's getting views for them then it can get views for you as well so we can see like specific things that this guy is solving and we can look into what's actually working here the new AI agency model that will dominate 2025 so here I'm going to learn about that new AI agency model or this AI technology where will replace millions and here's how to prepare so this like specific what I can do now here it's way too broad again I would assume because of the format of these titles that they've been generated with AI and that's another thing to know you never ever want to go to Chad GPT and ask it for a YouTube title it's never going to be good and it's never going to get clicks rather than that as a new channel you don't want to take the risk of coming up with a title yourself but you want to look at titles that are already performing well you have to make a list of five YouTube channels that are in your Niche personal brand or faceless it doesn't matter you're just interested in their titles and you're going to look into videos that are getting more views and when you find a video that got views like for example this one you're going to steal the title yes I'm literally telling you to steal the title copy and paste it don't change anything steal that title now you're going to say Dave but that's illegal no it is not illegal as long as you make a unique video that provides unique value and you add something you added TST to your own video now if you think about it if you search on YouTube for how to cut avocado you're going to find a 100 videos with the same title and they're all getting views so there is nothing inherently wrong with having the same title as someone else as long as you have a unique video so I'm not telling you to download the video reupload it I'm just telling you to steal their title because it's proven to get results and you don't want to risk as a new channel and test something that hasn't been proven to get views and here's the Rain video channels that I was talking about as well they're obviously never ever going to get views or make money off of this channel because there's a million other channels doing the same thing and the lower the effort the more channels are going to do the same thing the easier it is for you to generate these videos the more people are going to do it so if if I look into this and it's just a static image with some sounds in the background maybe some background music that's it how easy it is this to make like you can make it in two minutes and now millions of other people are going to do the exact same thing they're going to make these videos so when I look into YouTube automation I don't think oh this is going to be easy so I should do it well because that opens the door for millions of other people to do the same thing and then obviously no one is actually going to make money because there's too much competition but you want to make sure that it's harder to make your kinds of videos because then less people will do it some more money for you and let's look into some other examples over here which also are going to be listed below so here we don't really have a specific title it doesn't go with like how to do something it just boosts your attractiveness overnight there's no urgency I can sense that this is AI it seems a little bit low effort in the video is less than 8 minutes long now when starting out we're going to talk about that later you want to make sure that your videos are as long as possible because YouTube's idea and you're going to read that in this guide that we have as well the idea behind YouTube is to keep people as long as possible so most people over complicate YouTube but you just have to think about what does YouTube actually want what what is their goal and the goal for them is to keep people longer on the platform and metrics for Success are always going to be CTR how many people are actually clicking your video and how much time people are spending on and if you post 2 minute videos YouTube is not really interested in promoting your content because there are people who are posting 20 minute long videos and because YouTube's goal is to keep people longer on the platform they're going to promote those videos like if you look at this channel over here all of these videos are over 15 minutes long and they're getting hundreds of thousands of views and we look at this video it's five minutes long it got 25 views this is one of the reasons why it is not getting views um but yeah good examples uh let's look at some guys who are making lots of money so this channel I know it's making over a million dollars a year I bought a course from this guy as well has 1.7 million subscribers and if you look into these videos you're going to see that some of the topics are not new they're not novel like this guy told a story about PayPal well what I bought his course one of the main things that he said is that he takes a story that has been proven to get results on other channels so it's proven to get views and he just makes his own version by adding new unique value he goes step further and and he goes and finds stuff from different books from old blog articles from like 2006 and then he adds that information to make his story more unique so that if someone watches that they get New Perspective from his channel even though they maybe even know the story of PayPal or a story about Ikea Etc but they know that they're going to get something new from his channel so that's a really really good example this is a faceless channel that prints millions of dollars a year and inside of this document you're going to find over 300 faceless YouTube channels that are all making at least $5,000 a month and I I'm updating this list every single Sunday I go in I do research and I fun channels for example this one made over $116,000 from just eight videos and we can open it up and we can see what's working for them so again the best way to get views is to find channels that are in your Niche see what they are doing see what titles they are using see what kinds of videos they are creating look at their scripts and if you're like you don't want to watch the entire thing well you can basically just click on here open up the description click on show transcript on the right side toggle the time STS and you can now copy everything that was said in this video transcript so something like this I went a bit too far we copy the transcript we can just go to chat GPT and we can say format this script so that I can read it easily but don't change anything and then I can just submit the script and it's going to write it out so that I can read exactly what the script is about and I can see how what kind of words they are using is it too robotic are they using too complicated words because a lot of people go like if you go to chadd and you ask you to make a video on one of these topics let me show you how insanely robotic it's going to sound is going to use some insane words that when you read you know you wouldn't even use these words it sounds way too TV like it sounds way too professional so I can ask it write a YouTube script write a YouTube script for a video titled and I'm going to paste the same title that we got the transcript from here we go and let's listen hey everyone welcome back to the channel already bad welcome back to the channel if you ever felt like your goals are just out of r and you're not sure where to start stick around today I'm sharing a simple super quick blueprint like this sounds like a TV ad from the 90s but if you read back here's how more laidback this script is and how it works you know I've been studying the human brain for years now your brain has a hidden switch when you're try to achieve a goal you're probably focus on what you need to do but here's the truth that's exactly backward the real power comes from who you need to become so let's be let's get specific and again you're going to read this like Define your goal clear first things first get specific about what you want Etc like it sounds too robotic when you use just pure chpt now later on in the classroom I will be giving you the right prompts to use for chpd so that you can create scripts without having to write them yourself word for word but I just wanted to compare and show you how these scripts that are getting views are outlined and what kind of wording they are using when compared to others and when compared to chpd if you open up this this is another good example over here these guys have 69 videos they started less than a year ago and they already made over $215,000 from ad Revenue so again A lot of people are also saying YouTube animation doesn't work but we can look into thousands of channels that are making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and if other humans can do it then so can we that's what I like I like to look at channels that are making a lot of money and just thinking to myself this is a human being who's sitting behind their laptop and they're making millions of dollars and if they know how to do it there is something that I don't know and I need to F in that Gap and I I know I can make it because they've have done it it's not about landing on the moon like I don't have to land a rocket on the moon I just have to replicate a faceless channel that is making $10,000 a month that's my goal so this list is very very helpful to actually uh achieving that tips for adding value before we close off you want to give something that they can't already get this is a fundamental part of why people watch YouTube videos there is something new so recently I was also reviewing a channel where a person was posting videos about the Trojan War and it was just Trojan War explained now Trojan War is basically this thing that happened thousands of years ago and it has been told this exact same story has been told thousands and thousands of times there's nothing new about it and when they made a video children War explained they didn't add anything new it was a five minute video going over the same thing that has been thought millions of times so it didn't get any views so you want to make sure that you are adding something that hasn't been told before you add that information and you can do that with a chb prompt that later in the classroom I will be uh giving to you so you can copy and paste it you want to make longer videos at least eight minutes so at least eight oh eight minutes and just ask yourself when you make a video would I watch this would genuinely ask yourself like going to your channel would you click on on a video that says coins and it has this thumbnail and then you open it up and you listen to the voice over in the background would you watch this would you spend time watching this take the time like go through it and just ask yourself am I enjoying this video am I getting value if no then you have to make something new and you have to make something different just think about what are the kinds of videos that you are watching on YouTube are they different from from those from these if they are then you have to change the the strategy and luckily we do have tools and res resources for you to actually do that properly uh throughout the classroom so yeah that's it for now step number 17 getting brand deals and sponsors for your YouTube channel now as you start posting videos one of the best ways to start to make money before even getting monetize is through BR deals you see I recently did a breakdown of this faceless YouTube channel that has 4 million subscribers they're posting finance and success type of videos and some of their videos get millions and millions of views they're making over 175 ,000 per month without showing face and one of the biggest revenue streams that they have are their brand deals if you open up some of their videos you're going to see that most of them have this thing over here which says includes paid promotion if you click on that it's going to show you that this YouTube video is making money from Brand deals and we're going to see that Masterworks is the platform that is sponsoring them so what I like to do is I like to open up as many companies that are within my competitor so I open up competitor channels and I see if they're promoting some companies in the description and I try to find their contact details of those companies usually that's at a bottom so we're going to try and find their contact details here we go contact us and we're going to go and send them an email now that email is going to be this template that I'm going to share with you in a second now the reason I know this works is because a lot of people from my school Community online business Club are sharing that they're making money like for example Jason made $15,000 from Brand deals from a very small YouTube channel and I also recently saw that sham made $42,000 with brand deals so far with 6,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel so you don't need a lot of subscribers to make money so he literally made over $4,000 with 6,000 subs and he started out pretty recently with his YouTube channel so this is proven to get results not just for me but for other people as well which is pretty cool I shared a template inside of my school Community for brand deals and emails so you can just basically copy and paste this there's a subject line and this is the text that you would send you would just customize variables in the brackets and you would just contact that company so you would send them an email first and last name and then you just write out that email and submit it over so that's how it works in most of these companies if they're sponsoring one YouTube channel you can send them you can pach them and obviously not every company is going to accept you but if you send out 20 30 emails every single day for a month and your channel is growing steadily the chances are you're going to get brand deals like if all of these people are making money with brand deals there is no reason why it wouldn't work for you now if you go over to Future tools for example this is a directory of different AI tools and different software companies I just like to go here I discover new tools tools and when I find something that I like let me try with this one I go to their website and I just try to find their contact details so here you can spend some time browsing different software companies they usually have more money to spend and they are willing to pay more for brand deals because they know that if they get someone to sign up for their software company and they keep using that software company they're going to make a lot of money so if they pay you 500 bucks for that sponsorship video they're probably going to make a lot more in the back end and here we go this is the email so now I can go up to this email address I can go to email and I can just email them with this brand email template or dep want you can also write yourself just pitch them and try to get that brand deal close here you can find like a thousand different companies 3,000 different companies but also you can just go to Google and you can search for different companies within your Niche or you can also go to gro.com you can describe what your YouTube channel is all about and you can ask it for a list of a hundred different companies that you can pitch for brand deals so Gro is going to understand okay their YouTube channel is in this Niche let me connected with what kind of companies would be the best match for this Channel and let me just list out of 100 companies and then you go to their website you find their content details and you email them asking for a brand deal for a sponsorship and that usually means that you would mention them for 60 to 90 seconds and you would just link them in the description the same way that all of these people are doing with their YouTube channels like even if you go here you can find a part that is sponsored you can open up this video and you can find a part where it's sponsor part here we go they're showcasing the product and they're just talking about it for 60 seconds and they're linking it in the description and that's it and potentially this video made them like 10,000 $20,000 from brandle I'm not sure how much they charge but probably around that Mark since they have 4 million subscribers now for you you can probably start off with like $200 $500 whatever you manage to close and then slowly increase as your channel starts growing more and more step number 18 another way to make money from your YouTube channel especially a faceless one is to start your own School Community or create your own digital product and we know that this works very well because if we go to the leaderboard on school we can see that some people are making 2 and a half $280,000 a month like $100,000 a month $100,000 a month $6,000 less 7 days and $100,000 a month in mrr which is monthly reoccurring Revenue so those are like different communities on this platform called school that are making money and I even found a list of faceless communities that are making money like for example this one over here makes $75,000 a month and it's a completely faceless account like DA's using a lot of AI and he's not really showing his face we see he has 99 a month 55 members inside so he's making money from the school community and what I personally like to do is I have like a free Community First and I'm using my YouTube channels to send people to this free community I started it out pretty recently got 81,000 members and then from this free community which just promotes the paid Community which in this case is $200 a month and we have about 455 members inside of that community so that's like $25,000 a year from 400 different members in this School community and I'm not going to go too deep into how to actually start one but you're going to find a free blueprint here inside of the tools category of obf you're going to open up this post and you're going to find the school starter blueprint it works like this you can just follow all of the details here to start your own School Community I give you like trity prompts you can copy and paste you can just set it up for yourself and you can just follow along see how it works see the example ones and you're going to get a few templates all completely free from this document bro just post it's really not that deep like I saw this guy who grew up in some random small village I believe in England and he saw this tiny home in his village that he really liked it was his dream to buy this home and he bought it for £55,000 that's about $60,000 and he just recorded a process with his phone and that's a 10 minute long video that blew up because he was not getting views before that on his channel and then he got 19 million views off of that one single video where he just recorded him buying his dream house that he would either way do and he revealed that when that video had 11 million views it made $52,000 from our revenue and now that video has 19 million views so I would assume he made more than $8,000 from OD Revenue so he got the home for free and made $30,000 Profit just from that and then he also posted this video over here which got 1.8 million views where he revealed his earnings which probably made another $20,000 and then now he's renting out that home on Airbnb and he's making passive income and he's talking about that and he's making even more money he's now probably even selling a of course and how he's done it and he probably has other things that he's selling off of this YouTube channel making even more money that is nuts this just many years ago imagine what this guy would be doing he would be in a random small village no one would know about him I would be in my small town if I was born 20 years before the day I was born and now I'm in freaking Dubai I leave in Dubai and I'm traveling the world like that is absolutely nuts well look at this channel over here and this guy was just he likes to chill in the woods he's a chill guy who just sits in the woods lights the fire it just records himself 25 minute long video 16 million views in one month now I personally make about $39 per 1,000 views here we can see this video made me$ 39 $37,000 from ad Revenue so not every single video obviously makes that much money but this had a really nice RPM so we had $900,000 views and made $37,000 so about $39 per 1,000 views now let's say he only makes $6 per 1,000 views if he ask chpt how much money he made over of 16 million views with $6 per 1,000 views RPM we can see that that's $96,000 imagine going to the woods chilling in the woods like doing what you already love to do and making that much money so the point that I'm trying to make is that people are doing whatever they like to do and they just record it and they make hundreds of thousands of dollars how insane that is do you understand how now here we go this guy over here this is another chill dude bro is just smoking a cigarette on his porch he just just finished work and he just sat down to record a video on his phone a zero editing zero like you can just open up this video literally zero editing it's on his phone he got 900,000 views in a month now if he ask chbt how much money that is we're going to go and see how much money he made he made $5,000 just from ad revenue of a single video and then because that attracted more subscribers now he's getting more views and other videos that he uploads so he probably makes even more off of this he literally just made a video like hey just exist he just talked about his opinion how life should be lived whatever and I know that this is absolutely insane cuz I have this image for me I found this in my Google photos this is me in 2019 I was sleeping on my mom's kitchen floor we literally had zero doar I was I don't even know 17 18 at the time so obviously had no money we were in some small random town that you would have never even heard about and guess what I started a channel this is making 0 is 2019 this is the first two weeks it made $188 so I was making like $20 a day and let's switch to the next month let's go to the next month let's go so this was October let's switch this to November just like this and here we go $1,000 next month okay wait wait wait wait and then let's see what happened in December $5,000 not bad and then 2 and 1 half months in and we're at $1,000 per month like $4 to $500 per day and ever since that channel made let it just load over here the live time of that channel let's see if it's going to show up $822,000 how insane that is in a second I'm going to share with you the general script structure that I created for both faceless and nonf faceless YouTube videos so you can go viral much faster but I also want to show you something even more insane there are people posting faceless videos they're not even recording themselves now it's cool if you want to record yourself like whatever you want to sit in the woods you want to record your house whatever you want to record you can do that make money off of it but people are posting faceless videos like this channel over here I did a breakdown of how they're making over $175,000 per month like of course they're making money from ad Revenue so I looked into their social blade uh which is public and we can see how much money they potentially make from ad revenue and then we also can see that they have other streams of income so for example they have their own apps if you look into what they're promoting you can see they have their own app over here and by the way you can open up any of these videos you can see that they're just using stock footage so they're not really showing uh their face let me just log in show you how much money they're making off of this app so we go like this we open up the link shows $50,000 last month from the IOS app the one for uh iPhones and on Android they also did another $10,000 last month in revenue from the app they also sell different courses so they have digital products that they're selling off of a faceless YouTube channel that makes even more money like you can go here you can see that they're selling these courses and they're making money off of it now we're going to go back see what other streams of income they have so they have affiliate marketing they have affiliate links in the description if you open up their videos you can scroll to the description you can see that They are promoting different affiliate links for nordvpn for audible those are all affiliate links or they're earning commissions when people purchase something the the guys that are watching their videos they also get brand deals how do I know that they're getting sponsored videos well we can open up some of their content and we can see that it includes a paid promotion it literally says here and we can see the link in the description so they probably get paid thousands of dollars per video to promote some companies and okay again the person is not even showing their face they're not recording anything with a camera which is the craziest part and I also have this like massive document of 350 channels that I constantly update I collect channels that are making over $5,000 per month and for example this guy has seven videos on his channel like very simple faceless videos and his first video got 100,000 views and he already has 145,000 subscribers or if you're look into this faceless Channel as well 16 videos half a million subscribers let's see let's see if we look how many total views he got he got about let's see he got about 16 million views so he also probably made about $90,000 from this YouTube channel without ever showing his face now how hard it is to make 16 videos to make $90,000 from home or from wherever you are in the world this guy six videos almost 100,000 subscribers his first video got 800,000 total views like literally just make good videos right now because algorithm is favoring new channels small channels that's why we are seeing that people with zero subscribers are blowing up and getting hundreds of thousands of views even though they started again from zero and it's never ever going to be easier than it is right now they're trying YouTube as a platform is trying to compete with TK to and Instagram they're trying to overtake their user base and creators and so now they're rewarding all of us who post on the platform and I'm not sure if it's going to stay forever like this perhaps this is the last year when this is going to be as easy as it is right now because maybe in 202 2026 it's just going to go back to normal or it's just going to become hard again as it was before 2024 this is the script template that I usually use for my faceless channels I'm going to link it in the description for free you don't have to to send your email or whatsoever and if you want to make sure that you are making money from day one from your YouTube channel when you start posting so you don't miss out on thousands of dollars that could have otherwise been yours I'm going to shamelessly link my website where you can get instantly monetized it's an actual service you get a monetized channel and you can just make money from day one and not have to wait 6 to 12 months to get approved for the partner program but you just post and if you get views you make money off of your YouTube channel otherwise you would post get views and not make money so that's why I have no shame promoting this because we sold over 4,000 accounts so far over the last 3 years so we help over 4,000 people make money instantly from their YouTube channels bro talks about his cat he's reviewing his cat he got 1.9 million views $111,000 reviewing his own cat there's a secret no one tells you and I made over 2 and a half thousand long form YouTube videos and probably another 5,000 shorts over the last 9 and A2 years and over this time I made more than $12 million and in this video I want to share with you nine brutal lessons I've learned along the way so that you can save time save money and hopefully get views much faster than I did lesson number one is to not reinvent the wheel unless you want to waste time and money I know that when starting out we all get caught up in thinking that we have to come up with these crazy unique ideas in order to stand out but when you do that you're taking a huge risk cuz you have no idea if that idea is proven to actually get results so rather than that if I can go back in time I would just go and research first and find proven ideas that are working right now and then I would just replicate what they are doing so inside of our refer Community we have this tools and resources section in the classroom part and I've listed over 500 faceless channels that are all making over $5,000 a month and this is a document that I made for myself to always get inspired for my faceless YouTube channels that's why it's a little bit messy it was never meant to be shared but I keep updating this and I keep adding new faceless YouTube channels that are getting results pretty pretty fast there are Channels with like six videos that already made over $4,000 there are Channels with five videos that already made $26,000 and if they are getting results right now and if these kinds of videos are working for them and are getting like a 100 times outliers then I will try to replicate that topic if it's in the same Niche that I want to go in I also found lots of great AI tools like this one I'm not associated with this tool in anyway I literally just found it yesterday so I basically just go over here I think it's glow AI basically I just go here type in the keyword if I want to make a video about deep seek this new AI language model I type that in and it gives me videos that have performed very well recently so I can just replicate it because if it's working for them over the last 30 days then there is some demand for that video and YouTube is pretty much like any other business it's about supply and demand the more videos exist in that topic the harder it is going to be for you to stand out and the more interest there is the higher chances are that you are also going to get some of that traffic as well so lots of these tools can be useful I like this one because it's completely free you don't have to pay for vid IQ or any of those similar tools number two and this is only for those who are building personal brand channels I do recommend you build your own style and be unique literally be you and turn yourself into a niche a lot of people think that they can just copy others for example I forged this new style of thumbnails for my personal brand Channel with like green colors and this exact ex same style and I've seen hundreds of other people copy exactly what I'm doing and obviously it's not working very well for them and people are seeing that these are just washed up versions of the biggest channel that is actually doing that so when I say that you should not reinvent the will what I mean is take the idea take the title but bring your own style bring your own twist and to make it easier for you I build this notion template you can also access for free inside of our free community and you can just answer these questions for yourself like what's your unfair advantage in that Niche how can you daal up your creativity how can you daal up your consistency and be more authentic Etc literally just answer these questions for yourself this is going to take you 15 minutes but it's going to build a foundation for your YouTube channel so that you never end up in a position that you have to be a washed up version or Chinese copy of someone else's YouTube channel number three oh my God this is big YouTube is no longer a joke when I started my one of my YouTube channels I was just posting funny clips with my friends from our backyard like these videos I was literally a kid here and we were posting these videos 13 years ago we were just doing fun but today YouTube is literally influencing election 47th president of United States was mostly elected because of social media because of the influence that influencers had on social media even himself he said on the inauguration day that over 30% of votes came from podcasts and YouTube channels and YouTube appearances it was a huge huge part of that and when I took YouTube seriously I changed my life in three months I had this video where I shared my channels and I shared how YouTube literally changed my life in less than three months I went from genuinely being like completely broke and living in this house literally changing the entire bloodline like everyone else is going to come after me is no longer going to have to leave in this house because of YouTube it's crazy and like in the beginning you get embarrassed that you're recording these videos and you're thinking what are my colleagues going to think what is my family going to think what are my friends going to think that I'm like talking to a camera like it's crazy but if you think about the fact that you can change millions of lives you can make millions of dollars you can impact the world like literally election oh my God check check this guy like this guy had a very small YouTube channel 3 years ago and he just saw a house in his village that he really liked so he just recorded a quick video quick 10- minute long video where he bought that house like he would do that you like either way he saved up money to buy this house for £55,000 and that video blew up and he got over 19 million views and let me show you this if you go to his most popular videos he shared how much that video made so he shared that that video made him $52,000 from ad Revenue when it had only 11 million views so with 19 million views it probably made over $80,000 so he got a house for free and made money and grew his channel so now all the videos that he's posting are getting more views because of that one that blew up his channel number four if you're not getting results and you're not getting views you have to change some people start their YouTube channel and they just go yeah but I tried for 6 months and it doesn't work I'm not growing at all and that's the problem you tried for 6 months you did didn't improve for 6 months you just follow the list of steps and you gave up your agency you kept doing what wasn't working you didn't realize what's actually the problem and then you didn't experiment to change that you didn't compare your channel to successful ones because in all of these channels if there are thousands of channels that are making money even their first month and growing to millions of views and if I post 100 videos for 6 months and I get zero views there has to be something that I'm doing different so let me study these videos let me sit down and watch them for hours on end let me see the script let me see the editing let me see the thumbnail let me see the style of speaking that they're using are they just relying on CPT scripts or are they actually writing custom scripts and I've even seen someone say like yeah da I know this all of this stuff works but it's going to take like three to six months for me to get to like $10,000 a month but what's the alternative you would spend 40 years working a job that would probably pay a little bit less than that and would give you much less Freedom number five get instantly monetized you see I wasted so much time and money posting videos that were not making any money from the start because it wasn't approved into YouTube's partner program meaning I didn't have 1,000 subscribers and $4,000 of watch time and for some people it really takes 6 to 12 months to M monetization requirements so that just then when you start posting videos then you start making money so for all of this time for 6 to 12 months you're missing out on thousands of dollars that could have otherwise been yours and so I started building pre-built monetized channels and whenever I want to start a new phas of Channel I just start posting an already monetized channel so if I go viral I know that I'm not going to miss out on thousands of dollars that could have been mine I will link m channels in the description so you can get an instantly monetized one right away but even if you don't want to use my service or my channels then there's probably some other options as well but either way whichever option you choose I do recommend you be monetized from the start because imagine if this guy over here posted his first video and got 1.4 million views and he wasn't monetized this 1.4 million views is probably over $10,000 not Revenue that he would have missed out so not being monetized from the start is actually a lot more expensive number six don't rely just on ad Revenue like yes getting paid from the views that you getting is great but you can make a lot more if you just have links in the description like I've even seen this guy who made a video about a YouTuber who made over $90,000 with less than a th000 views by making like very niched videos and by just selling a product through his YouTube channel and even I myself like yes I get paid hundreds of dollars a day from some channels from ad Revenue but just by mentioning in an affiliate Link in the description that would make a lot more like with even just team program like with this one got paid over $6,000 in commissions and not to mention like building an actual digital product or a school Community or a coaching program would make a lot more money than just relying on ad Revenue like always remember that YouTube is just splitting out Revenue with you so when you make a million dollars from ad Revenue that means that someone spent $2 million to run ads on your YouTube channel and the reason they did that is because they probably made more than $2 million by selling a product number seven we have tell stories it gets more views than a soless buzzfeed the least or a jbd script and if you're not sure how to tell a story you can just use this structure which is telling a paino giving an example telling a personal story doing an anecdote sharing a statistic methaphor quote advice and then what how and why to actually go ahead and take action and do that number eight idea is more important than your thumbnail editing or script and I genuinely mean that person that spends more time coming up with a really good video idea is always going to get better results than a person who spends more time video editing but they just scrape any idea that comes their mind even this channel over here they only have like seven videos and they're getting millions of views not because their thumbnails are great not because their editing is great like it's extremely simple but the idea was very very good and that's why they're getting results so genuinely spend more time on ideation I mean going to different channels seeing what's working for them then going outside of YouTube seeing what's working on other social media platforms and spend like 6 to8 hours coming up with some video ideas because the payoff is going to be much greater than spending 2 minutes on any idea that comes across and then just right away proceeding to make videos on it next up if you never want to run out of video ideas just make your content Avatar person that would be watching all of your videos and that way you never actually have to think about what's going to be the next video cuz you can just think about how old are they what do they do how do they spend their week like just answer these questions for yourself to create your own avatar and then you can build content buckets like these so here's how I do it first of all I start with three different discovery videos Discovery videos are the ones where I don't sell anything I just provide value and they are as broad as possible to get me the most viewers as possible onto the channel then I make one Community video which is more to connect me with that core audience like less than 10% of those viewers and it will be a Q&A a personal story something that's slightly longer so I build that trust in community and then I post a sales video and then I do it on a repeat so three Discovery community sales and then in terms of video Styles I just do these if I not sure I can just think about my avatar and if I'm making videos on how to get a sixpack or if I'm making longevity videos then I can do like seven apps seven biohacking hacking apps I use or summar I spent $1,000 on this biohacking course and here's what I've learned tutorial how to leave to 200 plus years listicle top eight facts you didn't know about fasting Etc and then you can just run these in circles and again always keep the sales video the left you don't want to right away start a channel and start selling a product but you just want to provide as much value as possible to attract large audience and then do the sales video and then on repeat do this now if you want to see the best Niche ideas for faceless YouTube automation you can click on the box that's here or if you want to see how I make money without showing my face you can click here I don't think you really understand how YouTube can change your life forever in the next three months not just your life but lives of everyone around you forever I made over $12 million online and over $700,000 of that came from just one YouTube channel on Revenue so in this video I want to show you the timeline of going from $0 to over $1,000 a day and we're going to be comparing that to Google photos in the calendar and we're going to be seeing how that was unveiling in real time and how life was just changing day by day because this was me in 2019 I was 17 years old sleeping on my mom's kitchen floor and I thought that was Destiny I never left my hometown until then and I thought like this is because this is the house that I grew up in 120 years old house my grandpa grew up and died here my mom grew up and never left until she was 50 and finally when I made changes and when I did these things I was able to move her out buy her an apartment and actually change her life and my entire family life forever and make the difference otherwise the entire bloodline would just continue probably living in the same house doing the same things and I want to show you the 12-steps formula that allowed me to achieve these results in the L than 3 months or actually changed my life forever in 3 months things that I've learned mistakes that I've made so hopefully you don't have to make those mistakes and hopefully you can do the same thing in shorter time or do bigger things now to be honest I did have some experience with YouTube before I started that channel I was constantly trying out different things and this is one of them from 9 years ago I was 15 at the time and like today I'm known for my faceless YouTube automation channels which have millions of subscribers but it's not like I was a YouTube genius cuz I was just posting screenshots from SpongeBob no voice no camera and honestly I couldn't even be on camera I didn't even have money to buy a camera I didn't even speak English like we grew up in a third world country I had no money and I was extremely shy but hopefully with this 12ep system that I want to share with you you can get results much faster and you can learn from my mistakes so October 11 I post my first video on that Channel Zero views Zar I post another video Zero views Z day 3rd so October 13th we make 1 cent now that was actually the most exciting time of my life because I was like okay this is now making some money then we go October 14 $2 October 15 $6 October 16 $4 now keep in mind the place where I grew up in average salary is $200 a month which is about $7 a day and I was always thinking like how the hell am I going to afford buying my own house making $7 a day if I worked a normal job like everyone else in my hometown so the YouTube channel was just getting $5 to $6 a day looking at Google photos this is where I kind of broke cuz this was me with my mom in a secondhand store we were buying some clothes for myself thrift store Thrift Shop how do you even call that and then I went to school and I remember we had she didn't have money to give me for lunch but I saw that she just packed me an orange just for lunch because she just wanted to give me something to eat and that's where I kind of broke like this is October 16th if we go back and we compare that on that day I made $4.25 now overall October 2019 I went from making $0 to about $15 per day but overall in October 2019 I went from $0 to $15 per day now if we change the dates now if we change the date to November 2019 voila now November 2019 we made $1.3 th000 we were doing about 40 to 50 bucks per day and this was around that time looking at Google photos it was my 18th birthday and this is me with my brother now I was getting happy because I made a th000 bucks but let's go to the next month next month is going to be December and that was 2019 as well December $5,000 we were making over $100 a day and now that went from a $100 a day to $300 per day what and I remember that's when I bought my first bike from that money and I was flexing like hey I'm a bowler now like I have a bike and I even managed to afford a Yugo Yugo car this is how that looks like it was a white one it's literally exactly like this and we can see that was November 4th 2019 now let's go to the next month let's see how things were in January 2020 that next month it was $1,000 from out Revenue consistently $4 to $500 a day and that's when I bought my mom a car and I started traveling the world and I started doing cool things and overall if you look at the lifetime of that channel it is about $700,000 from ad Revenue but again this is just one of the channels that run a BN run a bunch of different faceless channels that are making hundreds of thousands of dollars as well like this one over here this one did over a million dollars just from ad revenue and that's not even the primary source of income we use those channels to promote affiliate links to get brand deals and sponsorships to sell digital products and it Al open so many different doors for Partnerships and all sorts of different things but let's go to the 12 Steps formula step number one decide whether you're going to go with a faceless or personal brand Channel and you should only pick one in the beginning I personally started with only faceless YouTube automation channels because again I didn't have money for a camera I didn't even speak English I was extremely shy so I was just running faceless channels being behind the camera now regardless of what you choose step number two is to choose one Niche and choose one word to be associated with and again this also comes with a faceless Channel as well for example I know a guy that owns this faceless channel it's called Emma cin this is an AI Channel this girl doesn't exist if you open any of these videos they're faceless so it's an AI voice and they basically are running a brand around this but you can do the same thing with a personal brand Channel as well or a faceless channel so you choose a word to be associated with if you think about Dave Nick it's online business if you think about Ryan holiday it's sism if you think about Joe Rogan it's alien or whatever podcast step number three once you get that out of the way and you chose your Niche wisely number three God this is a joke this is a joke I'm GNA get my channel deleted with this got to remove this wait go away it was a joke don't do that okay for legal reasons that was a joke number three create a free community a free community is a great way to have a lead magnet and especially because if you start a YouTube channel you don't have to right away sell anything you can just send people to a free community that's what we are doing with for example this one on school we have about 46,000 members and then you can sell in private so you don't have to sell publicly because then people will hate you and they will not really watch your channel and you will not grow but you can give things for free like your free community and when they join that's when you can offer Solutions step number four what a lot of people Overlook is just extremely studying your Niche and stud that word that you want to be associated with and absorbing all of the information devouring everything in your way that's related to that Niche so whether you're starting from zero or have experience in your Niche become one of the most knowledgeable people in the world on that subject watch videos constantly on that topic read about that topic listen to podcast on that topic only talk about that subject and you have no idea how many these experts that you see on on YouTube on social media that are like big they get lazy and they don't do that anymore so you you should go and learn more than them because that's going to be your Competitive Edge step number five after that is going to be to go extremely hard again become a student of the best accounts in your Niche so what I would do to make it even more practical make a list of at least five YouTube channels that're already getting results doing what you want to do you don't want to start a YouTube channel just thinking you're like you don't even check YouTube you're like I'm I'm going to start a Channel about this and uh I'm going to start a Channel about this I'm going to make this video but you haven't even checked if that works or not so you want to find at least five channels look what I have so I have this list YouTube automation channels and I constantly update so every Sunday I spent four hours watching YouTube to find new faceless Channel ideas I put them in this document so that's why it doesn't look really nice but basically when I want to start a channel I just open this document and I can find at least five channels that are getting results in one of these niches here we have like a channel that started a month ago so their first video one month ago and they already have like millions of views so I'm like okay I'm going to start a similar Channel and I'm going to create something that has like a similar title and thumbnail in fact I actually did that today I just started that channel uh posted the first video three hours ago it might completely flip it doesn't matter I'm just trying like different things until like basically you try as many channels as possible until one thing is actually getting results so we'll see how that one is going to go step number six direct your followers or your viewers to your free community so you should have just one Link in the description of those videos again whether they're faceless or not and just send them to your free community whether that's going to be hosted in school or Facebook and telegram whatever you can choose step number seven start providing Evergreen long-term value with your content and with your free community as well if you feel comfortable then I recommend also like doing actual q&as and calls like video calls with your fre Community but you should do that like once you have at least 100 members in your free community you can do a few video calls you can ask them what they actually want what are their problems and then you can try and solve those problems for them if you chose your Niche wisely if you didn't go too broad at the beginning so that's why it was really important to narrow down down when you start out then just listen to your intuition just decide based on those q&as and based on like what you see in your Niche decide what your business is going to be around that because yeah YouTube out revenue is cool you can make decent amount of money from that but you can make a lot more if you sell a product and then you can start offering either a paid Community or a digital product now with this community that they have we have 46,000 members it's a free community we then do an upsell to a $99 a month Community which now has about 400 members and then then we VI an abso to a high ticket offer to high ticket program so that's basically the funnel behind it you can also cross promote with other communities so you can reach out to people on school or whatever other platform you use to host your community and you can basically do a shout out for shout out to just slowly build your presence and build your community and then at the end you just create your signature program that solves a problem and is aligned with your premise and what you are trying to solve that's why it was really important to Niche down and be more specific so trying to start a channel that's going to only talk about finance and helping people with Finance is not really going to work but if you Niche down and you're like I'm going to be helping people invest okay let's go even deeper I'm going to be helping people invest with stocks okay I'm going to be helping gen Z invest in stocks and you can go even deeper and be even more specific because that's going to make it even easier for you to grow as long as there are already some channels that are getting results so you can see what they're doing and see how they're getting results and then try and do a better thing than them make better videos make longer videos make more valuable videos do more research and there is no reason why it would work for them and then it wouldn't work for you there just absolutely no logic in that but yeah those 3 months were an absolutely wildest Journey ever for me cuz that was just a massive catalst and just never stopped since then and if that didn't happen all of these people would suffer like all these people would be in the same house and they would leave that same life probably their kids and their kids and all that but these are my brothers and sisters but I moved them out I gave all of them an apartment separately like all of them have houses all of them have cars because of me they don't have to leave there anymore they're out of the country and uh I'm filming this from Dubai I'm about to buy a castle I'm traveling the world it's wild wild these are 15 websites to promote your channel for freid to get views and subscribers almost instantly you see I run many different YouTube channels some of which have over a million subscribers and some of which made hundreds of thousands of dollars like this one in the last 28 days did about $119,000 this one did over $300,000 in Revenue in total so I know a thing or to you about YouTube but if you're just starting out and you want to see those initial views as fast as possible I want to share with you 15 different websites where you can promote your Channel for free to get views and subscribers quickly now we all know that the best way to grow on YouTube is by posting high quality content that people actually want to watch optimizing it well for the algorithm but it doesn't hurt to get some extra views especially because it's absolutely free my name is Dave Nick and website number one is free.co now this website is based in the UK but we can use it all around the world it's a website where people are sharing free ads now these free ads are mostly used by people who either want to give away some products or want to sell something on this website but there is an option to promote YouTube videos as long as they're high quality and provide value so you can just join free and you can post an ad when it asks you what do you want to promote you just want to Select Community website number

YouTube stuff though the rule is that you have to subscribe to other channels that are in the comments you can potentially reply to them like their comments like a few videos so they do the same or else you go to the box of Shame website number three is going to be Flipboard now at Flipboard people promote their stuff as long as it's related to creative work which is exactly what YouTube videos are so when you go to Flipboard you just want to click on for creators and you want to build your presence to build your presence all you got to do is create a profile which we'll do in a second

there are also a lot of free communities as well so what you got to do is you just going to click filter and then simply filter by free communities only and there you can see loads of communities where you can join and promote your YouTube videos in a respectful manner because some of these communities usually don't even allow promotions unless you really provide a lot of value with that post so if your channel is about Chess you can join this community if your channel is about film making you can join this community with 26,000 members if you're making Fitness content here's another one over here 13,000 members and a good thing is that you can even filter by category so if you're only making health and fitness content here are loads of free communities with thousands of members that you can join and you can make posts that provide value and then promote your channel so here someone in our freight Community online business friends they made a valuable post and then at the end they just promoted their own YouTube video and they're getting engagement on this post website number five answers.com now answers is a platform where people come to ask questions and get answers to those questions so naturally you can provide value with your videos if they're educational so if someone asks for example how to lose weight if you have a video that teaches exactly ly that then you can just reply and direct them to your YouTube videos so you're providing value and you're sending them to your YouTube channel as long as your YouTube channel actually solves that exact same problem the sign up process is pretty simple you can go with Google Facebook or apple and just search for questions that your YouTube videos answer website number six is called Hercules now Hercules is a platform where you can advertise to a thousand people per day for completely free so they're effectively giving you an email list of a th000 people to whom you can send an email every single day and they're hoping that you are going to get so much traffic that you will then pay for more emails but you can just start off with 100% real free traffic 1,000 people per day and if you write a high quality email then then at the end naturally promotes your YouTube video then you should be easy and good to go so just click on submit ads now and there's over 300,000 members that are already doing it next up we have threads. net which is a very very similar website to Twitter or x.com it's a competitor app and if you create an account for free you can make valuable threads that again just promote your YouTube videos in a respectful Manner and I have these prompts that I usually use for Twitter and you can just paste them into chat jpd and create high quality threads that again promote your YouTube videos next website is of course Pinterest.com where millions of people come every single day for inspiration on different topics and so I found a bunch of different Pinterest accounts that are already getting loads of traffic so whatever Niche we choose let's say for instance we select travel Niche we can see exactly what these people are doing to get traffic like these guys are getting 600,000 monthly views of their Pinterest account and every single pin promotes their website now instead of a website you could be promoting your YouTube channel cuz it's pretty much the same process to create your own pin just go to the left side click on Create and here you can drag and drop if you're not sure how to set up your Pinterest account I have this absolutely free blueprint which not only gives you all of the prompts that you need to set up a right channel but it outlines it in a step-by-step manner so that you have a checklist in front of you that you know you should follow to actually have a good account now if you go to our free community online business friends and you select tools right over here just open up a post that says all you need as online business owner you're going to find a bunch of free text courses and you're also going to find the Pinterest starter blueprint when you open up that Google drive folder you just click file then click on make aod copy and make a copy so that it can make changes to this Google Document you can do whatever you want with it next up we have shout card.com now shoutcart is where you can buy shout outs from Instagram Pages now this is obviously not free but it's so cheap that it almost feels like free so you can find Instagram pages that have hundreds of thousands of followers and you can pay them to promote your YouTube videos for like 10 20 $30 so yes I know it's not free but again it's really really cheap and all you got to do is register for free and you can browse different agencies and if you're really on a budget you can just find a page that does it for $5 to $10 you can get exposed to thousands of people next up we have Twitter or x.com this is where I go to create valuable posts with those prompts that I shared earlier that I just pasted into jgpt then I get a full thread which I post to Twitter and then of course at the end I just promote my YouTube video so I usually say watch the full video here and if you click it's going to take you to my YouTube video to create a post all I got to do is just press post and then I can just paste it from chat to GPD and at the end just paste a link to my YouTube video next up we have Instagram reals and I've recently seen a friend of mine post real to his Instagram account now he at the time had about 10,000 followers now he has 177,000 but he posted a real which is basically just promoting his YouTube video and he got 800,000 views of Instagram and he was of course promoting this YouTube video sending people to YouTube and we can see that at the end so he talks about changing the world with AI his story and then at the end out now it's on YouTube on his YouTube channel so hundreds of thousands of people have seen his face in his personal brand because of this simple Instagram real it was probably just taken out of the long form video which is already created so short form content on Instagram is a great way to promote your YouTube channel next up we have steam.com where people share blog articles on all sorts of different topics and a really cool thing is that not only is it free and you can get traffic but you can also get paid depending on how much traffic you get like this one was $5 $1 is obviously not a lot but if you're already posting it to promote your YouTube videos then why not $8 or or this guy got paid $300 10 hours ago off of this one single article $400 if you're not sure how to write these blog articles there's also going to be a prompt inside of our fre community that you can copy and paste it's called blog article CH prompt and you can basically just take this and just change the variables in the brackets when you go over to chat gp.com you can change the variables for example write a 2,000-word blog post titled whatever it is that your YouTube video is about I would even just space the title of the YouTube video it uses the exact keyword whatever is the keyword that you're trying to rank for and just submit that next up we have vocal. media which is pretty much the same platform as steamid it just doesn't pay you for the views that you get on these blog articles but it is a great platform to promote a YouTube channel again you just have to create a valuable piece of blog article and when you share it just basically like create a story and when you share that on here you can get traffic but it has to be over 3,000 words long else it's not going to work next up we have find a forum.net now this is a platform that has been around for quite a long time but if you go here and you click on explore forums or you go to categories right away you can just find a category that your YouTube channel is about let's say for example travel and then you can find Forums on that topic where once you join these forums and discussions you could potentially promote your YouTube channel next up we have google.com if you just go over to Google and you search for your Niche plus forums then you can find a lot of different forums that are still active where you can talk to other people in that Niche and then just send them to your YouTube channel and invite them to subscribe because that's your ideal audience you don't want to promote your YouTube channel to people that are not really interested in that topic now if you want to see how to actually make money on YouTube without showing your face then you can click on a free training that's on the screen right now to learn how to make your first $10,000 a month or more it's free so I'll see you there all right now this should be the most exciting part of the video as I'm going to be answering your most frequently asked questions and I'm going to be reviewing your channels you guys submitted in the comments and if your channel is not on this list that I'm going to be reviewing throughout the next few minutes you can still take a lot of notes because the things that I'm going to be saying here can be applied to any channel in any Niche so first channel that we have over here is called Octor it has 17 subscribers right now five different YouTube shorts and one long form video now looking at The Branding over here okay we have a simple and clear name in terms of The Branding one thing that I don't like is that there is no consistency in colors and no consistency in fonts so it's not really consistent in between these two so we're it's very hard to build a brand like this then looking at the video that is published it doesn't even have a thumbnail thumbnail is really essential and then look looking at the title as well it's not something that I would assume was taken from a viral video idea but was just an idea that came up to the mind of the Creator and they just made a video about it now video length 4 minutes not ideal looking at one of the most successful new channels some of the most successful channels here that we have on the list let's say open up this one it has eight videos and 300,000 subscribers like literally just off of eight long videos they're doing 6 to 8 minutes 6 to8 minute long videos now when you do 8 minute long videos you can put more ads and you can make more money from your YouTube channel now if this channel is obviously not monetized and that doesn't really mean a lot but the longer you can make these videos the easier it will be to get views from your YouTube channel now if we open up the video itself let's what happens when a tiny octopus faces off against a giant crab you'd think the crab has the upper hand those claws look deadly but don't count out the octopus just yet these little guys have some sneaky tricks up there sleeps all right I like the visuals it's a little bit engaging so it's changing though and the first 5 Seconds i' like to change like multiple scenes or like make it as engaging as possible the first few seconds just to grab someone's attention I guess the video itself should be okay but here the problem is the idea is this a viral video idea did this video get millions of views in the last 30 days on some other channel or not or is this just something that we are just guessing and posting on our YouTube channel because if it's not from a proven video idea it's going to be very hard to grow as a brand new channel so that's why I have a list of successful channels I just open up I see what's working for them and I just try to recreate that in a better way so if they are getting lots of views then chances are I would probably get decent views now in terms of the titles so we're looking at a title over here I have this resource I found it if you go to Google and you type in Creator hooks there's this free newsletter so you don't have to actually subscribe to the newsletter just go to pass Creator hooks newsletters and this guy is pulling out like every week or every month he's pulling a new YouTube title ideas and Frameworks that you can use so you just open up any of these and then it just gives you the most successful titles and then it gives you the framework that you can use for any Niche so I tried and then you can basically just fill in the blanks what is the goal that you achieved so if your channel is about health and fitness I tried seven supplements these three got me shredded whatever so whatever Niche you're in you can just apply that formula for any of these video ideas so it's also showing you what worked for our Channel and then giving you the template it's very very useful and it's completely free for your YouTube thumbnails and the second channel that we're going to review here it's called we love animals has 4 million subscribers 1,000 videos and sometimes gets hundreds of thousands of views within days which is really good though I don't like this Niche because it's hard to build a brand so it's hard for you to then sell products it's hard to then sell the channel and it's also hard to stay consistent so one month it may get millions of views because these are viral videos sometimes something randomly goes viral but then next month you have no idea if it's going to make any money or not because you have to constantly build this the video explodes and then it dies off because it's a browse based video browse based videos are the ones that show up on the homepage when someone opens up YouTube and they see a viral thumbnail or title and they click on it they watch it and they leave forever when you make more search based videos or education Style videos they tend to have like a flatline so you're going to expect pretty much the same amount of Revenue and growth throughout the months it's not something going to be exponential or going up and down it's not that stressful so it's more reliable and you can also sell products while with this channel as we're not building some kind of a brand it's going to be hard to sell products so for example most people come to this channel that you're watching right now to learn about online business so then if I have products that teach them online business it's a lot easier to convert while for example if you go to this channel whatever product they sell I'm going to be less likely to purchase since this is just a compilation of Random clips that they got from other channels or videos so it's good for add Revenue not that bad but it's not really really sustainable now looking at this channel autogenius they have 30 videos and 30 subscribers that already should be a Mark that there is something wrong with a channel because if you look into some other ones in that Niche from this list there are Channels with like two videos or three videos and 100,000 subscribers so it means that we're doing something a little bit wrong here looking at the videos I can already see the thumbnails are really complex it's really hard to understand what the videos are about I can see that AI or chpt was used for most of these titles and I can see there is not much consistency in fonts in in the style of videos because if we go over to to Google or YouTube and we search for example best seu gadgets I guess that's what the what this channel is all about we can look at this Tech joint YouTube channel we can see what kind of thumbnails they have how easy they are to understand how simple they are and what kind of visuals they're using and then we can also see what kind of titles they're using for these videos and what is the length it's always over 20 30 minute long videos multiple times a day and we look at these videos they're only 2 minutes and then sometimes 5 minutes 4 minutes like zero consistency in these is very very bad you want to make sure that you're consistent with length consistent with the style of thumbnails that you have even if you look at for example example this channel is in a different Niche we can see that it is consistent with colors and fonts and style and the same person is in thumbnails even though this is a faceless Channel like if you open up these videos you're going to see that it's literally completely faceless it's just stock footage on the screen and some screen recording as well so no one is really really showing their face in these videos and looking here there is no consistency so we're not building a brand that people are going to recognize easily and if you open up some of these videos let me play it for a second look for the perfect lighter that's safe stylish and built to last introducing the suprus electric lighter the game changer you it sounds too robotic it sounds too aiish which can be fixed if you cut out the silences in the audio or pick a better voiceover if you're using 11 laps or by hiring an actual voiceover artist so this people can see through this they can see that it's somewhat low eff for in aiish and it's not really going to perform well it's not going to get views and the main Way That these channels make money is from links in the description so if you go back to to for example this one over here and we open up their videos we can see that they right away have L affiliate links for these products so when someone comes here and they're like okay I'm interested in these products where do I buy them they can click here and that person earns an affiliate commission and then looking at this channel that we are reviewing they don't really have those affiliate links they have a lot of text over here and then at the bottom they have some affiliate link so if we close this up what has happened when someone opens up this video they don't see the top of the description they don't see The Links at the top less people are likely to just open up this and then scroll through all of this unnecessary text to find the affiliate link so you're making it hard for them to actually give you the money and purchase the product and you want to make it as easy as possible to do that check out the description box of this video you're watching right now I right away have Links at the top so it's easy to see them even if I don't reference them someone might notice them at the top of the video description and they might click on that link all of this is really unnecessary if you really need to put this text just put it at the bottom and make sure that your affiliate link is at the top so people can see it right away that's what's making money and not this text over here next up we have a channel called animal files seven videos 22,000 subscribers very good some videos over a million views they started 3 months ago and already in total this channel has 1.6 million views very very good let's look at the videos themselves very simple following a viral framework and then adding their own twist is a really good idea so the reason their first video get 100,000 views is because again they had competitor channels that they looked into they saw it's getting a lot of views and they just thought about okay how on Earth can I add my own twist make these videos more unique and add more unique value because this is a topic that's getting results so they didn't second guess or they didn't just randomly pick a topic out of their head but they went on they did research they found channels that are going viral right now over the last 3 months and then just replicated what worked for them and added their own twist and unique things to that channel so this is perfect 10 out of 10 and obviously making a lot of money already so this is a really really good example now looking at the next channel that we have clever Tech gems they have 28 videos and 1,000 subscribers looking at their latest videos I can see four views 10 views so it's not really doing very very well and I can see lack of consistency again in some of these thumbnails or at least the new ones in the past seems like we had consistency in fonts and colors and the presenter on the screen that's really good looking at the first few videos this is somewhat bad very very complex and hard to read subscribe button on the thumbnail is really unnecessary cuz no one can subscribe from the thumbnail itself so that's not going to work looking at the latest thumbnail I think it's hard to read the text is small blue text on a blue background again just very hard like there's no contrast usually when we had colorful background we want to make sure that it's a different color of text people can easily read it and open imagine waking up to find $250 in your account every single day make money online Niche overall is now very very competitive and it's very hard to grow a channel in that Niche that's why a lot of channels that even were successful are now quitting because it's so so hard to actually get views in the make money line Niche unless you have a lot of experience in it and a lot of proof to show that you are doing those strategies so even looking at this channel over here this was a faceless Channel it was getting views but they stopped doing it because there is so much exaggeration in that Niche but if you'd like to continue with this one I do recommend adding a lot of screen recording like this but at a beginning of the video cuz when people open up these tutorials they don't really care about unnecessary stock footage they're just looking for where is the actionable stuff that I need to follow and the tutorial and that's what I've noticed and if it doesn't talk about the actionable stuff and it only shows the stock footage people are going to click off they're going to leave ruining your retention rate and ruining your views as well so you want to make sure that you are using either relevant footage or screen recording in any Niche whatever Niche that your channel is in next up we have I got better this channel is in the productivity Niche self-improvement Niche doing very very well right now we have one video with 35,000 views 81 outlier score and the thumbnails are consistent and high quality the video ideas are really really simple and these are taken from pring Concepts which is good this channel is on a really really good track to explode and we are seeing some explosion already even though they started out pretty recently only 20 videos and 1,000 subscribers and some of them are already already exploding and it's also educational so they can sell products we only have the free community which probably Absol different things this is a really really good channel that is just a ticking bomb and we're just waiting for it to explode even further and make lots of money for the person who owns this channel very good job over there next up looking at this channel that was submitted as well it's called Kingdom wealth hub 7even videos 3,000 subscribers looking at the videos there is also not a lot of consistency in the thumbnails in the fonts some of the text is too small to read on these thumbnails and I think there is a little bit more going on so we said like maximum up to six words in thumb Els is more than enough I like that it niched down to one specific thing it's really really niching down so it helps people who are religious to build wealth and get Financial Freedom so that's really really good though the video ideas could be taken more from viral topics and viral channels well I would assume that this would potentially be AI title and you want to be very very careful because a lot of people can notice that and that would really really ruin the channel so you just want to make sure that you are taking either some of the templates from that Creator Cook's free newsletter or you're using examples from other channels you look into what's getting views for them in your Niche so that's why you need a list of five competitor channels so you can see which titles are getting the best results and in this list that I'll also share with you has over 400 channels you can find inspiration even from other niches like what are the title Frameworks they're using and can I apply this to my own Niche maybe this channel that made $177,000 already we can see what kind of titles they are using and we can see what kind of videos they are making so we can recreate it for our own Channel if we are in the same Niche that's why it's so important to look into other channels especially when starting out and especially when you have no experience with YouTube you don't just want to guess what the next title is going to be or just ask chpt because that's never really going to work very well you have to look into which videos are working right now which titles are performing well and just create either create your own version of that or just literally copy the title and make a better video with your own twist and with your own unique stuff in there so you're not Reinventing the will you are just upgrading that wheel that was already created and that's how you succeed as fast as possible also a question I get asked quite a lot is should you be spending money on YouTube ads to promote your videos absolutely not it's a waste of money the views that you're going to get are going to be very low quality despite the fact that you might pay for targeting you're still just going to watch like the first 5 seconds so I don't know why but Google really makes it hard it really ruins your watch time even if you spend hundreds of dollars on that and they're not really going to continue watching your future videos it's not like loyers loyal subscribers or whatsoever and when YouTube notices that you have money to spend on promoting your YouTube videos then it's going to limit your growth so that you spend more money promoting your videos second question I get asked quite a lot is how many videos should you be posting every single week and there is no clear answer to that though number of videos that I should aim for that I prefer to aim for is at least three videos every single week that may seem like a lot but the more you post in the beginning the more data you are going to get you're going to get more data as to what people like on your channel what they don't like and based on what gets more views you're just going to do more of that so if we if this channel start posting videos they can see like okay this is what people like they can read the comments this is the topic so I can try and find similar ones and avoid the ones that are not getting views and by posting three videos a week you are really really staying consistent you're building the channel fast and you're learning quite a lot about creating YouTube videos you're learning about the process itself and just watching these tutorials is good but doing it yourself is going to learn is going to teach you much much more being down there in the trenches and then doing that hard work is going to give you so much more lessons and hopefully this gave you like a good base to start one of the most common questions I get asked is Dave what is the best and fastest way to get to $10,000

What is YouTube automation? YouTube automation is a combination of native and external tools and platforms that can: 1 – Handle repetitive tasks such as publishing. 2 – Optimize your videos for search and feeds. 3 – Create, auto-generate, enhance, and edit videos. 4 – Bulk edit video descriptions, tags, and more. 5 – Automate the marketing and promotions of your YouTube videos and channel, plus collect behavioral data and personalize your marketing efforts. Automation is the process of using tools to automate actions you’d otherwise do manually (or not at all). YouTube automation can help you get more views and subscribers, make more money, and save tons of time. Some of YouTube automations include automatically sending emails with your new videos, creating transcriptions, generating SEO-friendly titles and descriptions, promoting videos on social media, and more. Sometimes when people talk about “YouTube automation,” they’re referring to websites where you can auto-engage in comments, buy views, subscribers, comments, and other types of engagement. However, auto-engagement, buying subscribers, or paying for views, comments, and other engagement is against YouTube’s terms of service. So we won’t cover any tools that promote those actions in this post. Is YouTube automation legal? Yes, automation and AI are “legal” within the YouTube platform, as long as you follow its community guidelines and AI policies. We’ve listed highlights from the platform’s automation and AI policies below 👇 YouTube automation policies To use automation in a way that abides by content policies, thoroughly review YouTube posting policies before you publish. Never publish: Fake engagement Impersonation Spam Scams Deceptive practices Excessive posting of affiliate content that violates YouTube’s spam policies External links that send users to the above type of content (content that violates their policies). Any content that violates YouTube community guidelines Ok to publish: Affiliate content Monetized videos created with AI tools AI-generated videos (within guidelines) YouTube AI policies YouTube encourages the use of generative AI to create videos, as long as users follow its community guidelines and policies on the responsible use of AI-generated content. Channels and creators must disclose when realistic-type content is AI-generated. For example, if your AI-generated videos contain representations that might be mistaken for a real person, place, or event — this must be disclosed. To meet disclosure requirements, transparency tools are provided by YouTube Studio. Disclosure labels that appear in the video description. In-video labels for content related to sensitive topics such as health, finance, elections, news, etc. Here’s an example of YouTube’s disclosure label in the description text and in-video. It is perfectly YouTube-legal to use automation and AI tools to create, enhance, optimize, and promote your YouTube videos. Before you do, though, carefully review YouTube’s Community Guidelines to ensure that your content abides by all of YouTube’s policies. What are YouTube automation AI tools? YouTube automation AI tools are tools that incorporate artificial intelligence for smarter, more competitive results. Nearly all of today’s automation tools incorporate AI for better and quicker results. How does YouTube automation work? To use YouTube automation, determine what tasks you need help with and look for tools that can automate those tasks. Some of the most common automation tasks YouTubers use are: Generate videos from text or scripts. Turn other content into YouTube videos (such as blog posts and podcasts). Optimize your YouTube channel and videos for search and feeds. Cross-post YouTube videos to other social media channels. Automate email campaigns and collect behavioral data to promote your YouTube channel and videos. Connect all your tools and apps to one main dashboard.

How to make money with YouTube automation To make money with YouTube automation, create high-quality content tailored to your target audience. Automation can help improve the quality and efficiency of your videos and marketing campaigns. However, you’ll want to avoid the temptation to push out massive amounts of content. Keep in mind that publishing tons of content — is something that anyone can do, thanks to AI and automation. So it won’t help your videos or channel stand out to simply produce massive amounts of videos for your niche. The greatest benefit of automation and AI is that it frees up your time to engage with your audience, get to know them better, and develop ideas for content that they’ll fall in love with. Then, you can use automation to help you produce, publish, and promote videos more quickly. Using this strategy, the chances of earning income from your channel are greater than ever. Some of the ways you can earn income from your YouTube channel include: Ad revenue Affiliate marketing Sponsored content Product & merchandise sales Crowdfunding The top YouTube automation tools Below are our favorite YouTube automation tools for creators who want to build, grow, and promote their YouTube channels more quickly and efficiently. 1. TubeBuddy TubeBuddy is probably the best-known tool for YouTubers. It includes a plugin and browser extension with tons of tools that can help you upload, manage, and grow views on your YouTube videos. What does TubeBuddy automate? TubeBuddy has tons of useful features, but try these three first. They’re the easiest to implement, and will save you the most time by replacing tasks you’re already doing. Automations: Get AI tag suggestions, translate titles and descriptions into other languages, and automatically run YouTube approval checks. Bulk actions: Change cards, end screens, descriptions/titles, delete comments, and create thumbnail overlays — in bulk. For example, if you have a new video to promote, you can add a link to it in every video description or card; no need to manually edit each and every video. Defaults: Create multiple default profiles, descriptions, and tags for your different topics and choose the one most relevant to the video you’re uploading. (YouTube only allows you one.) How does this help you? Most of the tools in TubeBuddy help you save time by offering automatic or bulk actions you’d have to do manually. You can also use TubeBuddy to grow views by promoting one video across your channel, or you can easily add tag suggestions to make your videos more likely to show in search results and suggested videos. Reviews TubeBuddy has a 4.6-star rating on Capterra. Cost TubeBuddy has a free plan that offers keyword tools, but it doesn’t include bulk actions, defaults, or limited automations. TubeBuddy’s paid plans start at $3.75/month. 2. VidIQ VidIQ helps YouTubers create better content and get more views and subscribers. What does VidIQ automate? Based on your YouTube channel and answers to questions VidIQ asks you, it will automatically generate for you: Topic ideas, trends, and success stats Keyword opportunities AI-optimized titles, descriptions, and tags Competitor stats Monetization reports and tracking You can also use VidIQ to promote a specific link or topic across all your YouTube descriptions at once. How does it help you? VidIQ is valuable because it helps you reduce the time it takes to research good content and keyword ideas for your target audience. We use it for the AWeber YouTube channel, and the information it gives us is well worth its monthly fee. I especially like the bulk description tool (available on paid plans only). It can help you get a ton of views on new videos without a lot of work. Reviews VidIQ has a 4.4-star rating on Capterra. Cost VidIQ’s free plan offers limited automation features. Get more features with their paid plans: starting at $17/month. 3. AWeber YouTube automation AWeber is an email marketing tool that you can use to easily and automatically promote your new YouTube videos via email. What does AWeber automate? AWeber can send emails to your subscribers any time you publish a new video to your YouTube channel. All you have to do is ask your YouTube subscribers to sign up. Once they’re subscribed to your emails, they’ll be notified of your new videos in their inboxes, instead of having to check YouTube all the time. You can also set up daily, weekly, and monthly emails with new videos, in case your upload schedule is sporadic. Note: AWeber offers other email tools and automations for small businesses like automatically adding new customers to your email list, sending abandoned cart emails, and more. How does it help you? Most YouTube videos reach less than 15% of the people who are subscribed to the channels those videos were published to. This limited “organic reach” means that even if you have a lot of subscribers, your videos aren’t reaching most of those people. Sending an automated notification email to your subscribers gets around all that. There’s another benefit to these notifications, too. Because of the way YouTube’s algorithm works, if it sees you have an engaged audience, it will show your videos to more people. Sending an email notification is a way to get your audience engaged. It’s enough of a signal to influence YouTube’s algorithm in your favor. Those early views also encourage the YouTube algorithm to rank you higher for searches and suggestions. And the best part? You’re starting to build an audience that’s not controlled by YouTube. No one can take your email subscribers away from you. Reviews AWeber has a 4.4-star rating on Capterra. Cost AWeber’s free plan includes one YouTube email automation and up to 500 email subscribers. Paid plans start as low as $12.50/month and include YouTube automations and anything over 500 subscribers. Get started with AWeber for free 4. YouTube Studio It may seem weird to have the official YouTube Studio on this list of best YouTube automation tools, but it’s worth pointing out what you can automate without any extra software. YouTube Studio lets you upload, manage, and get analytics on your YouTube videos. But there are a few built-in automations that can save you a ton of time. What does YouTube Studio automate? In YouTube Studio you can automatically generate subtitles and chapters for your videos. Subtitles increase accessibility since people can watch your videos without sound. Chapters allow people to jump directly to the section of your video that they need. That can be particularly useful for demos or longer videos. YouTube also automatically gives you real-time stats on your videos. Monitor them to see what types of videos are ranking, getting new versus returning traffic, how long people are watching on average, and more. How does it help you? Since you must use YouTube Studio to manage your YouTube channel anyway, it’s worth your time to see which features they offer that save you time. YouTube wants your channel to grow — so pay attention to the information and accessibility they offer to grow views, subscribers, and engagement. Reviews YouTube has a 4.8-star rating on Capterra. Cost YouTube Studio is free. 5. Zapier Zapier is a tool that allows you to connect thousands of separate apps and create automations.

As someone who recently started a faceless fitness channel, I can attest to the growing potential of this model—it’s only been a few weeks, and the channel is already gaining traction. Here’s why more creators are embracing automation this year: The Rise of Video Consumption By 2025, video is expected to make up over 80% of all internet traffic. This unprecedented demand for video content creates a golden opportunity for creators to connect with global audiences and generate income. AI Revolutionizing Content Creation Advanced AI tools have streamlined the content creation process. From writing scripts and generating voiceovers to editing videos, these technologies make it possible for anyone—even those without technical skills—to produce high-quality content. This has been instrumental in the success of faceless channels like mine, where branding and visuals do the heavy lifting. Passive Income Potential The allure of passive income is undeniable. With YouTube automation, once a channel is set up, it can generate revenue through ads, sponsorships, affiliate marketing, or even merchandise sales. The scalability of automated channels allows creators to manage multiple projects and diversify their income. By leveraging these tools and trends, creators are transforming their passion into scalable businesses.

Passion and familiarity with the topic can help you spot opportunities, create better content strategies, and maintain consistency. Ask yourself: What topics do I enjoy learning or talking about? Bonus: Channels fueled by your passion often come across as more authentic, resonating better with audiences. 2. Analyze Audience Potential Evaluate the size of the audience your niche could attract. Some niches, like gaming or fitness, have massive audiences but are highly competitive, while others, like AI news or religious motivation, may have smaller but highly engaged communities. Use tools like Google Trends, YouTube search autocomplete, or keyword research tools to gauge demand for topics in your niche. Ensure there’s enough interest to sustain regular content and attract advertisers or sponsors. Want to FastTrack your YouTube Automation Success?

While this isn’t necessarily bad, you’ll need a unique angle to stand out. Look at existing channels in the niche. Analyze their content, branding, and monetization strategies. Tip: Instead of competing directly with established channels, find sub-niches or untapped angles (e.g., focusing on pet care for exotic animals instead of general pet advice). 4. Evaluate Monetization Opportunities Not all niches are equally profitable. Some have higher CPM (cost per thousand impressions) rates due to advertiser demand, while others offer more affiliate marketing or sponsorship opportunities. Research the monetization potential for your niche. High-earning niches: Personal finance, technology, and luxury lifestyles typically have higher ad revenue and more brand partnerships. 5. Focus on Long-Term Sustainability Trendy niches may offer quick wins, but evergreen niches provide lasting opportunities. Ensure the niche can remain relevant over time, allowing your channel to generate passive income even as trends evolve. Evergreen examples: Health and fitness, education, and DIY. Avoid niches overly reliant on fleeting trends unless you plan to pivot quickly. 6. Understand Content Production Requirements Some niches demand complex production setups, while others are more straightforward. For instance, a tech review channel may require access to new gadgets, whereas a religious motivation channel might rely on curated messages or text-based visuals. Automation Tip: Leverage AI tools and freelancers to streamline content production and reduce your workload. 7. Balance Passion and Marketability A profitable niche aligns your interests with audience demand and monetization potential. Choosing a niche solely for profit without any interest or expertise can lead to burnout or mediocre content. 8. Validate Your Niche Choice Before fully committing, test your niche by producing a few videos or creating sample content. Monitor the response and adjust your approach as needed. Trial and Feedback: Pay attention to metrics like views, engagement, and subscriber growth to gauge potential. By carefully evaluating these factors, you can confidently select a niche that aligns with your goals, maximizes your earning potential, and sets the stage for long-term success in YouTube automation.

If you're curious about how to monetize YouTube automation channels effectively, here’s a step-by-step breakdown: 1. Ad Revenue: The Cornerstone of YouTube Monetization For most YouTube creators, ad revenue remains the primary source of income. Once your automation channel hits 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours, you can apply for Google AdSense and start earning from ads displayed on your videos. YouTube’s Partner Program offers a reliable way to monetize, especially for content that gets high engagement and views. Pro Tip: Automation can help you upload videos consistently, which means more ad views and higher revenue over time. Want to FastTrack your YouTube Automation Success?

By recommending products or services related to your niche, you can earn commissions on sales made through your affiliate links. For instance, a tech automation channel can promote gadgets or software and receive affiliate payouts whenever viewers make a purchase. Bonus Tip: AI-powered tools can help automate affiliate link placements, making the process seamless and time-saving. 3. Sponsored Content: Partner with Brands Sponsored content is a major revenue stream for YouTube creators. Brands are always looking to collaborate with creators who can showcase their products in an engaging way. For faceless channels, sponsored content can take the form of narrated product reviews or product mentions within your video script. Automation Insight: Use AI tools to efficiently incorporate sponsor mentions and ensure a polished, professional presentation. 4. Merchandise Sales: Turn Your Brand Into a Business If your niche has a loyal following, merchandise sales can be an excellent way to boost income. Platforms like Teespring and Printful make it easy to design and sell custom-branded products. This is especially effective for niches like fitness, gaming, or tech, where fans are likely to purchase merchandise related to the content. AI Tip: AI can assist with designing unique merchandise that aligns with your channel’s brand, reducing the time spent on product creation. 5. Channel Memberships and Patreon: Offer Premium Content Offering exclusive content through channel memberships or platforms like Patreon can provide a steady income stream. This could include behind-the-scenes access, premium tutorials, or early video releases. By creating a dedicated subscriber base, you can generate monthly recurring revenue from loyal fans. Automation Advantage: Use automated scheduling tools to ensure regular delivery of premium content to your members, keeping them engaged and satisfied. 6. Digital Products and Courses: Monetize Knowledge If your channel focuses on education, tech, or another expertise-driven niche, you can create and sell digital products like eBooks, online courses, or downloadable guides. For instance, a tech channel could sell in-depth tutorials, while a fitness channel might offer workout plans or nutrition guides. Automation Tip: AI can help you streamline content creation for your digital products, saving you time while increasing revenue potential. 7. YouTube Shorts Fund: Earn from Short-Form Videos With the rise of short-form content, YouTube introduced the YouTube Shorts Fund, which rewards creators for high-performing Shorts. If your automation channel produces engaging, viral Shorts content, this fund can be a lucrative addition to your revenue streams. Pro Tip: Use AI to optimize your Shorts titles, tags, and descriptions to increase visibility and performance. Want to FastTrack your YouTube Automation Success?

Automation Benefit: AI tools can help you repurpose content efficiently, maximizing the potential to license your work. The Pros of YouTube Automation (Is YouTube Automation Worth It?) YouTube automation has rapidly gained popularity, and for good reason. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, automation offers significant advantages for creators looking to scale and simplify their content creation. Here are the key benefits: 1. Easy Entry for Beginners One of the standout benefits of YouTube automation is that it allows even beginners to get started quickly. Automated channels eliminate the need to be on camera, which is perfect for those who are camera-shy or lack video production experience. With AI handling tasks like voiceovers, video editing, and content optimization, anyone can create professional-looking videos without prior expertise. 2. Time Efficiency and Scalability Automation streamlines repetitive tasks, allowing creators to produce content more efficiently. This gives you more time to focus on scaling your channel, exploring new niches, or refining your content strategy. You can rapidly expand your video library without getting bogged down in the manual labor of video production. 3. Multiple Revenue Streams Automated YouTube channels can be monetized in various ways, including ads, affiliate marketing, sponsorships, and merchandise sales. The diversity of revenue options provides creators with multiple avenues for generating income, making YouTube automation a highly attractive business model. 4. Global Reach and Accessibility YouTube is a global platform with a vast, diverse audience. Automation allows you to cater to different demographics and niches without requiring constant manual effort. With the right strategy, you can build a channel that attracts viewers from around the world. 5. Leveraging AI for Creative Efficiency AI tools can assist with creative tasks such as generating video ideas, writing scripts, and optimizing content for SEO. This reduces the workload on creators while maintaining high content quality. With AI, you can focus more on strategy and content direction, while the tools handle the time-consuming aspects of content creation. While YouTube automation offers significant advantages, it's important to remember that success still requires strategic planning, creativity, and consistent effort—particularly in selecting the right niche and optimizing content for YouTube's algorithm. The Challenges of YouTube Automation Despite the many benefits, YouTube automation comes with its own set of challenges. Here are some of the key hurdles creators may face: 1. Initial Setup Costs While automation reduces ongoing work, getting started with an automated channel often requires upfront investments. You’ll need to purchase tools, software, or even professional services for tasks like voiceovers or video editing. The initial cost can be a barrier for those just starting out. 2. Algorithm Dependency YouTube’s algorithm is constantly evolving, which means that automated channels must stay up-to-date with trends and best practices to remain competitive. Channels that are not optimized for the algorithm can struggle with visibility, leading to low engagement and reduced income potential. 3. Quality Control Relying heavily on automation tools may result in generic or low-quality content. While automation can save time, it’s crucial to maintain a balance between automation and a human touch. Viewers value authenticity, creativity, and high-quality content, so it's important to ensure that your channel stands out for all the right reasons. 4. Increased Competition As YouTube automation becomes more popular, the competition in automated niches is growing.

Anegbe Yunusa 1 month ago Standing out in these niches requires unique content ideas, strategic planning, and consistent engagement with your audience. Without these, your channel might get lost in the crowd. 5. Monetization Delays Automated channels must meet YouTube's requirements for monetization, including reaching 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours. Achieving these milestones can take time, especially for new channels that are still building an audience. Consistency in content creation is key to reaching these thresholds. 6. Policy Compliance YouTube has strict guidelines when it comes to content originality and quality. Automated channels that rely on reused or poorly edited content risk facing demonetization or account suspension. It’s important to stay within YouTube’s policies to avoid penalties and ensure long-term success. Want to FastTrack your YouTube Automation Success?

A niche with evergreen content—like personal finance, health, or tech—often provides consistent growth opportunities. 2.

Click Here to learn about my best Recommendation<<<<< Can YouTube Automation Make You a Millionaire? The short answer: Yes, YouTube automation can absolutely make you a millionaire—but it’s not an overnight process. With the right strategy, tools, and commitment, YouTube automation can evolve from a side hustle to a full-blown empire generating life-changing income. Let’s break down how and why this is possible. How YouTube Automation Works YouTube automation involves creating and managing faceless YouTube channels, where the entire process—from content creation to uploading—is streamlined using tools, outsourcing, and efficient workflows. I nstead of being the face of the channel, creators leverage automated systems and teams to build a portfolio of channels, allowing for scalable growth. The Millionaire Formula: 3 Key Steps 1. Build a Portfolio of Channels One of the secrets to scaling YouTube automation is diversifying your income streams by running multiple channels. For instance, Matt Par, the creator of the Tube Mastery and Monetization course, owns more than 9 faceless YouTube channels, each generating revenue from ads, sponsorships, affiliate marketing, and more. 2. Leverage Monetization Opportunities YouTube offers numerous monetization avenues: AdSense Revenue: Earn from ads displayed on your videos. Affiliate Marketing: Promote products and earn commissions. Brand Deals: Partner with companies for sponsorships. Digital Products: Sell courses, eBooks, or other products to your audience. By combining these strategies, even a channel with modest views can earn substantial income. 3. Automate and Outsource The beauty of YouTube automation lies in delegation. Instead of creating content yourself, you can outsource tasks like scriptwriting, video editing, voiceovers, and thumbnail design to freelancers. Tools like TubeMagic, Pictory, and CapCut further simplify the process, allowing you to focus on scaling rather than execution.

So now, let’s dive into how you can get started with the YouTube Automation channel and ultimately make money with it. What is YouTube Automation?

This FREE guide reveals the proven steps to start or scale your faceless channel to 7-figures without recording any video. Get it today for completely Free!✨✨✨ What are the best niches to start YouTube Automation in? So here’s a very basic overview of how this works. You find video ideas, you generate the videos, and then you upload and optimize those videos on YouTube. The first step in doing this is choosing a niche. Now, a niche is simply a category of content that you upload videos in. You don’t want to be uploading your videos all over the place, uploading basketball videos one day and drone videos the next. You want to stay within a consistent category of content that you upload. And I’m going to share with you some of the best niches to do this in so you don’t get hung up on this for too long. It’s important that you choose a niche, take action, and go with that as soon as possible. ★ Use 1of10 for niche research to identify trending topics and keywords in your niche. Below I am going to list 10 of what I consider the best niches to start a YouTube channel. 1. TRUE CRIME This is a niche that’s been exploding recently, and I believe it’s going to get even bigger for a very long time. To show you an example of a channel doing this, we can take a look at this channel called Explore With Us. They have 4 million subscribers and the channel pulls in 36 million views per month, which is honestly insane. At a $5 CPM, they would be making around $180.000 per month just from ad revenue alone. So this niche is absolutely popping off right now. What seems to be doing really well within this niche is talking about interrogations. As you can see, most of their videos are focused on that. If we go to the most popular, most of these are interrogation videos. So I believe this niche is going to continue to get more and more popular. But if you do this niche, make sure to follow the guidelines of fair use and also keep in mind that the primary source of revenue within this niche will be ad revenue. You have to get quite a bit of view for this to be worth it, but I’ll list some more niches that don’t rely fully on ad revenue. ✨✨New to YouTube or looking to grow your channel?

AI or ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE This one is booming right now, and it’s going to increase exponentially. I believe this niche is pretty future-proof because this is only going to become more popular in my estimation. There are always new tools and more improvements coming out related to this. So it can be a fantastic niche. And there are tons of different channels and different niches doing this, and having success with it. One of them is this one called Simplilearn. 3. TRAI CAMERA VIDEOS This is a bit of a unique one that’s been popping off recently. Take a look at Trail Terror for example, This one is popping off, getting millions of views per month just talking about different things that have been captured on trail cameras. And here’s another channel called Creepy Cam which does similar things. As you’ll notice, most of the focus on these videos is on scary subjects and they can do quite well. But keep in mind that, the primary revenue source for these videos will be ad revenue, but you can potentially get a lot of views on them. 4. 360° VIRTUAL REALITY VIDEOS This niche is becoming more popular as more and more people get their hands on virtual reality headsets. As the world progresses in that direction, channels producing this type of 360-degree content are setting themselves in a very good position. And think of it like this. Given the fact that not everybody owns these headsets yet, videos like this have managed to still get over 140 million views. This proves the potential of this niche going forward into the future. Now to create faceless 360° content like this channel called Warner bros• pictures does. You would either need a 360° camera to film stuff or you would have to hire some editors to animate your videos. Is it worth 17 million views per month to do that? I think so, in my personal opinion, but it would be an investment going into there unless you had animation skills. And it seems like people are becoming very interested in things like 360° water slides and roller coaster videos. ✨✨New to YouTube or looking to grow your channel?

WEALTH AND FINANCE As we enter the year 2025, more and more people are looking for ways to make money online. In a recent survey, the most desired job profession for kids and teenagers was being a YouTuber. So as these people get older and start to pursue these paths, you can capitalize on that with a faceless YouTube channel that, for example, teaches people how to grow a YouTube channel, and how to start making money online. And you might be saying, well, isn’t this niche getting saturated at this point? In my opinion, saturation up to a certain degree can be beneficial because you can get into the suggested video feeds of other popular videos. Also, out of all these videos going up within this niche, how many of them are decent and provide good information? Not many of them. So you can easily stand out within this niche just by doing a little bit of research and also make a little bit better videos than all the other videos that are out there, and most of all give more value to viewers. The way you give the most value is, you find multiple videos that have gone up related to a given topic, take the best parts of each video, incorporate them all into your own video, and boom, yours will be the best and most valuable. 6. TRAVEL With travel opening up nowadays and with people being able to go all over the world, travel is booming right now, and I think it will continue to do so. The destinations out there are virtually endless, and there are so many different combinations of videos you can make about those destinations, the best places to visit within a certain continent country, or city. There are so many different possibilities within this niche. And even though there is a lot of content out there related to travel, I do think there are also a lot of opportunities coming up going into the next year. Channels like World According to Briggs do travel content, and they get millions of views per month. Channels like that also incorporate negative videos within their content strategy, meaning they talk about the worst places to visit in addition to the best, and that seems to do well for their channel. If you make a channel on this niche, do that strategy where you talk about both negative and positive subjects of different places to provide the end traveler who’s watching as much value as you can. ✨✨New to YouTube or looking to grow your channel? This FREE guide reveals the proven steps to start or scale your faceless channel to 7-figures without recording any video. Get it today for completely Free!✨✨✨ 7. TECHNOLOGY Just like AI, think about how many other advancements technologically are coming in the coming years. Channels like TechZone, for example, They are capitalizing on this, making videos about ingenious inventions and cool gadgets, and they’re pulling in 13 million views per month, which is a lot. And if they translate TechZone into multiple different languages, they may be making multiples. On top of that, there are always new inventions coming out. This is a pretty high CPM niche, especially if you focus on mobile technology. For example, cell phones and things related to that, given some of the top advertisers are big cell phone companies. So on average, that type of content seems to make more money per 1000 views. And overall, I think this is a really solid niche if you’re considering a thousand views. I also think this is a really solid niche if you’re considering running a faceless YouTube channel. 8. DOCUMENTARIES With platforms like TikTok and Instagram reels popping off like crazy, people’s attention spans have been getting shorter, and there’s been a growing need for long-form content that people are interested in. So as short-form content becomes more popular, there’s been a growing amount of people who want to see a lot of great quality long-form content as well. And to prove that to you, channels like Magnets Media, for example, They are doing better than ever, getting millions of views per month on their channel. And they produce long-form documentary-style content about tons of different subjects. Dark Docs is another channel that is doing the same with over a million subscribers. And as more and more people are canceling their cable bills, they’re not going to be watching documentaries there, more and more people are going to platforms like YouTube to watch documentaries for free. So if you can produce long-form content on a topic that you are somewhat interested in, this could be a bonus because you’ll enjoy writing and talking about these sorts of subjects in your faceless videos. ✨✨New to YouTube or looking to grow your channel? This FREE guide reveals the proven steps to start or scale your faceless channel to 7-figures without recording any video. Get it today for completely Free!✨✨✨ 9. SCARY VIDEOS Channels like Nuke’s top 5, They are doing incredibly well, pulling in almost 10 million views per month, and creating videos on scary topics like ghosts and things that are just scary in general. And to be doing this well with only 227 videos is quite an accomplishment. They’re doing incredibly well, and this just shows that a lot of people are interested in this kind of content. And I think it’s pretty evergreen, meaning you could continue to make a good amount of views from this. But keep in mind that, with scary-related content, the primary revenue source will be ad revenue. So you do have to get a lot of views, but as evidenced by this channel, it’s certainly possible. 10. HEALTH Channels like Body Hub are within the health niche, getting incredible amounts of views. They’re pulling in almost 2 million views per month. And what’s crazy about their videos is that, if we click to watch one of their videos, like this one about losing weight. As you can see, the background of these videos is literally just stock footage, and you can get those on websites like Storyblocks or Pixabay. It’s literally just someone talking throughout the video about ten cheap meals that melt belly fat. One of the reasons the health niche is so amazing is that there are tons of products out there on places like Clickbank.com or Digistore24.com that you can promote as an affiliate and make even more money. Now, as a bonus, here’s how you can make even more money in doing this if you go with one of these niches. ✨✨New to YouTube or looking to grow your channel? This FREE guide reveals the proven steps to start or scale your faceless channel to 7-figures without recording any video. Get it today for completely Free!✨✨✨ If you’re going within the AI niche, make sure to sign up for the affiliate networks of all the different AI tools that you talk about and promote them from your videos, and you’ll get people on monthly subscriptions for that software. If you can refer people to software that pays monthly recurring commissions for a lifetime, you could potentially be making money for a long time into the future, as long as people stay subscribed. For the wealth and finance videos, also make sure to go to websites like Digistore24 and find courses related to this to promote. If you do the travel niche, make sure to sign up for any pertinent affiliate network related to flights or hotels that fly to these destinations to see if any of the products you talk about are on there. If so, make sure to drop those links in the description. And of course, the same goes with health. Whereas the other niches like true crime,360 videos, and scary videos, are the ones that are going to require quite a bit of views to make decent money. But the reason I put them on this list is because they’re exploding right now in terms of how much they’re trending, and I believe they’re going to be big this year and in the coming years. The top recommended AI Tools to maximize your channel’s growth Incorporating AI tools in your channel can bring countless benefits along the way. Almost all automation tools nowadays use AI for quicker and better results.

This FREE guide reveals the proven steps to start or scale your faceless channel to 7-figures without recording any video. Get it today for completely Free!✨✨✨ How to 10x monetize your YouTube channel There are 4 great ways of monetizing on YouTube and 2 bad ways. So let’s talk about the 2 bad ways first, which include doing merchandise and memberships on your channel. I recommend staying away from that, because the amount of money you make per sale is very low, and you have to be getting millions upon millions of views to make that feasible. Let’s talk about even if you get a small amount of views, how you can still make a lot of money. Let’s start with: 1. Ad Revenue This is always great for every single channel to have. Once you get 4000 hours of watch time and 1000 subscribers on your channel, now you can join what’s called the (YouTube partner program). And don’t worry about that, you can achieve this incredibly faster. There are a lot of YouTubers who do this very quickly, and you can too. Ad revenue involves something called CPM, which is how much money you make per 1000 views. Some channels only get a $1 CPM, and others get upwards of $50. So how can you make the most money possible from your channel with ad revenue? Well, that just involves creating videos on topics and in a niche that’s very high CPM. Some like the make money online niche, make upwards of $20 to $30 per 1000 views. A great tip for making as much money as possible is to create videos that are longer than 8 minutes. That’s because you can place multiple ads throughout your video and this way you make multiple times more money from your video. Let’s say you have a stream of income coming in from ads. That’s awesome. ✨✨New to YouTube or looking to grow your channel? This FREE guide reveals the proven steps to start or scale your faceless channel to 7-figures without recording any video. Get it today for completely Free!✨✨✨ 2. Digital Products. These can be things like online courses, ebooks, or software, and you can sell them very easily using a platform like Kajabi. The reason online courses are so great to sell from YouTube is that a course is just a collection of videos. Just upload videos teaching something in a step-by-step manner, and people will pay a lot of money for this information because it can be very useful to them. Now you might be saying, Well, doesn’t it take a lot of effort and energy to create an online course? And the answer is yes. It does, but it can be very worth it if you do. But if you don’t have specialized knowledge in something to teach, Then you can go and do 3. Affiliate Marketing There are websites like digisore24.com and Clickbank.com where you can partner with people who’ve already made courses, and then get upwards of 50% of every sale that you get promoting somebody else’s program. All you do is go to Clickbank, go to their marketplace section, choose your niche, and then find products that are within that niche. I recommend making sure that it’s being sold for at least 500 to 1000 dollars. Because if you get 50% of a sale for 1000 dollars, you just made five hundred dollars. Get 20 of those per month. Boom. You’re making $10.000 per month. It’s very easy to get a channel to get hundreds of thousands of views per month, so this is more than achievable. All you have to do is mention the product within your video after you’ve given a lot of value to make sure your video still does well in the algorithm. Then you mention the product, have it be one of the first links in the description. People will click and buy through that, and boom, you just made money. 4. Sponsorships Once your channel grows big enough, usually a couple of thousand subscribers and getting a decent amount of views, companies will start to reach out and ask if they can sponsor your videos. You can agree to the terms and make a deal. They make the payment, then you promote their products or services on your videos. This method in particular can make you a lot of money, especially if you get a lot of views in your channel. Conclusion So there you have it, now you have everything you need to start a successful YouTube automation channel. I gave you all the necessary knowledge and tools to succeed, which will significantly help you, whether you want to go with a faceless channel or become a traditional YouTuber. Either way, this guide is going to help you. But I would say that this is more for YouTube automation where you run your channel completely faceless, just by leveraging AI tools, which I recommend you do. If you follow the guidelines I shared and use the right tools? I doubt you won’t be successful with your YouTube Automation channel. So, go all in and start your channel right now and apply what you learned. But most importantly, what I want to ask you now is to be patient with the results. You will actually need to put in a lot of effort at the beginning, but once you upload around 30 to 60 videos, things will start to compound, and you will then start to get a lot of views and subscribers on your channel. So stay consistent, very essential. YouTube loves consistency, make sure to upload 1 to 2 videos every day for at least 30 days at the beginning. That way you will fast-track success on YouTube. Even though you may not be able to monetize your channel from the (MPP) yet, you can still use other monetization methods I shared earlier on, and you can monetize your views that way. Remember, with these monetization methods, you can start making money right from day 1. ✨✨New to YouTube or looking to grow your channel?

Automation is developing and deploying technologies that allow goods and services to be produced and delivered with little or no human interaction. Many tasks that were previously performed by people are now more efficient, reliable, and/or fast because of the use of automation technologies, techniques, and procedures. YouTube automation, similarly, is the process of creating content on YouTube. There’s no need to go through the cumbersome process of coming up with an idea, carrying out meticulous research, writing down a script, and arranging required apparatus, like camera, mic, lights, etc. Hence, YouTube automation prevents you from reinventing the wheel every time, as you can outsource every step involved in the content creation process on YouTube. Additionally, a bot will try to gather the views for you, and keep your viewers engaged with your channel.

It allows you to publish videos when convenient for your audience and helps you avoid missing important moments in the news cycle. You can use automated video scheduling to: Automatically post videos at the same time every day. Schedule a video to be posted on a specific date and time. Create a playlist of videos to be uploaded each week or month simultaneously. Many automation tools let you schedule when your video will be published on YouTube. Here is how you can schedule for YouTube with ContentStudio: This is useful for creating a consistent stream of content over time — especially if you want to grow an audience by regularly uploading new videos. Automating video publishing also lets you take advantage of trends and news stories that are currently trending on social media, like when a celebrity dies or when there’s breaking news about politics or sports. Scheduling these videos ahead of time ensures that they’ll be published when more people are likely to watch them (e.g., after school or work). Captioning Videos The second most common example of YouTube automation is captioning videos automatically. Many companies want all their videos captioned as soon as possible after uploading them to reach more viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing. This makes sense because these viewers make up an important part of the market; according to YouTube’s stats, “people with hearing loss visit YouTube more often than those who don’t have hearing loss.” Translating Subtitles into Other Languages Automated translation is a good example of how YouTube automation can be used to grow your business. You can use automated translation software to translate subtitles from one language to another and make them available for viewing. This is a great way to reach a wider audience, especially if you have a product or service that people want in their native language but don’t know where to find it. You don’t need an advanced degree or even basic knowledge of foreign languages to set up this automation process. You must download the free software from the Internet and install it on your computer. Then you must upload your subtitles file into the program and hit “upload.” The whole process takes less than five minutes! Conclusion YouTube is a huge opportunity waiting to be grasped by ambitious people, who have the hunger for growth, and the brain to go with their plans. Being the second largest search engine after Google, YouTube is a market for your skills in the domain of content creation. Simultaneously, automation is taking over each and every domain of human endeavor. In such a scenario, you need to be aware of the relevant automation tools which make life easier for you on YouTube as a content creator without going through much trouble.

The Challenges of YouTube Automation Automating a YouTube channel involves creating a workflow where tasks like video creation, editing, and uploading are streamlined, often outsourced, or managed by AI tools. However, achieving this level of efficiency isn't easy. And it has a lot of downsides for beginners. Algorithm Changes YouTube’s algorithm is always changing, and that can seriously impact your automated channel. You need to stay on top of these updates because they decide which videos get pushed out to more viewers. If you ignore these changes, your views and revenue can drop fast. Having good analytics tools helps a lot because you can track how your videos are doing and tweak your strategy accordingly. Being adaptable and quick to respond to algorithm shifts is key to keeping your channel successful. Competition The competition on YouTube is intense, especially with more people using automation tools. It’s not enough to just pump out videos; they need to stand out. Finding a unique angle or niche can help a lot. Viewers have tons of options, so they expect high-quality, engaging content. Automated channels need to be creative and continuously improve their videos to keep viewers coming back. Standing out in such a crowded space takes effort and innovation. Find The Perfect Niche In Minutes – Access The Nexlev AI Tool And Get Started Today! Dependency on Platform Relying on YouTube alone can be risky. Any major changes to YouTube’s policies or algorithms can mess with your channel’s success. For example, stricter content guidelines or monetization rules can hit your revenue hard. It’s smart to diversify and not put all your eggs in one basket. Look at other platforms or ways to make money to spread the risk. Following YouTube’s rules closely is also crucial to avoid penalties that can disrupt your channel. Balancing automation with strict adherence to YouTube's policies is vital to keeping your channel running smoothly. How To Make YouTube Automation Worthwhile To make YouTube automation pay off, you need a solid plan. Focus on finding profitable niches with high demand but low competition. Use AI tools and hire freelancers to handle tasks like editing and scriptwriting to save time and boost efficiency. Always keep an eye on analytics to tweak your content and stay relevant with algorithm changes. In the end, this approach is what makes YouTube automation worth it. Quality Content Quality content is the heart of a successful YouTube channel, even if it's automated. You need to invest in good editing tools, graphics, and intriguing scripts to keep viewers hooked. High-quality content is what makes YouTube automation worth it, as it ensures viewers keep coming back for more. Despite the automation, human creativity and insight are irreplaceable in making content that stands out. High-quality content ensures viewers keep coming back, which is essential for the long-term success of your channel. Compliance With Policies Sticking to YouTube’s rules is a must for automated channels. Breaking guidelines can lead to demonetization or even account suspension. Make sure to stay updated with YouTube’s community guidelines, copyright rules, and monetization policies. Using tools to check for policy violations before uploading can save a lot of trouble. Transparency, like clear disclosures for sponsored videos, is also important. Following YouTube’s rules ensures your channel stays in good standing and keeps generating revenue. Continuous Improvement YouTube is always changing, so continuous improvement is crucial. Regularly analyze your performance metrics, viewer feedback, and industry trends to keep your content fresh. Experiment with different formats, styles, and topics to see what works best. Use data analytics to understand viewer behavior and refine your content accordingly. Staying updated with the latest tech and integrating new tools can boost your production quality and efficiency. Continuous improvement is essential for staying relevant and successful.

By hiring freelancers for tasks like video editing, scriptwriting, and thumbnail design, you can focus on the bigger picture. Outsourcing not only saves time but also brings in diverse talent, enhancing your content's overall quality. Use platforms like Fiverr and Upwork to find skilled professionals.

Look for mentors with a proven track record, positive reviews, and a personalized approach. Bad mentorship can lead you down the wrong path, costing you more in the long run. Make sure your mentor is genuinely invested in your success and provides actionable insights that can help grow your channel. Hiring A Low-Quality Team Your team plays a crucial role in the success of your automated channel. Hiring low-quality freelancers or staff can result in poorly produced videos, sloppy editing, and uninspiring content. This not only affects viewer retention but also harms your channel’s reputation. To avoid this mistake, take the time to vet candidates thoroughly. Look for portfolios, ask for references, and start with smaller projects to test their skills.
