      "content": "3 Best AI Script Writers for Making High-Quality Videos As the popularity of AI skyrockets, hundreds of companies are jumping on the artificial intelligence bandwagon. With an overwhelming amount of AI tools on the market, we tested over 30 different AI script writers to see which tools actually produce quality results. Many creatives are (rightfully) skeptical of AI’s ability to generate original, engaging ideas. But marketing videos don’t need to reinvent the wheel. Like a good pop song that plays too many times on the radio, marketing videos follow tried-and-true formulas — which AI can mimic. To produce humanlike content, AI script generators employ natural language processors, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But how good can an AI scriptwriter really be? Let’s find out! We tested over 30 AI script generators; here are three options that produced the highest-quality results when writing a video script. The goal wasn’t to create a small list, but we had high standards for the AI script-writing tools. These three tools delivered professional results. We’ve also included tips on how to write effective AI prompts and example results from each script-writing tool we’ve featured. How to Create Effective AI Scriptwriting Prompts The results of AI-generated writing are limited to the information you provide in your prompt. Therefore, it’s important to over-explain the parameters of what you want the AI to generate, rather than leaving it to make its own assumptions about tone of voice, ideal audience, and other similar details. Your prompt should include all of the information you want to be reflected in the generated script. This might be creative, product, or brand information. We’ve created a template (below) for a general marketing video script. Replace the bolded text with information from your marketing video brief to utilize the template with an AI writing tool. Spending a few minutes creating a detailed prompt is essential to getting the most out of AI script writing tools. This prompt covers all of the most important information AI needs to create a marketing video script for your product and company. AI Video Marketing Prompt Template The ideal audience for this video is [Targeted Audience]. The goal of the video is [Campaign Goal]. The video’s tone should be [Tone], in the style of [Theme, Brand, or Video URL]. The purpose of this video is to [Intended Viewer Experience] with the goal of persuading viewers to [Video Call to Action]. The video should be structured as follows: When writing your prompt, add or remove details as needed. To create varying results or use AI as a brainstorming tool, experiment with the amount of information you provide. Other information you might include: Note: AI output can be improved with follow-up prompts. You can specifically point out a desired change or even just ask AI to “try again.” 3 Best AI Script Writers for High-Quality Videos Of the 30+ AI writing tools we tested, only three made the cut for generating high-quality scripts for marketing videos. Most AI writing tools use the same machine learning model: OpenAI’s ChatGPT. OpenAI has established several contracts with third-party companies, which allow them to utilize the network in specific, limited ways. We will note what AI model each respective tool uses as we discuss them. We created the prompt below using the template provided. The goal of the prompt is to generate a 30-second explainer video script for an organic, minimalist makeup brand. We used this same prompt when testing each AI script generator. 1. ChatGPT: Best Free Tool You don’t need to pay for a script-writing tool to produce solid results with AI. This is perhaps the most surprising thing we learned while testing these AI writing tools. Since most AI writing tools use some version of ChatGPT, we figured it was worth starting with the free version of ChatGPT for comparison with the paid tools featured below. At the time of writing, ChatGPT-3.5 is OpenAI’s free tier. To test ChatGPT, we input the prompt four separate times. The AI produced slightly different scripts each time, even though we did not change the prompt. Each new iteration provided more detail and dynamism in the shot imagery and text. The following script was the fourth script generated using the prompt. ChatGPT-Generated Video Script [Opening shot: A serene bedroom with soft natural light filtering through sheer curtains. Gentle, uplifting music plays in the background. A woman in her 30s stands before a vanity mirror, looking contemplative.] Narrator (V.O.):(Warm and empathetic tone) Life’s beauty shouldn’t come at the cost of your skin’s comfort. [Cut to a close-up of the woman’s hand hesitating over traditional makeup products.] Narrator (V.O.):(Understanding) Sensitive skin deserves a better story. [Quick sequence of the woman applying traditional makeup, her skin showing signs of irritation.] Narrator (V.O.):(Compassionate) It’s time to rewrite that story. [Transition to a picturesque garden, where the woman sits, surrounded by nature. She picks up XYZ Makeup’s organic products and brushes.] Narrator (V.O.):Introducing XYZ Makeup – where nature becomes your canvas. [Show a series of close-ups highlighting the organic makeup products and brushes.] Narrator (V.O.):Our organic blends enhance your beauty, while embracing your skin’s well-being. [Quick cuts of the woman applying XYZ Makeup products, her skin looking radiant and comfortable.] Narrator (V.O.):(Inspiring) Experience the joy of a minimalist routine – a graceful dance between luxury and simplicity. [Cut to the woman confidently strolling through a charming street, exuding confidence.] Narrator (V.O.):(Inviting) It’s time to embrace your skin’s true potential with XYZ Makeup. [Zoom in on the XYZ Makeup logo, accompanied by a soft chime. Text appears on the screen: “Discover More at XYZMakeup.com.”] Narrator (V.O.):Elevate your everyday ritual. Explore XYZ Makeup today. [Closing shot: The woman stands on a hill, overlooking a serene landscape, a serene smile gracing her lips.] Narrator (V.O.):XYZ Makeup – Beauty, Naturally Yours. [End with the logo and website link on the screen as the music fades out.] ChatGPT-Generated Video Script ChatGPT produced a solid script from the setting and visual elements to the copy and potential business taglines. There’s nothing fantastically original here, but it tells an emotional story well without becoming cliché or using overly-flowery language to convey luxurious femininity. Pros Cons Cost: Free 2. Jasper: Best Text Generation Jasper integrates multiple AI models to produce some of the most dynamic results across tools. The AI models it utilizes include ChatGPT, PalM (Google), Anthropic, and Cohere. It also allows you to upload brand and campaign information, saving you the trouble of constantly reiterating standard information about your company to the AI. Instead, the tool remembers this information and contextually incorporates it where relevant. We input the prompt several times when testing the tool. It’s important to produce multiple variations when using AI to create a high-quality script. This allows you to initiate a collaborative process with AI that creates better results overall. We also used both the “blank document,” which allows you to start from scratch, and the “Video Script Outline,” template offered as part of Jasper’s service. Both produced sufficient results, but the experience of using a blank document mimics tools like Microsoft Word and Google Docs. This created a more natural-feeling user experience and ease of conversing with the Jasper AI. Jasper-Generated Video Script [Opening Scene: Narrator’s voice smooth and soothing over visuals of nature] Narrator (V.O.):Life keeps moving at a fast pace for the contemporary woman, adding more tasks to an already overflowing plate. Navigating this chaos with sensitive skin? It’s a game of doubles. [Problem Scene: Visuals of a concerned woman holding cosmetics filled with chemicals] Narrator (V.O.):Ever stopped to question what’s hidden in your beauty products? A slew of synthetics, aggressive chemicals – they’re not doing your skin or our world any favors. [Solution Scene: Switch to our product, showing organic materials and chic packaging] Narrator (V.O.):Enter XYZ Cosmetics – your skin’s best friend. Our pared-down, organic line takes an oath to honor both your skin and Mother Earth. [Product Details Scene: Close-up shots of a woman applying our product smoothly] Narrator (V.O.):Formulated for delicate skin, XYZ is the soft touch your face has been longing for. Our brushes, as eco-friendly as they are plush, create an effortless sweep for a natural, impeccable look. [Call to Action Scene: Visuals of our website with a warm, enticing tone] Narrator (V.O.):Immerse yourself in the beauty of simplicity. Replace the superfluous with the exquisite. Dive into xyzcosmetics.com and join us in the organic, minimalist journey. Your skin, and our planet, will show their gratitude. Jasper-Generated Video Script Jasper excels in producing copy that genuinely mimics human language and captures the desired tone. Jasper isn’t built to write scripts, and that’s most apparent in the lack of visual direction included in the script above. However, Jasper took follow-up instructions extremely well. The second example script below was produced with two follow-up requests, “try again with more visual direction,” then “try again with a setting in a unique location.” Rewrite of Jasper-Generated Video Script [Scene: A sunlit, airy artist’s loft, the early morning light spilling through the large factory windows, casting a soft glow on the woman] Narrator (V.O.):In the heart of the city, where the hum of life never fades, she finds her tranquility. XYZ Makeup, her partner in carving out moments of self-care amidst the bustling metropolis. [The camera pans to showcase the cityscape beyond the window, then returns to the woman, sitting by an easel, a palette of XYZ Makeup beside her] Narrator (V.O.):Crafted with the essence of nature, our products lend themselves seamlessly to her lifestyle, enhancing her natural beauty, not hiding it. [Scene transitions to her mirror, reflecting the city’s skyline. She applies the makeup gently, each stroke a testament to self-love] Narrator (V.O.):Gentle on your skin, yet bold in their statement, XYZ Makeup is for every woman who celebrates her uniqueness. [Final scene: The woman facing the window, the cityscape behind her reflecting in the mirror. Her face is radiant, her eyes sparkling with a confident glow] Narrator (V.O.):XYZ Makeup, marrying the simplicity of nature with the dynamism of city life. Unveil your radiant self. [Screen fades to the company logo and website, amidst the cityscape] Narrator (V.O.):Visit our website today and let XYZ Makeup accompany you on your journey to self-expression. Rewrite of Jasper-Generated Video Script Pros Cons Cost: Starts at $39/mo 3. Hoppy Copy: Best User Experience Hoppy Copy sets itself apart with an easy-to-use platform and effective templates. Although advertised as the AI for marketing emails, Hoppy Copy has something for every aspect of a marketing campaign. In fact, it’s one of the few tools we tested that includes a dedicated Video Script Template. In many ways, Hoppy Copy excels where Jasper falls short and vice versa. Both tools offer the ability to save brand information that AI can automatically integrate. Hoppy Copy provides the best user experience by far but can’t quite keep up with the quality of writing Jasper generates. In fact, it’s unknown what AI models Hoppy Copy uses. When we reached out, this was the company response, “We can’t say exactly the models we use, but we do use OpenAI.” Despite this lack of transparency, Hoppy Copy feels like a tool built for longevity. As artificial intelligence continues to improve, the platform Hoppy Copy has created will only become more of an asset to users. Hoppy Copy-Generated Video Script [Fade in to a woman in her 30s, wearing minimal makeup and sitting in a pristine and luxurious living space. Soft music plays in the background.] Woman (V.O.):We all want to look and feel our best, but sometimes the daily makeup routine can feel like a burden. [Cut to a close-up of a selection of organic makeup products from XYZ Makeup] Woman (V.O.):Introducing XYZ Makeup, the perfect solution for those who favor a minimalist lifestyle and have sensitive skin. [Cut to a woman in a butterfly-filled garden, using the XYZ Makeup brushes to apply makeup] Woman (V.O.):XYZ Makeup offers organic, all-natural makeup and brushes that are gentle yet effective. [Cut to a close-up of the woman’s face, looking natural and stunning] Woman (V.O.):Achieve the look you want with minimal effort—no more fuss, no more stress. [Cut to the woman standing up, arms outstretched, looking towards the sky] Woman (V.O.):Experience the ultimate in luxury and ease with XYZ Makeup. Visit our website today and experience the power of organic makeup. [Fade to the XYZ Makeup logo and website URL] Hoppy Copy-Generated Video Script This script illustrates one of the most powerful benefits of using AI to create video scripts: randomly great ideas. The script above outlines a scene in which, “a woman in a butterfly-filled garden [is] using the XYZ Makeup brushes to apply makeup.” This incredibly vivid image could become the setting for the entire commercial, lending to an engaging 30-second advertisement. In general, this ability to play around with the output from Hoppy Copy is one of its greatest assets. The tool splits your screen in half, allowing the left side to be AI Chat or a built-in template, while the right side is a live text document with your working copy. This allows a truly seamless workflow for marketers and copywriting professionals. Pros Cons Cost: Starting at $23/mo Convert Your AI-Written Script into an AI-Generated Video We thought it would be fun to grab one of the example scripts and test the end-to-end AI workflow, from writing the video script to generating and editing the video. There’s plenty of room for improvement, but it’s amazing to see the script come to life with music, voice-over, and stock video footage. This rough cut was produced in about 30 minutes. Here are the steps we took to create this short video: Check out our complete list of the best AI tools for video editing and production, including Pictory, which was used to generate the video above. 3 Ways to Write a Script with AI AI can produce seriously impressive scripts. But it’s often more helpful to employ AI as an assistant, rather than asking it to do all the work for you. Here are a few ways you can use AI to brainstorm fresh ideas and expedite scriptwriting. Conduct Dynamic Solo Brainstorms Brainstorming in a group setting synthesizes more engaging, interesting perspectives. Artificial intelligence can quickly gather a large range of potential ideas. To get effective and customized output, you will need to ask specific questions or provide significant detail. Using our example from before, you might ask AI to, “provide 40 different potential settings for an explainer video about a luxury, organic makeup brand for affluent women in their 30s who value sustainable business practices and desire a minimal but stunning daily beauty routine.” Alternatively, you might include those same product and brand details but ask AI to, “write 40 different taglines for this brand,” or, “write a story about a woman who uses this makeup.” AI output is hugely dependent on the input. Introduce various different prompts or ask for a significant number of responses to conduct a productive solo brainstorming session. Get a Rewrite to Gain Perspective AI learns from the content that already exists across the internet. Therefore it’s not always ideal to write the first draft using AI. The boundless originality of the human imagination is a huge asset that shouldn’t be quickly discarded for convenience. But whether you hit writer’s block or need some insight into your own writing, consider asking AI to rewrite your first draft. Be specific with your rewrite request. Instead of simply asking AI to, “rewrite the script,” be specific about what you want to be changed. For example, you can ask AI to expand the script, add uniqueness, or change the setting. Consider what you want to be changed in the script and use precise words to generate a useful rewrite. Which AI Writing Tool Is the Best at Rewriting Copy? Without additional instruction, how well do our favorite AI script generators rewrite scripts? That may depend on your preferences! We found this feature to be particularly helpful for rewriting clunky text or fixing sentence structure. At a minimum, AI rewriting can take pressure off of the first draft by allowing you to produce multiple, similar iterations. This makes it easier to identify weaker sections to improve the second version. Mimic a Viral Video It’s not easy to write a script that engages a wide audience. But there are a lot of viral videos that have done just that. Why not use AI to generate a similar tone (emotional, humorous, etc.)? To test this out, we asked ChatGPT to mimic “1984“, a classic Apple commercial that first introduced the Macintosh personal computer. The results are shockingly accurate — even too similar at times to use. In this case, a parody of this classic commercial would likely be a big hit. ChatGPT-Generated Video Script Based on Viral Video [Scene 1: A stark, monochrome environment. Rows of women sit in front of identical, oversized vanity mirrors, applying thick, heavy makeup robotically. A large screen at the front showsan overbearing figureadvertising mainstream, chemical makeup. There’s a cold, industrial hum.] Overbearing Figure:Conformity is beauty. Layers mask imperfections. [Scene 2: From the back of the room, a lone woman, distinct and vibrant in color, runs forward, clutching a sleek, minimalist XYZ Makeup kit. The atmosphere is tense, the monochrome women turn their heads slowly, watching her.] Narrator (Whispered V.O.):Break free. [Scene 3: The woman reaches the front, throwing the XYZ Makeup kit at the large screen. As it makes contact, the screen shatters into a burst of radiant, natural colors – representing the organic ingredients. The monochrome room starts to saturate with color.] Narrator (V.O.):XYZ Makeup. Dare to be different. Embrace the organic, the minimalist. [Scene 4: The formerly monochrome women now appear curious, picking up XYZ brushes and makeup, exploring them. Their faces begin to transform, revealing their individuality and natural beauty.] Narrator (V.O.):For the sensitive souls yearning for purity in a world of chaos. [Scene 5: The room is now awash with color. Close-up of the XYZ Makeup logo with the tagline.] Narrator (V.O.):Rediscover your essence. XYZ Makeup. Beauty redefined. [Scene slowly fades to black.] ChatGPT-Generated Video Script Based on Viral Video Provide minimal information for best results. Use follow-up requests to customize the output for your brand or products. What Makes an AI Writing Tool Good? Among the 30+ tools we tested, many were built specifically for scriptwriting. While some of these tools offered useful features for screenplay writers, none of them were built for marketing writing and failed to meet our standards. Additionally, the vast majority of AI writing tools relied too heavily on their contract with OpenAI, as well as a handful of mediocre templates. If the AI writing tool you’re considering only offers these basic features, the free version of ChatGPT is sufficient. Instead, the best AI script writers (and AI writing tools overall) are those that: Many of the tools we tested were unintuitive, produced overly simplified copy, and failed to compete with the free version of ChatGPT. But the three AI writing tools we chose can be used to produce quality videos from draft one through the final script. Ready for more?

Designed to be accessible, even for those with little editing experience, Runway ML’s tools are great for exploring creative possibilities and generating unique content. Runway ML is a compelling option for creators and marketers who want to explore the potential of AI in their video content. But because its focus is on experimentation, it isn’t always the best option for those looking for a professional-grade video editor. However, If you’re looking for a user-friendly platform to experiment with creative video editing and infuse your content with special effects, Runway ML is definitely worth checking out. To show how easy it is to use (and that you really can create video with their “free” version), we took an extremely simple prompt and produced this cool 4 second clip, which you can view on RunwayML’s platform. Our prompt was simply “Please prepare four seconds of an introduction to an advertisement for the rainforest.” 2. Descript Cost: Plans range from free to $24 a month for pro and enterprise offerings. The free plan comes with 1 hour of transcription & 1 hour of recording. The creator plan is $12 a month for 10 hours. Great feature: Powerful text-based video editing and podcasting Descript is an AI-powered platform that really shines when it comes to text-based editing. Editing a video with Descript is like editing a document. You can see the words spoken in your video and change them directly. This is different from most video editors where you have to move clips of video around on a timeline. It’s a faster and more intuitive way to make cuts, rearrange sections, and fix mistakes. Descript also utilizes AI to streamline audio editing tasks like removing silences or background noise reduction. As a bonus, editors using Descript can record themselves or their screens directly within the program, collaborate easily with team members, and publish and integrate video within existing platforms or marketing tools. There is a bit of a learning curve to mastering all of Descript’s features, however. If you’re looking for a streamlined workflow, powerful audio editing tools, and easy collaboration features, Descript could be the ideal AI editor for you. 3. Synthesia Cost: Plans range from $22 a month to enterprise offerings. The starter plan comes with 1 editor, 3 guests, and 120 hours of editing per year. Great feature: Custom AI avatars Synthesia is a game-changer in the AI video editing sphere, particularly for its ability to create over 160 AI-powered avatars. With its user-friendly interface and dynamic features, Synthesia empowers creators to produce stunning videos effortlessly. In addition to its digital avatars, Synthesia excels at text-to-speech generation, allowing you to deliver your message in your preferred language, accent, and tone of voice. Starting Synthesia is as easy as typing your text script. While integrating Synthesia with your existing marketing tools is no problem, it’s important to remember that the best use of this tool is in generating script-based videos. You can incorporate your own footage, but that’s not what Synthesia excels at. If your marketing strategy involves creating script-driven videos or leveraging the power of avatars, then Synthesia could be a great fit for your needs. 4. InVideo AI Cost: Plans range from free to $48 a month. The free plan comes with 10 minutes a week of AI generation. Great feature: YouTube optimized videos InVideo AI is a dynamic AI video editor that offers an array of templates and intuitive controls to help content creators craft professional videos effortlessly. One of the core features of InVideo AI is its prompt-to-video creation. Simply provide a text prompt describing your video concept, and InVideo AI will generate a script, create video scenes with relevant media, add a voiceover, and even incorporate text overlays. Invideo’s AI gets you started with your video creation, but your editing options are endless. You can customize your script, include your own images or footage, change the voiceover narration, and fine-tune other details of your video. You can even collaborate on editing directly in InVideo with your teammates. Whether you’re a seasoned video editor or a beginner, InVideo AI will help you create videos that not only look professional but also resonate with your target audience. 5. Pictory Cost: Plans range from $19 to $99 per month. The starter plan comes with 30 videos per month and 600 minutes of transcription. Great feature: Video makers specifically for social media (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn) Pictory is an AI video editor that caters specifically to content marketers, making it easy for you to transform your content into shareable and engaging videos. Pictory is especially great for turning existing content like blog posts, articles, or even podcasts into video format. You can paste text, upload a video file, or provide a link to online content, and Pictory will automatically generate a video storyboard with relevant visuals and music. Pictory also makes it easy to customize or edit your videos and even optimize them for social media by offering various aspect ratio options and pre-designed templates. One big benefit for content marketers is that some Pictory plans offer integration with analytics tools, allowing you to track your video performance and gain insights into audience engagement. Overall, Pictory is a solid choice for content marketers looking to streamline video creation and leverage existing content to create fresh video assets. 6. Sora (OpenAI) Cost: Currently limited access Great feature: Powered by one of the most advanced LLMs available today Sora, the latest project from the creators of ChatGPT, turns imagination into striking videos with groundbreaking AI technology. This innovative platform lets you describe the scene you have in mind, and Sora generates polished videos to match. While it’s still in limited access, we wanted to mention it because It’s powered by one of the most groundbreaking AI engines out there. Sora’s flexibility is a key benefit. Enter a few descriptive words or detailed paragraphs, and it will work its magic. Experiment with different art styles, moods, and visual effects to find exactly what sparks your inspiration. While it’s still in development, Sora’s potential is huge – it represents a new frontier in creative expression through artificial intelligence. Guide to AI Video Editors Navigating the vast landscape of AI video editors can be overwhelming. To simplify your journey, we’ve put together a comprehensive guide to explore the pros and cons of AI video editors and answer other pertinent questions you might have about them. Hopefully, we’ll be able to help you discover the perfect AI companion for your content creation and video editing needs. Is AI video editing the same thing as text-to-video? While AI video editing encompasses a broad spectrum of tools, text-to-video is a specific aspect within this domain. Text-to-video utilizes AI algorithms to convert written content into visual sequences. AI video editing, on the other hand, includes a wider array of features, incorporating various technologies to enhance and streamline the video production process. Do AI video editors cost money? Yes, most AI video editors come with a cost. While some offer free versions with limited features, premium plans unlock the full potential of these tools. Investing in a paid subscription often grants access to advanced features, increased processing power, and built-in support or resources for a more well-rounded and satisfying editing experience. What are the benefits of using AI video editors? AI video editors offer a variety of benefits that can streamline workflows, boost content creation, and potentially improve the quality of your videos. Here’s a list of some of the key advantages to using an AI video editor: Increased Efficiency: AI automates repetitive tasks like scene identification, transcription, and highlight creation. This frees up editors to focus on the creative aspects of video editing and storytelling. Faster Content Creation: By automating tasks and offering pre-made templates, AI editors can significantly speed up the video creation process, so you can produce more content in less time. Improved Quality: AI can assist with functions like color correction, noise reduction, and even adding subtitles, leading to a more polished and consistent look across your videos. Greater Accessibility: AI editors are often designed with user-friendly interfaces, which makes video creation more accessible to those with less editing experience. Data-Driven Insights: Some AI editors offer features that analyze video performance, helping you understand what resonates with viewers and optimize future content for better engagement. It’s important to remember that AI video editing is still a developing field, and while these tools are powerful, they likely won’t replace the need for human editors entirely. Creativity, editorial judgment, and a strategic approach are still invaluable when crafting truly compelling video content. Do you need editing experience to use an AI video editor? No, AI video editors are designed for user-friendly experiences, so even beginners can produce high-quality content. The intuitive interfaces and automated features of AI-editing tools eliminate complex technicalities, allowing users to try their hand at video editing without a steep learning curve. It is important to note, however, that some AI video editors may require you to spend more time figuring out their more complex editing features. Are there limitations to AI video editors? AI video editors are great for many things, but they’re not perfect for every project. If your video involves a lot of creative choices and really detailed editing, a more traditional video editing program might be a better fit. Also, some complex tasks can take a long time for AI editors to process. Knowing these limitations will help you use AI tools smartly, letting them handle the easy stuff while you focus on the trickier parts of the editing process.

These are the tools I’ve used to edit and publish over 500 videos that have generated 20M+ views on YouTube. What’s great: You don’t have to be a professional editor to use these tools or pay a costly subscription to get access. I’ve included a good mix of tools ideal for users of all skill levels. Let’s dive right in.

Video editors are like clothes, where finding the right fit depends on the person. YouTubers don’t all use the same video editor; there is a huge variety of editing software used by content creators. When looking for the best video editor for your own needs, it’s always best to consider your personal preferences. With this in mind, there are some common popular choices. A lot of creators use iMovie, Final Cut Pro, and Adobe Premiere Pro to edit videos for YouTube. You can find more excellent editing software examples in our compiled list below. Key features to look for in video editing software Editing videos doesn’t have to feel like rocket science. Here’s my checklist for evaluating and choosing the right editing software for YouTube. User-friendly interface A good editing tool will offer an intuitive interface to help you get started quickly and make the editing process seamless. When evaluating your options, look for tutorial videos and guides to conveniently learn more about a tool as you use it. Editing features No two video editing software are the same. You have to look for specific features that best fit your editing needs. If you’re a beginner, I’d recommend you check out basic editing features like cutting, trimming, and merging clips. Find tools with AI tools to automate and simplify the editing process. And, if you need professional-grade editing software, test advanced features like motion tracking, multicam editing, keyframing, and more. Export options Remember to evaluate all the export options available in a tool to ensure your videos are compatible with YouTube or any other platform. YouTube supports several file formats, including .mov, .mpeg-1, .mpeg-2, .mp4, .avi, and more. A good editing tool will let you adjust the export settings and choose your ideal resolution, frame rate, and compression. Special effects and transitions Good transition effects and styles can add life to your videos and maximize engagement. When testing different tools, look for the kind of effects and transition styles available. You should also consider how seamlessly these effects appear in the edited video. Here are some transitions and effects you may want to try: Speed filters where you can adjust the speed of your videos. Color correction so you can create natural, consistent coloring for your videos. Motion graphics and overlays where you can add text or media for extra context. Fade ins/out where the screen will gradually dissolve or appear in the next scene. Spinning effects to create a pattern interrupt effect and make dynamic visual hooks. Multitrack editing Multitrack editing allows you to edit the video and audio components as two separate tracks. You can add, cut, replace, or adjust any of these tracks individually without impacting the other track. I find this feature particularly useful when editing a video with multiple participants. You won’t have to worry about participants speaking over one another. If one participant talks quietly, you can raise their volume without affecting anyone else’s. Audio editing The audio quality can make or break your video. Issues like fuzzy audio, background noise, or out-of-sync sound can disrupt the viewing experience, and viewers will be quick to hit next. That’s why you should look for audio editing tools like: Noise reduction where you can remove background noise. Audio normalization to make sure none of your audio is too loud. Sound effects so you can add some character to your videos. Performance and stability YouTube content creation means you’re likely editing several large video files. Before finalizing an editing tool, you should check if the tool offers a smooth performance. Plus, you also need to assess whether your device is compatible with these tools and ticks off all software requirements. Read more: How to Edit YouTube Videos Easily: Complete Beginner Guide 10 Best video editing software for Youtube creators Best YouTube video editor (Overall): Riverside Multitrack editing: Yes Export format: MP4, MP3, WAV, Raw Video (CFR MP4), Aligned Video (CFR MP4) Ideal for: YouTubers who need an all-in-one solution for recording and editing, especially those who conduct interviews or remote collaborations. Pricing: Free plan, paid plans start from $15/month Riverside If you’re looking to speed up video creation without sacrificing quality, then Riverside is your best choice. You can record, stream, and edit all on one platform, making it a YouTube powerhouse. Its text-based editing tools make it really easy to use. In the video editor, you’ll see your recording transcript side-by-side with your video. Anytime you delete text in this transcript, the corresponding video and audio will be automatically deleted. If you’d like to edit in the old style, you can use the editing timeline, which has automatic chapters and is color-coded by speakers. Chapters allow you to section off parts of your video, and the color-coding makes it easy to keep track. You can drag your recording on the timeline to trim or use the splice feature to create and even delete cuts. You won’t be able to make nitty-gritty audio edits. But Riverside’s Magic Audio does a good job of removing background noise and normalizing and smoothing out your audio. You’ll also have tools for dynamic captions and image overlays, plus the ability to add your own logo and background to keep true to your channel branding. Moreover, you can repurpose your long-form YouTube video into Shorts at the tap of a button with the Magic Clips tool. Key features: Up to 4K video: Capture, edit, and export videos in the 4K resolution for a studio-quality output. Text-based editor: Simply add, remove, or adjust the text in the transcript to edit videos effortlessly—like editing a document. Seamless video editing timeline: Color-coded by speaker and automatically arranged into chapters for easy organization. Magic Clips: Turn your videos’ highlights into Shorts at the tap of a button. Show notes: Download an automatic video summary with chapters, titles, descriptions, and even speaker profiles. Audio enhancement: Enhance the audio quality with noise cancellation, and audio normalization. Silence/filler word removal: Automatically remove silence or pauses in the video and cut filler words such as “like” or “umm.” Captions: Add auto-generated captions in multiple styles with fully customizable design options to change the font, color, animation style, and more. AI transcripts: Get 99% accurate transcripts in over 100 languages within seconds. AI layouts: Let AI create your layouts for you based on who’s talking, and then change them as you like What we don't like about Riverside While Riverside is an intuitive platform suited for users of different skill levels, it lacks advanced editing features in other professional-grade editing software. Start recording with Riverside Easily record high-quality podcasts & videos remotely Get Started Best YouTube video editing software for beginners: iMovie Multitrack editing: Yes Export format: MP4, MOV, M4V Ideal for: Beginners and casual video editors looking for a simple, no-cost solution. Pricing: Free iMovie iMovie is a beginner-friendly video editor for iOS users. When you upload a video, the app automatically finds the best clips to create a great output. You can edit this draft by rearranging clips and modifying aspects with trim, split, and merge tools. iMovie’s built-in templates are really useful for beginners. You can choose from 20+ styles to customize your video’s look and feel. You’ll also find 13 filters and visual effects to create slow-motion, speed-up, and picture-in-picture styles. Key features: Storyboarding: Choose from 20 storyboard templates for different niches, such as cooking, vlogging, product reviews, and more. Green-screen effect: Use a virtual green screen with a single click and fine-tune the effect for a believable finish. Cinematic mode: Import videos directly from your phone and adjust the depth-of-field effect to create a cinematic appeal. What we don't like about iMovie iMovie is a lightweight video editing tool. While it works well for basic video editing, it doesn’t offer more advanced capabilities like text-to-speech or color grading. Plus, the tool supports limited file formats. You have to use another tool to convert MP4 files into different formats, such as AVI, WAV, WEBM, and more. Best YouTube video editing software for intermediate users: Adobe Premiere Pro Multitrack editing: Yes Export format: MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV, MXF, MPEG-2, FLV Ideal for: Experienced editors and professionals seeking a robust editing platform. Pricing: Free plan, paid plans start at $22.99/month Adobe Premiere Pro Adobe Premiere Pro is widely used by professionals, but just like DaVinci, it’s better suited for users with some editing experience. As a text-based editor, Premiere Pro lets you edit videos using a transcript. You can trim or arrange clips by adjusting the script. However, you can also use the traditional video editing timeline if that aligns with your skillset. Premiere has typical editing tools for adjusting your video’s colors, adding transitions, and creating animation effects. It also integrates into Adobe Audition for super-fine audio editing. You’ll also find many new AI editing tools in Premiere. For example, you can add or even remove objects in a scene with an AI prompt. But, if you’re just creating talking-head videos, you likely won’t use half the features though. Moreover, Premiere Pro seamlessly integrates with Adobe products and 400+ tools. This can simplify your editing process with other tools. Key features: Motion graphics: Design custom motion graphics or use pre-made templates to add titles and other details. Visual effects: Link assets from Photoshop, remove and replace the background, and choose from dozens of transition effects. Advanced export options: Export your videos directly to social media platforms and change the aspect ratio with AI. What we don't like about Adobe Premiere Pro One of the biggest downsides of Premiere Pro is its costly subscription model. While several video editing software offer feature-packed free plans, Premiere Pro’s $22.99 monthly cost makes it an expensive option. Adding plugins to your video editing setup will increase this cost further. Besides, I’ve found that the platform slows down rendering in low-end systems. Best YouTube video editing software for professionals: DaVinci Resolve Multitrack editing: Yes Export format: MP4, MOV, AVI, MXF, MPEG-4 Ideal for: Creators working with a team of editors and looking to build an efficient editing process. Pricing: Free plan, lifetime license available at $295 DaVinci Resolve DaVinci Resolve is typically used for large projects. Think films, documentaries, and streaming shows. Experienced editors will find its interface easier to use. But if you’re relatively new to editing, you’ll probably face a steep learning curve to get used to all the features and workflows. If you’ve used Adobe Premiere Pro, its video editing timeline will look familiar. You can work with it like you’d expect—trimming, cutting, splitting, and more. DaVinci offers many effects that you can add to your videos. It also gives you great control over your audio. You can clean it up, level it out, or use filters such as reverb and distortion. Key features: Audio Core: Work with up to 2,000 tracks to process and clean up your audio with EQ, reverb, de-esser, and hum removal. Color corrector: Adjust your video’s contrast, mid-tone, grading, and temperature to make it more appealing. Visual effects: 100+ video and film FX effects like lens flair, image restoration, noise, and more. What we don't like about DaVinci Resolve While DaVinci offers many advanced capabilities for pro video editors, its interface can feel too bulky to some users. It might take a few days to get fully acquainted with all the features and get the most out of the platform. You also need to meet heavy system requirements, such as 16 GB of system memory and an Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 CPU. Best YouTube video editing software for Mac: Final Cut Pro X Multitrack editing: Yes Export format: MOV, MP4, MXF, M4V, AVI Ideal for: Mac users and professional editors looking for high performance and efficiency. Pricing: 90-day free trial, lifetime license available at $299.99 Final Cut Pro X Final Cut Pro X is another iOS-based video editor designed for Mac. When editing videos with Final Cut Pro, its superfast interface. The tool can render high-resolution videos in just a few minutes. The app works with Apple’s Magnetic Timeline. This timeline magnetically removes empty spaces between clips and fits them together. Mac users will be familiar with this feature since it’s also available in iMovie. You can add, trim, or remove video and audio clips in different layers. And the editor will automatically fill the space between two clips to keep them together. You can also use the multicam editor to combine and enhance up to 64 camera angles for a video. Key features: Duplicate detection: Identify any video or audio clip repeating in your draft and decide whether to keep it or delete it. Motion graphics: Design 3D graphics for video titles and create high-quality visual effects using the chroma key technique. Compress and encode: Export videos quickly with the built-in encoder and compressor to optimize the file size. What we don't like about Final Cut Pro X Final Cut Pro’s one-time license of $299.99 can be expensive. But considering it’s a once off payment, it can pay off in the long term. The platform also tends to slow down your system. It sometimes can crash when making too many edits. Best YouTube video editor for visual effects: HitFilm Express Multitrack editing: Yes Export format: MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, MKV Ideal for: Creators interested in incorporating visual effects and looking for a cost-effective solution. Pricing: Free plan, paid plans start from $7.99/month HitFilm Express HitFilm Express is one of the best video editing software for YouTube to create Hollywood-style visual effects. Besides all essential editing tools like trim, crop, split, and more, the platform offers customizable presents for color grading and text overlays. You can also leverage keying to clean up your background and add a green-screen effect. Like DaVinci and Premiere Pro, I’d suggest Hitfilm for more advanced video editors. Its large set of complex tools might be overwhelming for someone who’s looking to create basic edits. Key features: Cinematic effects: Create unique visual effects like light leads, 3D glow, color grading, etc. Advanced plugins: Enhance video editing by integrating tools like Brois 3D Objects, Foundry 3D Camera Tracker, and more. Built-in assets: Access a library of royalty-free music, stock footage, and sound effects. What we don't like about HitFilm Express HitFilm Express requires a steeper learning curve than other beginner-friendly video editing software. That’s because you have to navigate its complicated interface and discover hidden features. The platform also offers limited capabilities in the free version, with just five templates and 10 songs. It might not be enough to learn what the platform has to offer. Best free video editing software for YouTube without watermarks OpenShot Multitrack editing: Yes Export format: AVI, FLV, MOV, MP4, MPG, OGG, WEBM, WMV Ideal for: Creators looking for a free video editor with advanced features and watermark-free exports. Pricing: Free OpenShot OpenShot is a free video editing platform for cross-platform usage across Mac, Windows, and Linux devices. What sets it apart from other video editing tools is the ability to add unlimited tracks—video, audio, watermark, and more. Use the drag-and-drop editor to move clips up or down and edit your output. I particularly like OpenShot’s advanced editing timeline. It allows users to conveniently resize clips, zoom in and out, apply preset animations, and more. You can also adjust the frame rate for every clip in your video by using the arrow keys on your keyboard to go frame by frame. Plus, you can export videos for free without any brand watermark. Since OpenShot is an open-source software, it doesn’t add any watermark to your content. Key features: Time mapping: Adjust the speed of your video and reverse the direction of any movement with keyframe animation. Audio mixing: Split, trim, and adjust your audio clips with a waveform-based editor. Animation framework: Create titles and graphics in 3D animation effects to make your content more engaging. What we don't like about OpenShot OpenShot’s interface wasn’t as intuitive and clean as most other video editing tools for YouTube. The tool is also prone to performance issues and can crash or slow down your system. VSDC Multitrack editing: Yes Export format: AVI, MP4, MKV, MPG, WMV, FLV, MOV, RM, SWF Ideal for: Beginners who don’t have high-performance devices for video editing. Pricing: Free plan, paid plans start from $19.99/year VSDC VSDC is another great video editing software that works with minimal system requirements—making it ideal for beginner YouTubers. VSDC is one of the best video editing tools for watermark-free exports. Its non-linear video editor allows you to blend several layers of audio and video clips together. This feature makes it easy to create a picture-in-picture effect or display your clips in a split-screen style. VSDC also supports exports in all video/audio and codec formats. And you can create “export profiles” for different devices and export content anywhere based on your needs. Key features: Record voiceovers: Add and edit your voiceovers to deliver a clear and crisp audio experience. Video stabilization: Stabilize shaky or jittering footage to create a professional look with your clips. Motion tracking: Create overlays or add text or images and map these elements to any object’s movements for animation. What we don't like about VSDC One of VSDC's biggest shortcomings is that it doesn’t offer a full-screen preview of the draft. That means you can’t see a full preview of the edited versions of your video unless you download them. I also found that adding transitions wasn’t seamless and required some trial and error to get the right effect. Best video editing apps for YouTube on iOS & Android CapCut Multitrack editing: Yes Export format: MP4, MOV, GIF Ideal for: Social media content creators with beginner or intermediate-level editing skills. Pricing: Free plan, paid plans start from $7.99/month CapCut CapCut is a user-friendly video editing app for users of all skill levels. You get basic features like trimming, splitting, and merging clips. But you’ll also find an array of video effects templates ideal for social media content. For example, you can adjust speed, add zoom-in animation, or create warp effects. The auto-captions are quite easy to use and you can choose from an array of dynamic effects. Overall, if you’re using the CapCut app, this is a great choice for YouTube Shorts. If you’re creating longer, landscape YouTube videos, it’s better to use the desktop version. Besides, exporting videos in custom resolution up to 4K 60fps makes CapCut a great option for content creators. Key features: Text-to-speech: Create voiceovers in different languages with a script. Filters and effects: Use movie-style filters and unique effects like AI animation, 3D, and glitches to jazz up your videos. Multitrack editor: Edit, place, and adjust different video and audio clips in a multitrack timeline editor. What we don't like about CapCut CapCut is a beginner-friendly tool. That’s why you’ll find limited features for more sophisticated editing, like color grading, keystroke animations, and audio adjustments. The tool also supports limited formats for exporting videos. You have to convert files into your desired format using a different tool. Premiere Rush Multitrack editing: Yes Export format: MP4, MOV, GIF, MXF Ideal for: Intermediate users looking to export and publish videos seamlessly on YouTube and other platforms. Pricing: Free Premiere Rush Premiere Rush is a part of Adobe’s editing suite and works like the compact version of Premiere Pro. You’ll find several in-app assets to edit your content, such as transition styles, animated title overlays, pan-and-zoom effects, and more. This platform easily integrates with other Adobe tools like Photoshop Express. You can use the mobile app to edit YouTube Shorts and work on the desktop version to enhance long-form videos. Plus, you can edit and export as many videos as you want with the app’s free version. Key features: Audio editing: Record your own voiceover, import a file, and clean up the audio track for high-quality sound. Color correction: Manually adjust and enhance the colors in your video or use presets to improve the aesthetics. Versatile export: Export and publish videos directly to any social media platform in your chosen aspect ratio. What we don't like about Premiere Rush Premiere Rush’s features are noticeably limited compared to other video editing software. For example, you won’t find capabilities like freeze frame, green screen, or auto-captions. The platform also lacks presets and templates to make YouTube video editing effortless for beginners.

Best practices for editing YouTube videos like a pro Choosing the right video editing software is just one part of the puzzle. You need to strategically plan your editing process to create a winning video. Here are a few best practices that will come in handy for editing videos for your YouTube channel: Storyboard your video Not able to bring your creative vision to life in your videos? You need a good storyboard to visualize exactly what the output should look like. This storyboard will help you plan different shots, organize all the footage, and edit the draft to produce a great video. Creatively use visual effects You can grab viewers’ attention with an intriguing hook in the first few seconds. But how do you retain their attention? With engaging visual effects. Keep your audience hooked till the end by using pattern interrupt, transitions, text/image overlays, and more effects. Use royalty-free music Remember that YouTube checks every video for copyright violations. That means, you can’t use somebody else’s music/audio without a license. As a best practice, you should use high-quality royalty-free music to make your video memorable. Optimize for YouTube SEO Want to make your content discoverable and maximize your reach? Follow the rules of YouTube SEO in every video. Add a primary keyword to the video’s title, description, file name, and hashtags. And add a catchy thumbnail to stand out from other results and get more clicks. Level up your YouTube content creation game You spend days and weeks creating new content for your YouTube channel. But there’s no tangible growth in subscribers and viewer engagement is shrinking. A good video editing software can be your silver bullet. With the right software, you can conveniently edit and enhance your videos. As a result, your audience will be more keen to watch your content till the end and come back for more. Looking to get started with a free video editing software for YouTube? Sign up for Riverside to turn your raw footage into a studio-quality video. FAQs on YouTube Video Editing Software Does YouTube have a free video editor? YouTube offers a built-in video editor in YouTube Studio. But some people don’t particularly like the interface and the tools available. If you prefer a more robust video editor, then you’d be better off choosing something from our list. What video editing software do professional YouTubers use? It’s hard to say what every professional YouTuber uses. But, many use more advanced video editing software like DaVinci Resolve and Adobe Premiere Pro. It also depends on what video the creators share. For example, if you’re a travel vlogger then you may need more editing controls to create a captivating video. If you’re just creating remotely recorded talking head videos such as podcasts, then you may be better off with an easier editor such as Riverside. Why should you use video editing software for your YouTube videos? Good editing can make your YouTube videos more engaging for the audience. Good video editing software can help you enhance the visual appeal with color grading, text overlays, and transition effects. You’ll also want to use software for captions, which can help increase your videos’ accessibility and reach. This all keeps your content captivating and ensures viewers watch longer, which will boost your content in the algorithm.

Stephen Robles Video & Podcast Creator Last Updated: January 3, 2025 15 min Reviewed by Ortal Hadad by Stephen Robles . 15 min read LinkedinTwitterFacebookEmail LinkCopy Link Table of contents: What equipment do you need for video editing? Video editing equipment recommendations for every level & budget Computers Monitors Hard-drives Video editing software Keyboards Headphones & speakers Chairs Tips on making the most of your video editing equipment FAQs on Video Editing Equipment Key takeaways: Video editing setups don’t need to be extensive or expensive: You can achieve great results even with basic equipment. Core video editing equipment: You’ll need a computer, hard drive space, video editing software, and headphones or speakers. Important things to consider when designing your video editing workspace: Usability, budget, design, and available features. Editing videos professionally doesn’t require a massive budget or complex setups. But it’s vital to equip yourself with at least the essential editing equipment and software to get started. After creating hundreds of videos for Riverside and my own YouTube channel, here’s what to know. I’ll cover the gear you absolutely need, give you some pointers on how to choose it, and provide some of my favorite options in each category. Let’s go! What equipment do you need for video editing? Your requirements may vary depending on whether you’re a beginner or an experienced professional. But here’s some gear to consider: Computers Video editing can be resource-intensive. Look for a computer with at least: 6 processing cores for high-definition video and 8 or more cores for 4K editing 16GB of RAM (32GB for 4K editing) Higher-end graphics processing unit (GPU) with reliable video memory (aim for a Video RAM of 6GB or more for 4K). Hard drive or cloud storage One of the biggest mistakes beginners make is they work directly off their computer's internal drive. “Your computer is just the machine that powers the work, your storage should be a whole separate thing. Editing massive video files, especially 4K or 8K, eats up space fast, and if you’re using your computer’s drive, it’ll slow everything down. Plus, you’re risking losing everything if something crashes.” - Bridget O'Rourke, Video Creator Instead, I suggest you always work off an external hard drive or even the cloud. Storage drives For hard drives, go for SSDs —they’re faster and more reliable than traditional HDDs. An SSD (Solid-State Drive) uses flash memory, making it faster, more durable, and better suited for quick data access. For video editing software, this means faster loading times. In contrast, an HDD (Hard Disk Drive) relies on spinning magnetic disks. It offers larger storage capacities at a lower cost but slower performance. An HDD can be used in addition to an SSD to store larger video files. A setup with 512GB SSD and a 1TB HDD is a standard configuration for video editors. Cloud storage If you work collaboratively or across multiple devices, cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox let you access your files from anywhere and back them up. Recording and editing with Riverside happens online, making accessing your work easy from anywhere. Monitor A monitor with at least Full HD (1920x1080) resolution is ideal, though a 4K display is preferable for editing high-resolution footage. Ensure the monitor also covers a wide color gamut. A color gamut is the range of colors on displays. A wider gamut means more vibrant and accurate colors, essential for precise video editing. While sRGB is standard for general use and web content, DCI-P3, with its richer and more vibrant colors, is ideal for video editing. Adobe RGB excels at reproducing greens and blues and is suited for tasks like photography and printing. Keyboard A specifically designed video-editing keyboard can help you edit your work more quickly and easily. Its shortcut keys can speed up your workflow, and its special design can improve your comfort levels when you’re recording. Graphics card A graphics card is the key to a seamless editing workflow. Your choice of graphics card can impact your export, playback, editing speed, and preview quality. For HD video editing, a mid-range pick will do. If you’re editing in 4K, go for the best you can find. Headphones or Speakers Getting accurate audio during your editing sessions is critical to achieving the right mix and ensuring everything is aligned properly. A solid pair of editing headphones can make a huge difference here. Look for comfort and durability first. You can base the rest of your selection on your specific needs. Generally speaking, professionals should opt for studio speakers for the most accurate audio. That said, headphones are best for detailed editing. I recommend using headphones for editing and speakers for playback. Video editing software Your choice of video editing software will ultimately affect your ability to properly put together and polish your footage. Look for software compatible with your system that includes the features you need and has an interface that's easy to use. An editing chair A comfortable and supportive editing chair is essential if you work long hours editing videos. Look for an ergonomic design, comfort, and the ability to customize the settings to fit your body. Video Editing Equipment Recommendations for Every Level & Budget When it comes to video editing, having the right gear can make all the difference in your workflow and final product. From powerful computers to color-accurate monitors and essential peripherals, the right equipment ensures speed, precision, and creative flexibility. Here are my top recommendations to help you build a setup that meets your video editing needs. Computers Your computer is the heart of your editing setup. You’ll want to ensure your PC is compatible with the video editing software you use. However, if you’re using Riverside, you don’t need to worry too much about this. Riverside is browser-based and works well on both Mac and PC (there’s also an app just for Mac!). Here are some of my favorite picks for 2025: iMac Price: starts at $1,299 The latest iMac runs on Apple's powerful M4 chip and is an excellent option for both beginners and pros in terms of capability and price. Key features: 24-inch 4.5K Retina display provides excellent resolution (and means you don’t need to invest in a monitor). M4 chip makes it even more efficient at 4K editing than previous models. Sleek and thin design with a range of colors to choose from. Easy to use Compatible with Final Cut Pro X. Things to consider: The base model includes two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports. If you need more connectivity this is something to consider. GPU may result in some lagging during intensive video editing tasks. Microsoft Surface Studio 2+ Price: $4,499.99 The Surface Studio 2+ is perfect for creatives of all descriptions—artists, content creators, and more. If you like working on a tablet, you’ll probably like this display best. Its large display size and touchscreen capabilities make it efficient for working with a video editing timeline. The tilt feature of the display also mimics the ergonomics of a drafting table, making precise edits and navigation more comfortable. It has a digital pen for extra-detailed tasks like scrubbing or keyframe adjustments. Key features: 28-inch touchscreen with 4500 x 3000 resolution. Stylish design Large storage capacity and fast running speed. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 360 GPU to enhance graphics-intensive tasks. Things to consider: High price-point Previous generation core processors and GPU could lead to lower performance compared to competitors. Lacks full-size SD card reader. Read: 7 Best Video Editing PCs for Smooth Graphics Macbook Pro 16-inch ‍Price: Starts at $2,499 Video editors who want the versatility and flexibility of a laptop cannot go wrong with Apple’s MacBook Pro. Like the iMac, the latest versions run on ultra-powerful M4 or M4Pro chips, providing even better performance for video editing. Key features: Portable and sleek design. SD card slot, HDMI port, and 3 USB-C ports. 16-inch Liquid Retina XDR display. M4Pro and M4Max chips include hardware-accelerated H.264 HEVC, ProRes, and ProRes RAW support for enhanced video editing. Things to consider: Though it has a big display, you may also want to invest in an external monitor. The 16-inch model weighs almost 5 pounds, heavier than comparable competitors. Expensive for a laptop. macOS may not support all video editing software options. Razer Blade 16 Price: starts at $1,999.99 The Razer Blade 16 is a gaming laptop at heart, but its high performance makes it well-suited for video editing. Its powerful processor and high-resolution screen allow it to handle complex editing. I also love the crisp visuals on this one. Key features: 16-inch OLED display delivers top-quality visuals for video editing tasks. Runs on an Intel Core i9 processor for high-speed performance. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for crisp, ultra-fast visuals. Versatile port selection, including 1 Thunderbolt, 1 USBC, 3 USB-A, and 1 HDMI 2.1. It also includes an SD card reader. Sleek and portable design. Things to consider: Heavy at 5.4 pounds Higher price point Can get quite hot during extended sessions Read: 9 Best Video Editing Laptops Monitors Look for monitors that offer the color accuracy and resolution needed to bring your creative vision to life. Here are some top options to ensure you see every detail clearly. Asus ProArt PA348CGV Price: $729 The ASUS ProArt is an ultra-wide screen with a frameless design that maximizes screen size. It is an excellent option if you don’t want to compromise on size. Key features: Ultra-wide Pre-calibrated for excellent color accuracy. HDR-10 compatible Things to consider: Price Size (you should check if it would fit in your setup!) Dell UltraSharp U2723QE i Price: $549.99 One of the latest Dell models, the UltraSharp U2723QE, has some great features for video editors. In terms of color accuracy and features, this newest model is a step up from previous models. Key features: Provides a high contrast ratio and very detailed and accurate color reproduction. Functions as a USB-C hub, with multiple ports to streamline connections for peripherals and devices. Sits on a highly adjustable stand that can tilt, swivel, and pivot. Things to consider: HDR content may not appear as vivid or dynamic as on monitors with higher brightness and more advanced local dimming capabilities. Hard-drives Fast and reliable storage is the backbone of any video editing setup, helping you handle large files and projects with ease. While SDDs are typically recommended because of their faster data access and durability, HDDs are still a good choice for creators on a budget. We’ll take a look at both, starting with HDDs. Seagate BarraCuda 2.5” Hard Drive Price: $225.99 for 5TB The Seagate BarraCuda 2.5” Hard Disk is a reliable hard drive, perfect for editors with a mid-range budget. Toshiba Canvio Price: $69.82 for 2TB The Toshiba Canvio is another reliable budget external hard drive. You’ll only get 2TB of storage at this price, but this might be enough if you’re just starting out. One thing to note, though; You'll need to reformat it to use it with a Mac. SanDisk Extreme Pro SSD - 2TB Price: $219.99 The SanDisk SDD is a fast-performing, durable hard drive that lives up to its price tag. It is protected from drops of up to 2 meters and is dust—and water-resistant. However, some design-conscious creators may not like its rubbery coating and orange trim. Samsung 870 EVO Price: Starts at $179.99 The Samsung 870 EVO is another great SSD SSD choice. This new model is available in capacities up to 4TB, providing flexibility for various storage needs. It’s also known for its excellent speed and reliability. Video Editing software The right video editing software is your ultimate creative tool, providing the features and flexibility to transform raw footage into a polished masterpiece.

Logitech Craft Price: $259.99 The Logitech Craft is a wireless keyboard designed by creative professionals. Its most unique feature is the “Crown,” a touch-sensitive input dial that adapts to the application in use. For instance, in Adobe Premiere Pro, the Crown allows for intuitive timeline navigation, enhancing the editing workflow. Apple Magic Keyboard Price: $99.00 The Apple Magic keyboard is an obvious choice for Apple fans. Its signature Apple feel and design make it a perfect complement to an Apple-oriented setup. LogicKeyboard Astra for Adobe Premiere Pro Price: $149.00 This keyboard is designed specifically for Adobe Premiere Pro.

Black Magic DaVinci Resolve Speed Editor Price: $395.00 If you’re happy with your current keyboard but want to streamline your workflow with intuitive keys and dials, then the DaVinci Resolve Speed Editor is a strong choice. Its compact design means it’ll fit even the coziest setups, and the search dial and quick-shortcut buttons help speed up your editing in no time. That being said, this small but powerful keyboard does come with a hefty price tag, so it won’t be as suitable for smaller budgets. ‍ Headphones & Speakers Clear and accurate audio playback is critical for editing soundtracks and fine-tuning your videos.

Beginner-friendly video editing software is now freely available for Mac users, letting you quickly splice together different video files, switch out audio tracks, add special effects, and more. Choosing the best free video editor for Mac can be tricky, especially with so many features to consider. Whether you’re a keen amateur or a seasoned professional, these free video editors will help you make the changes you want to create the video you need. Software Best for (beginners, professionals, etc) Completely free/ free trial Rating on a 10-point scale Apple iMovie Beginners Completely free 6 Movavi Video Editor for Mac Beginners and professionals Free trial 10 Lightworks Professionals Completely free 8 DaVinci Resolve Professionals Completely free 7 Blender Professionals Completely free 4 At Movavi, we’re committed to providing you with verified information only.

Best free video editors for Mac It can be difficult to find the best, easy to use video editors on the market. To help you, here are some of the best video editors available for Mac OS X today. Apple iMovie For absolute beginners It’d be odd to start a list of free video editors for Mac users without mentioning the freely available Apple iMovie first. Pre-installed on every Mac, this free-to-use video editor is the go-to for most beginners, allowing you to edit videos up to 4K in quality. It isn’t a professional editor like Final Cut Pro, but it does offer many professional-grade features, including the ability to add special effects to your videos. Basic editing is easy, with the ability to create smaller clips, splice together video and audio tracks, import videos from your iPhone or iPad directly, and more. If you want to carry on editing on the move, you can easily switch to iMovie on iPhone or iPad, with seamless project sharing using AirDrop or iCloud. Some of the advanced features (such as the special effects) are pretty limited, however, especially when you compare it to DaVinci Resolve or Movavi Video Editor for Mac. iMovie is perfect for beginners who want to get stuck in and learn the basics, but if you’re thinking about turning pro, you’ll probably need to look at alternatives to get the full scope of features you’ll need. Pros: Supports 4K video editing Seamless video editing across Apple devices (including iPhones) Beginner friendly Cons: Limited number of special effects and features Reduced number of editing tracks compared to Final Cut Pro Movavi Video Editor for Mac For amateurs and professionals Download for Free Download for Free If you’re looking for a free video editor that includes professional level features but without a huge price tag, consider Movavi’s own Mac Movavi Video Editor. Free to try for 7 days, Movavi Video Editor for Mac is a transformative editor that can be adapted to suit your particular editing requirements. Looking to create basic videos for Instagram? Drop the video into the timeline and add a few pre-made special effects and ready-to-insert intros. Looking to create complex, well-made movies? Take your time building up your video with multiple video clips, audio tracks, visual effects, and more. Casual snappers will find that features like video stabilization, transitions, and chroma keying help to quickly create complex videos from the source content. Pros, meanwhile, will love the built-in ability to record voiceovers during editing or add a picture-in-picture commentary using a camera, as well as import additional effects from Movavi’s own effects store. With a simple, drag-and-drop visual interface, beginners are going to love how easy it is to create the videos they want in Movavi Video Editor for Mac. Once the trial period is over, you can upgrade to the full version for a one-off cost of $59.95. Pros: Easy to use interface Many special effects, with additional effects available from the Movavi Store Built-in camera and microphone capture for voiceovers Cons: No Look Up Table (LUT) support Lightworks Best for special effects There’s a reason the Emmy award-winning Lightworks is considered a top-tier video editor by professionals – it’s been used to edit movie classics, from Pulp Fiction to The Wolf of Wall Street. Mac users can take advantage of many of the features it has to offer for free, with some file output options and special effects missing. Lightworks’ interface follows the industry standard, with an easy-to-use timeline allowing you to manipulate multiple video and audio tracks. With a vast collection of tutorial videos and free-to-use music and video clips, you’re free to let your creative juices flow, although Lightworks’ free version is limited to web-friendly 108p output. It also supports speed enhancements over other editors, allowing you to quickly import, render, and export videos in the background as you continue to work on files using the power of your graphics card or chipset. If you want to take things even further, you can add enhanced special effects using add-on plugins like Boris FX. Lightworks is also a great option for team video editing, unlike many of the other options listed, with options to grant view or edit access over project files to other users, as well as supporting hardware video editing equipment out-of-the-box. There’s no doubt that Lightworks is a great video editor for professionals, but if you’re a beginner, or if you want to output your videos in a high-quality format, you’ll be better served by other options unless you decide to pay for an upgrade. Pros: Award-winning video editor Large library of effects and features Support for GPU rendering Cons: Lots of limitations for free users Not beginner friendly DaVinci Resolve For professionals Another award-winning video editor, DaVinci Resolve is perfect for professionals looking to branch out, with none of the limitations on file output that Lightworks and other editors include for free users. It supports 8K video, offers Hollywood-grade special effects, and more – totally for free. Each new release of DaVinci Resolve brings a whole level of new features and improvements to make it more competitive, from AI touch ups to enhanced audio editing. With HDR support, you can bring out the color in your video tracks, with the ability to tweak and adjust levels accordingly. It’s also a fast and easy-to-use tool for basic video editing, letting you quickly cut up and correct videos using multiple video and audio tracks. You can add transitions, effects and more to your content, as well as use a speedy automatic trimming tool to quickly remove parts of a video you don’t like. There are friendlier video editors for Mac users out there, but if you’re after a professional tool that can create video suitable for broadcast (online or on TV) without an upfront cost, DaVinci Resolve could be the one for you. Pros: Award-winning video editor Huge number of features and special effects Supports 8K video editing Cons: Not the easiest video editor to master OpenShot For open source supporters Those who support the open source community will love OpenShot Video Editor, a completely free and open source video editing tool for Mac. It also supports other operating systems like Windows and Linux. OpenShot aims to be simple to pick up and use, with a simple interface that allows you to insert different media (such as photos and video clips) and merge them together. It supports basic video editing, with the ability to cut up and trim your clips, but also includes animations, slow motion effects, unlimited layers, and more. If you’re looking to make your videos stand out, you can even add 3D animations to your video project, with preset effects such as lens flares or special 3D text. It isn’t as advanced as a tool like DaVinci Resolve, but OpenShot offers a number of advanced features you wouldn’t normally expect to see in a completely free editor. OpenShot also supports over 70 different languages, thanks to the efforts of translators and supporters. With no price to pay, and support for almost every type of video, OpenShot is a worthy choice for beginners, but professionals may need to look elsewhere for a full range of features. Pros: Completely free to use Some special effect features Support for 70+ different languages Cons: Not the fastest video editor HitFilm Express For amateurs turning professional Almost all of the top video editors on this list offer some kind of special effects, but they’re usually quite basic. That isn’t the case with HitFilm Express, a free-to-use video editing tool for Mac users which bridges the gap between amateur and professional video editing with over 400 special effects to choose from. At its core, however, HitFilm Express is just like any other good video editor on the market, with a customizable interface and easy-to-use features that let you cut up, combine, and create new video projects. It also offers numerous animations, enhancements, and built-in audio editing to help you create the best possible videos. You can even create niche-style videos with HitFilm, turning photos into 3D-style scenes with 3D camera projection, or creating commentary-style videos with picture-in-picture inserts. Special effects are its biggest advantage, however, with the ability to create, insert, and render 3D models and animations directly. It’s also handy that HitFilm Express supports all major video files and high-quality video formats up to 4K. With a free download available, HitFilm Express can help you create visual effects unlike any other. With a steep learning curve, however, beginners may want to stick to the preset effects that other editors have to offer. Pros: Impressive number of VFX features Support for 3D-modeling and rendering Supports up to 4K video Cons: Difficult to master Avidemux For basic video editing Rather than trying to appeal to professionals, the free and open source Avidemux focuses on the other end of the market with basic video editing. It doesn’t offer lens flare effects or 3D animations, but instead focuses on the core tools and features that other editors take for granted. While it supports all major video formats, Avidemux is a tool for basic editing, allowing you to convert videos to other formats, add subtitles to videos, trim and edit videos and change the audio track. As it’s completely free to use, Avidemux also adds no watermarks to videos you edit or create. While features are limited, you can expand its functionality somewhat. With Javascript support, you can create your own custom scripts to automate tasks. You can also create your own plugins, but this requires more advanced coding skills. Avidemux may seem a little dated compared to more modern video editors, but it’s also a simple editor that isn’t trying to offer thousands of features. If basic video editing is all you need, Avidemux might be suitable, but there are certainly better performing (and better looking) alternatives out there. Pros: Good and basic video editor Cons: Outdated layout Few features Blender For free 3D modeling Blender, with its rich history in 3D modeling, might seem like an odd choice for a video editing shortlist, but it’s actually one of the best video editors for Mac, especially if you’re looking to create complex, 3D-rendered videos. At a basic level, Blender offers standard video editing with a number of advanced features, such as chroma keying, audio editing, transitions, slow motion effects, and more. It allows you to combine a number of different videos, images, and effects together, with a built-in previewing tool to test out any changes. Blender, however, offers far more than just video editing. Once you master its functionality, you can create 3D-modeled scenes that can bring your imagination to life. You can create realistic character animations, convert 2D drawings to 3D, add realistic world effects like rain and fire, and more. It even supports motion tracking, allowing you to reconstruct real areas in 3D. The skys the limit, with new features added with each release. Available entirely for free, Blender is a 3D modelers dream, but if you lack the skills, you’ll be downloading alternatives pretty quickly. Pros: Perfect for 3D modeling Lots of effects and features Cons: Very high learning curve Not beginner friendly Kdenlive For cross-platform users As a product created for Linux users, it might be surprising to see Kdenlive on a shortlist for Mac users. Thanks to cross-platform functionality, however, Kdenlive is a perfectly suitable video editor for Mac users to consider, especially if you’re looking for software you can use on multiple operating systems. With nearly twenty years of constant development, the open source Kdenlive supports all major, modern audio and video formats. It allows you to edit and combine multiple video and audio tracks at once, letting you lock in or hide certain tracks to test your changes. Kdenlive’s interface is built for ease-of-use, but if you don’t like it, you can customize it to suit your screen size and preferences. Along with basic effects like 2D text and color gradients, you can also insert some special effects and filters, but these are quite limited, especially compared to more professional editors. Built for everyone, Kdenlive is a good (but not great) Mac video editor. To get the latest version, you’ll also need to download and compile the source code yourself, which may limit new users to only the most enthusiastic of supporters. Pros: Easy to use Supports all major video and audio formats Cons: Users have to compile from source code Fairly basic features Jahshaka For virtual reality world building With virtual reality content becoming mainstream, Mac users need a VR-friendly world creator to sink their teeth into. That’s where Jahshaka comes in, allowing you to create rich, 3D environments that your viewers can experience with the right VR headsets. It has a number of preset special effects and animations, allowing you to insert your own textures and shapes into the interactive worlds you create, with the ability to export these as videos to view. As far as standard video editing is concerned, however, Jahshaka isn’t really the software to use anymore. Jahshaka version 2 is the last release of Jahshaka as a more traditional video editing tool, allowing you to edit and combine video clips with some 3D-modeling and special effects. While Jahshaka v2 is still available for download, it’s no longer supported by the developers. If you’re curious about creating interactive VR environments, the new Jahshaka is a great option, but as it’s no longer a traditional video editor, you’ll need to switch to an alternative like Movavi Video Editor for Mac if you’re after a true Mac video editor. Pros: Great for virtual reality environments Cons: Standard video editor deprecated and no longer supported Each of the editors on this list are high-quality, powerful options for creating and editing simple and complex videos.

Here’s an eye-opening statistic for you: According to Aberdeen, businesses that use video grow revenue 49% faster year-over-year than businesses that don’t. Still not convinced? Here’s a SlideShare presentation with more stats that illustrate the importance of video. Of course, even if you are completely sold on the idea of incorporating video into your business’s marketing program, there’s still the issue of actually creating the videos. And in order to do that, you’re going to need some video editing software. If you have a PC that’s running Microsoft Windows, or an iMac/Macbook, there’s a good chance you already have video editing software installed on your computer. For Windows, that’s Windows Movie Maker, and for Macs, it’s iMovie. However, depending on your particular skill set and/or what it is you’re trying to accomplish with your videos, you may find that the above options are either too complicated or not packed with enough features. The good news: There are several free video editing solutions you can download that run the gamut from super simple to Hollywood-level powerful. 7 of the Best Pieces of Free Video Editing Software 1) Machete Video Editor Lite (Windows) (Source: Softonic) At the simple end of the spectrum is Machete Video Editor Lite, which allows you to cut, copy, and paste different sections of video. As the Machete website puts it, Video Editor Lite was “designed for quick and simple ‘slicing’ of your video files.” The program’s intuitive interface means you won’t have to waste time shuffling through technical support documents. And because Video Editor Lite doesn’t re-encode your video files when you slice them, you don’t have to worry about losing video quality. The main downsides to the program? It only supports the AVI and WMV video formats, and it doesn’t allow for audio editing. Still, if you have zero video editing experience and only need to make simple edits, it’s a great option. 2) Avidemux (Windows/Mac/Linux) (Source: Softonic) Like Machete Video Editor Lite, Avidemux allows you to do basic video editing (no audio editing) without having to worry about loss of video quality. But Avidemux also has a few more tricks up its sleeve. For starters, the program supports multiple video formats, including AVI, DVD, MPEG, QuickTime, and MP4. What’s more, Avidemux comes with several filters that allow you to perform a host of different functions, from flipping and rotating clips, to adding subtitles, to adjusting colors and brightness levels. And while the learning curve for Avidemux is slightly steeper compared to Machete Video Editor Lite, the upside is that there’s an extensive Avidemux wiki that covers everything you need to know. 3) WeVideo (Cloud-based) (Source: WeVideo) Cloud-based video editing software (i.e., software that you access via a browser instead of downloading directly to your hard drive) is growing more and more popular. And one of the programs leading the charge is WeVideo. Compared to the first two programs on this list, WeVideo definitely offers some more advanced features and functionality, including audio editing capabilities and a library of commercially licensed music. However, the free version of WeVideo isn’t without its limitations. One major downside is that you’re only given 5GB of cloud storage. If you’re making a one-off video, this is fine. But if you’re planning to edit multiple videos you’ll definitely need more space. The free version also puts a WeVideo watermark on your videos, which isn’t ideal. For a complete breakdown of the differences between WeVideo’s free and paid options, check out their pricing page. 4) VSDC Free Video Editor (Windows) (Source: Softonic) In experienced hands, the VSDC Free Video Editor can produce some seriously professional-looking video. In addition to supporting nearly every major video format, the program offers advanced video effects, including object transformation and color correction, as well as advanced audio effects like volume correction and sound normalization. And unlike WeVideo, the VSDC Free Video Editor is truly free. You can use the program’s full feature set without having to deal with pesky watermarks. But unfortunately, there is one catch. If you want technical support, you need to pay. (And because there is a bit of a learning curve, there’s a good chance you’ll need to.) Support for the VSDC Free Video Editor costs $1 for one month, $5 for half a year, and $10 for a full year. 5) Wondershare Filmora (Windows/Mac) (Source: Wondershare) Wondershare Filmora (formerly Wondershare Video Editor) is the perfect option if you want to start out with basic video editing functionality while also having the opportunity to get more advanced as you go. The program’s “Easy Mode” strips away the complexity so you can drag and drop video clips, choose a pre-designed theme, add some music, and produce a finished video in a matter of minutes. Go into “Full Feature Mode,” however, and you’ll be able to do much, much more — from adding transitions, filters, and overlays, to playing video clips in reverse, to using split-screen effects. Sound too good to be true? Welp, you’re right: The free version of Wondershare Filmora adds a watermark to your videos that you can only remove through upgrading to their paid service. 6) Blender (Windows/Mac/Linux) (Source: Blender) The open source program Blender is more than just a video editor: It’s a full-blown 3D animation suite, which allows for modeling, rendering, motion tracking, and more. On the video editing side, there are a ton of features, including transitions, speed control, filters, adjustment layers, and more. There are also 32 slots available for adding video clips, audio clips, images, and effects, which means you can produce some incredibly complex video. For the amateur video editor, all the functionality that’s available can be a bit overwhelming. But if you’re looking to produce truly professional-quality video — without having to deal with watermarks — Blender is a solid option. 7) Lightworks (Windows/Mac/Linux) (Source: ZDNet) Like Blender, Lightworks is definitely on the more advanced (and powerful) end of the video editing software spectrum. In fact, it’s a program that’s been used to edit some well-known and award-winning films, including Pulp Fiction, L.A. Confidential, and The King’s Speech. There are two different licenses you can choose from with Lightworks: “Free” and “Pro.” (The latter of which, as you might have guessed, requires that you pony up some cash.) The main difference between the two licenses is that the Pro version offers more features, including stereoscopic output and advanced project sharing. But the free version is still quite powerful, providing 100+ effects and supporting multicam editing. Too see the complete list of differences between Lightworks Free and Pro, check out their “Compare Versions” page. Know of another great piece of video editing software that’s not on this list?
