      "content": "YouTube Equipment for Beginners: Ultimate Guide for 2022 All Tools Tag Generator Channel Audit Keyword Tool Rank Tracker Tag Extractor Hashtag Generator Title Generator Description Generator Blog sam visunes Account Logout YouTube Equipment for Beginners: Ultimate Guide for 2022 Jun 2, 2021 There’s a reason starting a YouTube channel is one of the most popular ways to make money online. A 2020 report revealed that the most successful YouTuber had earned 29.5 million dollars from his channel. This high earner is Ryan Kaji, now ten years old. Outstanding success on YouTube is possible, and clearly doesn’t require advanced training or certifications. It does, however, require some basic tools to get started and produce high-quality content for your followers. We will break down the basic YouTube setup for beginners and explain everything you need to get started. What Do I Need? It is possible to start with a small setup when you first begin making YouTube content and then add items to your kit as your channel grows. Currently, there are over 31 million YouTube channels. More are being added every day. If your videos are grainy, shaky, or hard to hear, they will likely be buried under all the other content on YouTube. To produce quality videos that stand out from the beginning of your channel, you will need some beginner YouTube equipment. Camera/Camcorder Microphone Lighting Video Editing Software Tripod We’ll cover some of the best options in each category for beginner YouTubers. Smartphones First, a word on using your smartphone exclusively as your beginner YouTube equipment. It can be done, but it is best to have a quality phone that is designed to capture 4K image and video. iPhone filming is a common part of many established YouTubers’ setup, even if they use DSLRs for stationary filming, like Chhavi Agarwal of Mrs. Daaku Studio: “While I have a Sony Alpha 6600 as well, there are so many times I just use iPhone 12 because the setup required is so much lesser. It is quick for me and the quality is the same as my camera. Everything is in 4k.” An iPhone 11 or 12 will be your best choice if you’re planning to use it for filming your YouTube channel. It is a good idea to pair it with a microphone to boost the sound quality, so make sure the microphone you choose is compatible with Bluetooth or your smartphone has a microphone jack. Smartphone Editing Tools If you’re planning on using a high-quality smartphone for YouTube, you might opt to use a video editing software directly from your phone. We’ll cover desktop-based video editing tools below. Adobe is famous for its expansive suite of creative tools and offers an iPhone app called Adobe Premier Rush that lets you easily edit video from a phone or tablet. While subscription costs can be confusing with Adobe, Premier Rush comes included with a Creative Cloud software and is available at a discounted rate for students and educators, so there are ways to get it as an affordable part of your beginner YouTube video editing software. Kinemaster is another good choice with inexpensive monthly and annual subscription options. Even it’s basic model has surprisingly advanced features, like an intuitive action bar. Camera Aside from smartphone filming, you have six basic camera options in your equipment for starting a YouTube Channel: DSLR Mirrorless Camera Compact Camera Camcorder Action Camera Drones Of course, some experienced YouTubers edit together clips filmed on different kinds of cameras, but for a beginner YouTube setup its best to choose one to start with. Some of the key features to look for in the best YouTube camera are: Quality auto-focus Good image stabilization Light-level adjustments Decent battery life 1080p or 4K shooting capability Regardless of which type of camera you choose, it should have these features to make high-quality filming intuitive. DSLR Granted, a DSLR camera for YouTube can take a while to master, but the resultant quality is well worth the investment. Canon offers several DSLRs that are good picks for your YouTube equipment. We recommend the Canon EOS Rebel T6 as the best DSLR camera for beginner YouTubers. The Rebel T6 offers enough AI features that it is possible for a beginner to master, while still offering 1080p quality and the customization that pro videographers love about the DSLR. Different lighting priority settings make it easy for the subject you’re filming to stand out against a background while the built-in microphone does a pretty good job picking up voice recording. Mirrorless As with DSLR’s and compact cameras, the best mirrorless camera for beginner YouTubers will be designed specifically for shooting high-quality video. Our pick is the Sony A6400 for both ease of use and quality video and audio production. The microphone jack is a nice touch that is not included with most other mirrorless models and makes a basic YouTube setup for beginners much easier to achieve. Amira Irfan uses this camera for her seven-figure blog and YouTube channel covering business and legal topics. Irfan shares: “If you plan on travelling, this camera is compact and light…the autofocus is very fast and includes real-time tracking so you can keep an object moving fast in focus.” Overall, the Sony mirrorless is a workhorse that can serve as your primary YouTube camera, especially if you want to keep your overall setup lean and portable. Compact Camera The Sony ZV-1 Camera is specifically designed for content creators and has a nice face priority feature that helps people stand out against the background. The image sensor is much better than on a smartphone. The battery life is decent, though we recommend keeping a charger handy. Camcorder The quality of camcorders varies widely, and if you’re going this route we recommend a quality camcorder that can shoot in 4K, like the Sony FDRAX33 Handycam. Many vloggers prefer it for live streaming because it is lightweight and has superior image stabilization. Action Camera The GoPro brand is practically synonymous with action cameras, and there’s a reason why. Waterproof and ultra-durable, GoPros have captured amazing shots all over the globe. Paul Strobel at eRideHero shared that his GoPro Hero 8 offers the best value for the cost, while offering: “Awesome cinematic footage and smooth motion blur.” If you plan on your YouTube channel being mainly active, outdoor content, then an action camera might be a good choice as your primary filming method. Drones Depending upon your niche, a drone might be a useful filming tool for adventurous settings, like the hiking and mountain biking videos filmed by Chris Emery of Outdoor SoCal: “We use a Mavic Air 2 for our aerial footage. These are amazing drones and have really upped our game for panoramic outdoor shots.” Adding a drone to your YouTube equipment can take your content up a notch over your competitors in similar active niches. Computer A laptop or desktop that can handle video and audio editing is a must in the YouTube equipment for beginners checklist. You will need a large screen and enough RAM to handle your video editing software. You might also need an external hard drive for storing extra video files, as these tend to be bulky. The MacBook Pro and Air have stellar reputations in the design world for their quality image and audio abilities. The Google PixelBook is a strong competitor; it has a sophisticated graphics card that lets it handle video editing with ease. Computer Video Editing Tools Editing is just as important as filming, so a good editing software is a key component of your YouTube equipment. Audacity is a popular audio editing tool, largely because it is free to download. DaVinci Resolve has a pricey, pro-level package but also offers a free version that has a surprising number of features. Adobe Premier Pro and Lightworks are higher end video editing software. With YouTube, though, less is often more. It’s better to keep the frills to a minimum, so MovieMaker might be all you need. Choose a video editor that feels intuitive to you and doesn’t have excessive features you don’t plan to use. Tripod Bryan Streigler of Streigler Photography notes: “Nothing is more distracting than a shaking video. I know that makes me turn it off quicker than almost anything else.” For beginner YouTube equipment, Bryan recommends something like the Joby Gorillapod. With an adjustable mount that can hold either your smartphone or a specialized camera, the Gorillapod has flexible legs that can wrap around a pole or stand for shooting on the go. Joby offers several different Joby packages, which is great for beginners begin you can go for the least expensive model (only around $30!) or opt for a more advanced model designed to hold your DSLR. Some prefer a gimbal stabilizer instead, which is a support that can pivot. This allows greater range of motion for the mounted smartphone or camera. The DJI Osmo Mobile 3 is a highly-ranked gimbal for smartphones, while the Roxant Video Camera Stabilizer Pro can handle most cameras, including DSLRs and GoPros. Even better, it’s relatively lightweight. Gimbal stabilizers are useful if you will be shooting in very active contexts or outdoors. Microphone Chris Allen of Oodle Life, a dog-lovers blog, noted that adding an inexpensive lavalier microphone was the key to taking his YouTube channel up a notch: “Quality sound is *so* important to help create and keep an audience engaged and hopefully subscribed.” Try this one from Purple Panda and make sure your camera has a jack for an external mic! Lights While many a newbie YouTuber has started off with sunlight as their only advantage, relying upon natural light leaves you at the mercy of Mother Nature. Even a simple lighting setup is better than nothing when you’re filming indoors. The Neewer Video Conference Light Kit is a favorite for YouTube recording equipment because it is so easy to use, has everything you need to set up, and comes at a reasonable price point. Simple buttons control brightness levels and easily replaced color filters help cut down on post-production editing time by balancing the color levels during filming. Analytics & Optimization Simply posting your content to YouTube and waiting for viewers to find it is not enough. Optimizing your new YouTube channel can dramatically increase the number of views and your videos’ SERP prominence. TagsYouTube has some useful free tools that will walk you through tags, optimized descriptors, and titles or hashtags. Running a quick channel audit can help you determine whether your efforts are working and how to leverage search terms and hidden tags. Other Things to Think About When Starting your Channel Once you have your equipment and analytic tools assembled, there are a few other things to think about. Naming and Branding This is often the hardest part of starting a YouTube channel. Branding determines the tone and audience of your channel, and your name is the most important part of your branding. YouTube channel names should be: Short Memorable Relevant to your Audience Easy to Spell Branding includes everything from wardrobe to hashtags, such as: Wardrobe Music Special effects Video spotlights Color scheme Vocal tone Humor YouTube offers a useful tutorial on how to customize your channel’s branding. Competitor Research Entire books are written about competitor research, but here are a few things for beginner YouTubers to keep in mind: Analyze your competitors to identify your audience Track which videos are successful or flop Identify gaps in your competitors’ offerings Analyzing your competition will help you determine where you can add value to the existing content. Captioning Providing captions for your YouTube videos makes it easier for Google to index your content and could boost your views as much as 14% within the first two weeks. Captions are a simple addition, but they make a difference. Content Planning and Scheduling Finally, keep your new viewers engaged by regularly posting content. It’s better to create a schedule that you can stick to rather than posting erratically. Many beginner YouTubers post daily in the beginning when they are enthusiastic, and then taper off to a couple of times a month. Posting once a week shows the best return for your time for the vast majority of YouTubers. In some niches, it may be more, while production-heavy channels tend to upload less. It’s best to upload your videos around the same time, each time. 4pm on Fridays or midnight on Tuesdays and Thursdays for example.

Camera & Lenses The most important equipment in your kit is a camera and the right set of lenses. You don’t necessarily need to buy the most expensive camera in the store. In a lot of cases, all you need is a camera that can record in high-quality (1080p). We’ve segregated the best cameras in the market, based on where you are in your YouTube journey. Let’s get down to it. (A) Beginner ($200 – $800) If you’re just starting out with YouTube, a camcorder or webcam are great options. They’re easy-to-set-up, user-friendly, compact, and don’t cost a fortune. These work best for simple videos that don’t require a lot of post-production, like doing live streams, shooting videos from your desk, or creating on-the-go vlogs. I. Camcorders (under $300) Camcorders are portable, automatic, and built for adjustable shooting. Like point and shoot cameras, all you have to do is click the record button to start. One of the biggest drawbacks of these cameras is that they don’t come with manual features and record in 1080p or less, as compared to DSLRs and digital cameras which now record in 4K. However, if you’re just starting out, these will make for the best YouTube equipment for beginners. Check out this holiday film by Thea which was shot on a camcorder. 4 factors to check before you buy a Camcorder: a. Optical zoom range - It must be at least 50x zoom allowing you to record things at a distance. b. Sensor quality - The larger the effective area of the sensor, the better the pixel quality of the image, allowing you to shoot in dim light as well. Your camcorder should have a 22.3mm width, APS-C sensor with a maximum 1.6 crop factor. c. Video resolution - The video resolution quality should be a minimum of 1080p. d. Image stabilization - In-built image stabilization helps reduce the shakiness in the video while it is being recorded. We’ve listed 2 camcorders under $300 for you to start creating videos on YouTube. (i) Panasonic Camcorder HC-V180K ($228) This compact camcorder is a great choice for vloggers and creators who are always on the go. It is extremely handy and comes with a 50-90X optical zoom which allows you to get zoom into a distance subject. You can also use the in-built creative filters like 8mm movie, silent movie, miniature effect, and timelapse effect to create stunning visuals to add to your YouTube video. Here’s a video that’ll show you the kind of footage quality you can get from the Panasonic HC-V180K Camcorder. (ii) Sony – HDRCX405 ($233) The Handycam has been a favourite amongst tourists to record their travel videos. Like the Panasonic camcorder, it also comes with 7 in-built creative effects, AVCHD-MP4 dual recording, face detection, and SteadyShot image stabilization which makes it a great choice to shoot on the go. Watch this video by the fiX files where he has compiled sample footage taken from the Sony HDRCX405 Handycam. II. Webcam ($60 – $210) Webcams on the other hand are the best for shooting videos from your desk – like tutorial videos or live streams. These attach straight to your laptop or desktop and you need to only adjust the focal length and frame for your webcam once. These are easy to set up as the system reads the hardware driver automatically and after that, it is literally plug-and-play. 2 factors you should check before buying a Webcam: a. Output quality and resolution - The minimum output quality and resolution of your webcam should be 1080p. You should also check the frames per second – the higher the fps, the better the quality of the image. Most webcams come with a standard 30fps. b. Auto-focus - Manual focusing on webcams can be very tedious. Always pick up a webcam that has an auto-focus feature and can also detect faces. Here are 2 webcams that will allow you to record your live streams in high definition, under $210. (i) Logitech Brio ($206) The Logitech Brio is one of the first 4K compatible webcams that shoots at 30FPS. It also shoots 1080p at 30/60FPS. It comes with light adjustment and auto-focus which compensates the exposure in different settings, making sure you’re always visible and everything looks perfect. It has a dual-mic setup for great audio and a 90 degree field of view which allows you to have a wide set-up, especially if you plan to record or live stream tutorials. You can use the control panel from the Logitech app to zoom in to a particular frame as well. The control panel also allows you to manage the brightness/contrast, colour intensity, and white balance of the frame. Check out Justin Tse’s experience with the Logitech Brio as he tests out the features and shows you the quality of the footage. (ii) Logitech c920S ($90) The Logitech c920 records in 1080p at 30/60FPS. Like the BRIO, it also has a light correction, auto-focus, and shoots a wide frame. If you are on a budget, you should pick the Logitech c920 which is one of the best webcams for starting a YouTube channel. It also comes with a privacy shutter that protects the lens when you’re not using it. Watch this review by TimmyTechTV to get a sense of the video quality you can get out of the Logitech c920S. III. Cell-phone cameras ($170- $906) If you don’t want to make an investment right away, you can use your cell-phone camera. Most smartphones these days come with at least a 12MP camera which records in 1080p. These make for easy-to-carry equipment and are great for shooting outdoors without restrictions. However, you will have to invest in a gimbal or tripod to shoot stable videos. Smartphones today also come with filters and effects like slow-motion, panorama, and timelapse. We’ve listed budget as well as expensive options for you to make an informed decision. 3 factors to consider if you’re planning to use your phone to shoot Youtube Videos: a. Megapixels - Make sure your mobile camera has a minimum of 13MP to get sharp footage for your YouTube videos. b. Image stability - This feature will stabilize shaky videos and is essential if you plan to shoot your videos handheld. c. Storage - 128GB storage will allow you to use apps and store your footage without memory getting constantly full. d. Low-light compatibility - Your cell-phone should be able to shoot under low-light circumstances so that you don’t need to invest in external lights. We’ve listed below 3 cell-phones – budget, midrange, and expensive, all of which are great for shooting videos. (i) Huawei P30 Lite ($170) Camera specifications: 24MP+8MP+2MP triple rear camera This budget cell-phone comes with Leica lenses and lets you record brighter and wider videos as compared to its competitors in the market. It also comes with image stabilization and you can attach it to a tripod or gimbal for more stable videos. Check out this video by Dave West Media where he puts the Huawei P30 Lite to the ultimate video test. (ii) OnePlus 7T ($399) Camera specifications: 48MP+16MP+12MP triple rear camera The OnePlus7T has an ultrawide camera with a 2x optical zoom. The triple rear cameras give extreme clarity and accurate colour reproduction. Known for its image and recording quality, the OnePlus 7T has an in-built image stabilizer and records videos at 1080p on 30 and 60 frames per second. Watch this super detailed test of the OnePlus 7T’s camera before you make a purchase decision. (iii) Iphone 12 ($906) Camera specifications: 12MP – Wide camera, Telephoto camera, ultra-wide camera One of the best features of the iPhone 12 is the ultra-wide camera that allows more light to seep in, making it a great fit for shooting in low-light conditions. It also records, edits, and plays in Dolby Vision and comes with a 10-bit HDR video recording that delivers 60 times more colour than the regular 8-bit video. If you’re a travel vlogger, you will love the night mode time-lapse video that can record light trails and motion when mounted on a tripod. Watch this video by fStoppers where they compare the iPhone 12 Pro to the Sony A7 RIII, a full-frame mirrorless DSLR camera. Want to know more about how you can shoot amazing YouTube videos just using your phone? Check out this tutorial by Sean Cannell. (B) Intermediate ($350 – $1300) If you’ve been making videos on YouTube for a while now or you love creating videos with post-production effects, you must consider upgrading to a digital camera, DSLR, or an action camera. These cameras allow you to manually put in the settings or choose presets and create your own effects while shooting your videos. Most YouTubers use a DSLR to create their content because it allows them to create high-resolution videos from scratch. The resolution in these cameras is top-notch and will take your videos to the next level with respect to clarity and colour intensity. I. Digital cameras If you’re not someone who is interested in getting into camera settings, digital cameras are for you. These compact cameras are simple to use – literally point and shoot. They come with different presets that allow you to manage the light and colours depending on where you are shooting, and you can also manually input the settings of your choice. Canon and Sony both recently launched cameras specifically suited for vloggers and content creators to be able to shoot ultra high definition videos without learning the technicality behind producing videos. 3 factors you should keep in mind before buying a Digital Camera: a. Resolution/Megapixels - It is essential that your digital camera records at minimum 1080p resolution, however, digital cameras today like the Canon G7x Mark III shoots in 4K. b. Mic input - This is absolutely essential for bloggers since you will need to connect an external mic for better sound quality. c. Lens - All digital cameras come with a fixed lens – so be sure that the optical zoom and lens value work for the kind of videos you want to create. We’ve listed 2 of the best digital cameras in the market for you to choose from. 1. Canon G7X Mark III ($649) Specifically designed for vlogging, Canon’s G7X Mark III is a point and shoot that records videos in ultra high definition 4K. It comes with shooting presets like sports, landscape, scene intelligence, creative, and more to help you make the most of your surroundings. It comes with a 24-100mm fixed lens that takes care of both, wide and close-up shots. The aperture range of 1.8-2.8 allows you to shoot even in dimly lit conditions – making this one a great choice for YouTube camera equipment. You can also live stream using your Canon G7X Mark III by using the EOS Utility Webcam Beta Software or connect it to your system with an HDMI cable. Check out this experiential video by Potato Jet where he talks about what a great fit the Canon G7X Mark III is for vlogging. 2. Sony RX-100 VII ($1298) If you’re a travel vlogger, this has to be the camera you have been looking for. With a fixed lens of 24-200mm you’re free to shoot wide landscapes as well as extremely tight details and portraits. It also comes with a mic input, image stabilization and shoots in 4K ultra-high definition. The autofocus on this digital camera is absolutely unbelievable as it uses Ai based real-time tracking to ensure your subject is always in focus. Like the G7X Mark III, it also comes with a tilting touchscreen that allows you to set the frame for your vlog. Watch this video of Brent Rose testing out the Sony RX-100 VII’s 4K footage. II. DSLRs (under $1300) If you’re passionate about telling visual stories, the DSLR is the perfect equipment for you. With everything in your hands, you can control the settings to great visually stunning effects using depth of field, motion blur, bokeh, and more. There is a lot you can also experiment with interchangeable lenses and create new effects. Most YouTubers who create premium quality content use a DSLR to record it. However, you don’t need to immediately invest in an expensive camera. There are many cameras in the market that are affordable and get the job done. 4 things you should keep in mind before buying a DSLR Camera: a. Sensor and ISO - The sensor and the ISO determine how sensitive your camera is to light and can shoot in dim light settings without breaking into pixels. While the 35mm full-frame sensor is the gold standard, even a crop frame sensor works well. You must, however, check the ISO range of the camera which determines how it performs under low light circumstances. A good sensor will allow an ISO range of at least 25,600. b. FPS - Most DSLRs come with FPS presets. Make sure you choose a DSLR that has a range from 24-60 FPS. c. Auto-focus - The auto-focus feature of your DSLR allows your camera to focus on the subject even when it is in motion. This will make sure you always have sharp footage. d. User-friendly - Not everyone is tech-savvy and understands the nitty-gritty of how a camera works. Choose a DSLR that has most of the settings on the camera body so it is easy to access. Note: If you want to create live streams you may want to rethink a DSLR setup because you will need additional equipment to connect the live feed to the internet – like live streaming software, dual monitors, HDMI cable and adapters, DC coupler, mic, and more. Here are 2 DSLR options for you to choose from: (i) Canon 70D ($1200) The Canon 70D is currently considered as the best equipment for YouTube videos. It comes with 19 cross-type autofocus points which ensure that your subject is always sharp and in focus. With 20.2MP and a dual pixel AF sensor, it allows you to shoot in ultra-high definition, giving you the best image quality at that price. With Bluetooth and WiFi, your camera can easily connect to your smartphone and you can set the frame, start recording, and even manage the settings at your fingertips. Watch this short film by Collin Ausbury which is shot completely using the Canon 70D – to get an idea of the quality and colours you can expect from this camera. (ii) Nikon D7500 ($1099) The Nikon D7500 comes with a 51-point autofocus system that makes sure your subject is always in focus. Like the Canon 70D, it also comes with Bluetooth and WiFi allowing you to use your smartphone to manage settings and set the frame. It also records in ultra high definition (UHD) – 4K. Watch this review by Joshua Roode in which he also shares the footage and his shooting experience with the Nikon D7500 in the outdoors. If you want to know more about recording videos on DSLRs, you should watch this video on the best DSLR settings for video by Think Media. Let’s talk lenses When you purchase a DSLR, one of the most important things to keep in mind is what lenses you need in your kit. Let’s broadly look at the different types of lenses and what they are used for. a. Wide-angle lens ($499 onwards) The most staple lens and a must-have for every kind of YouTuber is a wide-angle lens. You can pick up the favourites, like 18-135mm or the 24-105mm or you can pick up lenses that are more suited to your style. For example, if you’re going to create video content with shots that show interiors, architecture, or massive landscapes, you could also choose an extreme wide-angle lens to make sure you get all of it in the frame, like the 16-50mm lens (essential if you want to shoot architecture and interiors) or the 10-24mm lens (best for shooting landscapes and nature). Watch the video below for a detailed review of the Canon 18-135mm lens and you can also see the output quality that this lens gives you both indoors and outdoors. b. Prime lens ($159 onwards) Prime lenses unlike other lenses have a fixed focal length and maximum aperture, like the 35mm, 50mm, and 85mm. This makes them a great choice for shooting close-up videos, interviews, especially in low or dim light conditions. Owing to their maximum aperture, they can create blur and bokeh effects, allowing you to use these tricks to tell vivid stories. Check out this video by Matti Happoja where he shows you the difference in output from a wide-angle lens – 24mm and a prime lens – 85mm. c. Telephoto lens ($1299 onwards) Telephoto lenses increase the focal length and allow you to shoot subjects that are far away from you. These are great for travel and wildlife videographers who may not be able to go close to their subjects at all times. You can use a medium telephoto lens like the 70-200mm and 100-400mm or even opt for super-telephoto lenses that are longer than 300mm. These lenses are heavy and often need a stand of their own for weight support. Watch this video to understand how telephoto lenses (specifically the 100-400mm) are great for creating videos. d. Macro lens ($499 onwards) If you want to go extremely close to a subject and get in all the details of it – you need a macro lens. These lenses are very popular with videographers who like to capture nature and small wildlife. However, these lenses can create stunning shots for food and fashion where you show your viewers the layers and intricate details of your subject. Watch this 2-minute video where Peter McKinnon will show you why you need to have a macro lens in your kit. e. Creative lenses ($1200 onwards) We’re putting fisheye, tilt-shift, and Lensbaby under creative lenses because of the creative visuals they can create when used for shooting videos. – Fisheye lenses have a focal length of less than 12mm and allows you to view the world with the bulbous eye of a fish. Check out this video by Meike Global – Tilt-shift lenses manipulate optics and perception to create dramatic shots, like this amazing miniature timelapse by Little Big World. – Lensbaby are camera lenses that when combined with a simple lens add special effects to the videography. These lenses are usually used to create selective focus and bokeh effects. Check out this video – a Lensbaby reel. III. Action cameras ($350 onwards) If you want a versatile camera that fits right into your pocket and allows you to shoot ultra high definition 4K videos, an action camera is perfect for you. Action cameras are best suited for YouTubers who want to show their POV or are into travelling and adventure sports. These compact cameras produce 4K videos at 60fps and are waterproof (up to 10 meters). It comes with an in-built image stabilization but you can also additionally purchase its holders, body belts, and stands to give you better stabilization. Unlike the DSLR, you cannot manually integrate all settings. However, these cameras come with their own settings and preset for you to create unique shooting styles. The current market favourite for action cameras is GoPro. These cameras allow you to create gold-standard videos by recording in ultra-high definition. They’re portable, affordable, and easy-to-handle. Their most recent model is the GoPro Hero 9 which is for $400, accessories sold separately. Check out this video in which Peter McKinnon breaks down the features of the GoPro Hero 9 and you can also see its output in terms of stability, colours, and quality. (C) Professional ($1500-$3000) Ready to level up? These cameras are in a league of their own. With the ability to record in ultra high definition on a full-frame sensor, the latest mirrorless cameras are truly a class apart. They share all the features of a DSLR but have a lighter body and better output quality. (i) Canon EOS R ($1600) Canon’s first full frame camera is one of the best choices for YouTube equipment. It comes with an in-camera digital lens optimizer for vivid colours, 5 stops image stabilization for crisp and clear imaging and shoots 4K UHD videos. Canon Log gives a rich gradation output, allowing you to work on the footage in post-production, without hampering the image quality. It also has the fastest autofocus system yet which detects the subject in 0.05 seconds, making sure that every movement recorded is sharp and clear. Watch Team Supertramps’s review of the Canon EOS R where they also share test footage and tell you what made them switch to this mirrorless camera. (ii) Sony Alpha A7 RIV ($2998) This 61MP mirrorless camera by Sony is nothing short of the quality of a medium format camera (which is used to shoot movies). It comes with a mix of fast hybrid and contrasts autofocus systems to ensure that you get the sharpest moving images. It shoots in ultra high definition 4K and with Sony’s BIONZ X processor, you won’t miss out on a single detail. Watch Tutto Digitale’s extensive 4K video test and review of the Sony Alpha A7 RIV before you think of buying this camera. Next, let’s look at external stabilizers to add to your YouTube equipment kit. 2. External stabilizers Everyone likes sharp images and while cameras come with in-built stabilizers, having an external stabilizer ensures smooth movement and sharper videos. Every use-case will need different stabilizers and your choice will depend on where you are shooting and how much movement you need. To help you choose external stabilizers better, we have segregated them based on their use case, so that you can choose the best-suited stabilizer for the kind of videos that you want to shoot. (A) Still-Frame Videos Think interviews, over-the-desk, and tutorial videos – all of these videos have a still frame, in which the subject interacts with the audience. These simple videos are fairly easy to shoot and don’t need high-end video stabilizers. If you plan to shoot these kinds of videos, here’s a list of equipment – both basic and advanced that are great options to shoot still-frame videos. I. BASIC (i) Simple 3-legged tripod A simple tripod is a 3-legged stand that can hold your phone or camera in place while you’re shooting the video. These are great if you have a single frame set-up. All you have to do is fix your camera on the tripod, press the record button and you’re good to go. You will find tripods of different heights, folds, and portability – pick the one that best suits your shooting needs. For example, if you plan on shooting tutorial videos at home, you should buy a simple 5ft tripod with 2 folds. a.

(B) Videos with simple movements If you plan to have simple movements in your video like shooting while walking or following your subject, you will need something more stable and light-weight than a tripod. I. Basic Simple monopod As the name suggests, a monopod has only one leg to support your camera or cell-phone. These are a great fit if you want to walk around the city with your camera or switch between taking handheld and monopod shots. Here’s a review of the Manfrotto Compact Extreme monopod ($20.50) by Think Media and video journalist Juliana Broste. II. Advanced Monopod (under $170) Ready to upgrade your simple monopod?

(C) Videos with complex movements Want to shoot videos with complex movements like in a mysterious chase scene or a complicated long shot? You will need a gimbal or Steadicam to ensure you get smooth camera movement and transitions. You can start off with basic gimbals that can achieve smooth pan, tilt, and follow shots. For complicated shots, you will need advanced gimbals which come with more modes and grip movements or you can upgrade to a vest or Steadicam. I. Basic (i) Phone Gimbala.

Lighting set-up One of the most important pieces of YouTube equipment that can take your videos to the next level is a good lighting set-up. You can choose the lights depending on the type of videos you create. Lighting set-ups change based on where you’re shooting – indoors or outdoors, what you’re shooting – moving or still subject, and what kind of lighting set-up do you want – dramatic, even, or cinematic? Most of the lighting set-ups mentioned below fit in multiple categories, so to make things simpler, we’ll talk about the set-up and then put tags based on where you can use these lights. (A) Ring lights Ring lights have become a popular YouTube equipment for vloggers. They’re portable, super simple to use, and extremely handy lights. The main purpose of this ring light is to illuminate the face, reduce shadows, and minimize blemishes. These can come for as cheap as $20 like this Arkon LED rechargeable LED selfie ring light which clips on your smartphone or camera’s LCD screen and is great for vlogging and live streams. If you’re looking for a bigger ring light for a larger set-up, check this 18” ring light by Prismatic ($140). It comes with an in-built dimmer that allows you to control the intensity of the 240 LED lights in its frame. It comes with a hot shoe so you can mount it on your camera or a light stand. It also comes with a cold-shoe mount which lets you put a compact camera or smartphone set-up within the light to make a quick set-up. Where are you shooting? Ring lights are great for shooting both indoor and outdoor What are you shooting? Usually, ring lights are used for shooting a single, still subject but if you have a portable one like the Arkon LED selfie ring light, you can use it while you’re vlogging on the go. What kind of lighting set-up do you want? Ring lights give you even-toned lighting. It is not good for dramatic or cinematic lighting. Check out this video by Think Media on video lighting tips for your YouTube video using a ring light. (B) LED Lights LED light panels are another great option for YouTube equipment. These are simple to set up bi-color lights which come with a diffuser to soften the light and barn doors that can act as cutters if you want to block the light. Most LED panels will allow you to control the intensity and temperature of the light. If you’re on a budget, go for the Neewer 660 LED Panel ($209) – it comes with the complete setup and variable white balance and colour temperature. On the other hand, if you want to upgrade or are looking for a more professional set up, check out this 900 LED Daylight Panel Kit by Fovitech ($450). Looking for something below $30? Check out this on-camera 176 LED Panel by Neewer ($24.49). It is small, portable, and fits right on top of your camera – making it the perfect YouTube equipment for outdoor shoots. You can also upgrade to continuous LED lights like the Godox SLB60W ($349). You can control the colour temperature and the brightness on this super portable light. However, you must use a softbox to diffuse the intensity of the light to avoid overexposure and deep shadows on the subject. These kinds of lights are great to create a dramatic and cinematic effect. Where are you shooting? LED lights are heavier and so are best for an indoor set-up, especially if you will be using additional diffusers like a softbox. However, you can use the portable on-camera LED lights for outdoor shoots as well. What’re you shooting? You can use LED lights to shoot multiple subjects, however, you will need to dedicate a minimum of one fill light per person or a central light per subject. What kind of lighting set-up do you want? LED lights to give an even tone set-up but you can create dramatic and cinematic looks with LED light panels. Watch Sean Cannell discuss the best video lighting equipment for LED light panels in the video below. (C) Softbox Softbox lights are professional video set-ups like those you would see in television interviews. These usually come with high-intensity lights – like CFL or LED bulbs and a softbox that helps diffuse the light. For even toned lighting, you must have a softbox on either side of the subject to remove any shadows. You can pick up this pocket-friendly option by Fovitec ($176.70) which comes with a 2-1000W studio lighting kit or you can build your own kit by choosing advanced and high-quality continuous lights and softboxes from Godox ($99). Where are you shooting? Softboxes are heavy and can be tedious to set-up. These lights are best for an indoor set-up. What’re you shooting? Softboxes like LED panels can be set up for multiple subjects, however, you will have to have multiple keys and fill lights. What kind of lighting set-up do you want? Depending on how you set-up your softboxes, you can achieve all the 3 – even tone, cinematic, and dramatic lighting. Here’s a review of the Godox Softbox by SMOHJOE14. (D) Stick lights These portable LED lights are extremely handy and make for the best YouTube equipment to shoot outdoors. You can adjust the colour temperature, the intensity of light and in some stick lights, like the Godox LC500R ($239) you can employ the RGB mode to choose from 360 selectable colours for a cinematic effect. It also has a creative music mode which allows light to change its color and brightness on the beat of the music, as it changes. Where are you shooting? Stick lights are great for shooting outdoors – they’re super portable and don’t need to be set-up like softboxes and LED lights. What’re you shooting? Stick lights are great for both still and moving subjects. However, you can only light one subject with a single stick light. What kind of lighting set-up do you want? These lights are best for creating dramatic and cinematic effects. They may not be the best choice if you want even-toned lighting. Check out this detailed review and demonstration by Nemanja Sekulic of the Godox stick light. 4. All things audio The sound in the video makes for half the experience. The quality and richness of the sound play a big role in engaging your audience with the scene. When the audio is not good, you end up skipping the content right away. Think about movies with exceptional background scores like Tenet (2020), Joker (2019), and Interstellar (2014) – the audio equally drives the story of these films. The in-built sound systems in your camera or smartphone don’t record good quality audio. To make sure that you are giving your audience the best sound experience, it is important to invest in sound equipment like microphones, headphones, and sound cards. Most of these audio equipment fits in multiple categories, so to make things simpler, we’ll talk about the different kinds of YouTube recording equipment that are available and their use cases. (A) Microphone One of the first investments you should make for leveling up your audio game on YouTube is a microphone. Many microphones are suitable for recording crisp audio and we’re going to talk about the most popular ones used by YouTubers themselves. I. Shotgun microphone Shotgun microphones or high-directionality microphones are the most sought after choice for audio amongst YouTubers. These cameras easily mount on your cameras and are great for vlogging and interviews – whether you’re shooting indoors or outdoors. It gives you the best quality when it is closest to the subject. One of the drawbacks of these shotgun mics is that the audio quality reduces as the distance between the mic and the subject increases. However, you can mount a shotgun mic on a boom pole and extend the wire to connect it to your camera – allowing you to record quality audio even from a distance. You can even buy a dead cat ($29.95) or fuzzy windjammer ($59) to cut down further on external disturbances. Here is a list of shotgun microphones for you to choose from: a. Best budget shotgun microphone – Takstar SGC-598 Shotgun Mic ($35) Compatible with Canon, Nikon, and Sony cameras. Watch Podcastage’s review of the Takstar SGC-598 Shotgun mic in which he also shares test audios for you to experience the quality of the output. b. Best shotgun mic – Rode Video with Rycote Lyre shock mount ($229) This shotgun mic by Rode comes with a Rycote Lyre shock mounting system that isolates the recorded audio from external factors. Watch Sean Cannell review, test, and compare the RODE VideoMic to help you make a better purchase decision. c. Best studio boom kit If you’re looking for a complete studio boom kit, this one comes with a RODE shotgun microphone, boom stand, wind muff, adapter, and 25” cable for $199. II. Lapels (wired and wireless options) Lapel mics are also a favourite among YouTubers. These small mics easily clip onto your shirt and plugs straight into your cell-phone or camera. These lapels are great if you create videos from your desk and they’re also good for conducting interviews and vlogging. We’ll be looking at both wired and wireless options in lapel mics below. Here’s a list of lapel mics that you can choose from: a. Best budget lapel – Deity V Lav Lavalier Lapel Mic ($49) Watch this video to see how this mic performs in different shoot situations. b. Best wireless lapel – RODE GO compact wireless microphone ($199) This portable and wireless mic are a must-have for content creators on YouTube. Watch Think Media’s review to know why. c.

Sennheiser’s lapel system allows you to set frequencies based on where you’re shooting and allows you to manage any disturbances from external factors. Watch this video for a detailed review and sound test (up to 400 feet). III. USB Microphones If you’re looking to create live streams and screen-sharing tutorial videos, USB microphones make for the best YouTube equipment. These versatile mics directly connect to your system and give a clear audio output. These podcast mics are strictly indoor mics and can’t be used outdoors simply because they have to be connected to a PC system for it to record the audio. We’ve listed top creator picks of USB microphones for you to choose from: a. Blue Snowball mic ($59.95) This versatile mic is great for live streaming and easily connects to your PC or Mac.

Let’s check out some microphone accessories The acoustic treatment maximizes audio quality by normalizing and reducing excessive reverberation, reflection, and resonance. This can be simply done by using foam covers, mufflers, and dead cats on the mic or foam boards in the room you are recording in. Here are options for dead cats, mufflers, and foam boards for you to choose from: a. RODE deluxe windshield dead cat b. Movo WS-69 windscreen muff c. Movo WS-G7 foam and muffler windscreen dead cat d. Zoom WSS-6 foam windscreen e. DEKIRU acoustic foam panels f. BUBOS acoustic foam panels (B) Headphones If you’re a gamer, you definitely need headphones to create screen-share videos but you’ll also need them for editing your YouTube videos to ensure quality audio. While you can make do with the earphones you currently own, we’re listing headphones (which are top choices for YouTubers) for when you decide to upgrade. Two things that you must keep in mind before choosing headphones: (i) Comfort - You need earphones that are comfortable even after using them for a couple of hours. (ii) Sound quality - Check for sound profiles that most suit the kind of sounds you will want to listen to. For example, gamers would love to have bass-heavy headphones. Here are our best-recommended headphones for YouTube creators: a. Audio Technica ATH M50X (wireless Bluetooth) headphones b. Sony MDRXB950BT (wireless Bluetooth) headphones c. Munitio PRO40 (wireless Bluetooth) headphones You can also watch this video where tech and gaming YouTubers spill the beans on what their go-to headphones are. 5. PC The next important piece of gear is your system on which you will be editing your YouTube videos. Whether you want something portable like a laptop or you want to fix up a computer piece by piece according to your needs – we’ve got you covered. Pro tip: If you’re working with a cloud-based video editor like InVideo, you can pretty much work from any system as long as you have an internet connection. Every piece in the chain could make your editing experience better. We’ve listed down the minimum specs that you need for a smooth editing experience on your system and we have also suggested upgrades that you can make depending on the kind of videos you will be editing. While trying to zero down on a PC, you primarily need to look at these 5 key specifications: (A) Processor If you’re going to be editing simple videos, sans external effects – you can start with the Intel i5-6600K, however, if you plan to create videos with created effects that will make for heavy file sizes, the Intel Core i7-4790K and the i7-6700K are standard for HD video editing. All of these are quad-core processors. If you want to upgrade to a better processor and make your editing experience even smoother, especially if you’re working with 4K footage and heavy editing software like After Effects – then you should go for the Intel Xeon E5-1650v3. You can upgrade this further by 2X with the (2x) Intel Xeon E5-2660v3. Both of these are hexacore processors. (B) Multi-drive workflow One of the crucial things while editing a video is speed and a lag-free experience. To do this, you need a multi-drive workflow. While this may not affect HD video editing, it makes a big difference for 4K and keeps your files organized at all times. What do you mean by a multi-drive workflow? A multi-drive workflow in terms of your system is a storage solution that dedicates specific files to separate drives – to increase your system’s speed and also keep it organized. 1. Dedicate a 1 TB SSD to your operating systems and software. So all of your installation, upgrades, and ancillary files for all of your software will be here. 2. Dedicate another 1TB SSD for your data files – these are your project files (which you command your video editing software to save), footage, final files, etc. 3. The third one is a variable and important only if you plan to shoot and edit in 4K. These are an array of external drives that take the payload while you’re editing and can be externally connected to your PC. If you’re just beginning, you can start with a multidrive workflow of one 256GB SSD and two 1TB HDD. You can then upgrade this multidrive workflow to one 500GB SSD and two 2TB HDDs. Ready to upgrade to a professional 4K setup? You must then invest in one 1TB SSD and two 4TB HDDs. (C) RAM While your RAM does not affect video editing as much, it is crucial for the functioning of ancillary software like After Effects and Cinema 4D. The RAM is where your working files are stored while you’re working on projects, and so having a lot of RAM can support motion graphics editing and makes it easier to integrate these files in your video project. You must have a minimum of 16GB RAM but if you can go higher than that, it’s even better. (D) Display When we talk about the display of your monitor or laptop – we are looking at its resolution. If you plan to edit 4K videos – your PC display should have a full 4K screen which comes with a 3840×2160 pixel resolution. If you’re only creating HD resolution videos, you can choose an HD screen because you don’t necessarily need a 4K display. Another crucial thing you want to check for when choosing your monitor is IPS which tells you the colour accuracy. As a visual creator, you want your monitor to be colour accurate so that you see the colours right and make your edits based on it. Otherwise, you’ll see the difference in colour tones when you render the project and view it on another screen. (E) Graphics card As a visual creator, the graphics card (also known as a video card) is one of the most important things you need to be looking at before choosing a PC. Previously, most of the heavy lifting of video editing was done by the processor but these days, graphic cards take on most of the load, making it faster and smoother to edit on software like Premiere Pro and After Effects. Graphics cards speed up editing and rendering and will enhance video editing performance. You must look for NVIDIA Graphics Card and along with that, you should also check for CUDA cores. These graphics cards give a solid performance that also supports hardware acceleration – resulting in a high-performance video editing PC. (F) USB Ports It is important to check for how many USB 3.0 ports you have. This is important for video creators because you want to transfer your footage and data faster to your PC. The latest USB versions allow you to do it with Superspeed+ at 20Gbits/second. So when you pick out your PC, ensure that you have the latest USB port connectors to support all of your external systems and will work without compromising on speed. USB 4.0 is the latest version which was released in 2019 and reads at 40Gbit/second and comes with Superspeed+ and Thunderbolt 3. You can also go for a USB 3.2 which reads at 20Gbits/second and comes with Superspeed+. Based on the above-recommended specifications, here are our recommendations in terms of editing systems: 1. MacBook Pro ($1699) Apple’s latest 13” MacBook Pro comes with a 10th generation Intel Core i5 Processor, 16GB RAM, and 512GB SSD Storage. Watch this review by Max Yuryev that also talks about 4K video editing on the new 13” MacBook Pro. 2. HP Envy 15 ($1903) The HP Envy 15 Laptop comes with an Intel Core i7-10750H processor, an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Graphics card, 16 GB RAM, and 512 GB SSD Storage. It has a 15.6” full HD touchscreen with a fingerprint reader and comes with Windows 10 installed. Watch this detailed review by Just Josh where he reasons out why the HP Envy 15 is the best laptop for video editing out there. 3. iMac ($2199) The latest BTO 27″ iMac comes with a 5K retina display and a 3.3GHz 6-Core Intel Core i5. It has 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and an AMD Radeon Pro 5300 4GB graphics card. This insightful review video by Max Yuryev is specifically for video editors who are looking at purchasing an iMac this year. 6. Memory cards One of the most underrated YouTube equipment is the memory card. While it is absolutely necessary to have for recording videos, not many people understand how to pick up the best memory cards. We have broken down the 3 key things you should look for before purchasing a memory card. Use-case for SD, MicroSD, Compact Flash, and CFast cards SD cards and Micro SD cards are the same. SD cards are used in DSLR, compact, and mirrorless cameras, whereas micro SD cards are used in GoPros, cell phones, etc. Compact flashcards on the other hand are faster and are used in more expensive cameras like the Canon 7D, 5D Mark IV, and the CFast cards are used in high-end professional cameras like the Canon 1D and other cinema cameras. (A) Format Most cameras today however use the SD card or micro SD card, so let’s take those as an example and understand how to pick out the right memory card. Micro SD and SD cards come in two formats – SDHC and SDXC but the main difference between these two cards is the filing systems which give you better memory capacities. (B) Capacity The next thing you need to look at is the memory capacity of the card – most cards come in 32GB, 64GB, 128GB, and 512GB. The memory capacity of your card depends on what you’re planning to shoot. For example, if you’re going to have long shoot days, you must choose a minimum of 128GB memory capacity. However, if you know that you have breaks in between your shoots or you won’t be shooting continuously, you can go for a 64GB memory capacity. (C) Speed card rating As a videographer, one of the most important things you must check for when choosing a memory card is the speed card rating. You’ll find this on the right-hand side of the card. If you see the letter C with numbers 2, 4, 6, 1o enclosed within it, the card has a minimum sustained write speed of 2 megabytes, 4 megabytes, 6 megabytes, and 1o megabytes respectively. This is important because if the sustained speed drops below the video bitrate, you’ll start seeing dropped frames in your video. Next to this number, you will see a U with a 1 or 3 inside it. This also represents the minimum sustained write speed with U1 being 10 megabytes per second and U3 being not slower than 30 megabytes per second. If you want to dive deeper into understanding SD cards and to understand the numbers represented on the hardware, watch this detailed video by Gerald Undone. 7. Software Editing allows you to tell your story – by putting videos together, adding music, texts, and effects. Whether you’re making YouTube videos for fun or you are creating content for an audience, good editing can take your videos to another level. We’ve listed the most used software for editing YouTube videos and we’ve also listed screen-recording (for tutorials and how-to videos) and live streaming software. Let’s jump right in. (A) Video Editing Software If you’ve done your basic research about editing YouTube videos, you would have heard the names Premiere Pro, First Cut Pro (FCP), After Effects, and Cinema 4D. While we will be covering these, we’ve also added new editing software that lets you create videos hassle-free. We’ve segregated them based on how simple it is to use and what kind of editing they should be used for. Let’s jump right in. I. Easy- InVideo ($10/month) If you want the editing of your video to be the least of your worries, InVideo would be your best bet. This hassle-free online editor allows you to get started immediately with pre-designed templates, stock footage (great if you don’t have the budget to shoot everything), and royalty-free music. With InVideo, you’ll be able to choose from 4000+ templates, an inbuilt library of 1 million+ premium photos and videos from Shutterstock to create visually stunning YouTube videos. You can complete your video by adding music, animated text, stickers, and effects, all of which can be added by a simple click and drag. Most importantly, if you’re just starting and don’t know much about editing videos, IVA, the world’s first intelligent video assistant will help you make your videos seamless and perfect. You don’t need to install InVideo on your PC – it is available online and you can upgrade to the paid version of this tool for as low as $10/month. The pro version gives you access to stock footage, watermark-free templates and you will also have 24*7 support from their team. The best part of using InVideo is access to their community of 18,0000+ creators. It is a great space for you to discuss, share ideas and solutions, get answers, and engage with people who are creating video content, just like you. Here’s a quick tutorial on how you can leverage InVideo’s pre-made templates and create a thumb-stopping video in minutes (even if you’ve never edited a video before). Edit your YouTube videos like a pro Without spending hours on editing Try for free II. Advanced Adobe Premiere Pro & Final Cut Pro (FCP) ($19.99/month onwards) Both these softwares are popular choices amongst filmmakers, content creators, and YouTubers for editing videos. It is the best option for people who have a basic understanding of film creation and want to create video content at a professional level. They edit and render in HD and 4K, and you can choose different formats to export your video (like 1080p HD for YouTube and BlueRay for films). Both Premiere Pro and FCB require you to start at ground zero and build your video up. You have access to tools that let you do more than just basic video editing and allows you to adjust sound, colour, and more. These software have a dearth of functions, creative tools, and presets to aid you but you’ll need to have a basic technical knowledge of transitions, colours, and design for you to make the best editing choices. There are tonnes of tutorials on YouTube but it still can be very intimidating for someone who is just starting on their YouTube journey. Check out this Final Cut Pro Vs Premiere Pro video by Tyler Stalman where he discussed how professionals choose the software they want to edit on. III. Pro-level Adobe After Effects ($20.99/month onwards) If you want to create digital effects to add to your YouTube video (like this video by Roy Aldin) After Effects is the best place to make it. After Effects can be used for keying, tracking, transitions, and adding motion graphics and animation to your YouTube videos. Like Premiere Pro, this software too requires technical know-how and lets you create effects from scratch. If you’re creatively inclined to try new things and create new visuals for your YouTube videos, there is no better playground than After Effects. (B) Screen-recording software Want to show your audience how you do something – like in a tutorial or a gaming video? You’ll need a screen recording software that will record everything you do on your screen, so you can share it with your audience. We’ll be looking at options for both your desktop and mobile. Let’s dive right in. I. Camtasia ($249.99 one-time fee + yearly renewal after the first annum) Camtasia is not only a screen recorder but also a video editor – which means that you can edit the recorded footage on there itself before you move it to your final editor. It allows you to zoom in and out, highlight your cursor, blur or highlight objects and a lot more – making it a favorite amongst YouTubers. It also comes as a smartphone app that allows you to record your phone screen.Watch this video for a full review and demo of Camtasia before you make a purchase decision. II. OBS (free) The OBS screen recorder is very basic but does the job. It will record everything on your screen but you won’t be able to zoom in and out, use a highlighted cursor or do any other extra effects. The upside of OBS is that it is also a live stream encoder that helps you compress and convert your audio and video into a digital format for a smooth streaming experience on YouTube. Watch this video where Kevin Stratvert breaks down how you can use OBS to do screen recording on your PC for free. III. DU screen recorder (free) This robust screen recorder is the most reliable for android users. It is a simple screen recorder and does not crash or break when it’s recording. It also comes with a video editor that lets you work on the recording in the app itself and add background music. It also allows you to adjust the video quality by setting the frames per second (up to 60FPS) and output (1080p). (C) Live-streaming software Live streaming software helps you convert your content (video, audio, presentations, etc.) files into a suitable format for streaming on the internet. These software also helps you switch between multiple cameras, cards, application windows, and more, to make broadcasting live simple. We’re looking at 3 options (web and app-based) which are favoured by most YouTubers when they stream live. I. StreamYard ($20/month onwards) StreamYard is a web-based live streaming tool that is a great option for you if this is your first time streaming live. It does not matter what PC or laptop you have because it is web-based, which also means that it doesn’t depend on your system’s resources. One of the things that makes it a go-to streaming option is because it is a simple click and go once you log in, making it extremely user-friendly. Watch this review by Justin Brown where he talks about the benefits and limitations of StreamYard, pricing, and why you should choose it. II. Be.Live ($24.99/month onwards) Be.Live is one of the fastest and easiest platforms on the web to go live. It is packed with features that will help you take your live stream to the next level – like adding scrolling texts or bullet points and feature live comments on the screen. It supports multiple cameras and allows you to switch between them, and you can even share your screen if you want to show your audience what you’re working on. You can also host up to 10 guests on a live stream, with 4 guests on the screen at once while the others can wait in the waiting room. It also has an app, letting mobile users join your live stream and you, the host, control the live stream from your smartphone. One of the best features of Be. Live is Live Shopping which lets you put up links of products that your users can click on to buy immediately.

Watch this detailed review by Buildapreneur where he also shares his screen and does a walkthrough of Be. Live. III. Ecamm Live ($16/month onwards) This powerful live-streaming app is built for Mac systems and lets you stream in HD and 4K with one click. It allows you to connect external visual and audio capturing devices – like a microphone, DSLR, and webcam for better quality. It comes with built-in support for all the major platforms including YouTube and also lets you multicast using platforms like Restream and Switchboard. With RTMP support, you can broadcast from anywhere and it also lets you completely customize the toolbars in the app according to what you’ll be using during the live. You can play videos and presentations during your live streams by just dragging and dropping them on the screen and you can easily switch between screen shares, multiple cameras, and guest video. This feature-rich app lets you create your own custom animations and you can also add a ticker text on the screen. You can invite multiple guests on your live, with 4 sharing the screen at one time. To know more about Ecamm, check out this detailed review by Justin Brown – Primal Video where he discussed Ecamm Live’s features and also teaches you how to make an animated intro for your live stream using the app. IV. Switcher Studio ($20/month onwards) If you go live from your smartphone or tablet, Switcher Studio is a must-have app for you. It allows you to use one tablet or phone as a control center and then you can wirelessly connect multiple phones to do a full production Multicam live stream setup. Switcher Studio allows you to create pro-level production wherever you go, without having to carry bulky equipment. Here are Sean Cannell’s first look and review of the Switcher App where he shows you how the setup and app works. V.

This cloud-based tool offers you several platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and more, where you can invite your guests and broadcast your own show. The best part is, you can broadcast the same stream on multiple platforms at the same time. Studio by Restream is your way to achieve mass outreach for your online live streaming shows. We’ve covered everything you will need equipment-wise for creating stunning YouTube videos, but that’s not all. One of the biggest hurdles for content creators is what their videos should be about. Whether you’re wondering what your first YouTube video should be or you are looking for fresh ideas – this exhaustive list of YouTube video ideas will make sure you never run out of great content. Still not sure what is the best equipment for shooting YouTube videos? You can simply check out our snapshot recommendations where we have put together our best bets for every kind of video – first-person, live streams, vlogs, and more. Snapshots: Equipment list for different types of videos (A) First-person videos First-person videos are where you set up the camera on your desk and just talk into it, so it appears like you are having a direct conversation with your audience. These are simple to shoot and you don’t require a lot of equipment. Here’s all the gear you’ll need with our recommended best buy for each piece of equipment Camera: Webcam if you have a PC and want to record your videos from there itself, camcorder, or smartphone if you will be changing your set up or moving around in your videos. Stabilizer: Manfrotto PIXI or any simple 3-legged tripod that will support your camcorder or smartphone. Light: Ring lights are the best option for lighting up a single person in the video. Audio: Opt for the Takstar SGC-598 Shotgun microphone that will connect to your compact camera or choose the Deity V Lav Lavalier Lapel Mic if you’re recording your videos from your smartphone. Blue Snowball mic is a great option if you will be recording your videos directly on your PC. Memory card: A standard 64GB SDXC card should suffice for shooting first-person videos. PC: Any PC with a minimum of 12GB RAM if you plan to edit your videos on Premiere Pro or FCP. If you don’t want to upgrade your PC yet, choose to edit online with InVideo. Softwares: InVideo for editing videos (lets you also add stock footage and animation, if needed), Premiere Pro for advanced editing (in case you’re making long videos), StreamYard, or Switcher Studio for live streaming, and OBS for screen recording. (B) Product showcases like phone, unboxing, etc. Creating unboxing videos, tests, and doing reviews are also simple set-up YouTube videos. However, you will need equipment that can easily move around so that you can show your audience different angles. Here’s all the gear you’ll need with our recommended best buy for each piece of equipment Camera: If you’re just starting, you can use a camcorder or a smartphone (minimum 12MP camera) to record your video but if you want to upgrade, you can choose between a compact camera like the Canon G7X Mark III or a DSLR – Canon 70D. Stabilizer: You’ll need a stabilizer with a fluid head for easy pan and tilt movements to show your audience the unboxing and products, like the Manfrotto Compact Action tripod. You can also upgrade to the Vanguard Alta Pro. Light: You can choose between an 18” Ring light, LED panels, or a softbox depending on how big your set-up is. Audio: You can use a shotgun mic – RODE Video or even a lapel – RODE Go Compact Wireless to record your audio. Some YouTubers also prefer a podcast mic like the Maona USB Podcast Mic. Memory card: A standard 64GB SDXC card should suffice for shooting product reviews and unboxing videos. PC: Any PC with a minimum of 12GB RAM if you plan to edit your videos on Premiere Pro or FCP.

(C) Performance art Whether you’re shooting a dance performance or a band – having the right equipment will allow you to capture the movement and emotion of it. Here’s all the gear you’ll need with our recommended best buy for each piece of equipment Camera: Based on your budget, you can choose to shoot with a smartphone, compact camera, or DSLR. If you wish to upgrade, you must go for a mirrorless camera, like the Canon EOS R that records on a 35mm sensor – giving you more vivid colours. Stabilizer: To capture smooth and fluid movements you must use a gimbal. If you’re shooting with a smartphone, the DJI Osmo Mobile 2 and the Moza Mini MI are both great options. If you’re using a DSLR – go for the DJI Ronin-S or the Zhiyun Weebal Lab. Light: If you’re going to be moving with the subject and want the light to follow that movement, you can use an on-camera LED light panel. However, you can also use this LED panel kit by Fovitech if you want to light up a small room or stage. This stick light by Godox can be used to add colours, drama, or a cinematic feel to the performance. Audio: Use a shotgun mic like the RODE Video with a dead cat to capture the audio (to match it to the original during edit) but you should put in the original track during the edit of the video. Memory card: A standard 128GB SDXC card should suffice for shooting long performances but you should keep a backup card, just in case this one gets full. PC: Any PC with a minimum of 12GB RAM if you plan to edit your videos on Premiere Pro or FCP. If you don’t want to upgrade your PC yet, choose to edit online with InVideo. Software: You should use Premiere Pro for editing the video and you can use InVideo to create an animated intro-text, StreamYard or Switcher Studio for live streaming, and OBS for screen recording. (D) Vlogs and outdoor videos If you’re going to be shooting outdoors, you want to have steady but portable equipment. More importantly, you want to make sure that all of your footage is recorded smoothly, with no audio or visual disturbances. Here’s all the gear you’ll need with our recommended best buy for each piece of equipment Camera: You can shoot vlogs and outdoor videos on your smartphone or you can use the Canon G7X Mark III which is known as the vloggers’ camera. You can also choose to upgrade to a DSLR like the Canon 70D or a mirrorless camera like the Sony A7 RIV. Stabilizer: For ultimate stabilization, especially because you will always be on the go – choose the Moza Mini-MI or the DJI Osmo Mobile 2 for your smartphone or you can use the DJI Ronin-S or the Ikan MS Pro Beholder. Light: You will mostly choose to shoot when there is good natural light outdoors. However, this portable ring light, on-camera LED panel, or Godox stick light should do the trick, if you happen to need external lights. Audio: You will want a portable mic set up that should easily sit on your camera. Go for the RODE Video with a dead cat or the RODE Go Compact Wireless to record your audio. Memory card: Pick two SDXC cards – 64GB and 128GB. PC: Any PC with a minimum of 12GB RAM if you plan to edit your videos on Premiere Pro or FCP. If you don’t want to upgrade your PC yet, choose to edit online with InVideo. Softwares: InVideo for editing videos (lets you also add stock footage and animation, if needed), Premiere Pro for advanced editing (in case you’re making long videos), StreamYard, or Switcher Studio for live streaming, and OBS for screen recording. (E) Live streaming Live streaming on YouTube needs some extra equipment – like a live stream encoder and podcast mic. Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. Here’s all the gear you’ll need with our recommended best buy for each piece of equipment Camera: If you’re live streaming from your desk, the best option for you is the Logitech Brio webcam but if you’re traveling or are outdoors – you can also go live from your smartphone. Many YouTubers also use a DSLR and convert the footage using live stream software – especially for interviews and podcasts. Stabilizer: If you’re not moving around during your live stream, you can set up a simple 3-legged tripod. However, if you are walking around with your equipment to show your audience where you are and what you’re up to – we’d suggest either an advanced monopod like this one by Manfrotto or a basic gimbal – like the Moza Mini-MI or DJI Ronin-S. Light: You will need a light that can sit on your desk while you comfortably go live like this 18” ring light or something that moves around with you – like an on-camera LED panel. Audio: The best audio option to go for during your live stream is a podcast mic like the RODE NT-USB or Maono USB Podcast mic AU-A04, however, if you’re going live outdoors, you must choose the RODE GO compact wireless microphone. Memory card: A 128GB SDXC card should suffice for live streaming only if you are using a DSLR or compact camera. PC: You can use any system or laptop to go live as long as you have an external mic and camera that covers your audio and video quality. Software: Use InVideo to create the promo and intro of your live stream. You can then choose between StreamYard, vMix, and Streamlabs OBS to go live. If you are using your smartphone – go for Switcher Studio. (F) Screen-recording tutorials Want to show your audience how you get something done – like how you play a game or create something on Adobe Illustrator? You’ll need a screen recorder to capture all your activity which will help you guide your audience through a step-by-step tutorial. Here’s all the gear you’ll need with our recommended best buy for each piece of equipment: Camera: You must use a webcam to record yourself doing the activity – like creating a graphic on Illustrator so that the audience can understand your thought process too. You could also use your smartphone or a compact camera to shoot it. Stabilizer: You’ll need a simple tripod like the Manfrotto PIXI to mount the compact camera or smartphone. Light: You don’t need a fancy light for a screen-recording tutorial. A simple ring light will do the trick. Audio: You can choose between a podcast mic, a lavalier, or even a shotgun mic depending on your budget. Memory card: A standard 64GB SDXC card should suffice for shooting a tutorial. PC: Any PC with a minimum of 12GB RAM if you plan to edit your videos on Premiere Pro or FCP. If you don’t want to upgrade your PC yet, choose to edit online with InVideo. Software: You should use Premiere Pro for editing your tutorial and create a stunning intro on InVideo. You can choose between OBS, DU screen recorder, and Camtasia for screen recording. (G) Animation / stock footage based videos Got a great idea but don’t have the budget to shoot it? That shouldn’t stop you from creating a great YouTube video. Here’s all the gear you’ll need with our recommended best buy for each piece of equipment: PC: Any PC with a minimum of 12GB RAM if you plan to edit your videos on Premiere Pro or FCP. If you don’t want to upgrade your PC yet, choose to edit online with InVideo. Softwares: InVideo lets you add stock footage and animation from Shutterstock and you can edit your YouTube video on the online editor itself. If you have bought or sourced stock footage from elsewhere, you can edit it in Premiere Pro and FCP. Wrapping up We’ve listed the best of YouTube equipment for every budget and use case.

that you need in order to start a beginner YouTube studio so with that let's jump on into today's video Let's face facts when we're first starting out all we might be able to afford is that bedroom sort of glow up with the amount of gear that we need to literally press record and get our videos out the door and that's why I've broken down today's video into seven different pieces and I'll be walking you through each one individually today so the first consideration that we need to talk about today is obviously your equipment because your camera will easily be the most expensive piece of equipment that you need for your studio space and in my opinion the quality of YouTube content Creation in a studio environment has just gotten so high that a high quality mirrorless camera is one thousand percent the first purchase that you need to be making and if you've watched my other videos you'll know that I have two cameras a Sony a74 and a Sony A1 which the Sony A1 I use for all of my commercial work and bigger shoots that I actually get paid for outside of my social media presence and the Sony a74 I treat as my B Cam and YouTube camera because when it comes to social media it's actually my a cam for three reasons first and most important is the flip out screen because as a YouTuber you'll be solo filmmaking a ton and you need to see yourself and what you're doing because trust me I've been on the other end of a camera without that flip out screen and all I can say is good luck second is the a74s autofocus and color science not only does it lock on with eye Auto tracking in pretty rapid movement scenarios but it's got s cinetone built into the color profile meaning that you need to worry about your color grading a little bit less in the editing room and then three is the viewfinder capabilities now yes the Sony zve one is out but that camera does not have a viewfinder and in my opinion I would sooner level up with the Sony a74 than the zve1 has a vlogging camera for the simple reason that if I'm traveling and my a camera and my photo camera doesn't work or breaks or something goes wrong I can pull out the a74 and I know I have a backup Pro photo camera that I can use for all of my content creation needs when you are a beginner YouTuber you need to take into considerations those three things that I just mentioned in your essential camera body there are only a handful of cameras that I would recommend that can actually do this Sony a74 being one of them the Canon R5 Canon R6 and the Nikon Z6 Mark II now my other consideration for YouTube gear is the best lens that you can get for filming YouTube content is a 16 to 35 millimeter F 2.8 or it's equivalent this lens is known as a vlogging lens because it provides you with enough space for 16 millimeters that is extremely wide 35 millimeters which gives you the most accurate portrayal of what the human eye sees which comes in handy not only for vlogging but good for interview setups and most importantly photography for when you need it now I've made a short about why this is such a great video lens as well which I'll link in the description so you can give that a watch now with your camera you obviously need to put it somewhere in order to film your a-roll content which for me is sitting at the corner of my desk and to my right is actually a monitor this is where I work my laptop is right over here and I can just put my tripod down right in front of me I know the monitors out of frame and that's what's important is making sure there's not this long and lengthy setup process that you might be really demotivated to do before you actually set up your camera and so here are some tips for choosing your main camera angle for YouTube you want to keep the camera at eye level or just slightly above because you need your camera to capture you and your background which should represent your brand and the topics of your video ensuring a consistent brand across all of your content this way you're always considering your viewers perspective and once you find a setup that works stay consistent so that your content instantly recognizable now once you've dialed in your camera angle the natural next step is ensuring you have a good background because in truth your background says a ton about you and who your channel is designed for and so it needs to directly speak to your target audience so here's some tips your background must be consistent with the theme of your channel if you're running a tech Channel show some of your favorite tech products on it be sure to include colors that you feel represent what you're trying to create because color is a big branding cue and you need to make sure that the colors you choose to use in your videos can contrast with what you're wearing and the text that you use to make everything stand out individually but also complement each other and finally have your setup evolve change it up every so often to find out how to communicate who you are better but reality is that showing off your background is super important and you need secondary angles then to really highlight what's the most important components of your video and for me I've come to learn that that the top down shot is the best shot to be able to do that for most content creators it just makes things so much easier on my content creation workflow because the way I have it designed makes it again seamless efficient and with a reduced amount of friction to be able to just get up and film something so let me take you through what that looks like now the setup that I have for my top down angle is simply just a c-stand neighboring my camera so it sits above and the arm is actually right above me right now pointing down at my desk so when you see the videos they're coming from the c-stand that's essentially locked in position the way I have my lights set up is that I have a big soft box off to my left and then I have another continuous light pointing straight up at the ceiling and this creates enough ambient exposure on the table down below me to be able to light my product reviews and film things that I need in the moment but what comes next is audio and the trick to mastering audio in your studio is understanding if there is an echo in your room and other complications that might happen with where your mic is actually set up so for high quality talking head videos in your studio space here are some mics that I can recommend first is a shotgun mic because it's extremely portable for Run and Gun filmmaking has directional sound capture and is quite honestly perfect for any indoor and outdoor environment two are lapel mics because maybe you want to film interviews or are on the go far away from your camera these give you a little bit more creative freedom and finally is your table mic there are a ton of options for these but inevitably if you choose the right one it should give you the highest audio quality possible and will be your go-to for your studio space my honest recommendation for your studio should be a table mic if you're on a very tight budget then I would recommend getting a shotgun mic because inevitably you're gonna take your camera into the field film Vlogs Run and Gun stuff and to dual purpose your audio I would say the shotgun mic you can just rock on the top of your camera you don't need to have this thing in front of you and that way you get a bigger bang for your buck than just getting a cheap table mic and a shotgun mic and so it's really just about finding solutions that work for you and the sound that you want to get at the end of the day and moving on from the audio setup is your lighting now your studio lighting is obviously very important and if I'm going to be honest for a YouTube Studio setup that is a beginner level my lighting is overkill so don't take my recommendation as a must because I Dual Purpose my lights for my business that I run so I have an aperture 300X off to my left and an aperture 120d Mark II off to my right but you can really tone down the quality of lighting that you need for your own Studio setup here are a few things to consider first natural light is the best light for a beginner if you can set up your a angle next to a window and have the benefit of natural window light being able to come into your environment and a supporting artificial light if you can't get the power out of them to illuminate the other side of you if you don't have the availability of a window light then you need to invest in good lighting putting soft boxes on your light is going to emulate the effect of the window light and if you're looking to have something that you can carry around with you for all of your content creation needs then getting a ring light is obviously the go-to movie especially if you're looking to film tick tocks depending on what kind of creator that you want to be the ring light is going to be your number one light for filming short form content the other thing that I'm going to say is that you need to experiment with your lighting setups almost religiously like I can't tell you how many times I've shifted and moved these things around just to figure out how to get the look that I want and the other thing is that if you have windows open you need to adjust your lights for the natural light that's coming into your space and that will take us to the final tip which is if you want to create more in studio short form videos here's how to do it ensure that your branding is consistent everywhere that you film this way you can just put something on your desk and film it without any need to set up your space in a particular aesthetic way if there's any piece of advice I can give you need to make it easy to just press record and get the content that you need because second is to make sure that the tech you use for work can also become a part of your Brand's aesthetic everything in our space needs to contribute to the brand that we're building because finally we need to leave enough room for all of it with our camera angles because if you're shooting all of your content at 16 millimeters consistently your content's gonna look just a little bit stale over time and so with that I hope this video was able to show you what you need to consider when you're designing your YouTube Studio space it really comes down to a small list of things that can go a very long way inevitably I think the hard part is just accumulating enough material to actually design your environment on brand especially because what you come to realize is desks a camera lights and a shelf are the bare minimum to get something interesting what really steps up a YouTube studio is the things you put on the Shelf maybe the items that you can put on your desk when you're filming shorts content and of course the accessories that you use by making your content and sharing that with your audience these are all the things that make a YouTube space a lot more of a storytelling environment so with that thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one",

And welcome to freelance Friday today. I want to talk about every single piece of equipment, every tool, every resource that you're going to need. If you want to become a full time content creator or just a content creator in general, I suppose, because listen, there are a lot of options out there nowadays for freelancing. You know, cameras and microphones and recording tools. And so I want to tell you the things that I wholeheartedly recommend what I would buy if I were starting over today. And I also just want to add the quick caveat, best tool, the best piece of equipment that you can use is what you already have. So just get started, get started with your phone, get started with your old digital camera. If you have one. But come back to this as a shopping list, as a resource list, if you want to improve, or if you want to like really take your stuff to the next level. And I always just like to put this out there. You don't need like the fanciest stuff to just get started and do be sure to open up the description box and the show notes. If you want to shop, I'll try to link everything for you. Today's episode is sponsored by MetraCool. MetraCool is constantly adding new features to unify social media management. For example, here are some of their latest releases. They recently incorporated Google drive and Canva integrations into their planners so you can design store and schedule your assets with ease. This is available with any premium account. Users can access a post library feature to save social media assets within the planner. You can also drag files directly into the planner to upload and schedule without importing. Access these archives to repurpose content or share across multiple platforms. Storing drafts and a content bank are now a reality within MetraCool. Metrical's AI assistant can recreate copies and optimize per social network, truly making this an all in one platform. Although free Metrical users can use up to 5 AI credits per month, premium credits start at 20 uses per month. It's worth trying a Metrical Premium Plan to test these new features, so be sure to use code Latasha to try any Metrical Premium Plan for 30 days free. Link down in the description. Now, you need something to record with. Of course, you can use your MacBook camera if you have a Mac, but you can also use your iPhone as a webcam nowadays, or you can use a camera like the Logitech Brio, which I really enjoy. It records up to 4K and just gives a little bit more of a polished look if you plan to record most of your videos, like at your computer, maybe podcast interview style, something like that. Now, if you plan to record content, that's a little bit more vlog style, or maybe more out in the world, I would definitely recommend getting a mirrorless camera or a DSLR camera, something that is a little bit more powerful. I personally love the Nikon Z30 for my vlogging camera. And I use a Canon R10 for these sit down videos. That's what I'm recording with right now. If you're watching the podcast, the main difference between those, I guess, three cameras, the Logitech Brio, the Nikon Z30 and the R10 are Logitech Brio is great for interviews, you know, meetings, webinars, things like that. It's just easy. I don't need to hook up a ton of. Intense cables or anything like that. I get a really nice quality shot for very minimal effort. The Z 30 is great because it's smaller. It is more lightweight, it's more compact. And so it's great for traveling around. I can throw it in my bag and take quick clips here and there and just get like a really beautiful shot. The R10 is what I would say gets me my most cinematic look and the most like professional and polished look, but it's not something I like to carry around. It's not really great with action shots. It's kind of just good for this setting or, you know, whatever setting you choose to really, um, commit to, if you will. So it really does just depend on what you need your camera for and what type of content you choose to create. Whatever you choose, you need to put your camera on something. So you need a tripod of some sort. It can be a small one. If it's a vlog camera, I've got a little mini Manfrotto desktop tripod that also works as a monopod for when I'm vlogging. Love that one. For my sit down videos like this, I've got a bigger Manfrotto tripod and for my Logitech Brio, I actually have something pretty cool. It's like a monopod type of situation. I'm going to link all of them down below the monopod type situation at clamps onto my desk. And so I can just actually have a pencil mark on my desk where it goes, so I can pop it on and off when I need it. And it just gives a really nice framing. I also use it for my Nikon Z30 when I do my podcasts using that. And I'll show some examples on the screen here. Microphones, microphones I could talk about all day, honestly, because I've tried so many microphones over the years, but I can pretty confidently recommend. Three different microphones. Number one is this one. The Shure MV7 is what I use for my podcast and for any type of interview or really anything, webinars, meetings. I use it all the time. I really like it. It's pretty affordable. I mean, it is an investment. It's like a 250 bucks, but in terms of more professional quality microphones, it's actually not priced too badly. It's also easy to use. So. Because you can use a USB with it or an XLR like I'm using. You can watch one of my videos all about podcasting to learn kind of what the difference is, but the point is anybody can use it who has a computer. Essentially. You can actually even use this with your phone if you want to get really fancy. Now, similarly, the Samson Q2U, I use that microphone for years, and I really think it is such an amazing quality microphone for the price point. I think it's 70, maybe even less. It's so affordable. And it is, I think a beautiful sound and it also works with both USB and XLR. So just depending on your budget, depending on the aesthetics that you prefer, you may choose to go with either one of those, or you may do what I do and buy the Q2U and eventually upgrade to the short MV7. Now, lastly, if you are not looking for this type of look, if you're like, I don't want to do podcasts. I don't want to look like a podcaster. I want to be, uh, you know, hands free if you will. I really like the DJI wireless mic system. So what's cool about these is that you can use them with a lavalier microphone. So that's the little guy that goes up. In your shirt and you just see the little, you know, microphone heads sitting right here or wherever you choose to put it, I guess, or you can use it as kind of a handheld thing. I don't personally like that look, but it's a little bit more trending on tick tock and things like that. Nowadays, it's just a really versatile microphone system. And so if you plan to do interviews, if you plan to do talking head videos, but you don't want to do podcasts, if you plan to record on the go. A lot and might not want to have a big bulky microphone to travel around with. That is a great option. You'll also need some type of a boom arm is what we call these. If you are going to do sit down podcasts, if you're using the DJI or a wireless system, again, you're probably going to want to think about a lavalier to go alongside it so that, you know, you have something to. Basically hold up your microphone or feed your microphone into your mic pack, depending on the situation. I'm going to be honest. I am not picky about boom arms. I right now, these ones are from road just because I worked with them on some content a while back and I had them and they're pretty good. I. I actually don't prefer them just because they say road on the arm. I actually had to cut it off of this one, um, just because I didn't want to be like a walking road promotion, but there are some from Elgato that I really like that clamp on really nicely. And, uh, yeah, I'm not too picky about boom arms. I would say if you're going to cheap out on anything. A boom arm can probably be cheaped out on pretty easily. I mean, you'll pay for it in the end. It'll probably break on you quickly if you buy like a 10 one from Amazon or something, but it will definitely get you by. Something else that I used for years was just a desktop stand for a microphone. I just preferred the look of it, but. I would say I like the acoustics. I like the sound better with a boom arm because, you know, my hands are a little bit freer. You're still going to hear me moving around, but if this was on a desktop type of situation, you would hear that a lot. Lighting. What I use nowadays is actually. Like the laziest situation, honestly, I am, you know, I'm actually not loving the lighting of my videos these days because it is so lazy, but this is just the most convenient light. It just makes setting up my videos so easy. It's the Elgato key light, and I only have one of them. And then I have a window over on this side. So I've got a key light here and a window on this side. So it is pretty even, but again, I could be doing better. I could be doing like the full lighting setup. Like I used to, I'm just lazy nowadays. I'm going to be honest. I just don't have time for it. So if you also don't have time for it, if you're also not super skilled in lighting, I think this is a really good one. What I like about the Elgato key light is that it is so. Compact, it's very thin and you know, you could easily travel with this. I could throw this into a suitcase and be okay. As opposed to like a big ring light or a big, uh, soft box light, for example. And what's also cool about this is it connects via wifi or maybe Bluetooth. I'm not really sure I will clarify on the screen. It connects via something and I can control it via my computer. So I can just, you know, bump up the temperature to make it more blue or make it more orange. I can make the lighting really intense right now. I'm recording in the evening. It's 5 p. m. So it's starting to, you know, the sun's starting to go down. If you're watching on YouTube, this will make sense, of course. And this is on 15%. So it gets really, really bright. Typically, like when I'm recording during the day, I only put it on like 7 percent or something really, really low. So it's a really powerful light and I just love it. I think it's really easy to use. Something else you're probably going to want to invest in as far as tools go is Canva or some other type of graphic design tool. Now, listen, I know some people are really spicy about Canva. If you are a novice. Like me, Canva is going to help you do everything from YouTube thumbnails, to TikTok covers, to simple animations that might, might pop up throughout your videos. If you are more advanced, of course, there are more advanced photo design tools, logo design tools, photo editors, things like that out there like Lightroom or Photoshop or anything like that. So pick and choose what you want and what you really need, but chances are you're going to need to do some Some editing to photos or some graphic design. Now, Canva isn't going to be great. If you want to create a logo, I hire out for that. I work with designers when I need fancy things like that, but I will make simple tweaks to my photos if I need to brighten it, or like I said, I'll design my thumbnails in it, I'll create simple carousel graphics and things like that in Canva. You're going to need something, but I personally like Canva for the level that I'm at. For ideas and SEO research, I use TubeBuddy. TubeBuddy is actually a Chrome extension. So you can log in with your YouTube account. They do have a free plan. I believe I have one of their paid plans just so I get more searches and more data. But if you log into YouTube, use TubeBuddy, you can start typing in keywords like social media marketing or graphic design or web design or whatever it is that you do, and it'll give you suggestions for topics. It'll help you rank your video titles and decide whether or not they are good ones to go after. You know, you'll be able to see how many people are searching for that topic versus how much content is out there. So you can really decide which niche you can kind of attack and which video title and tags and all of that you can do. There's a lot more you can do with TubeBuddy too. Everything from like bulk editing your YouTube descriptions to thumbnail AB testing, but I primarily use it for video research and I do use it for video research of all kinds, not just YouTube videos. Now, obviously it is really. Custom made for YouTube, but because YouTube is my primary platform and I tend to repurpose from YouTube to other platforms, I also let my YouTube content drive my strategy for TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, any other video platform out there. So it can be helpful to use, not just for YouTube, but just for videos and SEO overall. And lastly, the tool that I recommend every content creator have is a social media content calendar and scheduling tool. And analytics tool, which really Metro cool does all of that. It's my favorite tool for, uh, everything from competitor analysis to planning out my content calendar to actually pushing my content to go live. They do direct posting, auto posting to pretty much all of the social platforms, everything from Instagram to tick talk to Facebook to, uh, YouTube, I think. And yeah, it's just really, really cool. It'll take so much weight off your plate. If you do not have to have your phone on you at all times and be manually posting every single week. One of my favorite features within Metricool scheduler is the ability to cross post to different platforms. So if I have a YouTube short, for example, I can post it to YouTube shorts, but I can also post it to Instagram reels and tech talk at the same time. And I can go in and I can manually edit the caption to customize it for each of those platforms. So. Next time you plan to post a video, just like make sure that you're clicking the other platforms so that you're getting more reach. And yeah, that's just a really nice way. Cause like I never log onto Tik TOK for example. So I will just forget to post on Tik TOK if I don't have a scheduler kind of reminding me to do that. They've also got analytics, so you can see how you're growing over time, which is really helpful. And so many other features inbox management. So definitely recommend every content creator has some type of tool like that. So those are the 10 resources, pieces of equipment. Tools that I recommend that you use. If you want to become a full time content creator, be sure to check out the description box and the podcast show notes, I'll have links to everything. If I've got discount codes to anything or anything like that, I'll have that linked for you down below as well. Let me know if you have questions about any of the other tools, resources, or pieces of equipment that I mentioned. I hope you have a great day. Thank you so much for tuning in. I'll talk to you in the next one. Bye.",

People will want to watch you for you, not for the top tech you may have. Remember that most youtubers started with just a phone, or worse, just a webcam! So set up your book stack, place on your phone and press record! 14 comments being a successful creator doesn't need to be expensive this is how you can build an Empire using just your phone I hit all different sections with chapters and time stamps you can skip around video and find what is best for you so today's video is all about YouTube gear or black bear off I should say there's also the misconception that in order to start a YouTube channel and be super successful you need to have all the latest tech and software or you won't succeed now this couldn't be further from the truth particularly in 2023 where you've got YouTube shorts Tick Tock and Instagram reels which are all designed around creating the video content from those apps on your phone and sure making high quality videos with a DSLR and microphone everything is great but sometimes all you need is your phone camera and yourself but before considering any type of tech or gear decisions Begin by asking yourself the truly existential question why do you want to become a Creator at all and if none of the answers have to do with some kind of passion or desire for actually creating content itself then maybe you you might want to reconsider the truth is one of the answers to that question should probably involve something with a passion or desire or enjoyment or actually creating the content in addition to course to all the potential revenue or money benefits that it may bring starting a new venture or project like a YouTube channel I think should be done has reasonably cheaply as possible The Only Exception really to this rule is if you're like a company and you're just starting to create video content on YouTube then people are going to expect some probably reasonable level of quality from a big brand but if you're like a Creator like an individual like myself then the high quality Tech will just come over time and first you just need to start creating and uploading content that you enjoy and that you're interested in and probably the three more important things to consider are having some good natural lighting so people can see you a decent background and also just some personal motivation and desire out to actually create the content film the videos upload them edit them if you've got all of these three then you know what everything else is going to come you don't really need much else to get going a lot of being a YouTuber just comes from being a good Storyteller if you think of your favorite creators do they always have an impeccable setup did you know that Mr Beast is still films these videos in 1080p HD because he doesn't want it to feel like too well produced and 4K go and check out one of these videos on the channel they're all in full HD and even if Mr Beast decided to upload in 720p would you still watch the content yeah you probably would right I think the big thing that I learned is just having the build up of confidence to be able to realize that you know do people actually care about the videos that you're creating in terms of like your friends and family probably not does it really matter if they kind of care or not probably not even especially if like the videos are not even really targeted at them from an audience it doesn't really matter what your friends or family may think about by uploading content the thing is if you're interested in it it's like validating one of your passions and you're sharing that with the world and other people who are also interested in your passion like Pokemon cards for example then that's really the only thing that matters and the only way to do that really is my practicing putting a camera in front of yourself like I'm doing now and just speaking to the camera advice I think you're passionate about and then maybe editing it a bit and then uploading it onto a platform like YouTube if anything I find it less daunting to speak in front of my phone purely based on the fact that the lens is so much smaller compared to a huge DSLR which feels a little bit more like imposing and the thing is phones all cameras aren't really cheap these days but one of the things that Brands and manufacturers have been really doubling down on in terms of their Innovation over the past few years is within the camera setups of the phone so most phones nowadays come out in the last three or four years have really good cameras and they're actually pretty decent from setups too and some creators choose to use their phone and film all their content on to this day particularly with shorts and vertical content because it's so easy to carry it's always on you and it's so great for Vlogs I know for example for me that if I'm wanting to film a vlog or if I'm wanting to like go somewhere and film some content but I don't want to feel like too self-conscious about it I actually just like taking my phone or taking like this little DJI pocket thing that I actually got it's just a really nice way of getting myself more confident and used to like vlogging or filming in public for sure and also an advantage of filming the photos and videos on your phone is that they're right there for you to be able to edit if you're on a train or if you want to fly or if you're in the car or you know you're just kind of on the move and you just want to get going get editing something get started with an app like cap cut for example which is a super popular editing app I think the real upgrade you can do with a phone setup is not necessarily in the camera department but more around than mine people will sit through and watch YouTube video that maybe doesn't have the best liked video quality but they won't necessarily sit through a video with audio that is just really really poor or really important if you've got airpods in or you've got headphones on you're really going to notice that the audio quality is important so if you want to use an external microphone you can do that too and that's probably where I recommend getting like a cheap Mount or like a lavalier mic for under 30 pounds that you can kind of like clip onto your phone laptop or even just like your shirt So currently we're at the cost of like 20 or 30 pounds for an external microphone because we already have the phone and we're already going to buy that latest iPhone or that latest Google pixel the only other thing you might want to consider if you're doing content a little bit like this where you're sitting down in front of a camera is like some kind of tripod so next you could of course invest in like a smartphone tripod it's just a way to like prop up your phone but to be honest all you really need is like a stack of books I use like a stack of postcards or maybe some other household origin you want to start with and literally get your postcards lean your phone up against it boom all right we've got some kind of like workable tripod situation of course works if I want to film horizontally too now look you might think oh well the angle might be dodgy but actually you know what you can make it work and I've actually used this many many times if I wanted to film in like a public place or somewhere where I've been like a bit nervous or a bit self-conscious about filming I'll just pop my camera or my iPhone or my pixel uh up against like a wall up against some books or some postcards in this case and film myself like working at a desk for some video or for a video when you do want to bring a DSLR on your phone maybe a little bit self-conscious or maybe a worry that people are going to look at you all the concerns that I've definitely had before then you can just bring your phone and pop it up against something and it'll be 90 as good as if you were to bring full DSLR the true beauty of YouTube is that you can use anything you have around you to make it work just make sure the camera is straight stable and nothing is blocking the microphone so now you've got your physical Hardware sorted with your phone and maybe an external mic or lavalier mic then once you've got that sorted all you really need is some software to be able to edit your videos on so you can use something like a cap cart you can use YouTube tick tocks too 10 editors you've also got tools like find movie that Apple try it as well free of charge if you have an iPhone and if you still don't believe me that you can film an amazing video on your phone did you know that all of these different music videos Stupid Love by Lady Gaga lose you to love me by Selena Gomez a good night by John Legend and How Long Will I Love You by Ellie Goulding all of these guess what they were filmed on a phone really I know right I'm not complaining possibility of using your phone that you're doing sit down talking videos with your vlogging whether you're trying to film video of yourself in public is almost Limitless particularly just on the ability that I I use my phone in public place but no one to really like to bat an eyelid or judge me it really is the go anywhere camera and one of the best phrases that I love is what's the best camera that you have the one that is with you I will say one quick thing which is that if you do stop making a little bit of money or maybe you start seeing some traction Brands start reaching out to you you um you're getting loads of views and followers Etc and you do want to invest in some like proper DSLR or camera or filming gear I will list down below in the description all the different products that I use my camera's like five years old not only is filming this video and I think the quality of this is still pretty decent it can film 4K so super happy to share with you all of the different gear that I use it's actually quite low-tech it didn't actually cost me that much there's also nothing wrong with getting gear used like from the likes of CeX in the UK or Ebay there's stores that you can actually buy lenses or cameras or lighting from the second hand that also have a warranty so highly recommend doing that what really matters aside from having a most amazing red camera that like Marquez brownie uses it's probably 10 or 20 000 is building the confidence building the Reps like getting the Reps in and uploading more content and building really quality videos and content that people really enjoy watching not necessarily very physical quality of the video that you produce people want to watch you for you and your authentic self no matter the top Tech you may have remember most YouTubers started with a phone or even worse just they're like computer camera webcam so set up your book stack place your phone in the right slot and press record you're recording a YouTube video do you have any further questions about gear I'll do my best to answer them in the comments below but let me just say one thing don't let gear be the barrier for you to start setting up a successful business in the Creator economy this year because there are so many so many so so so many creators out there we're just using their phones and being really really successful so don't feel like you need to have a spare two or three rounds in order to be a successful YouTuber thank you so much for watching this video check out this one to watch next so subscribe if you're not already otherwise I'll see you in the very next video thanks so much for

I wanna share some actionable tips with you so you can take that first step to getting started today. We're gonna go over the gear, the software, and the strategies that you need to grow on YouTube in 2025. Happy new year, by the way, and welcome to my annual update to my beginner guide to growing on YouTube, 2025 edition. This time around, I wanted to especially focus on some updated growth strategies that I think are gonna be really effective this coming year. In particular, three different types of YouTube channels that I'm predicting are going to thrive on the platform in 2025. You get to pick which type of YouTube channel makes the most sense for you, and therefore which growth strategy you might wanna use. It's not that there's any way to grow on YouTube that's necessarily easier than another, if I'm honest. It might just be a different kind of hard work. So choose the one that you enjoy the most because as we're gonna talk about later, truly the key to success on YouTube is learning to love the process rather than obsessively optimizing for metrics. But we'll talk more about that later because first off, if you're starting a YouTube channel this year, then you're gonna need a camera and some other tech to make it happen. So let's talk about gear. (upbeat music) So this is the best camera for beginner YouTubers in 2025. That's right, you guessed it. It's the phone that you already have. This is a great place to start because it's affordable. I mean, you already own it, and it can produce really high quality results. In fact, I'm filming this clip with my iPhone right now. This is just the internal audio. I recommend you change your settings to be filming at 4K, 30 frames per second, and make sure that you turn off HDR. Those are the most important ones. If you do that, you'll have great crisp footage that's easy to edit later on. And it just looks great. If you film with your phone, then I'm gonna suggest you get these two accessories to make the filming process easier and get higher quality results. The first one is just a basic tripod. This will allow you to graduate from only having selfie clips to really any possible shot or composition you could dream of. This is just the Eukos tripod from Amazon. It's really lightweight. It extends like this, and then you just attach your phone to the top. If you truly are used to having to hold your phone for any clip you want to film, this will be a game changer, and it's only like 25 bucks. The next accessory is lav mics, and this one admittedly is more optional. This is what the audio straight out of the iPhone sounds like. It's pretty good, but it's not quite as good as the audio when you're using the DJI mini mics. Really though, where it makes the biggest difference is when you find yourself setting your phone up on a tripod and then standing quite a distance away from your phone, because obviously the audio stays the same because the lav mic is clipped to me. Whereas you can see without the mic, it doesn't sound nearly as good when I'm this far away. With just these two basic accessories, you'll be able to produce extremely high quality videos without having to invest in a separate camera. However, sometimes it does make sense to invest in a camera that's different from just your phone. Basically what it comes down to is there are pros and cons to filming with your phone, and you've got to decide what makes sense for you. First, let's talk about the pros. Your phone is pretty much always with you and always charged. All of us basically make a habit out of making sure that our phone is charged every morning, whereas you might forget to charge your camera batteries. Your phone's pretty inconspicuous. You'll feel less awkward vlogging with it in public than you would holding up a big camera. And probably the biggest pro of them all, you already own it. You don't have to drop another $1,000 on a new camera. You've already got it, so you might as well use it. However, there are some cons. Let's just be honest, storage is annoying on phones. The thing is we use our phones for so many different things. When you go to edit your vlog inevitably, you're gonna be sifting through a ton of screenshots, photos of things you're supposed to get at the grocery store. It's just a little bit messier than having a camera dedicated to filming where the SD card only has the clips that you actually want to edit. And we all know the struggle of our phone storage constantly being full. And the final con, you have less control over the lens you're using and the exposure. Phones have really improved over the years in terms of camera control. So based on all of this, you have to decide whether a phone setup makes sense for you or if you're ready to upgrade. If all of the cons of filming with your phone are starting to add up for you, then I would recommend looking into a system like this. Okay, this is my official statement for 2025. I think if you wanna film on something other than your phone, this is the best camera for beginner YouTubers. This is the Sony ZV-E10 Mark II. Not only does this little mirrorless camera have some incredible video features, but you also have access to a wide range of lenses. And I just think it produces really beautiful results. For improved audio, you could pair it with this tiny little shotgun mic. This is the Sony ECMG-1. It connects wirelessly and it just sounds good. Here's a sample of what the Sony ZV-E10 Mark II looks and sounds like with the kit lens and with no additional microphone. And here's what it sounds like when you have that little ECMG-1 microphone plugged in on top. Whichever kit you go with, just remember that the quality of your videos is so much more about the substance, like what your video is about, rather than what camera your video was filmed with. So really just make the best of whatever you have on hand and use that until you start to bump up against the creative limits of your setup. When you find yourself wanting to film something that you physically can't with your existing camera, that's a good indication that it might be time to invest. But until then, just promise me, you won't let not having the perfect camera hold you back from getting started. A lot of times we use gear as an excuse for why we're not ready to start yet. So don't fall into that trap. Dive in with the phone that you already have and then upgrade when you're ready. Okay, so we got you the gear that you need to actually film your videos. And now let's tackle the software that you're gonna use to edit them. I have one really solid recommendation for you and it's an app that I personally have started using a lot over the last year. The best part is it has a really great free version and that is DaVinci Resolve. Fun fact, I actually edited a lot of the videos for this channel and my vlog channel using just the free version of DaVinci Resolve like earlier this year. I just recently upgraded to the paid version, but there are so much you can do with this, totally for free. Honestly, you can do everything that you need to do with the free version of Resolve. But if you wanna get into more complex stuff like automatic masking, motion graphics and the auto captions I believe are part of the paid version, but it's a one time fee to purchase the software. It's not a subscription, so we love that. I wanna focus more on the strategy in today's video, so we're not gonna get into a full on editing tutorial, but I did do kind of an introduction to DaVinci Resolve for beginners in this video. So I recommend checking that one out next if you wanna learn more about that. Now, when you're editing your videos, in my opinion, one of the most overlooked parts of creating a great edit is making sure that you find the right music to pair with it. Especially if you wanna edit fun montage segments like this. (upbeat music) Now you might be thinking, Katie, you're going crazy. First of all, that was very extra. And to that I would say, yes, fair. But you might also be thinking, aren't you gonna get demonetized? And to that I would say, no, because I used Licked, the sponsor of today's video. Licked is this really cool platform that I discovered recently that allows YouTubers to use popular mainstream music in their videos legally. Where you stay protected from copyright claims and your videos don't get demonetized. Usually if you were to use mainstream music in your videos, the AdSense revenue from your video would actually go to that copyright owner. But when you use Licked, you get to keep your AdSense revenue. Licked is a music licensing platform with over 1.4 million tracks from huge mainstream artists like my girl, Sabrina Carpenter, and others like Coldplay, Ruto Mars, and many more. As well as tens of thousands of stock tracks. You can search for your favorite artists or filter the options by genre, mood, or tempo. I feel like as creators we've all had that moment where you know the perfect song to use in a scene. But then you have to stop yourself because you're like, no, that's copyright. And you know you'd get demonetized if you used it. With Licked you don't have to worry about that because you can get that perfect song to use in your video legally. Plus, mainstream music can really help increase the engagement and watch time on your video. Viewers are much more likely to keep on watching when they hear a song that's familiar to them. Be honest with me, would you really have watched my espresso dance number there if it wasn't set to a song that you liked? Probably not. I'm not that good of a dancer. So if you wanna use music from your favorite artists and your YouTube videos, you should definitely check out Licked. Make sure you use my link in the description. It really helps me out. It lets Licked know that I sent you. And of course, thanks to Licked for sponsoring today's video. One last thing I wanted to mention while we're on the topic of editing, if you're feeling overwhelmed or intimidated by the prospect of editing all your own videos this year, I did wanna let you know that I have a team of editors. It's a small agency called Creatorly Media. We work with clients and we edit their YouTube videos for them. We're taking out a few new clients in 2025. So you can go to creatorlymedia.com for all the details on that. And I'll have it linked in the description as well. All right, we've got you set up to film and edit your videos. Now let's make sure that your channel is actually gonna grow. Like I mentioned at the start of this video, there are really three main types of YouTube channels that I think are gonna grow well in 2025. And they each have their own strategies, methods and techniques. So let's break it down. (upbeat music) Okay, so the first type of YouTube channel that we are gonna tackle is a podcast channel. Video podcasts have become super popular over the past year or so. And I can definitely see them continuing to grow in popularity throughout 2025. Okay, so first let's discuss like why this works so well. Like why does this type of channel thrive in the YouTube algorithm? Oh, but first I've got to add my little sticker. The video podcast format really takes advantage of the part of the YouTube algorithm that prioritizes watch time. The way people consume video podcasts on YouTube is that they like to put them on and let them play in the background while they do tours around the house, go for a walk, drive to work, especially for people with YouTube premium, right? Because you can play a video even if the app is closed. But even if you just have it open in another tab on your computer while you're scrolling through Pinterest or doing other stuff, like people love to have it as like background noise, basically. And this means that your watch time is amazing compared to other formats because people are less likely to skip through something if they're doing another activity simultaneously. Pair that with the longer on average video length and video podcasts are like a hack to basically going viral because your watch time is so high. Another reason why this works so well is because it really builds up that connection with your audience. The nature of it is when people spend like 30 plus minutes listening to you talk, you're gonna feel more connected to that creator and therefore more loyal to them. Also, listeners just have more tolerance for tangents on podcasts again because they aren't as likely to skip. So even if you aren't being as brief and concise and to the point as possible, people will still kind of keep listening. And so that means there's not as much pressure for podcasters to edit out their personality for the sake of brevity because you've kind of got that guaranteed watch time there as long as you are generally engaging and interesting to listen to, doesn't have to be such tight cuts. So all of this kind of helps increase your watch time, increase that connection with your audience. Finally, another benefit of video podcast is the extra discoverability that comes from the other platforms where your podcast will be syndicated. So if you post your video podcast on YouTube, chances are you're also gonna make sure that the video and audio are on Spotify and the audio is on Apple Podcasts, which basically means you have those additional opportunities to grow. So not only are people finding you through YouTube, but they're also finding you on the other podcast platforms. Okay, so that's why it works. Let's talk about how you can make it work for you. Okay, so the first strategy that you definitely need to implement is that every episode needs a hook. Depending on your type of show, maybe your hook will be a really interesting guest, or maybe it'll just be an intriguing topic. If you're able to get a guest, that's gonna be familiar to your audience, that is a great way to hook people into listening. This is why podcasts interviews with celebrities always go viral, because the person is the hook. But you don't need to interview celebrities to have a successful podcast. If you have a good episode topic idea, that could also function as a hook. If you're interviewing someone who is relatively unknown to your audience, you can turn that person into a hook by focusing on their story rather than just on their name. So maybe it's something like how she made $70,000 in brand deals in one year with less than 10K followers. I'm interviewing someone and I'm asking them about that, but I'm leading with their story rather than their name, and then you get to know them once you listen. Basically, you're asking people to listen for like a relatively long time, so you need to give them a reason to press play. The second tip I have for you around video podcast strategy is that the story is more important than the editing. The beautiful thing about video podcasts is that you don't necessarily need to have the most engaging, crazy edits. If you don't have a lot of B-roll and you don't have a lot of graphics or titles, that's okay because a lot of people are gonna be just kind of listening in the background. They're not fully paying attention to the screen. So it gives you a little bit more leeway when it comes to the visuals, but it does mean that it's important that whatever you're talking about is engaging. My third tip for growing a video podcast in 2025, you wanna promote it externally. Two main ways you can do this that I think are really effective is SEO blog posts. And the second thing is short form clips. Again, another beautiful thing about podcasts is just how much repurposing you can do without having to film extra content. So take that podcast episode, get the transcript, turn that into a blog post, summarize it, include the transcript, and then, you know, it can show up in Google search results and direct people to your YouTube channel. Another thing that you can do is create short form clips. I highly recommend if you're gonna do this, don't just grab a 60 second segment and crop it to vertical and call it good. Instead, think about making like a trailer for your episode. Some creators who I think do a really great job of this are Amandam Beck. They are like van life YouTubers I've followed for a long time that recently started a podcast and they do really attention grabbing short form edits to promote their latest episodes. And if you watch my channel, chances are you're familiar with Colin and Samira. They do great little like trailer edits of their interviews. It's a great way to create like engaging short form content that you could post as YouTube shorts, which will also help grow your channel. And of course, direct people to watching the full length episodes. Okay, so who is this format really for? Like how do you know that this is the right channel type for you? I feel like if you are more passionate about the subject matter of your channel over like say the visuals, then podcasting might be a good format for you because it's not as like B-roll or graphics forward. If you like writing and planning and like research, I think that's also a good sign this could work for you. A really underrated skill when it comes to podcasting, I think is the research because in my opinion, the best podcasts like they have researched the guests. They know what the interesting questions to ask are not just like tell us who you are and what you do. You know what I mean? Like you know who you're talking to and you know like how to get interesting information out of them or you're talking about a subject where you've taken the time to go in and see what the other experts are saying on it. Like I feel like research is really underrated. And I think podcasts are also just good for people who are kind of chatty or like long winded. If you have a hard time making a video that is like 15 or like 20 minutes long for YouTube, if you wanna talk for longer than that, like a podcast might be a good fit. The second format that you might wanna consider for growing a YouTube channel in 2025 is a vlog channel. I think a lot of people are dubious as to whether a vlog channel can still be successful in 2025, but I really believe they can be. It just takes the right strategy. Cause like this format is still working in the algorithm and let's talk about why. In my mind, this genre is really defined by good storytelling and ultimately kind of a form of escapism. Viewers watch these channels for relaxation, for comfort to kind of get a break from their everyday lives, to kind of just turn off their brain and tune into a different world. So the creators who do the best with these formats are really good at immersing you into their life. Like truly, I think one of the markers of success of these channels is just strong vibes. Like you need to kind of have a clear brand, have a clear vibe and like just admit that with every video. What I mean by this is successful vloggers, like I don't know if you've noticed this as you watch your favorite comfort creators, but they're always gonna have like a similar genre of music that they use, similar types of shots, similar visuals, transitions that they go back to again and again. So they have the same style of fonts. They have a clear visual language to their brand. It's just like how someone has like personal style, like their outfits are consistent in a way where you're like, oh yeah, that's the kind of outfit that Katie would wear. For successful vloggers, they have like, oh yeah, that's the kind of font that Katie would use in her videos. That's the kind of like transition. All of those things are very consistent. So it provides that same feeling to viewers every time. It's really about like comfort viewing, I feel. Okay, so how do you grow a vlog channel in 2025? Like how are people doing this? First and foremost, I think it is so essential. You need to choose a target audience. If the vibe or like the personal brand is the core of being a vlogger, then it's so important that you have a target audience that connects well to that vibe or that brand. So I really recommend if you're gonna embark on this, study your target audience. Think about the kind of people that you think will connect with what you want your vibe to be. Figure out who they are and figure out who they're already watching. Do a little bit of market research. See the other people in your space and figure out how you can come to the table with a slightly fresh or different approach. Like how are you gonna differentiate yourself? And so basically the process is you're going to start with a familiar format. We need a little bit more space, but you're going to find an angle that differentiates you from other people, making those formats. What I mean by familiar formats are the same structure of videos that many different lifestyle creators kind of fall back on all the time. So the typical week in my life in city. I tried blank for a week. Here's what happened. What's in my bag or apartment tours? What I eat in a week or my routine for blank. These are all formats that people instantly recognize and they kind of know what to expect from the structure of your video. But then you find a fresh angle that you can bring to that format. So it's different. It's worth clicking on for people. And what I mean by having a fresh angle is like, what about your life or what you're gonna share of your life in your videos makes you different from other people. For some people, it might be like the city they live in, maybe that's Paris or New York. That's a great one, especially if you live in like a major like kind of world famous city because a lot of people are curious about what that life is like. Or maybe it's the type of job you have and other people who are curious about that career and wanna see what life is like doing that job. Or maybe it's some niche lifestyle, whether you're a digital nomad or you're homesteading or you live in a van. These are all examples of the angle that you can take to those week in my life, my routine for X formats that are so familiar. And of course, as we know, the title and thumbnail are like super significant to the success of these videos. It's important that you use your opportunity and your title and thumbnail to really advertise the video, give people a sense of your vibe, like I said, the vibes, very important here. And then of course you need to make sure that your video delivers on not only the structure slash the format, your angle on it, but also the vibes. There's also opportunity here to use SEO, like I think the week in my life or even like the city or the job or the niche lifestyle, those are all good keywords that can help you find people through search as well. Okay, let's talk about who this format is best for. I feel like if you are creative and multi passionate and maybe even like a little bit on the artistic side, I feel like this is a good fit for you because you would probably feel a little bit constrained by the idea of choosing a specific topic or focus for a podcast or for the next type of channel we're gonna talk about. If you feel you're the kind of person that has a very strong vibe and aesthetic, but not necessarily a strong focus in terms of the subject matter you'd wanna cover, this is the right approach because it allows you to cover a variety of topics that relate to your life. But the consistency factor is that you're always doing the same editing style, those same genres of music, the same transitions, all of that stuff that comes down to again, strong vibe. I'm telling you the vibes here, it's all about the vibes. So if you feel you are good at curating a vibe, but not so good at curating a specific like set of topics to discuss, I think a vlog channel is a good idea for you. I guess one other thing I would mention about this too, I think a factor with like choosing your YouTube strategy that a lot of people don't consider is actually what kind of level of privacy each of these afford you. Creators and like content started just like don't tend to talk about this very much, but the truth is, if you start a vlog channel, you are by nature of it going to be sharing your life. If you start a podcast about a specific niche topic or if you start this type of channel, which we'll talk about in a second, you actually have the opportunity to really not share much of your personal life at all. So consider that when you're thinking about your direction, like how much of yourself do you really wanna share online? Because contrary to popular belief, being a content creator or an influencer doesn't necessarily mean that you are like doxing yourself constantly and like sharing every single bit of personal information. Like you actually don't have to, especially if you take these types of routes, but with a vlog channel, like that's just how it goes. Let's talk about mystery format number three, which is a niche YouTube channel. I feel like it's been a lot of discourse around the idea of a niche and whether or not you need one on YouTube, but the truth is it's one of many different approaches for how to grow. Having a vlog channel is kind of like the inverse of having a niche channel in many ways. The way that I define a niche channel is simply a YouTube channel that focuses on specific subject matter and likely provides either education or commentary and opinion. Okay, so why do channels like this work on YouTube? I feel like we're all pretty familiar with this, but really what it comes down to is these channels thrive on specialization. They provide videos on the same topics or topics in a specific kind of genre. They tend to do it in the same format on a consistent recurring basis. And by providing content in the same subject area, in the same format on a consistent basis, these channels are like supercharging the YouTube algorithm with data about who they are and what they do and what kind of audience they should be serving their content to. Let's just talk about a few channels that I really love that I think fall into this category so you get a sense of what I mean. Okay, so one would be City Nerd. This is the channel about cities and transportation, but delivered in a very like dry humor, sarcastic kind of way. Very educational, but it is also a lot of like commentary and opinion for people interested in urbanism. Tiffany Ferg is a great one. I think if you like my channel, you would like love her videos because she has a show called Internet Analysis where she does commentary on like internet and social media culture. Finally, Cleo Abraham, I think another really cool example of her channel blew up in this past year. And she basically has a show called Huge If True, which is like optimistic science news and journalism. So these are all creators that have like very specific topics and subjects that they cover and ways that they do it. Like the format is very consistent as well. Once again, I feel like it's all about the consistency, the SEO, but also like having homepage worthy titles and thumbnails. Like it's not just about like tutorials that are optimized for search. These things are very like viral worthy as well. So I feel like a lot of people hear niche channel and they think like tutorials and it doesn't necessarily have to be that. Okay, so how do you grow with this type of channel? First of all, you have to have something that you are obsessed with. Because again, it's all about consistency. It's about hitting that same subject area again and again. And the only way you're gonna do that is if you talk about something that you're obsessed with, that you love. And then I think it's just very important again to be consistent in your subject area, your niche of course, but also your format. So who is a niche channel like best suited for? I think you need to be the kind of person that has a very specific passion that you are just obsessed with like reading about, researching about and like writing scripts about. So again, this is like really the opposite of a vlog channel type person who's very multi passionate, can't choose a certain topic. Cause again, to succeed in this type of channel, you have to just like go down the rabbit hole, be obsessed with, you know, science news or urbanism or internet culture or whatever. I also think this type of channel is great for someone who is a bit more private. This is kind of what I was mentioning before, like how a vlog channel really like exposes you in this way where you by necessity need to share your life, at least a bit of it. With a niche channel, like you really don't have to share much of your life at all if you don't want. For example, I've been watching City Nerd for like over a year now. And I have no idea if he has a spouse, has kids. And so if you're the kind of person that would really love to be a professional content creator, but you're scared about sharing more of your personal life, this type of approach can be perfect for you because you can be successful without always having like a vulnerability hangover. All right, let's take a look at this. So we have our three types of channels, video podcasts, vlog channels, and niche channels. These are the areas that I really see being successful and trendy going into 2025. All of these are valid options. It really just comes down to where your passions and interests lie and also what type of production style you think would suit you and your life the best. No matter what type of YouTube channel you choose as your strategy for growth, there is one universal truth about YouTube growth. And that is you need to learn to love the process. If you are looking for a get rich quick scheme or you're hoping to go viral overnight, I'm sorry to tell you, that's not what your YouTube growth journey is probably going to look like. It's probably gonna look like months of grinding and being consistent and learning and growing and getting better before you start to see the results that you're really hoping for. And I don't say that to discourage you. In fact, I hope that it has the opposite effect so that you know, you know, once you get to March or like May of this year and you're like, oh, I still don't have 100K subscribers. That is so normal. Like don't be hard on yourself. It's gonna take time, but it's so worth it. The more you create, the better you get at your craft. And in my mind, every video you post is just like another chance. Another chance to find a new viewer, another chance to show up at the homepage, another chance to surface in search results. So don't give up on yourself too easily and just know that it takes time and it takes practice, but good things in life take time. Okay, before you leave this video though, I want you to take the first essential step to getting your YouTube channel started this year. Choose a day to film your first video. Maybe it's tomorrow, maybe it's next week sometime, but put that day on your calendar and promise yourself that you're gonna do it. If you don't give yourself deadlines to be accountable to, then this is likely to become a dream that you're still thinking about starting next year. If you made it to this point in the video, my friend, you are a part of the elite end of the video club and I just wanna thank you for watching. And yeah, I'm just excited that you're here. I'm excited to see how you're gonna grow. I have a lot of big and exciting plans for my own YouTube channel and my own video podcast as well for this year. So I hope that you can come along for the journey. Make sure you're subscribed here and to the Creator Club podcast if you aren't already. And yeah, thank you so much for watching. As always, I hope that you are having adventures and following your dreams in 2025. And I will see you in my next video. Bye.",

Lost in navigating the business and community aspects of a church closure is the congregation's metamorphic spiritual, emo tional, and psychological journey. Subsequently, many church members are left to traverse unfamiliar feelings and stages of grief without an essential counseling forum . Ministry Context The Peninsula Baptist Association (PBA), previously a denominational entity, shifted its focus to being a network of churches throughout the southeastern region of Virginia. The PBA’s efforts are geared toward assisting people in churches with strategic pl anning, leadership development, youth and senior adult programs, and many other valuable resources. Ecclesiastes 3:1 -2 (E nglish Standard Version ) states, “There is a time for everything and a season for every activity under the heavens: a time to be born a nd a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot.” An unfortunate t rend within the PBA over the last few years is that several churches in their network are seemingly coming to the end of their season and are being “uprooted” or closing. There are myriad reasons why churches are closing annually, and the numbers are 1Bob Smietana, “Thousands of churches will likely close down. What happens to all that real estate,” RNS, March 15, 2024, https://religionnews.com/2024/03/15/thousands -of -churches -will -likely -close -down -what -happens - to -all -those -buildings. 2 steadily increasing. Some factors contributing to the totals have involved poor business decisions, decreased ministerial involvement, and evangelistic shortfalls within the community. Each time an announcement is made about a church closure, church leader ship groups within the PBA address the congregations about the current state of the church. Detailed plans are discussed concerning the necessary actions to ensure the proper transition of the church's assets, equipment, and financial resources. While chur ch assets are being addressed, the church members are not being tended to in as much detail. Congregations (sheep) have to fend for themselves to find new sources of spiritual manna (other churches). People are being left to navigate through their own feel ings of personal and spiritual loss, which includes a supposed displacement from family, friends, and community. The loss of the church building and its social components subjectively translates into a loss of life. These feelings manifest into different f orms of grief that should be proactively addressed by the PBA . Ministry Problem The problem this student is seeking to address is that the Peninsula Baptist Association in Newport News, Virginia, lacks counseling programs assisting members transition through the grief experienced by church closures. The word grief consists of overwhel ming feelings or ongoing reactions to loss. Grief can be both a universal or a personal experience. 2 Over the years, the PBA has made an exceptional amount of varying resources available to churches in their region. The PBA looks to sustain and reinvigorate ministerial operations and promote growth for new leaders through one -on -one coaching. While the PB A’s main emphasis is on equipping churches and planting new ones, they lack the ability to provide care and counseling to the church body of people who were once a part of their network of churches. 2“What Is Grief,” Mayo Clinic, October 19, 2016, https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient -visitor - guide/support -groups/what -is -grief . 3 The PBA maintained a misconception that former church members would naturally move on and find another church. However, people who are made aware of their church’s closure experience a sense of perceived loss similar to the loss of a loved one. Church closure grief begins to develop internally . As a result, people need more than to be advised of other churches in their area where they can continue to receive spiritual enrichment. The notification of a church’s closure negatively impacts people, causing them to struggle with grief -induced symptoms, which include sadness, despair, helplessness, anxiety, and social withdrawal. Since many are unaware of the underlying issue, church closure grief, they do not seek assistance and begin to disconnect themselves fro m the body of Christ. This crisis develops varying reactions in the person, creating an increased risk to their emotional and mental health. Counseling programs are beneficial not only to those grieving the loss of a family member or friend but also necessary for those grieving the perceived loss of church relationships once considered family, the loss of their ministerial role or purpose, and the loss of a communal bond. While the PBA cannot implement counseling programs as a remedy for grief, they should provide counseling resources to assist in preparing people to navigate through the varying stages of grief and help limit the effects of chur ch closures . Explanation and Justification of Micro -Projects The task was to select four micro -projects that would address the problem statement with the ultimate goal of finding a solution. The first micro -project was selected intentionally due to its interactive research component and the value of the data . Initially, no other predetermined selection s or order of the preceding micro -projects was conceive d. Once the first one was completed, the others were purposefully selected and placed in a precise order to strategically address and conceivably solve the problem statement. 4 Micro -Project One: Interviews and Analysis As a pastoral counselor, conversations are had with individuals to determine if there are any ongoing psychological or emotional issues that need to be resolved. Based on the dialogue, considerations are made on how to engage with the person on a path toward addressing the problem and coming to a n amendable outcome. This was the main reason for selecting Interviews and Analysis as the first micro -project. Church closure grief is very unfamiliar to many people. Stating that the PBA lacks counseling programs to assist people with this unfamiliar grief required proof that members of former vibrant churches within the PBA were even exper iencing this type of grief. The intent behind selecting this micro -project was to have an opportunity to meet with, ask questions, and analyze the responses of people who had dealt with the closure of their long -tenured church. Five people volunteered to be interviewed and were asked several questions regarding their experiences from when they were first notified of the closure and the period before and after the church closure was finalized. Their responses provided an emotional yet enlightening glimpse of the reality pertaining to church closure grief and its impact on those who endured the process. Multiple times during the course of the interview s, questions were placed aside to provide care and counseling to those who began t o display unanticipated emotions as they began to recollect their journey through the closure. This micro -project identified the issue within the problem statement and unquestionably revealed the existence of church closure grief and the need for counselin g resources to be made available within the PBA to assist those suffering from its exposure. 5 Micro -Project Two: Panel Discussions The information gathered within the Interviews and Analysis Micro -Project from those who experienced a church closure highlighted how different people suffer many forms of grief throughout the transition. The Panel Discussions Micro -Project was strategically selected as a follow -on project to continue the information -gathering process but in a different forum and from different people. Panel Discussions bring together people from varying groups to share and build upon other’s viewpoints. 3 Since the problem statement implies overlooked ministerial opportunities on behalf of the PBA, incorporating this micro -project allows key personnel within the PBA to be introduced to the issue and become involved in the process of developing probable solutions. Three groups of twelve panelists were selected to engage in dialogue concerning the data obtained from the first micro -project. The panelists comprised a diverse group of individuals throughout the PBA with different backgrounds and levels of experience d irectly connected with church closures in the past. They were presented with topics relevant to the problem statement regarding the ongoing crisis of church closure grief and asked to share their perspectives. Many thought -provoking questions were posed in dividually to panelists concerning future processes, congregational consoling, and best practices, producing compelling responses toward a desired resolution. Ideas and differing opinions on how to properly announce a church closure, disseminate informatio n, and provide counseling resources to congregations in an attempt to diminish the adverse effects were presented in an insightful manner. The panelist’s keen 3Angel Definis, “Moderate with Moderation: 10 Steps to Running a Successful Panel Discussion ,” Accessed June 11, 202 0,https://www.presentationxpert.com/moderate -with -moderation -10 -steps -to - running -a-successful -panel -discussion. 6 interaction provided excellent counseling initiatives and contributed to the selection of the latter two micro -projects. Micro -Project Three: YouTube Channel During the earlier micro -projects, awareness was gained by a select group of people concerning the grief endured by those who experienced the closure of their church and the need for counseling resources. Awareness continues to be the catalyst within the latter two micro - projects for a select group of people to address the problem statement , beginning with the implementation of a YouTube channel. With a target audience identified, those dealing with church closure grief, cultural and generational distinctions had to be considered to incorporate practical therapeutic resources as well as the platforms on which to deliver them. The YouTube Channel Micro -Project was the first platform selected to disseminate information and create an online presence that was nonexistent in this forum. YouTube channels reach a wide range of people, facilitating engagement, providing learning opportunities, and increasin g awareness and understanding regarding particular topics. Church closure grief care was not found on any YouTube channel. This micro -project provides the PBA with a social media presence customized to afford encouraging and hopeful resources for audiences dealing with psychological and spiritual struggles resulting from the transitory grief of their church’s closure. Many who suffer from this type of grief tend to isolate and distance themselves from community or religious events. The YouTube channel platf orm overcomes this pastoral counseling barrier by meeting people in the comfort of their surroundings versus having them come to a centralized location for assistance. As a viable solution to the problem statement, the YouTube channel was developed so that multiple instructional videos containing faith -based content and other interventions on 7 handl ing and cop ing with the effects of loss and the stages of grief can be continuously uploaded . A lack of understanding by the viewer and their retention could pose challenges when using online platforms to disseminate information. 4 The YouTube channel 's homepage contains an animated introductory video . This introduction serves to quickly grab an audience’s attention and give them an understanding of what is being made available . Micro -Project Four: Brochures Similar to the third micro -project, the Brochures Micro -Project was purposefully selected to promote counseling resources and maximize the PBA’s ability to solve the problem statement. The selection of this fourth micro -project was endorsed by panelists during the Panel Discussions Micro -Project. Even with the heightening popularity of the internet, developing and distributing brochures still remains popular due to their tangible nature. 5 Many people, regardless of whether they are tech -savvy or not, prefer hard -copy information that does not require using a computer or a smartphone to access. Effective pastoral care and counseling are evoked through personal interaction. It does not matter if a brochure is delivered to one person or a group of people dealing with grief; if it contains counseling resources explaining, comforting, and reassuring people regarding their current state, it d emonstrates a sense of empathy and establishes a rapport with the recipient. Additionally, printed materials allow people to carry the information with them and review it whenever needed for assistance. Three brochures were created within the scope of the problem statement. Each brochure was tailored to appeal to an intended audience regarding church closure grief, regardless of age 4James Young, “ So Is It Important to Have a YouTube Intro Maker ,” January 15 , 202 1, https://bunnystudio.com/blog/so -is -it -important -to -have -a-youtube -intro -maker . 5“Five Reasons Why Printed Brochures Are Still Important,” Hydra Creative, Accessed October 22, 2024, https://www.hydracreative.com/news/five -reasons -why -printed -brochures -are -still -important. 8 or physical location. The brochures encompass engaging designs, vibrant colors, stimulating graphics, and functional layouts. All these components are vital for gaining a reader’s attention and maintaining it to minister and make a lasting difference to th ose dealing with multiple forms of church closure grief . Conclusion As a pastoral counselor, assisting people in working through their circumstances by engaging in dialogue or providing a listening ear is a continuous and gratifying goal. The first two micro -projects created platforms for engagement and informational gathe ring on an individual level and within a group setting. Individually, this student sat down with people dealing with the emotional, mental, and spiritual impact of their church’s closure. Listening to their hearts, the Interviews and Analysis Micro -Project exposed and identified multiple forms of grief people had been experiencing unbeknownst to them over the years. In a group setting comprised of leaders and key personnel within the PBA, insight was collectively gained through the Panel Discussions Micro -Project into addressing the identified grief in direct correlation with the problem statement. With the data and resource suggestions attained from the previous two micro -projects, the following micro -projects will serve to effectively disseminate the information in two distinct manners that take into consideration culturally and generationally dive rse congregations. The YouTube Channel Micro -Project was chosen because it is the second most popular social media platform behind Facebook. 6 It allows numerous counseling resources to be accessed from one central location, enabling limitless information dissemination. The Brochures Micro -Project 6Josh Howarth, “Top 35 Social Media Platforms,” Exploding Topics, October 1 , 202 4, https://explodingtopics.com/blog/top -social -media -platforms . 9 provide s an opportunity for a more personal approach to distributing counseling resources either in person or via mail. All the micro -projects strategically selected for this portfolio took active approaches to address the problem statement. They initiated a call to action to identify the issues, develop beneficial and supportive counseling agendas, and then incorporate dif ferent measures to distribute them and progressively diminish the impact of church closure grief .10 CHAPTER 2 : MICRO -PROJECT ONE The first Micro -Project this student conducted to address the problem was Interviews and Analysis. This chapter will provide justification for the selection of the micro -project, an explanation of the process, a review of the data, and an overall analysis of its efficacy. Justification Senior pastors have varying roles in executing their duties in providing discipleship to church members. One particular yet overlooked component involves nurturing psychological or emotional breakdowns experienced by members through many of life’s demoralizing or disheartening expected or unexpected occurrences. As a result, th is student and pastor saw a need to become educated within the counseling field, which has led to the enrollment in a Doctor of Ministry and Pastoral Counseling degree program to help people navigate through various emotional, mental, and spiritually chall enging circumstances by providing care and counseling. It is prevalent to make counseling appointments available for individuals (one -on -one) to address specific issues or concerns they may have and to obtain guidance or comfort. Such an instance could include but not be limited to the passing of a family memb er or friend. It is rarely expected to make counseling programs available for church congregations as a whole to address overarching issues or concerns so that the masses receive guidance in transitioning through challenging events that impact the entire c hurch body. An example of this situation could include the distressing closing of a long -tenured church. For multiple years, the Peninsula Baptist Association has dealt with the regrettable reality of church closures within their region. Most congregations have moved beyond stability to a time 11 of breakdown or crisis. Their futures are uncertain. 7 There are varying reasons why churches have had to close; some include but are not limited to a church's decrease in finances, unforeseen developments of immorality within leadership, or an inability to sustain ministerial operations due to the elderly ag e of the church's members. In the past, when a church was designated for closure ; generally, most of the concern regarding the transition was focused on the financial, legal, and business aspects. As a result, the individual church members' emotional, mental, behavioral, and spiritual aspects are unconsciously overlooked. They are left in a crisis without resources to assist them in navigating through the impact of grief. While grief is not easy to define, people experience grief when formed deep connections – close relationships, for instance – are lost. 8 The problem is that the Peninsula Baptist Association in Newport News, Virginia, lacks counseling programs assisting members transition through the grief experienced by church closures. Th e Interviews and Analysis Micro -Project will assist in gathering information from individuals who may have suffered or are suffering from grief experienced by a church closure within the PBA. The word grief tends to be utilized in two different ways: (1) a collection of emotions, usually associated with loss; (2) a process or journey that follows a significant loss. 9 This project necessitates the development of multiple open -ended questions. These questions will serve as an attempt to ascertain individual experiences regarding emotional, cognitive, and behavioral expressions, or lack thereof, encountered by congregati onal members within this type of crisis. Since there is a transitory nature to grief, the answers of those selected to be 7William Chris Hobgood ,The Once and Future Pastor: The Changing Role of Religious Leaders , (Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Incorporated, 1998 ), v . 8Scott Floyd, Crisis Counseling: A Guide for Pastors and Professionals (Grand Rapids, MI: Kregel Publications, 2008 ), 80 . 9Ibid., 79 . 12 interviewed can expose points of failure within the transition or journey of church closures, impacting the emotional, mental, and spiritual well -being of people within the churches associated with the PBA. Multiple scriptures speak to the transitory needs of others in situations of grief and mourning. Matthew 5:4 states, “Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.” Grief relates to the thoughts and feelings that accompany a loss, but mourning is how feelings of grief are shown to the public. 10 These feelings of grief and mourning are to be comforted regardless of origin and expression. An analysis of their responses can reveal ongoing trends in familiarities, challenges, and pessimistic thinking induced by the crisis. The analysis can place the observer where the grieving person is and not where a person thinks they are or should be. External expectations for behavior cannot be placed upon them. 11 Since there is no universal mode of grieving, one person may be angry when another is sad, while another is in shock, struggling with anxiety over the loss. 12 At this point, measures can be considered by the PBA and then implemented to assist and comfort people through the different phases of the crisis, reestablish lost connections with other Christians, and gain a better perspective regarding their new season in God. This coincides with another aspect of grief called surviving and rebuilding. 13 In 1 Thessalonians 4:13, Paul instructs all to grieve but not as those without hope. This micro -project was purposefully chosen to identify trends that debilitate hope and then search for 10 Renee Deveney, Grief vs. Mourning: What is the Difference? (The Recovery Village, 2022) , https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/mental -health/grief/grief -vs -mourning. 11 H.

The data from this research project is essential because just as counseling sessions are necessary to assist those dealing with the emotional or psychological effects of the loss of a human body, effective counseling programs and practices must be implemen ted to help with any effects of the loss of a church body associated with future PBA church closures. Peer Review A logical way to address the problem is to hear directly from those who have been through church closures and explore their experiences and emotions. To lessen some of life's crises, congregations must be prepared for the changes they will experience. 14 Grief can appear differently and at different times (suddenly or gradually) throughout the closure process. 15 Dr. James Zabloski noted that a strength in the development of this project was that “defining grief for the reader shows that how one remediates grief will depend on their initial definition of it.” 16 His comments and the comments provided by peers throughout the progression of this project proved to be very beneficial. During the Organizational Phase, the project involved creating a list of 20 open -ended interview questions for five participants and properly analyzing each of their responses. Dr. Robert Clayton, one of the students enrolled in the class, made several int erviewing technique suggestions geared toward developing questions examining participants’ personal experiences concerning the church’s current status to understand the situation’s impact on their emotional, 14 Wright, The Complete Guide to Crisis & Trauma Counseling , 137 . 15 Ibid., 82. 16 James Zabloski, “ Discussion Thread: A Defensible Micro -Project, Professor Comments ,” January 23, 202 4. 14 mental, and spiritual state. Dr. Clayton referenced Tim Clinton and Ron Hawkins regarding grief: “Grieving is like entering the valley of shadows. It is not fun. It is painful. It is work. It is a lingering process.” 17 In doing so, Dr. Clayton connected this description of grief, in particular the valley, with Psalms 23:4, “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me” (NASB). He stated that “wandering away from God and fellowship with other believers is likely very prominent with church closures, and the following grief can be associated with a valley.” 18 Additionally, Dr. Clayton posed some insightful questions that helped analyze the perspective of the individual participant regarding the problem statement. He asked if the questions would “primarily focus on how the individual is feeling or felt during th e grieving process, or will your open -ended questions also include how the individual would have preferred to receive support from the Peninsula Baptist Association with their grief and what the PBA can do differently with future closures?” These questions expanded the focus beyond what the individual experienced to what they would have liked to experience in the form of support. This resulted in restructuring questions 17 through 20 in the Elaboration Phase to have the participants address what was needed to sustain those appropriately in the future. During the Implementation Phase, the 20 questions were administered to the participants one at a time. “Norman Wright states that to be seen as a person who cares and is sensitive and empathetic, language that conveys these feelings should be used.” 19 This is understandable, but a potential challenge encountered during one of the interviews was the impending shift from a 17 Tim Clinton & Ron Hawkins, The Quick -Reference Guide to Biblical Counseling (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books, 2009), 130. 18 Robert Clayton , “ Discussion Thread: A Defensible Micro -Project, Peer Response ,” January 24, 202 4. 19 Wright, The Complete Guide to Crisis & Trauma Counseling , 45 . 15 question -and -answer session to a counseling session. Many counselors have been taught to sympathize with a person when a past trauma or crisis in their life is brought up. However, this matter could shift the research project’s focus or extend the session longer than the time allotted by getting stuck on a particular question. Another peer, Mikhail Jackson, encouraged to demonstrate “empathy” and afford the individual(s) the opportunity to receive “counsel” after the session. 20 This would ensure the steady flow of the session within the designated timeframe. Being flexible and adaptable is a part of any successful project. 21 As part of the project, three churches within the PBA were initially selected as research models. One of the churches had already closed, and two were pending closure. While looking for causal differences concerning the closures, in grading comments from D r. Zabloski, he expressed a concern that the “questions and their (the participants) life experiences will not align.” 22 This brought the realization that developing questions for this project would be challenging, and the analysis would not be conclusive because of the skewed life experiences of the participants. The related term for the research is church closures; two ch urches had not closed yet. As a result, two of the churches previously identified in the Organizational Phase were replaced. One of the replacement churches closed due to a lack of ministry evangelism. The low attendance and funds could not sustain continu ed services. They gifted the church to a very prosperous local ministry. The second church dissolved the ministry due to the congregation's age and allowed a church plant collocated with them to have the building. The peer reviews were essential for adjust ing the project's focus and overcoming potential obstacles. 20 Mikhail Jackson , “ Discussion Thread: Collaborating and Advising, Peer Response ,” February 6 , 202 4. 21 George A. Bonanno , Anthony Papa, Kathleen Lalande, Maren Westphal, and Karin Coifman. “The Importance of Being Flexible: The Ability to Both Enhance and Suppress Emotional Expression Predicts Long - Term Adjustment.” Psychological Science 15, no. 7 (2004): 48 5. 22 James Zabloski, “Organization Phase Assignment , Professor Comments ,” January 28, 202 4. 16 Implementation Conducting interviews with those at the front lines of a problem and analyzing their responses provides information and insight beneficial for developing a solution concerning the lack of counseling programs assisting members transition through the grief e xperienced by church closures. The interview process aimed to document people’s experiences, self - understanding, and working models in an attempt to make meaning of these phenomena at levels of analysis beyond simple descriptions of what we heard. 23 Process The PBA was informed of this research project, and they stated a willingness to cooperate. As a result, an informal request for church closures within the last seven years was submitted to the PBA. Although the association's name suggests that it is only m ade up of Baptist churches, the PBA also has a mixture of Nondenominational and Protestant churches. Three churches were identified and selected due to their comparable circumstances in relation to the problem statement. The churches were named by a geogra phic location as part of a privacy agreement with the PBA. Downtown Church -1 closed due to a lack of ministry evangelism, low attendance, and funds that could not sustain continued services. They gifted the church to a local ministry. Town Center Church -2 held its last service in the Summer of 2019. The congregation comprised 25 to 35 members between the ages of 65 and 93. After a vote early in the year, the congregation decided to gift the church to another younger church. Midtown Church -3 dissolved the mi nistry due to the congregation's age and allowed a church plant collocated with them to have the building. 23 Ruthellen Josselson, Interviewing for Qualitative Inquiry: A Relational Approach (First edition )(New York: Guilford Press, 2013 ), 2 .ProQuest Ebook Central , http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/liberty/detail.action?docID=1137446. 17 The initial petition to the PBA also included a request for church leadership and member contact information from the selected churches, such as phone numbers, addresses, and emails. While the PBA may have been more familiar with the potential participants , using the PBA to expedite the process as a third -party contact could have negatively impacted the research due to their lack of investment or knowledge of the project. 24 As a result, the PBA was not involved in selecting or contacting the five participants chosen to be scheduled for interviews. The participants were not chosen haphazardly. They were selected because of their unique association with the church and their ch urch involvement. They were provided with pseudonyms to respect their privacy as well. 25 All the participants were provided with 20 open -ended questions 48 hours beforehand so they would be prepared to address the validity of the problem statement through their responses. The participants from Downtown Church -1 were Amy Wade 26 and Jesse Braden. 27 The two participants from Town Center Church -2 were Sharon Parker 28 and Bill Royce. 29 The one participant from Midtown Church -3 was Anita Stevens. 30 All interview appointments, except for one, were conducted face -to -face. Due to cancellation and rescheduling challenges, the interview with Anita Stevens was conducted 24 Irving Seidman, Interviewing as Qualitative Research: A Guide for Researchers in Education and the Social Sciences (Third edition. New York: Teachers College Press, 2006 ), 46 . 25 James Zabloski, “ How to Conduct Interviews,” Module 2, January 22, 2024, https://canvas.liberty.edu/courses/588495/files/99812071?module_item_id=61350883 . 26 Amy Wade, interview by Marcel Berrios, In Person, February 6, 2024. 27 Jesse Braden, interview by Marcel Berrios, In Person, February 8, 2024. 28 Sharon Parker interview by Marcel Berrios, In Person, February 7, 2024. 29 Bill Royce, interview by Marcel Berrios, In Person, February 5, 2024. 30 Anita Stevens, interview by Marcel Berrios, Telephonically, February 13, 2024. 18 telephonically. The option of conducting the interview via Zoom meetings was not feasible because she was not knowledgeable in the application’s use. An alternate timeframe for her to come to the church for a face -to -face interview could not be established because she did not have the means to travel. Furthermore, she was not comfortable having someone in her home. While structure was desired during the interviews, participants were made to feel at ease. A classroom instead of an office was utilized. A desk can connote formality and power relations, and it is best not to have such a large piece of furniture between b oth parties. 31 The classroom where the interviews were hosted had a security camera recording 24/7 without sound. This room was chosen not only for the comfort of the participants but also to protect the interviewer from any possible false allegations of misconduct or i nappropriate gestures toward any participant in private. In order to thoroughly analyze all their responses for trends regarding their individual grief, the interviews were audibly recorded, and their responses were transcribed verbatim. 32 The Voice Memos app on an iPhone was used to record the interview because it provided the clear sound needed for transcription. During the interview, the phone was placed in airplane mode to avoid possible interruptions due to incoming calls or texts. Even after methodical planning and preparation, interviewing participants can cause them to become hesitant or uncomfortable with the notion of being involved in an interview that might trigger them to relive past experiences or express vulnerability to a stranger. In order to avoid this, the selected participants were reassured about the purpose of the research. Trust also played a key factor. It was essential for them to understand why they were selected to be involved in this research and how their infor mation would be used and of value. A conversational partnership 31 Ruthellen Josselson, Interviewing for Qualitative Inquir y, 55 . 32 Zabloski, “ How to Conduct Interviews.” 19 was adopted so the participant felt understood and accepted. 33 This also conveyed the interviewer’s respect for the participant’s distinct experience, knowledge, and perspective that is not interchangeable with anyone else. 34 This consideration established a rapport between strangers by bridging an honest understanding between the project's value and the participant’s input. Parameters The participants were selected for their willingness to share their experiences in alignment with the research. They were also selected to gauge a different perspective from those with varied associations with the churches to determine if being leaders, ministry participants, or long -tenured members had any opposing effect on grief. Such links among people whose individual lives are different but affected by common structural and so cial forces can help distinguish patterns in that experience. 35 Only then can an analysis of their behavioral expressions or lack thereof be considered as a connection or direct cause resulting from the church’s status. All the participants were given 20 open -ended questions broken into four categories to collect information and experiential insight. In order to be seen as a person who cares and is sensitive and empathetic, careful language was used to convey this feeling .36 Buffers were used between questions, so the participants did not feel like this interview was an interrogation. If the participant’s response was negative, a statement of remorse with a positive twist was used as a 33 Herbert J. Rubin , and Irene Rubin ,Qualitative Interviewing: The Art of Hearing Data .(Third edition ) (Thousand Oaks, Calif: SAGE, 2012 ), 7 . 34 Ibid. 35 Seidman, Interviewing as Qualitative Research , 52 . 36 Wright, The Complete Guide to Crisis & Trauma Counseling , 45 . 20 buffer: “I am so sorry you had to experience that, but I am glad you have been able to speak about it today.” This avoids a systematic question -and -answer session without any human relation. Themes The participants’ responses varied in nature but had many similarities concerning their experiences and how those experiences affected them emotionally, psychologically, and spiritually. It was striking how their journeys were so similar, yet their transit ions were uniquely different. In order to fully convey the interview experience along with the participants’ responses, a narrative analysis was incorporated in this section to make sense of each story by looking for interpretations connecting each one’s j ourney in an insightful manner. 37 During the interview, the participants were asked to define “crisis and grief” within questions 15 and 16. These terms were presented to them to ascertain if they relate to their closure experiences. Grief responses express feelings about loss, protest a l oss, and a desire to change what happened and have it not been true, as well as the devastating impact of it. 38 A crisis is defined in various ways but is generally known as a crucial time and a turning point in the development of something decisive. 39 These questions were provided in the latter part of the interview. The reasoning was to ensure the participants’ responses were unbiased and not subliminally coerced by introducing the terms at the beginning of the interview. This could have caused these t erms to become the foundation or focus for all their following responses. The goal was to observe if, in the end, after 37 Mike Rucker, 3 Straightforward Methods for Analyzing Qualitative Interview Data , January 11, 2016. https://unstick.me/3 -straightforward -methods -for -analyzing -qualitative -interview -data . 38 Wright, The Complete Guide to Crisis & Trauma Counseling , 83 . 39 Floyd, Crisis Counseling , 25 . 21 discussing their situations, they would associate these terms with what they had been reflecting on throughout the interview and not as a result of loaded or leading questions directing them toward a predetermined conclusion. Dr. Zabloski advised, “Be very mindful not to go into these interviews with your answers or mindset already established. You are not seeking vilification of what you believe or think people feel. That kind of bias will skew all your data collection and analysis.” 40 These were their responses when asked to define crisis : Church -1, Amy Wade Things will change. They are no longer stable and safe, but I do not think of the church in a crisis. Church -1, Jesse Braden I do not visualize it so much as a crisis, you know. Because I left with sad feelings but joyous feelings when I did get into a church I enjoyed. So, there was no stop in between. So, I do not feel like it was such a crisis. Church -2, Sharon Parker Panic. Something is wrong. Something has to be dealt with. Church -2, Bill Royce Well, a crisis is a serious situation. It is something that often means getting ready for a situation where something has to be done. It is a change point, and in the church, it is when you reach a point where you or somebody has to do something. It cannot go on. It has to be taken care of. That is a crisis to me in the church. You put it in God's hands, but something has to be done. As you have reached that point where it is a crisis, you have to do something about it. So that is the w ay I think of that in the church. I guess we knew there was a crisis coming. Some people thought we had a crisis, but I do not think we actually had a crisis. Church -3, Anita Stevens Well, I relate it to family, probably like health problems. In the triage assessment model, a counselor assesses an individual’s crisis responses in three domains: affective (emotional), cognitive (thinking), and behavioral (actions). 41 40 James Zabloski, “ Justification Phase Assignment , Professor Comments ,” January 18 , 202 4. 22 Interestingly, while three participants considered the word crisis comparable to their experience with the church closure, none of them associated the closures as falling into the category of actually being a crisis. They used associative verbiage but did not connect them in the same manner. A crisis usually involves a temporary loss of coping abilities, meaning any emotional dysfunction is reversible. 42 While interpreting their responses within this question alone, all of the participants could have been demonstrating an ability to enact effective coping skills. Most crises connote a negative or problematic state, event, or series of events or an unstable time period with an uncertain outcome. 43 Amy Wade related a crisis with this same definition by stating she felt “no stability or safety.” However, she did not consider the church’s situation as negative or as a crisis. Additionally, her loss of desire to interact with others falls under the dom ain of behavioral response to a crisis. Jesse Braden's use of the words “sad feelings,” Sharon Parker’s use of “panic,” Bill Royce’s “serious situation,” and Anita Steven’s depiction of a “health problem” are similar in negative or problematic connotations as well. These responses fall under the domain of affective and cognitive crisis responses. Comparably, the participants could have ignored or were unaware they were in crisis mode. Those who deny reality have a hard time coping with a crisis because it is their attempt to avoid pain and anger. 44 41 Alan A .Cavaiola, and Joseph E. Colford ,\"Crisis Intervention Models: An Exploration of Historical and Contemporary Models .\" In Crisis Intervention: A Practical Guide ,17 . Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc., 2018. https://doi.org/10.4135/9781544327457. 42 Floyd, Crisis Counseling , 25 . 43 Ibid., 24 . 44 Wright, The Complete Guide to Crisis & Trauma Counseling , 139 . 23 The outcome of a crisis, whether positive or negative, is a function of the nature of the crisis itself combined with the person’s ability to make appropriate and healthy adjustments during and following the crisis. 45 Further analysis of their responses to the other questions will provide a better understanding of the different types of crises they could have been unknowingly experiencing, including developmental, situational, existential, interpersonal, and spiritual crises. 46 When asked to define grief , the responses to this question provided a common thread; all five participants associated grief with their own unique church closure experience. Grief is a collection of feelings related to some notable distress. These feelings may include sadness, hurt, fear, confusion, anger, and frustration, along with many other possible emotions. 47 Amy Wade’s initial response to this question was sadness, and she immediately made the connection with the church. This was the same case with Jesse Braden. She never provided a definition for grief, but she immediately made the connection of the term gri ef to her experience. Sharon Parker used sadness as well, but she provided a new perspective. Most of the participants expressed grief toward the end when the churches were finally closing. She grieved the process that brought her to the decision of the end. Sharon Parker griev ed the decline in the number of family and friends who no longer attended, but when it came to the closure, she grieved with hope [as Paul stated within 1 Thessalonians 4:13] because she saw “God's handprint over this.” So, yes, there was sadness of a loss , but she also saw “the gain in it for His Kingdom.” 45 Floyd, Crisis Counseling , 38 . 46 Ibid., 26 -27 . 47 Ibid., 79 . 24 Bill Royce introduced the terms sorrow and loss. Loss is the separation from or removal of something meaningful to an individual. Loss can be subtle, and while Bill Royce did not connect crisis to his experience, keep in mind that underlying a crisis is a loss of some kind; therefore, crisis and loss go hand in hand. 48 Anita Steven reflected on the “loss of a husband” and related it to the church due to “memories” shared. At the heart of a crisis is loss —loss to separation from or removal of something meaningful to an individual. 49 Translation A researcher’s life, feelings, emotions, intellect, and history become a viable part of presenting the participants’ stories, and to that extent, the researcher “translates” the life experiences for the reader using his or her own unique language. 50 The goal of this student was to translate the following three sections of questions through a narrative using an analogy of quilting and tapestry. Antique quilts carry pieces of history and can evoke powerful emotions. They are often passed down through families as heirlooms. 51 At some point, these quilts will require a repair or restorative process, which necessitates the removal of individual pieces of fabric and threads and repositioning them in a manner that reproduces facets of the old while incorporating the new. 48 Wright, The Complete Guide to Crisis & Trauma Counseling , 129 . 49 Mike Rucker, 3 Straightforward Methods for Analyzing Qualitative Interview Data , January 11, 2016. https://unstick.me/3 -straightforward -methods -for -analyzing -qualitative -interview -data . 50 James Zabloski, \"Gifted Dropouts: A Phenomenological Study .\" Order No. 3404751, Liberty University, 2010. In PROQUESTMS Dissertations & Theses @ Liberty University; ProQuest Central; ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global; Social Science Premium Collection, 79. 51 Lukas Kowalewski, How to Care For and Repair Vintage and Antique Quilts ,March 13, 2021. https://runawayquilting.com/blogs/blog/how -to -care -for -and -repair -vintage -and -antique -quilts. 25 Cutting threads can weaken the structure and lead to more damage; therefore, careful planning and significant time are paramount for a rewarding outcome. 52 Through the participants’ shared experiences, the identified churches all started as beautiful quilts that became a part of history and tradition passed on to each participant from generation to generation. Some of the questions were developed to gain know ledge of their situations and any perceived measures taken by the church leadership or external organizations during their transition. These questions provided an initial picture, a “Tapestry of Resilience,” of the church and the participants before the ne ed for repair and restoration. The questions involved looking at the participants' emotional, mental, behavioral, and spiritual state prior to the closure to determine points of origin to measure against. All five participants shared that their tenure with the churches ranged from 29 to 77 years. Amy Wade, Jesse Braden, and Sharon Parker total over 225 years of committed connection to their church ministries. All participants were involved in some form of m inistry. Bill Royce “had been on every committee and chairman of almost all the committees.” Jesse Braden shared about the days when helping with Wednesday evening meals had “about 175 people in attendance.” Sharon Parker shared how “every room in [her] ch urch” had a class she had participated in while teaching full -time and part -time. Each participant shared memories of rich history and a thriving and resilient church amongst family and friends. The focus of the second set of questions shifts to the individual’s personal experiences regarding the notification and handling of the closure. The goal was to determine if any trends were needed or called for grief counseling measures to facilitate the t ransition of this phase. While quilting involves putting pieces together, the repair process involves delicately 52 Kowalewski, How to Care For and Repair Vintage and Antique Quilts . 26 disconnecting the individual pieces from one formed entity before reconnecting them to other pieces to create a new entity. While it can be time -consuming or even tedious, the proper and careful handling of the threads will prove vital to ensure the thread s can intertwine with different or new threads. This “Tapestry of Repair” coincides with how the participants felt they should have been dealt with during the church closure. This process is vital to ensure the church members' emotional, mental, and spirit ual welfare. The participants’ responses show that they, like the threads, were not handled properly, and some ended up stretched, frayed, cut, and damaged to the point of induced or self -induced ostracization. The participants used words that can be compared or fit into the category of being stretched, frayed, cut, and damaged to the point of induced or self -induced ostracization. Church -1, Amy Wade Sadness. Loss. Losing stability. Felt Guilty for excluding herself from the final service. Church -1, Jesse Braden Confusion. Sad. Felt let -down. Grief. Church -2, Sharon Parker Sadness. Grief. Church -2, Bill Royce Wrestle with the situation. Confusing. Sad. Turned loose [abandoned]. Sorrow. Loss. Grief. Church -3, Anita Stevens Sad. Was not too happy. Felt she did not have a choice -lack of control. A common thread for all of their responses, other than the previously noted grief, was the feeling of sadness at one point or another throughout the transition and after the church closure process. Sadness is a symptom of grief and a normal response, but j ust like many other symptoms, it can worsen over time. In Amy Wade’s case, while she expressed feelings of sadness, her behavioral response of not showing up to the final service appears to have induced feelings of guilt, which tend to cause people to blame themselves for the difficulties and immobilize themse lves even more, thus the 27 self -induced ostracization. 53 Bill Royce had a similar behavioral response to Amy Wade's, but it originated from a different feeling. He felt turned loose [or abandoned]. This coincides with induced ostracization, which is similar to Anita Steven’s feeling of not having a choice [lack of control or surrender]. These two participants felt forced into a situation. In Jesse Braden’s case, her response of being let down is a form of disappointment, meaning things did not go as expected. The delicacy needed to keep her from being frayed or cut emotionally was not taken in her case. When it comes to Sharon Parker, something very different is revealed. What was unique about Sharon Parker was that her emotions caught her off guard as she began to cry when responding to a question regarding what occurred during the last service at the ch urch. She was extremely happy regarding the decision, but since it was unpopular, she had been suppressing her emotions due to her guilt for being happy. This created an “existential crisis” for her. Sharon Parker had been experiencing an inner conflict an d anxieties that accompany important human issues of responsibility. 54 While none expressed any affliction or decrease in spirituality, Amy Wade responded that she chose to “stop coming to the church,” including the final service, because she “needed something more.” This would convey a desire for an increase in spirituality, given her state and the state of the church at the time. However, probing into her responses more, she mentioned that it had been six years since the church's closing, yet she was still “slowly getting involved.” At the same time, all the other participan ts had already joined other churches and were actively engaged in different ministries. Her behavioral response could be interpreted as the church 53 Wright, The Complete Guide to Crisis & Trauma Counseling , 139 . 54 Floyd, Crisis Counseling , 27 . 28 closure having a negative impact on her, causing her to experience a spiritual crisis. A spiritual crisis has the potential to lead a person into a deeper, more intimate relationship with God or may result in a person’s turning away from God. 55 Toward the end of the interviews, questions were developed to gain insight into the participant’s desired assistance relating to the church closure. Within these final questions, the counselee becomes the counselor. Their responses provide ideas to resolve some of the facets associated with the problem statement and the failing points they experienced. Meticulous planning and a substantial amount of interest and time spent on this theme of “Tapestry Restoration” are paramount for facilitating better transit ions during church closures. Binding the quilt is the final step, which involves covering the fabric's raw edges and sewing them. The participants were asking for a covering. Due to Sharon Parker’s husband's position and her ministerial involvement, it seemed she had more intimate insight into the situation than some of the other participants. Within these questions of restoration, Sharon Parker brought up the term counseling. She noted that “some type of counseling would have been the thing needed.’’ She stated that the church members were left to counsel each other without external support. Jesse Braden conveyed the same sentiments when she expressed the need “to tell people y ou are losing this, but you are gaining this.” The need for transitional counseling was an ongoing theme not just for the individual but the entire church as a whole. Another restorative process addressed was how the handling or passing of information was viewed differently. Four participants shared that “there was a lot of talk” about the church closure, but nothing definitive was passed on other than just “word of mou th.” Bill Royce stated 55 Floyd, Crisis Counseling , 27 . 29 that the manner in which the information was passed “could have been better.” The only person with a different take on the situation was Anita Stevens, who said all the information was passed along “in a business meeting.” Interestingly, all participants a greed that the PBA did play a limited role by only discussing “how to handle things legally.” However, beyond that, nothing else was provided to assist them with all the other aspects of the transition. After the individual church closures, many participants stated their intentional desire to stay connected to old friends using creative ways. Amy Wade “sends Christmas cards and other things.” Sharon Parker and Bill Royce shared how they continue to meet o nce a month, on the first Tuesday, for lunch with a group from the old church. For Anita Stevens, it was not as challenging. She did lose contact with some people, but she stated that most of everybody would stay and be a part of the new church plant. Jesse Braden shared how challenging it was even though she had their contact information; the problem was that “everybody had a busy life, and many passed on.” She can be categorized as someone experiencing an interpersonal crisis. Interpersonal crises can lead to either positive or negative outcomes, including relationship growth, relationship strain, or relationship termination. 56 Finally, many positive and encouraging trends were also in the participants’ responses. Collectively, all the participants highlighted the importance of awareness. Whether it was on the part of the individual or the PBA, seek out information and give out i nformation in order to maintain a high level of awareness. The need for prayer was also emphasized and encouraged throughout the interview process. They all said they prayed a lot and encouraged those about to embark on a church 56 Floyd, Crisis Counseling , 27 . 30 closure to do the same. Bill Royce shared his deep prayers for guidance. He prayed that God would take his hand, show him the truth, and guide him on what he should do and how he should act. He asked God to please forgive him if he should fail because he w as trying to listen. Even after all of this, he said he could have prayed more. Jesse Braden shared her optimism when discussing her new church and how “very welcoming and warm” the people were, so she decided to make that her new church family. Anita Stevens and Sharon Parker acknowledged that everything would work out after a while and to trust in God no matter what. Bill Royce also shared realism when he said, “You are not going to make everyone happy.” One of his most positive and unexpected responses was when he stated, “We did not close the church. We feel like we dedicated it to somebody else.” This was a compelli ng statement. One to be considered when implementing strategies toward helping people cope with future church closures. He stated that the “closing was not a downer.” He thought of it more as an upper. It was a celebration of hope for the new church. Bill Royce, like Sharon Parker, was grieving but with hope. He was sharing words of encouragement to assist others, including himself, in being hopeful while transitioning through a difficult time. Bill Royce saw the transition in a different light. Transition is psychological and also more about a journey and how to get there. 57 Like the tapestry metaphor, their stories intersected like threads, each unique in nature, woven together from opposite directions to form a tapestry that tells a story of their journey through a 57 Jim Tomberlin, and Bird, Warren ,Better Together: Making Church Mergers Work -Expanded and Updated . Minneapolis, Minnesota: 1517 Media, 2020 , 116 . 31 wilderness experience. 58 An experience that all five participants shared. Their stories indicate a need for counseling programs to be made available during these and possibly other transitional situations. They provide affirmation to the problem statement. While the PBA does not have counseling programs currently available for those churches that may, at some point, have to transition through a closure, the content within these interviews provides valuable insight and suggestions to an ongoing dilemma facing many church congregations. These participants expressed how vital it is to overcome the emotional and mental impacts of a church closure more healthily and beneficially throughout the process. An appreciation for the participant's willingness to open up b y sharing their personal experiences was shown by providing them with a written thank you letter a couple of days after the interview. 59 The common theme throughout the entire interview process was the integral support needed from the PBA to assist congregations in transitioning through grief or any other emotional, psychological, and spiritually draining experience encountered from a closi ng church within the association. While some solutions have been identified within this project, they must still be focused on and targeted correctly for future assistance with the appropriate resources and programs for those afflicted by church closures. Analysis of the Micro -Project Incorporating Interviews and Analysis as the first micro -project provides a foundation of valuable data for building and engaging future projects. All of the interviews maximized the participants’ knowledge and experience. Initially, getting some participants to elaborate on a 58 Milkah Mildred, The Art of Discovery: Weaving the Tapestry of Life's Journey, September 5, 2023. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/art -discovery -weaving -tapestry -lifes -journey -milkah -mildred. 59 Ruthellen Josselson, Interviewing for Qualitative Inquiry , 177. 32 question without leading them was challenging. Questions had to be restated slowly in an attempt to gather additional information. Transcribing their responses word for word took a lot of work. Adding punctuation while keeping what they were saying due to improper wording, grammar, tense, or sentence structure posed challenges. Conversational text and written text are very different. Quoting just a line or two differs from transcribing a whole conversation. Overall, it was a good experience, and everything went well. Initially, participants were apprehensive, but as the interview process continued, participants began getting more comfortable. Many stated how grateful they were to be a part of the research. They shared how it was needed and looked forward to its complet ion. This entire project and its process will prove valuable to the success of this research. Such detailed follow -up work may have seemed onerous to the interviewer; however, equity requires such considerations. 60 Based on their responses, all the participants questioned experienced some form of emotional, psychological, or spiritual transition. Life is full of many transitions, with periods of moving from one state of certainty to another, with an interval of uncer tainty and change in between. 61 The use of this micro -project was critical in introducing and highlighting transitional matters. The Interviews and Analysis project affirmed the problem statement that the PBA lacks counseling programs assisting church members in transitioning through th e grief experienced by church closures. Then, it exposed additional underlying factors other than grief that must be addressed to facilitate all congregational members' emotional, mental, and spiritual well -being. 60 Seidman, Interviewing as Qualitative Research , 50 . 61 Wright, The Complete Guide to Crisis & Trauma Counseling ,139 . 33 The participants’ responses within the project also identified some essential measures to be considered and incorporated within the transitional process of future church closures. While gathering information through the Interviews and Analysis Micro -Project achieved significant data relatable to the problem statement, it also offered the participants a voice. Many people do not overcome the challenges of a church closure. Without the necessary support systems in place, numbers immediately increase. This proje ct allowed participants to voice their actual needs and not the perceived needs of their welfare. Before 2020, 2% of congregations each year voted (or were required) to close; that number likely increased due to the COVID -19 pandemic. 62 Church closures are not unique situations. Each year, at least four thousand Protestant churches in the United States close their doors forever. 63 With such daunting statistics and the data obtained through this project, quality assurance measures will need to be researched by the PBA in order to identify and address the totality of church closure transitions and not just the business aspects. These measures can instill hope in the eyes of those downtrodden or frustrated by the closure and foster unity and community relations throughout the body of believers. A couple of the participants expressed their frustrations concerning the church leadership’s interests only being associated with desires to keep or manage a building and maintain old traditions instead of allowing younger generations to infuse life within the existing tapestry. Jesse Braden shared that the feelings were that the people were “in love with [the] building and do not want to change. There were so many changes the young people that were there wanted to do, and everything was just put down. So, they left to find a church that would 62 Tomberlin and Warren ,Better Together , xix . 63 Ibid., 34 . 34 do these things.” Sharon Parker shared that “the building itself was so old, just maintaining it was becoming costly.” This micro -project also revealed that no church [and the people who make up the church] wants to close, nor does it want to live in ongoing maintenance mode. 64 With that stated, preparations are necessary when there are no means to maintain church operations. As a result, the “legal” aspects, as noted by the participants, will not be the only concerns throughout the transition process. Like the antique quilts, p eople need ministering to help everyone transition to healthy places of ministry and service, to begin new chapters together or in another church. 65 A change management specialist, William Bridges, states: It is not the changes that do you in, it is the transitions. 66 Many of the participants have transitioned, but they were left on their own to do so. We have rituals such as funerals (celebration of life) for some objective losses but do not have anything similar for subjective, threatened, or ambiguous losses. 67 The initial analysis of the participant ’s responses to these questions shows a need for transitionary ritual — counseling programs developed to assist in grieving the losses while remaining steadfast in the hope of newness . 64 Tomberlin and Warren ,Better Together , xix , 179 . 65 Ibid. 66 Ibid., 115 . 67 Floyd, Crisis Counseling , 77 . 35 CHAPTER 3 : MICRO -PROJECT TWO The second Micro -Project this student conducted to address the ministry problem was Panel Discussions. Th is chapter will justif y the significance of this micro -project as a follow -on and provide a summary of the panel discussions and panelists’ suggestions that led to the selection of the latter two micro -projects. Justification Due to social and cultural changes, as well as economic pressures and low attendance, many churches, regardless of denomination or affiliation, continue to struggle to keep their doors open and maintain their ministries fully operational. This shift has ca used numerous church leadership groups to deliberate whether or not they will cease to continue having regular services. This can cause multiple options to be considered, one of which can be selling or gifting the church building, thus ending the church’s existence. Another option of consideration by the church leadership group would be merging with another church as a means of life support yet still losing the church’s identity. The announcement of a church’s closure tends to critically affect the psychology and spirituality of church members. Based on findings from the first micro -project, data revealed that many people who were members of long -tenured churches within the Peninsula Baptist Association had been negatively impacted by their church’s closure, causing them to suffer some form of emotional, mental, behavioral, or spiritua l grief. These effects were associated with the loss of not only a church building but also a perce ived loss of their church family, purpose, and function. Transitioning through the impact of loss affects people on multiple levels. Feelings of loneliness or abandonment set in, causing some of the participants to isolate themselves 36 throughout and after the transition. Even though loss is a common human experience, it is nevertheless difficult to endure, especially when it is a product of grief. 68 Many nondenominational and denominational churches within Hampton Roads are affiliated with the PBA. The PBA provides business and ministerial resources for pastors and churches within its regional network. While these resources lend themselves to the oper ational well -being of the individual churches and some discipleship development for church members, the findings from the first micro -project upheld that there is a lapse in another critical component in the development and sustainment of congregations. Th e mental and emotional health of the church members, specifically as it pertains to dealing with grief due to church closures, is seemingly being omitted as a resource. The problem is that the Peninsula Baptist Association in Newport News, Virginia, lacks counseling programs assisting members in transitioning through the grief experienced by church closures. People often encounter situations that cause them to experience a form of crisis or trauma in their lives. As a Doctor of Ministry candidate in Pastoral Counseling, integrating concepts learned provides an opportunity to introduce wellness programs within traditional and faith - based counseling frameworks to individuals and organizations needing therapeutic care. Identifying and incorporating effective counseling techniques and programs throughout the PBA can help limit the grief experienced by church closur es. Whether introducing a new concept, disseminating facts, or showing different points of view, Panel Discussions are a way to get people thinking in a new direction. 69 By utilizing Panel 68 Scott Floyd, Crisis Counseling: A Guide for Pastors and Professionals (Grand Rapids, MI: Kregel Publications, 2008 ), 77 . 69 Angel Definis, “Moderate with Moderation: 10 Steps to Running a Successful Panel Discussion ,” Accessed June 11, 202 0,https://www.presentationxpert.com/moderate -with -moderation -10 -steps -to - running -a-successful -panel -discussion. 37 Discussions, a pool of administrators within the PBA, local pastors, and key personnel with firsthand experience involved in this type of crisis can engage in dialogue, answer questions, and share their perspectives on addressing the multiple issues and co ncerns brought to the forefront by congregational members in an attempt to resolve the problem. There are five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. 70 The comments and emotions expressed by the participants within the Interviews and Analysis Micro -Project revealed how all had been impacted by their church's closure, causing them to experience one or more of these stages and suffer some form of psychological, behavioral, or spiritual grief. Helping churches with the practical work involved in a church closure is critical. However, helping people navigate through these stages is just as critical. The goal of the Panel Discussions was to formulate thought -provoking questions around these stages, soliciting responses that will produce viable strategies to better equip the PBA to identify and implement therapeutic care and counseling programs before, during, and after a church's closure and overcome counseling shortfalls related to the transitional grief experienced by members within its partnerships. Proverbs 11:14 (NIV) says, \"For lack of guidance a nation falls, but victory is won through many advisers.\" The announcement of a church's closure tends to critically affect the psychology and spirituality of church members, causing them to perceive it as a fall. This verse rationalizes that defeat is not contained within the fall but within the failure to gather around those willing to provide guidance. Scripture also teaches that using wise counsel helps to seek 70 Elisabeth Kubler -Ross, and David Kessler. On Grief and Grieving: Finding the Meaning of Grief Through the Five Stages of Loss (New York, NY: Scribner, 2014 ), 7 . 38 God’s best for everyone by considering all sides of issues. 71 Proverbs 15:22 states, “Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counselors, they are established.” The Panel Discussions Micro -Project offered an opportunity to seek wise counsel from seasoned leadership and experienced advisors to establish counseling programs of victory in the PBA. Peer Review The first micro -project involved interviewing people who had experienced church closures to see if the problem statement was substantiated. During the interviews, all five participants expressed having to deal with some form of grief. The second micro -project involved selecting, recruiting, and obtaining twelve people to commit to serve as a group of panelists in search of proper ways to close churches, manage the grief associated with the closure, and dissemination of informational resources, all in an att empt to diminish the emotional, mental, and behavioral effects of grief. Panel discussions can be an incredibly insightful exchange of ideas concerning this topic. 72 The goal was to engage all the selected panelists in productive dialogue, gaining different viewpoints that benefit those suffering the transitory grief of church closures. During the Justification Phase, it was submitted that the panel's original cast wou ld consist of twelve different panelists, including PBA administrators, local pastors, and key leaders. Dr. Zabloski asked if the “panelists would primarily consist of leaders.” 73 A good panel will include a diverse range of panelists with differing opinions since this is the key to an interesting and stimulating 71 Arlan Miller, “Biblical Decision Making Part 5: Wise Counsel ,” March 27, 2019 , https://accounseling.org/spiritualgrowth/decisionmaking/biblical -decision -making -principles -wise -counsel. 72 Phil Cooke, “How To Host A Great Panel Discussion ,” February 6, 2018, https://outreachmagazine.com/features/leadership/26263 -host -great -panel -discussion.html. 73 James Zabloski, “ Justification For Selected Micro -Project Assignment , Professor Comments ,” March 20, 202 4. 39 panel discussion. 74 Since there was a lack of diversity, four panelists were replaced with people who had been involved in a church closure within the last five years or were currently involved in church merger discussions. While grieving over a loss is a natural response, defining the word grief is very problematic because it is a collection of emotions. Psychologist Chelsea Buzzitta states that grief is better understood as a process instead of consisting of an emotion or s tate. 75 During the first discussion thread, Matthew Ramsey, a student enrolled in DMIN852, found Buzzitta’s definition of grief to have a secular slant. 76 He stated that “omitting emotions in favor of a grief process is difficult to rationalize from a biblical perspective because humanity, being created in the image of God, also shares, to some degree, characteristics and qualities similar to our Creator, i ncluding emotions.” 77 While his reasoning was correct, Buzzitta’s assertion is a beneficial way to evaluate reoccurring themes since a challenging aspect of grieving is that it does not involve a linear process or affect everyone in the same manner. Ramsey did bring up an exce llent point that, from a panel’s perspective, “gaining insight into how the biblical definition of grief influences the strategy would be stimulating.” The discussion topics were aimed to solicit insightful ideas so that a network of churches (the PBA) can move or transfer best practices for overcoming grief toward those suffering from the loss of a church closure. These people are not where they should 74 Abel Grunfeld ,“Panel Discussions: Full Guide to Hosting A Successful One ,” March 4, 2024 , https://riverside.fm/blog/panel -discussion. 75 Chelsea Buzzitta ,“The 5 Stages of Grief, ”June 6, 2023 , https://www.greatlakespsychologygroup.com/grief/5 -stages -grief. 76 Matthew Ramsey, “Discussion Thread: A Defensible Micro -Project,” March 26, 2024. 77 M Elliot, “ The Emotional Core of Love: The Centrality of Emotion in Christian Psychology and Ethics ,” Journal of Psychology and Christianity 31, no 2 (2012): https://go.openathens.net/redirector/liberty.edu?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly -journals/emotional -core - love -centrality -emotion -christian/docview/1223858650/se -2L . 40 be emotionally, mentally, or spiritually. Ramsey also brought up the role of hope and stated, “The Lord assures His children that grief is a temporal condition, not a permanent state.” Therefore, considerations need to be addressed regarding what vehicle w ill be used to move them from one diminishing state to a state of hope through resources made available within the PBA. While panel discussions can be an incredibly insightful exchange of ideas, the setup of the smallest details presents significant challenges. 78 Minor details create major problems; therefore, considerations must be taken to review the recording location, environment, format, seating, technical set -up, lighting, interaction with panelists, and alternates in case someone becomes unavailable. 79 Managing these details is critical in maintaining productive and informative 30 -minute Panel Discussions. Another classmate enrolled in DMIN852, Paula Francis, empathized with the frustrations involved in the development of this project. 80 Paula shared important guidelines for managing tasks efficiently and ensuring minute details are taken care of without getting bogged down in the details themselves: “Do, Delay, and Delegate.” 81 Paula also stressed the “importance of conveying to panelists, a/v team members, and other support cast the seriousness and significance of the micro -project to ensure active cooperation by preparing them beforehand and casting vision.” Finally, Paula helped articulate how not to lose 78 Cooke, “How To Host A Great Panel Discussion .” 79 Adrian Dearnell, “Seven Golden Rules For Successful Panel Discussions ,” February 22, 2023 , https://www.forbes.com/sites/adriandearnell/2023/02/22/7 -golden -rules -for -successful -panel - discussions/?sh=7ff6f2393b73. 80 Paula Francis , “Discussion Thread: A Defensible Micro -Project,” March 26, 2024. 81 Stephanie Eckelkamp, “How to Avoid Getting Bogged Down in the Details & Focus on What’s Really Important ,”February 19, 2021, https://www.pertheworkedit.com/articles/howtonotgetboggeddowninthedetails . 41 valuable insight from panelists due to time constraints by estimating the time required for each question and answer in advance. 82 The peer reviews were essential in providing good insight and overall guidance for developing and executing this micro -project. The input also helped ensure a productive, engaging, and informative discussion. Implementation Disenfranchised grief is grief that does not conform to cultural norms of mourning. Upon exiting a church, the only community ever known is often left behind, so people are left to parade grief in the public square, seeking others who will grieve alongside them. 83 Transitioning from the data obtained from the first micro -project to engaging in dialogue with a knowledgeable and diverse group of panelists serves to assist those looking for someone to grieve alongside them by contemplating solutions for counseling program initiatives to guide them through the transitory effect s of grief suffered from a church closure. Process Panel Discussions present an incredible opportunity to share valuable learnings and perspectives that spark conversation and inspire action. 84 However, the setup and structure of this type of micro -project can be complicated due to all the details and coordination involved in organizing the discussion. As a result, a team concept was adopted to ensure that all the project specifics were monitored and followed to completion. Careful planning, rehearsal s, and the need 82 Hubilo ,“A Complete Guide to Panel Discussions,” November 7, 202 2, https://www.hubilo.com/blog/a - complete -guide -to -panel -discussions. 83 Abbie Nye, “On Grieving The Loss Of A Church ,” Accessed April 2, 2024 , https://www.acnatoo.org/acnatoo -blog/on -grieving -the -loss -of -a-church. 84 Khalem Charles ,“How to Prepare for a Panel Discussion ,” January 10 , 202 3, https://www.adcouncil.org/all -articles/how -to -prepare -for -a-panel -discussion . 42 for each team member to bring their unique skills to the presentation resembled an orchestra. Each instrument —or panelist, staff, and technician in this instance —played an integral part in producing meaningful conversations that facilitated the opportunity to explore best practices for grief support. 85 Before the beginning of DMIN852, the PBA Director was contacted, and a request was submitted to speak at an upcoming monthly meeting. The PBA had previously been informed of this research, so the intent was to share current progress, upcoming projects, and goals with all the members representing the network of sixty churches. After explaining the second micro - project, those interested were invited to stay and discuss the possibility of serving as panelists. Many showed an overwhelming interest in participat ing not just in the Panel Discussions but also in the research, results, and resolution of the overall Portfolio Project. As a result, twelve panelists were conscientiously recruited for the Panels Discussions as a group of advisors who would share and bui ld upon each other’s experiences. 86 The panelists include PBA Director Chuck Harrison, PBA Ministry Assistant and Flow Church Lead Pastor Mike Mines, OneChurch Director Jim Moynihan, Ivy Memorial Baptist Church Lead Pastor Dr. Brian Williams, Retired Pastor Rusty Beck, Parkview Baptist Chur ch Minister of Operations Anne Mitchell, Parkview Choir Director Bonnie Largena, Stevens Memorial Baptist Church Lead Pastor Dr. Jay Russ, Orcutt Baptist Church Lead Pastor Ben Caldwell, LEADwell Consultant Steve Ruggerio, Crossroads Christian Community Ch urch Council Member Hannah Duke, Crossroads Worship Director Dan McPeters, and Missionary Lonnie Reynolds as an alternate. 85 Charles, “How to Prepare for a Panel Discussion .” 86 Definis, “Moderate with Moderation: 10 Steps to Running a Successful Panel Discussion .” 43 Contact information was exchanged, and coordination efforts were immediately initiated to schedule each Panel Discussion. The panelists were strategically divided into different Panel Discussion groups to maximize their background, knowledge, and expertise . If one or more of the selected panelists experienced a scheduling conflict, other PBA members were identified to serve as alternates. If necessary, members already committed would be used for more than one Panel Discussion. Missionary Lonnie Reynolds was initially identified as a panelist, but his role was changed to serve as an alternate as needed. Lonnie was instructed to serve as a member of the audience for each Panel Discussion in case one of the other panelists could not attend or had to leave sudde nly. Due to varying schedules while accommodating panelists, Panel Discussions were scheduled on different dates and times. All facility reservations were submitted and approved in advance. The first Panel Discussion was conducted on Tuesday, April 9, 2024, at 10:30 am. The second Panel Discussion occurred on Tuesday, April 9, 2024, at 1:00 pm. The third Panel Discussion was done on Thursday, April 11, 2024, at 3:00 pm. An alternate date and time for the first and second Panel Discussion was set for Thursday, A pril 11, 2024, at 10:00 am and 12:00 pm. An alternate date and time for the third Panel Discussion was Tuesday, April 16, 2024, at 10:30 am. The chapel at Crossroad Christian Community Church was used for the Panel Discussions, and the Parkview Baptist Church sanctuary was designated as an alternate location. Utilizing the chapel and the sanctuary as a backup afforded the use of live -streaming equipment already in place, such as cameras and microphones. It also eliminated possible long delays in changing locations if an issue occurred. Two cameras were recording simultaneously so that one could serve as a backup. Five wireless microphones were m ade available so that each panelist 44 and the moderator could have their own microphone and interact without waiting for a microphone to become available. An additional wired microphone was set behind the moderator as a backup. Audio -visual (A/V) technicians were scheduled and onsite during th e panel discussions, ensuring everything had been pre -checked, the recording was monitored, and troubleshooting implemented as needed. A digital clock in the back of the chapel was used to maintain awareness of how time was progressing. As a backup, the mo derator had a mobile phone alarm set to vibrate five minutes before the end was approaching. 87 The phone was also placed in airplane mode to avoid confusing an incoming call with the alarm. Additional lighting was considered, but due to the scheduled times, lighting would be appropriate. Each space had many windows, making the rooms very bright. Arrangements were made with the church’s hospitality teams to set up the fellowship hall and provide the panelists and team members with water, coffee, tea, donuts, and cookies. This allowed everyone to be on time, understand their roles, and provide an op portunity for panelists to get comfortable and acclimated before starting. Additionally, thermostats were preset in both facilities to accommodate a comfortable environment for the panelists and those in attendance. Format One of the most important tasks for a panel moderator is creating an appropriate structure and panel discussion formats. 88 The Panel Discussions maintained a structured format yet a casual setting. Panelists were seated on comfortable padded chairs located on the church stage. They were also given a pen and notecard if they needed to write down any thoughts they 87 Scott Kirsner, “How To Moderate A Panel Like A Pro ,” May 30, 2013 ,https://hbr.org/2013/05/how -to - moderate -a-panel -like -a-pro . 88 Kristin Arnold, “27 Popular Panel Discussion Formats to Spark Your Creativity ,” https://www.powerfulpanels.com/panel -discussion -formats. 45 desired to share and a small water bottle for hydration. A Mainstage Style was adopted and used with the invited panelists, and this student served as the moderator. Other people were allowed to attend as audience members but with no question -and -answer op portunity. 89 Pre -discussion sessions were held thirty minutes prior for all panelists. This allowed panelists to ask questions about the Panel Discussion format, order, or the questions they would be asked. Since the Panel Discussions could not exceed the allotted time, timing was crucial. Critical factors in managing time effectively for each Panel Discussion included setting a realistic timeframe for a good opening, short introductions, and seven well -thoug ht -out questions per discussion topic while taking into account the panelists' responses. 90 Managing time was a crucial part of the interaction with panelists. It was reiterated to all panelists that the goal was to hear from everyone and have them speak for the same amount of time. 91 As a result, many facets were considered and implemented to maximize time. The Panel Discussions began with welcoming the panelists, the audience, and those who would be viewing online in the future. A brief opening statement was given to share the purpose right from the start. This was followed by brief introductions of each panelist utilizing short biographies requested from the twelve panelists in advance. This allowed more control of time and avoided extended, irrelevant background information. All the panelists were given a copy of the questions 48 hours before the Panel Discussion, but they were kept from knowing who would answer which question. The goal was to prepare them for all the questions in case a panelist became unavailable and a shift in ques tioning needed to occur. 89 Ayesa Lubag, “A Complete Guide To Panel Discussion ,” November 13, 2021 , https://www.glueup.com/blog/panel -discussion. 90 Katy Mrvova, “Tips on How to Moderate a Panel Discussion as a Beginner ,” October 14, 2022 , https://blog.slido.com/panel -discussion -moderating -guide. 91 Arnold, “How to Gracefully Interrupt a Panelist Who Talks Too Long .” 46 Many discussions evolve into long monopolized conversations by an individual. The role of this moderator was to bring out the best in the panelists so that the viewer and listener would appreciate the content. 92 The questions were divided among the different panelists so that the same person would refrain from responding to all the questions. Three redirection phrases for those who may become long -winded were created and shared with the panelists during the pre - discussion session. This was a simple tactic for keeping the discussion focused and on time. 93 Controlling the flow of the discussion was vital for time management as well. The moderator was placed in the center of the panelists as the best location to exercise control during the discussion. 94 Each panelist was given ample time to respond to questions. Similar to the Interviews and Analysis Micro -Project, the moderator did not communicate personal opinions within the dialogue with panelists. During questioning, suggestive phrases, tones, and ma nnerisms were also avoided due to the influence they can place on panelists. 95 Only nodding and providing thanks for responses in a neutral and low -key tone were implemented. 96 Finally, a powerful ending was as important as a powerful opening. 97 In the end, a session summary was provided, and appreciation was shown to all the panelists and the audience. After the Panel Discussion was completed, an A/V technician signal was waited on to ensure the recording was successful. At that point, feedback was requested from the panelists and attendees. Different perspectives regarding the quality of the discussion, the moderator's effectiveness, the 92 Definis, “Moderate with Moderation: 10 Steps to Running a Successful Panel Discussion .” 93 Lubag, “A Complete Guide To Panel Discussion .” 94 Kirsner, “How To Moderate A Panel Like A Pro .” 95 Mrvova, “Tips on How to Moderate a Panel Discussion as a Beginner .” 96 Ibid. 97 Ibid. 47 engagement level, and the overall event proved to be insightful. Then, the panelists were once again thanked for their participation and dismissed. Within 48 hours, panelists were given handwritten thank -you cards expressing gratitude for their contributio n to the project. 98 All these initiatives and tactics set the tone for a well -structured discussion. A YouTube channel was created where all three Panel Discussions were successfully uploaded for viewing and to note important concepts for future development or implementation toward the solution. 99 https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqIzCbrSWD0TDHbonOlpuESNcU7dp2BfX&si=GlS 3oE4DoynqLXMK Panel Discussions The first step to ensuring a successful Panel Discussion is to establish a clear purpose, which includes identifying the objectives and defining what is to be achieved. 100 Three different Panel Discussions were hosted within this micro -project in search of a desired resolution. Each panel was provided with a separate topic relevant to the PBA's lack of counseling programs assisting members in transitioning through the grief experienced by church closures. The following three topics were c hosen for discussion as they pertain specifically to the PBA: Church Closures (Processes), Crisis and Grief Programming (Congregational Consoling), and Dissemination of Information (Best Practices). These topics were selected as part of a progressio n formula. 98 Ruthellen Josselson, Interviewing for Qualitative Inquiry: A Relational Approach (First edition )(New York: Guilford Press, 2013 ), 2 .ProQuest Ebook Central , http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/liberty/detail.action?docID=1137446. 99 Ibid., 177. 100 Melissa Chue, “What Are Panel Discussions and How to Conduct Them Effectively ,” January 17, 2023 , https://blog.pigeonholelive.com/what -are -panel -discussions -and -how -to -conduct -them -effectively#define -the - purpose -of -the -panel -discussion. 48 The discussion of Church Closures (Processes) was concerned with current practices. Generally, most church closure plans or processes do not involve attending to members' care and counseling needs, if at all, until the latter stages or timeframe of the clo sure. 101 Those who experience loss are generally counseled after the loss has occurred. Some losses occur suddenly, while others may take place over an extended period of weeks, months, or even years. 102 The decision to close a long -standing church is neither a sudden decision nor a sudden process. This lapse in response can have a negative emotional, mental, or behavioral impact on PBA members who have been dealing with the gradual effects of the impendi ng loss. The pastor shepherds the congregation to closure, including grief work. 103 The intent was to determine what is available and what is needed to assist members in the earlier stages of church closure to counter the earlier stages of grief. At this point, the goal was to identify, not necessarily develop. The next topic was Crisis and Grief Programming (Congregational Consoling). Closing a church requires faithful steering —guiding a church’s discernment process, embracing both gratitude and grief, recognizing both the losses and the opportunities, leaving a legacy of ministry, and blessing others. 104 In this discussion topic, the focus was more on ideas and concepts to assist in consoling congregational members during the stages of grief identified by all five participants in the Interviews and Analysis Micro -Project. The objective was to get the pane lists to go deeper than overarching suggestions and place themselves in the middle of the crisis. Dr. Zabloski suggested developing questions that would lead them there and not 101 Sara Nave -Fisher, Church Closure in Five Stage ,(Good Friday Collaborative, October 14, 2023), https://www.goodfridaycollaborative.com/writing/church -closure -in -five -stages. 102 Floyd, Crisis Counseling: A Guide for Pastors and Professionals , 70. 103 Nave -Fisher, “Church Closure in Five Stages .” 104 April Yamasaki, “When a Church Closes: Nightmare or a Good Death ,” August 10, 2020 , https://whenyouworkforthechurch.com/2020/08/10/when -a-church -closes. 49 necessarily force the point. At the heart of a crisis is loss, and it is generally known as a crucial time and a turning point in the development of something decisive. 105 The goal of the panelists for this topic was decisiveness. While an exact resolution may not be found for the grief experienced by all through church closures, the emotions can be transitioned into a form of meaning to benefit others by helping them find their purpose once again. The final topic was the Dissemination of Information (Best Practices). Life calls upon us to “move toward” others who are grieving. 106 Many will come for counsel but not for discipleship, yet these words are sometimes interchangeable. 107 Programs and studies intersecting these lines were discussed during this Panel Discussion for optimal distribution and utilization. Summary As the Body of Christ, helping decision -making groups with the practical work that has to be done is critical. It also means helping people say goodbye to a community, a place, and people who have been a vital part of their day -to -day lives. 108 All panelists petitioned to participate in these Panel Discussions were purposefully selected. They were divided into specific Panel Discussion groups based on their position, background, and personal experience to assist the PBA in making well -informed d ecisions about crisis care and counseling in its network of churches. 105 Floyd, Crisis Counseling , 65, 25 . 106 Jon Gohdes, So how can believers and the church help those who are grieving?

The panelists focused on current practices within the PBA to assist congregations pending church closure in managing grief. These were the four panelists selected to participate in Panel Discussion 1: Chuck Harrison has been the Director of the PBA since 2010. He also serves on the Board of Directors of the V3 Church Planting Movement and is a professor at Providence Bible College and Theological Seminary. He has pastored many churches on the Peninsula and holds a B.A. in Philosophy and a Master of Divinity degree. Rusty Beck was a youth pastor for Parkview Baptist Church before becoming the lead pastor. He served the church for 20 years before retiring in June 2023. He received his seminary training at The John Leland Center for Theological Studies. He is active in the PBA and the Baptist General Association of Virginia (BGAV), where he serves on the Youth Advisory Team for the State and leads training sessions during State meetings. Dr. Jay Russ has been the lead pastor for Stevens Memorial Baptist Church for the last 19 years and has served 20 years in Hampton Baptist Church's youth ministry. He holds a Doctor of Ministry degree in Discipleship. Dr. Brian Williams is the lead pastor for Ivy Memorial Baptist Church and a Field Strategist with the BGAV. He graduated from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and has a Ph.D. in Biblical Studies from Baylor University. Seven open -ended questions were presented to these panelists, and different members were chosen to respond. The first two questions involved grief and church closures. They were developed to set the stage around topics that are focal points within the prob lem statement. Unlike the reasoning used during the Interviews and Analysis Micro -Project, where questions 51 regarding grief were provided in the latter part of the interview, the topic of grief was presented in the beginning. In the first micro -project, the goal was not to unintentionally coerce responses by introducing a term too soon and causing it to be the foundational focus for all other responses. In this micro -project, the goal was different. The concept that grief was a factor had been previously established; therefore, there was no need to prance around the issue. An immediate connection to the topic was necessary to work toward implementing ideas for overcoming transitory grief from church closures. When asked what comes to mind when considering grief or crisis, Jay stated that he was taught “crisis meant opportunity.” He explained how, theologically, all things work together toward the good. “Everything always has an opportunity, even a church closin g or any kind of crisis.” Chuck stated that grief makes him “think of the word loss and loss of control.” He elaborated, \"It is not change that people fear; it is loss, and grief makes people feel lost.” It is a common tendency for people to want to circum vent loss. Chuck explained that “losing control, relationships, and everything that goes along with it is key in how people feel through the process of a church closure.” His response shows a connection between grief and church closures. When asked about church closure, Brian shared themes that had been introduced before but not previously examined in the manner in which he presented his thoughts. Brian stated, “Members of the church would feel things like grief, failure, and shame.” Those emotions are challenging not only to feel but also to communicate. Rusty shared, “It would be sad to think about not having the normalcy of a vibrant church in one’s life.” Then Brian expressed a level of connection that far exceeded insightful expectatio ns. It was as if he exposed his own emotions of grief without exposing himself in the process. He stated, “It is very devastating oftentimes to 52 own the words or the reality that we are in this process [church closure].” Then he added, “A lot of times that gets projected upon the staff or a pastoral staff member. They feel they have failed in this ministry. There is a sense of shame about going thr ough or facing this process.” His voice appeals to a leader’s journey with the church closure experience and not exclusively the one of an individual member. When considering church closure processes and the exhausting task of navigating a congregation’s e motional, mental, and spiritual journey, the journey of the leadership cannot be overlooked. In another panel discussion done on a different day, Mike Mines from Panel Discussion 2 shared the same opinion as Brian, that as a leader, “we get credit for esta blishing great works and achieving great gains, but we also get blamed during a loss.” This thought process was witnessed again when Brian was asked what could be done “after” a church closure to assist members. Brian’s response leaned subtly toward the ef fects on leadership again. He stated, “The mission of God still continues.” Many pastors struggle with the emotions of loss, being seen by colleagues or themselves as failures, but also the challenge of what is next. 109 Brian stated how there are other “mission opportunities and ways to engage once they see their entire life in Christ is not confined to a church or institution.” After a church closure, the institutional weight of the church has seemingly been lifted off leadership’s shoulders, but they must continue to engage in the work of God’s ministry. While these questions were developed to invoke ideas on how to serve people managing the grief of church closures, they also exposed the necessity of not overlooking th e grief of the servant -leader while he or she is serving. During the dialogue, Chuck acknowledged that the work done by the PBA is limited. He stated, “The most [done] is to help churches work through the process involving legal and 109 Gail Cafferata ,The Last Pastor: Faithfully Steering a Closing Church (Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press, 2020 ), 7 -20 . 53 practical aspects and not so much the emotions.” Since the PBA is limited, panelists were asked to share suggestions or recommendations for managing church closures. This question sparked a common theme shared in the responses throughout this panel discuss ion: the words church closure did not have to “have a negative connotation.” Jay expressed that special attention to the proper language used can assist in managing church closures. He stated that biblically, he thinks about transformation as “God is going to do something new, something even greater.” He pointed out that “God is getting [people’s] attention in saying that mindsets need to change by not focusing on an institution but on what one is called to focus on.” Brian expressed the importance of dialo gue. Rusty pointed out that it is necessary to convey that “change is actually a good thing.” Jay shared how “grief must be accepted just like change must be accepted.” He explained that “there are changes experienced when a person passes away” and express ed a need for a “celebration of life.” He added, “We celebrate the past, but then we also dream about the future.” His response coincides with ritualistic ceremonies reflecting and celebrating what was once in existence. The same can be incorporated for th e changes experienced within church closures. Chuck pointed out that there are a couple of different types of church closures, but regardless of which one is experienced, “it is time to find out where else service is needed in God’s Kingdom.” He stressed the importance of “encouraging people not to qu it on church because an individual congregation no longer exists.” Rusty echoed the need for this type of encouragement by sharing how he incorporated visitations for everyone who was part of a church that had closed in the past. Jay reminded the panelists of Paul’s letters and how “he finishes them by telling people how [they] have to encourage one another.” Rusty interjected, \"It is healthy and helpful for churches and people to be able to see themselves in the context of the 54 grand narrative of the Bible.” This encouragement “opens [people] to be able to develop a healthy theology of how God works.” In the end, Chuck stated that “this entire doctoral study would be an excellent resource of encouragement” to point people toward the transitory grief care needed for congregations dealing with church closures within the PBA. While the focus of the first discussion veered at times outside lines of the intended goal, discretion was exercised to not interrupt the flow of the engaging dialogue by the panelists, to go beyond the church closure process, and to consider procedural op tions for caregiving by the PBA. Crisis and Grief Programming (Congregational Consoling) The panelists for Panel Discussion 2 discussed Crisis and Grief Programming (Congregational Consoling). The goal was to consider different perspectives on how to console congregational members during any grief encountered by a church closure. Seven open -ended questions were addressed during this Panel Discussion. The following four panelists were selected to participate: Mike Mines is the lead pastor of FLOW Church and the PBA Ministry Administrator. He holds a B.S. in Pastoral Care from Acts of Grace Bible College and Theological Seminary. Jim Moynihan served as a lead and transitional pastor since attending Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forrest, where he received his Master of Divinity degree. He also holds a Master of Communications degree from Regent University. He fou nded OneChurch and serves as the director, implementing community development strategies. Dr. Ben Caldwell is the lead pastor of Orcutt Baptist Church. He holds a B.A. in Religion from Samford University, a Master of Divinity from Beeson Divinity School, and a Doctor of Ministry from the Baptist Theological Seminary of Richmond. 55 Dr. Steve Ruggerio is a United States Air Force Veteran. He partnered in launching LEADwell, a leadership development company. He has been involved in ministry for 15 years and has an M.S. in Leadership and a Doctoral in Strategic Leadership from Regent Un iversity. When grief is experienced, it is typically felt by an individual or family and is ministered to on a smaller scale. Church closures affect congregations; therefore, grief occurs on a larger scale. Interestingly, when the panelists were asked about possible options that could be effective on the masses, the overwhelming consensus referred back to effective ministry being done at a smaller level. Their comments evoke a domino effect, meaning to start small and evolve into a more significant impact. Jim stated , “It is important to approach congregations as individuals, couples, and even small groups in order to spend time listening and slowing down the effects of stress and anxiety.” Mike agreed that progressing through small groups and then larger ones allows “people the opportunity to vent or complain in a safe space.” Ben added that while discipleship programs and Bible studies could be incorporated because they fall into the realm of small groups, “initially, a ministry of presence would be very helpful in t erms of the congregation’s surety.” He explained that “curriculum discussion -based programs are beneficial, similar to grief -share.” Ben proposed using the “Bowen Family Systems Theory,” which examines stepping outside the emotion and talking through choic es within the situation. 110 He suggested that “the PBA could train leaders in this or other types of programs to help lead small group discussions.” Steve also agreed on the small group aspect. He stated, “There is not a lot of crosstalk in large congregations, so breaking out into small groups provides an opportunity for dialogue concerning their feelings of grief in a safe space.” He noted an important concern in dealing with the masses versus smaller groups. Steve said, “It is really important in a journey of 110 Murr ay Bowen, “Introduction to the Eight Concepts ,” Accessed April 10, 2024, https://www.thebowencenter.org/introduction -eight -concepts. 56 grief toward healing to realize that everyone’s journey goes at a different pace.” He suggested that “a mistake is made when crowds are grouped together, and people are rushed through the process or stages of grief.” Whether conducted in a large or small f orum, grief support groups are considered helpful, but regardless of size, each group comes with potential hindrances. When establishing these small groups, special care and awareness must be given to how they are led, structured, focused, and cultured. As Steve alluded, everyone is on their own journey, experiencing grief in their own way. This can cause a manifestation of conflicting and discouraging support when proper considerations are not made to address individual therapeutic needs in favor of a larg e cluster with the same expectations. When asked about encouraging hope amid a church closure, Mike shared that encouragement must come from leadership. He stated, “Leaders cannot go into defense mode even though they may be blamed” for what happened. Once again, Mike’s response includes the leader’s role, similar to Brian’s responses in Panel Discussion 1. Steve agreed that “one path toward the acceptance of hope comes in the form of self -compassion.” During grief, many people get upset with themselves, and anger rises concerning what they did or failed to do within their transitory grief. Steve stated, “This is a good time to step back and show yourself some kindness.” Another suggestion he made was to “practice gratitude because it helps our emotions move from a place of anger to acceptance.” The panelists were asked for specific ideas on how to honor or celebrate long -standing ministries (churches) that are closing. 111 Jim suggested a “Memories Workshop.” He explained that it resembles a timeline on a roll of paper hung on a wall. Then, everyone places special moments in their lives connected to the church on the wall. Jim’s response is similar to what is 111 Mrvova, “Tips on How to Moderate a Panel Discussion as a Beginner .” 57 found in the Old Testament when memorials of stones were placed by the Jordan River as a reminder of God’s blessings and faithfulness. This group of panelists provided several distinct recommendations with the common theme of “proper perspective” engrained within their responses. Mike stated that it was “a matter of perception,” using the analogy of a seed dying to produce more fruit. Ste ve stated that “while people struggle with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), getting them to see Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) is more important in those moments.” Jim stated, \"A congregation may be ending, but that is not the end of the people.” Finall y, Ben said, “People need to be made to understand that fellowship is meant for believers and is not specific to a local congregation.” Implementing small group sessions to express these thoughts and concepts will be vital in consoling people through grief encountered by a church closure. Dissemination of Information (Best Practices) The discussion topic for Panel Discussion 3 was the Dissemination of Information (Best Practices). Part of good communication lies in the dissemination of information. 112 Effective counseling programs can be developed and implemented, but the true value lies in how this information is passed on to those in need. The following four panelists were selected to participate in the Panel Discussions due to their involvement in s erving as Feasibility Team members concerning a church merger in which their churches will dissolve to create a new church. Their focus was on best practices for distributing sensitive self -care information: Anne Mitchell serves as a Minister of Operations for Parkview Baptist Church. She received her seminary training at Boyce Bible College and The John Leland Center for 112 Julie Turner, “The Dissemination of Information ,” March 12, 2017 ,http://www.gpcchurch.co.uk/the - dissemination -of -information. 58 Theological Studies. She is active in the PBA and the BGAV and serves on their Ministry Council. Bonnie Largena is the Music Director at Parkview. Since beginning ministry in 1988, she has served at six other Baptist churches and has also worked in church administration. Hannah Duke is Parkview’s Ministry Assistant and Youth Leader. She also serves on Crossroads' council and holds a Master of Business from Regent University. Dan McPeters is the Worship Director at Crossroads, Deacon Vice -Chair, and chairman of the Parkview’s Constitution and Bylaws Committee. He also serves multiple roles within the churches, such as Small Groups Leader, Webmaster, and general IT specialist. Seven open -ended questions were developed for this topic of discussion, with the first question setting the stage for the entire discussion: How would each panelist want to receive information concerning pending closure or merger discussions about their ch urch? The panelists had differing opinions concerning the manner in which they wanted to receive the information. Hannah mentioned that “Change Management involves helping people as if they were part of the process and their voice matters.” Doing so involv es verbally communicating with them from the beginning when the change is evident. Anne agreed with Hannah, stating that “it is important that verbal communication is received from the leadership within the organization upfront.” Dan and Bonnie had differe nt opinions. They both shared how important it would be to receive the information in writing. Dan stated that “it could be an email or a document, but the reasoning is due to having the ability to read and reread what was provided.” Having the information written out eliminates the disparity among the people receiving it. Bonnie said she “would like something in hand that she could go back and read for comprehension.” 59 Dan made an interesting suggestion concerning creative ways to share counseling programs or initiatives to help those ailing from grief due to a church closure: “developing a Frequently Asked Questions template.” He stated, \"The PBA could use this format t o provide members with a standard protocol to assist churches.” A template like this would be helpful in the practical works of a church closure and the counseling efforts for transitional grief. Bonnie suggested creating “a packet that could have informat ion like a bookmark with consoling scriptures, along with contact information and counseling resources and how to access them on a website, if applicable.” People may not always want to reach out to organizations, but equipping churches or small groups wit h these informational packets could be very useful. This would be similar to how evangelistic packets for first -time visitors are created. The Micro -Project Brochures could serve to meet this recommendation. Genaro Lawhorn, a classmate in DMIN852, shared that blogging is a means by which individuals can share stories, wisdom, and information with a target audience that could have widespread implications. 113 As a result, panelists were asked if blogging was a viable option for disseminating information concerning this topic. Hannah stated that the “biggest challenge would be accessibility.” Her point is well noted because the challenge is not the availability of the information; it is the ability to access the information. She did state that it could be a good option because “it makes people feel as if they are not alone.” Anne agreed, sharing that “one of the challenges with grieving is that sense of not belo nging anymore, and blogging gives that sense of belonging.” Dan disagreed with the idea of blogging. He stated, “It is outdated, and blogging is a terrible way to disseminate information in the sense of the word information.” He suggested that “podcasts ha ve taken over a lot of the blog space.” 113 Genaro Lawhorn , “Discussion Thread: A Defensible Micro -Project,” March 2 8, 2024. 60 Bonnie provided great insight in opposition to both options. She shared about a situation when her family had lost a couple of family members during COVID -19. She stated that her family attended a grief -share small group meeting and met someone who could r elate to their experience. Although they did not know this person well, the individual sent them a personal letter sharing helpful information to comfort them through their journey. Bonnie related it to the grief of those dealing with the loss of their chu rch. Receiving something personal, whether a letter or packet with helpful information, shows the sender cared enough to mail it out, thus causing them to read it and engage in the healing process. Within all the options covered in this Panel Discussion, challenges of development, sustainment, and accessibility will always be inherent. Getting people to read or listen to what has been made available will pose additional challenges as well. Analysis of the Micro -Project Throughout its development, the Panel Discussions Micro -Project rose from just words on paper, explaining all the minute details, meticulous planning, and elaborate coordination, to an informational resource. Panelists were ultimately tasked with formulati ng effective programs to provide a resolution for the problem statement. This micro -project was effective because most panelists’ responses indicated well -thought -out solutions for addressing the transitory grief experienced by members during a church clos ure. A plethora of valuable information and viewpoints were derived from the Panel Discussions. The approach used in these panel discussions was to present the problem statement and experiences shared by interviewees who previously dealt with or were involved i n the topic. This was an attempt to appeal to the panelists’ background and expertise as practitioners in determining possible resources and courses of action to be implemented. Many insightful 61 suggestions were brought to the forefront, such as Grief Support Groups, Church Resources Directories, Celebration of Life Ceremonies, Memories Workshops, Worship Events, and Conflict Transformation Programs, which can be implemented for the church congreg ations and disseminated through the use of Blogging, Podcasts, or Informational Packets. These means include various spiritual practices and collegial support from fellow churches within the PBA. 114 The suggestions are non -exhaustive but are meant to serve as a starting point to develop possible answers toward creating programs for the care and counseling of members experiencing different forms of grief resulting from church closures. Although the journey ended with a sense of accomplishment, it did not come without its challenges. At times, the details involved in the preparation and execution of the Panel Discussions seemed to override the purpose and goal of the micro -project. This was due to continual setbacks, which made problem -solving the priority. When things go wrong, panic sets in, and from there, problems snowball and become larger than they are, so finding ways to protect a creative, problem -solving mind in the moment of stre ss is the most important way to prepare for any situation. 115 Several coordination efforts were made to ensure all twelve panelists would be available for their respective discussions. Multiple contingency plans were in place; however, even the most comprehensive contingency plans may fail to address all the challen ges that may manifest. 116 114 Richard P. Olson, The Last Pastor: Faithfully Steering a Closing Church (Review and expositor. 118, no. 3 ,2021): 398 –403. 115 Bret Hoy, “Your Backup Plan Isn't Enough ,” August 13, 2017 ,https://fstoppers.com/originals/your - backup -plan -isnt -enough -what -do -you -do -when -everything -goes -wrong -191468. 116 Venkata Satish Guttula, “When My Contingency Plans Failed: Embracing Uncertainty in Life ,” April 15, 2023 ,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/when -my -contingency -plans -failed -embracing -life -venkata. 62 Panel Discussion 1 was scheduled for Tuesday, April 9, at 10:30 a.m., but it had to be rescheduled because the main person involved, the PBA Director, had to cancel. The alternate date also did not work due to his unexpected travel plans. Coordination was made with the other eight panelists, which resulted in Panel Discussion 2 being moved up to an earlier time and Panel Discussion 3 taking place later that afternoon. This allowed Panel Discussion 1 to be completed on the only date available for the PBA Dir ector, Thursday, April 11, at 3:00 pm. Although it would be out of the intended order, a solution around what could be controlled was found. During Panel Discussion 2, the actual first discussion to occur, many procedural checks were marked off. The recording and sound system were tested, and issues previously identified were corrected and no longer evident. The panelists arrived early and were greeted with beverages and snacks. Pre -discussion protocols were reviewed, and each panelist was enthusiastic about the event. It was evident in their practical and helpful responses. Nervousness was expressed by panelists, but overall, the discussion wen t well. There was a large audience present. The format did not allow audience questions, but the audience was able to interact with panelists after the discussion. The feedback from the audience and the panelists was exceptional. They expressed gratitude f or undertaking such an important topic and looked forward to watching the other discussions in person or online. Panel Discussion 3 took place an hour later. Everything went as planned, with no contingencies needed. There was a smaller audience, but the feedback was still very positive. It was exhilarating when both discussions were completed in one day after all the last -minute rescheduling and coordination that had to be accomplished to accommodate panelists. What is 63 overlooked so often is not necessarily the forethought to make a Plan A, B, or C but the forethought to consider how to handle a situation when things inevitably go wrong. 117 During Panel Discussion 1, there was a feeling of confidence. Two of the three panel discussions were completed with minimal issues, and good insight was shared concerning the project. This panel discussion started like the others, with everyone arriving o n time, a systems check, and a pre -discussion brief. Upon completing the discussion, a quick check of the recordings’ quality revealed no sound on the playback. None of the settings had been changed, so there was no understanding of why the sound was not w orking. Panic rose as it took a long period to discover the source of the sound issue, causing discomfort and uneasiness among the audience and panelists. One of the panelists has Parkinson’s. During the pre -discussion, he shared how he had timed his medic ation so that he would be in prime form during the recording, but due to the time that had lapsed, he shared that he felt pushed beyond his limits. The discussion could not be rescheduled due to panelists being unavailable to do it later in the day or on a nother date. After thirty -five minutes of troubleshooting, a software issue was identified and rectified. Once the recording was reinitiated, exhaustion and a lack of motivation had already occurred. During the second session, the panelists' responses were shorter and less vibrant since the energy in the room had diminished. While it was an unnerving experience, valuable insight was gained through what was considered a catastrophe at the time. Grief regarding what had been lost (sound, insight, and time) was not dealt with fittingly by this student at that moment, as seen by nerves in the video. Fostering a culture of resilience, adaptability, and continuous learning can help people better navigate the uncertainties of life and emerge stronger in the face of adversity. 118 This is true not 117 Hoy, “Your Backup Plan Isn't Enough -What Do You Do When Everything Goes Wrong .” 64 only when implementing a trouble -ridden panel discussion but also for those at the center of a church closure and experiencing the associated stages of grief throughout the process. Embracing uncertainty involves acknowledging the limitations of our plans and being willing to adapt to change when it occurs. 119 Brainstorming ideas and concepts with the potential of molding them into effective counseling programs was the intent of gathering a diverse group of individuals to serve as panelists. Having them reflect and think critically about the problem statement n ot only assisted in coming up with resolution options to transition people to healthy places in ministry, but it also allowed for a new group of grief -wounded individuals needing care to be identified and not be overlooked. The impacts of grief have no bou ndaries, and neither did the effectiveness of this micro -project in seeking to assist those suffering from church closure grief. 118 Guttula, “When My Contingency Plans Failed .” 119 Ibid . 65 CHAPTER 4 : MICRO -PROJECT THREE The third Micro -Project this student conducted to address the ministry problem was the YouTube Channel. This chapter will examine the effectiveness of this micro -project in relation to the suggestions made in the Panel Discussions concerning information dissemination. Justification Grief is commonly dealt with at a micro -level versus a macro -level. When a loss is experienced, people are counseled as individuals. However, this methodology does not take into consideration the mental and emotional impact on a group of people collectivel y. Collective grief occurs when a community, society, village, or nation experiences extreme change or loss. 120 While it is similar to individual grief, collective grief can be overwhelming and involve feelings of powerlessness and lack of control due to the inability to prevent the loss or change. The healing process for collective grief does not always look the s ame as for individual grief, which can make people feel even more unprepared to navigate through emotional, mental, and spiritual challenges. 121 The research within the initial micro -projects affirmed that people experience some form of individual and collective grief from church closures due to feelings of displacement, loss of friends, identity, or despair concerning the unknown. The Peninsula Baptist Association is a network of over sixty denominational and nondenominational churches. Many churches within the PBA have had to close their ministerial operations for various reasons, but mainly because they did not consider or make th e cultural changes necessary to engage in effective community outreach programs. As a result, a decline in 120 Asma Rehman, What is Collective Grief? Grief Recovery Center. Accessed May 23, 2024, https://www.griefrecoveryhouston.com/what -is -collective -grief . 121 Ibid. 66 church members and financial resources has led to an increase in church closures or the consideration of church mergers, where the name of one or both churches still ceases to exist. While the PBA has aided with the business aspect of church closures, it n ever considered the psychological and spiritual factors involved. The problem is that the Peninsula Baptist Association in Newport News, Virginia lacks counseling programs assisting members transition through the grief experienced by church closures. As a Doctor of Ministry candidate in Pastoral Counseling, the PBA’s shortfall highlighted a unique counseling need requiring the research of various projects to develop plausible solutions. Counseling programs are necessary conduits for helping those who not on ly grieve individually and collectively the loss of a loved one but also grieve the loss of their beloved church. The first two micro -projects used involved informational gathering processes. The YouTube channel will serve as an informational dissemination process. In the Interviews and Analysis micro -project , people within the PBA shared revealing and harrowing details of the grief they endured at multiple levels throughout the different stages of transition from a vibrant and thriving church to a declining and diminished church. This micro -project validated the problem statement and pinpointed specific counseling nee ds. In the Panel Discussions, leaders, administrators, and people who had previously dealt with church closures within the PBA engaged in productive dialogue. They provided several solutions for ministering to those grieving the dissolution of their church . This micro -project created an awareness of the lack of therapeutic care and support needed for those transitioning through a church closure process. The YouTube channel provides an engaging and easily shared platform that can offer an array of grief support resources for individuals experiencing one of the many stages of grief, 67 such as denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. 122 A YouTube channel produced to address this problem creates a presence that is not currently available online. There are many beneficial YouTube channels geared toward improving mental health and providing grief care. They serve as valuable tools for education, social connection, and emotional support, but none address the psychological, behavioral, or spiritual grief suffered by those involved in a church closure. 123 A YouTube channel can serve as a much -needed social media platform within the PBA to creatively design and share counseling initiatives geared toward improving mental, emotional, and spiritual health for those struggling with the loss of their church. The Blogging mi cro -project was initially considered, but there has been a significant shift from text to video preference in recent years, with 72% of blog readers choosing to watch videos over reading text. 124 With the YouTube channel, viewers would have access to receive, learn, and connect with others in a human -to -human manner because they can see, hear, and feel in a way that text alone does not allow for building rapport with those afflicted. 125 Nehemiah 8:4, 9 (N ew International Version ) states, “Ezra, the teacher of the Law, stood on a high wooden platform built for the occasion. Then Nehemiah , the governor, Ezra , the priest and teacher of the Law, and the Levites who were instructing the people said to them all, ‘This day is holy to the Lord your God. Do not mourn or weep.’” In these verses, Nehemiah, Ezra, and the Levites come to a single location where everyone gathered as one while they, through God’s 122 Jodi Clarke, “How the Five Stages of Grief Can Help Process Loss ,” December 7, 2023 , https://www.verywellmind.com/five -stages -of -grief -4175361 . 123 Luke Balcombe, “The Impact of YouTube on Mental Health ,” October 11, 2023 , https://enlighten.griffith.edu.au/the -impact -of -youtube -on -mental -health . 124 Branka Vuleta, “Blogging Statistics ,” Accessed May 19, 2024 ,http://99firms.com/blog/blogging - statistics/#gref . 125 Amanda Weber, “How to Use YouTube to Grow Your Therapy Practice ,” Accessed May 19, 2024 , https://www.brightervision.com/blog/youtube -to -grow -your -practice . 68 Word, collectively provided instruction and shared encouraging words to assist people during a time of grief. The YouTube channel corresponds with these verses by establishing a single location where people can be invited and gathered to hear godly words and instructions from teachers, pastors, and empathic leaders. This platform would serve as a means to encourage those deali ng with the transitory grief (the mourning and weeping) experienced by church closures. Peer Review YouTube is a global video platform that can get a ministry in front of millions of potential new viewers. 126 If a ministry wants to share a message, such as the Good News of the Gospels, or provide training in obedience to the Great Commission to make disciples, a YouTube channel establishes the stage. A YouTube channel can also be a creative outlet for instructional guidance and counseling that ministries can use to provide encouragement and hope. Therefore, the target audience is an essential factor to consider due to the different options for establishing a YouT ube channel. For this micro -project, the target audience is not a demographic group categorized by age, gender, household income, etc. The target audience for this YouTube channel surrounds a life event, specifical ly, a loss causing symptoms of physical and psychological grief. 127 During the first discussion thread, Matthew Luten, a student enrolled in DMIN853, shared that “though the targeted group is individuals within the PBA, keeping the information more general could help a larger audience.” 128 He suggested extending the research beyond the grief of church closures to the grief of losing social interaction. He stated that “the uniqueness of 126 Ron Stefanski ,“Why Every Brand Should Have a YouTube Channel, ”February 2, 2024, https://www.business.com/articles/every -brand -should -have -a-youtube -channel. 127 “Three Types of YouTube Audience Targeting You Should be Using,” Digital Strike, Accessed May 30 , 2024 ,https://www.digitalstrike.com/youtube -audience -targeting . 128 Matthew Luten , “Discussion Thread: A Defensible Micro -Project,” Ma y25, 2024. 69 the problem statement based on church closures may limit background research.” While both of these suggestions involve forward thinking and the possibility of future goals for the YouTube Channel, Dr. Zabloski shared in DMIN851 that the focus of the problem statement needs to address a local area; if not, it becomes too broad to address with one solution. 129 As a result, the catalyst for the grief, which in this research is church closure, makes the specific problem unique and demonstrates a need for it to be addressed and not broadened. Before the pandemic, approximately 4500 churches in the United States cl osed in one year. 130 It would be prudent to state that grief relating to those closures was experienced, and the research within this problem statement could benefit them. However, once a solution is established for the targeted audience at the local level, then a larger audi ence can and should be considered. Matthew noted an excellent point: \"The specific demographics of the closed churches can play a role in the channel's success.” He commented, \"If any of the closed churches have an elderly population, researching their YouTube consumption or media usage wou ld facilitate reaching them.” His recommendation was already considered and implemented in the second micro -project, Panel Discussions. Questions concerning the preferred platform for information dissemination to a multigenerational congregation experienci ng a church closure were asked during the third panel discussion. Some of the more popular options the older and younger members mentioned for receiving information were YouTube videos and hard -copy communications. The latter is to be considered for the fo urth micro -project. 129 James Zabloski , “ The Problem Statement, ”DMIN 85 1-Module 1, Online video, Accessed January 15, 202 4, https://canvas.liberty.edu/courses/588495/pages/watch -the -problem -statement?module_item_id=61350819 . 130 Scott Neuman, “The Faithful See Both Crisis and Opportunity as Churches Close Across the Country,” NPR, May 17 , 202 3, https://www.npr.org/2023/05/17/1175452002/church -closings -religious -affiliation . 70 One of Matthew's most significant suggestions was to create a script before recording a video to minimize time spent on takes. This information would have been helpful if heeded during the Implementation Phase while developing an animated video. Animations were selected and put into a video form before it was realized that following a script would have made the development process more manageable. Sight and sound timing issues could have been avoided. The YouTube channel will provide connectivity and support through a far -reaching and dynamic platform to aid a congregation's grief care. The development of this channel will prove beneficial, but it comes with challenges. There were more aspects to contemplate when cr eating a YouTube channel than initially considered. Relying on man was a significant factor in the earlier micro -projects and less on technology. This micro -project relied more on technology than man. William Welsh, another student enrolled in DMIN853, suggested seeking external assistance to provide the specific steps needed to execute the project. 131 As a result, the same platform used to host the project was used to provide instruction on creating the project. Using YouTube video tutorials to provide step -by -step instructions on how to accomplish an intended goal justifies the creation of a YouTube channel. This new channel will provide the same type of inspirational and thought -provoking instruction to accomplish the intended goal of assisting people through the transitory grief experienced due to a church closure. When people visit a YouTube channel, the goal is for them to immediately feel as if they have found what they are looking for. 132 This process requires much more than just uploading a picture on social media. William suggested focusing on the channel's initial presentation, often referred to as the front door, because it will draw the viewer's attention. If done poorly, people 131 William Welsh , “Discussion Thread: Collaborating and Advising ,” June 8, 2024. 132 Rob Wilson, “How to Create a YouTube Channel for Beginners in 2024 (Step -by -step),” January 19 , 2024 ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk_4GUymeOI . 71 will not stay to view the content. 133 The focus must be on having a clean and simple banner and thoroughly filling in the “About” section of the channel. William’s advice offered a new perspective and changed the developmental focus of the channel in a very productive manner to expand the vis ual and informational aspects of the front door. Implementation Information dissemination was the leading factor in selecting the YouTube Channel Micro -Project. Due to the high rate of church closures, people are finding themselves alone and having to deal with the psychological effects involved in the transition from operational to closed church. A YouTube channel was the platform chosen to engage people by producing videos, webinars, and other appealing yet helpful content. This YouTube channel will be customized for those who have been impacted by the transitory grief elements experienced as a result of a church’s closure. The URL for the YouTube channel known as Church Closure Grief Care is https://youtube.com/@churchclosuregriefcare757?si=ozmjHi_VCAqtnFDv . The first video's URL, the introduction video, is https://youtu.be/jvT_O16HD7k . Channel Mission This YouTube channel will serve as a pioneer within pastoral and church counseling ministries. The mission is to introduce wellness programs within traditional and faith -based counseling frameworks to guide individuals through the transitory effects of grief suffered fr om a church closure. The announcement to close a long -standing church is neither a sudden decision nor a sudden process. Neither is the associated grief of members dealing with the effects of the impending loss. Even though church loss is not a common huma n experience, it is nevertheless difficult to endure. The content on this YouTube channel will include videos and webinars to 133 Carina Fragozo, “ Make Your Channel Stand Out ,” April 17, 2018, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy3qiCdTGs4 . 72 help people navigate through the mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of grief that are unconsciously overlooked when a person experiences the loss of a church, the building, name, community, and congregational family. Scripture reminds us that while t hings do pass away, new things are made available to us. Church Closure Grief Care is here to assist people in not losing hope and remind them that an \"Empty Tomb\" is a promise for a better tomorrow. Channel Content A properly created YouTube channel can provide community healing, but the channel is only helpful with proper videos and content. 134 The YouTube Channel Micro -Project has been created to address the PBA’s failing point noted in the problem statement. It will contain instructional videos identifying the stages and effects of church closure grief as presented by those interviewed in the first micro -project. Additional inf ormation and ideas provided during the second micro -project will be introduced for intervention. Webinars will include effective grief coping skills such as adjustment to losses, utilizing support, appropriate grief and depression, and an accurate view of God. 135 Videos will discuss rituals and ceremonies to celebrate the end of a season and the beginning of another. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) will be available online, providing answers about navigating through the different stages of church closures and the associated grief. A collection of these and other videos will assist in encouraging congregational members who are mourning the loss of their church but are having their psychological and spiritual needs neglected online. 134 Lexie Schmidt, “How to Create a YouTube Channel for Your Church ,” The Lead Pastor ,Accessed May 29, 2024 ,https://theleadpastor.com/how -to/how -to -create -youtube -channel -for -your -church. 135 Scott Floyd, Crisis Counseling: A Guide for Pastors and Professionals .(Grand Rapids, MI: Kregel Publications, 2008 ), 96 . 73 Channel Practicality & Comparison As numerous the options for creating a YouTube channel, so are the reasons. Multiple blogs, articles, and YouTube videos explain how to create a YouTube channel and the reasoning behind it. YouTube is one of the most -visited websites on the internet, with users from all over the world watching videos to laugh, get educated, and more. 136 People come to YouTube seeking answers and trying to solve problems. 137 The problem associated with this micro -project is that the PBA lacks counseling programs to assist members in transitioning through the grief experienced by church closures. Previous micro -projects have explored questions about church closure grief. Information, plans, and concepts were gathered to address the counseling needs of those impacted. The reasoning behind developing a YouTube channel is to identify a means to distribute the information and suggestions received. The goal is to help those whom a church closure has afflicted to receive the mental, emotional, and spiritual aid necessary to navigate through the trauma they are experi encing. The PBA, in conjunction with the impacted churches, should be the leader in creating content that answers people’s questions and helps them solve their problems. 138 Therefore, a more significant presence of therapeutic and informational videos addressing grief and this unique problem statement is necessary. There are 113 million active YouTube channels, yet none specifically address the issues of grief associated with church closures. 139 136 “Create a Successful YouTube Channel for Your Business ,” Mailchimp ,Accessed May 22, 2024, https://mailchimp.com/resources/how -to -start -a-successful -youtube -channel -for -your -business. 137 Jamie Domm and Justin Khoe, “How To Start A YouTube Ministry ,” Accessed May 29, 202 4, https://www.sdadata.org/uploads/8/1/9/8/81986746/final_guidebook_how_to_start_a_youtube_ministry_domm_jun e_2021.pdf . 138 Ibid. 74 YouTube is a search engine people use when they are looking for answers to a specific topic. 140 The topic of grief is extensive; therefore, researching a YouTube channel that meets the problem statement’s specific need is critical. YouTube has 122 million active users seeking out different content on millions of YouTube channels daily. 141 Not all of the channels researched address the topic of grief, let alone the specific transitory grief elements involved in losing a church. Multiple YouTube channels were researched and critiqued for their worth to determine the efficacy of creating a ch annel that meets this unique counseling need. During the Organizational Phase, four YouTube channels that addressed comparable issues relevant to the problem statement were reviewed. The first YouTube channel considered was The Grief channel. The URL is https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeQz4 -WRg2us -wGNA2bzrJQ . The Grief channel encompasses a large amount of information on situational grief. The homepage does not have an introductory video, but the content within the “About” section provides a thorough overview of the channel and its mission. It was the only channel found t o come closest to relating to the issue stated within the problem statement. What makes it so comparable is the inclusion of a webinar discussing the emotional fallout after someone in the public eye dies, thus looking at the concept of collective grief, p ublic mourning, and healing. 142 As previously mentioned, collective grief 139 “YouTube Statistics 2024,” Global Media Insight, May 6 , 2024 , https://www.globalmediainsight.com/blog/youtube -users -statistics . 140 Alex Cattoni, “Mistakes to Avoid When Starting a YouTube Channel in 2024 ,” LinkedIn ,January 18, 2024, https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mistakes -avoid -when -starting -youtube -channel -2024 -alex -cattoni -uq3ne. 141 “YouTube Statistics 2024 (Demographics, Users By Country & More ), ” GMI Blogger ,May 6, 2024 , https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mistakes -avoid -when -starting -youtube -channel -2024 -alex -cattoni -uq3ne. 142 Julia Samuel, “ Collective Grief ,” The Grief Channel ,October 10, 2022, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rfuyybFC9c. 75 happens when a community experiences extreme change or loss. 143 This is similar to the gradual grief experienced by those dealing with the loss of a church closure. Utilizing the concept of collective grief allows the channel to approach grief counseling at both a macro and micro level, which has been a failing point for many churches dealing with the inevitability of change and crisis within their walls. The Grief Channel does not have a vibrant homepage filled with colors that grab the viewer's attention. The channel’s homepage is simplistic in nature but does provide a very symbolic image. It displays a beautiful image of a butterfly. Butterflies symboli ze transformation and resurrection, as well as joy, hope, and new beginnings. 144 By utilizing this imagery, the channel is able to make a stronger and more genuine connection with bereaved people, not just through verbiage or visual appeal but through the symbolism of empathetic understanding. The second YouTube channel considered was Families First. The URL is https://www.youtube.com/@familiesfirst4095 . The Families First channel aims to prepare people for the funeral process concerning the loss of a loved one. They look to celebrate life while helping families navigate their grief. While this is the channel of a funeral home, it was selected for analys is because it is an institution that provides a service to families without neglecting the mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects involved in their service to those grieving. The Families First channel approaches death and its services in a unique manner. They do not just deal with the funeral aspect of what needs to be done, from storing to the burial of the body. They seem to understand that much more is happening within the family dynamic. This channel has 24 videos presenting a series of seminars where the five stages of grief are openly 143 Rehman, “What is Collective Grief .” 144 Ariella Birnbaum, “Butterflies: Their Significance ,” Willed ,Accessed May 23, 2024, https://www.willed.com.au/guides/butterflies -significance -after -a-loved -one -passes -away . 76 welcomed. 145 Valuable information is contained in their playlist, explaining what grief is, how to cope with grief, the grief of different family members and friends, and self -care facets. The channel uses a cover photo of a warmhearted and celebratory family gathering, making it very inviting to the eyes and appealing to the mindset of a viewer who may be grieving the loss of a family member. The colors used are basic but warm and engaging. Unfortunately, the homepage lacks a good description of their services. The “About” section lacks the content necessary to keep viewers engaged and not have them move on. They have an excellent video describing their services and intent, which could be ad vantageous if used as an introductory video. 146 While this channel does not address the concerns of those grieving the loss of their church, the overarching focus of managing the grief experienced by human loss is comparable. The third YouTube channel considered was The Unstuck Group. The URL is https://www.youtube.com/@theunstuckgroup . The Unstuck Group channel focuses on church consulting practices. This channel has 160 videos containing interviews, webinars, and best practices for getting churches unstuck from different phases within the church's life. The goal is to help pastors gro w healthy churches by guiding them to align their vision, strategy, teams, and actions. 147 While this channel does not involve grief counseling for church closures, it provides insights and guidance regarding the trends that can lead to an unhealthy church and, ultimately, a church closure if these issues are not addressed in a timely manner. 145 “Grieving Hearts Seminars ,” Family First, Accessed May 23, 2024, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdWvqtyEuwX5BWoYIQJvvJMQlklTaBgIY . 146 Alan Wolfelt, “ We Celebrate Life ,” Family First, Accessed May 23, 2024, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjr6c3pk7D8 . 147 Tony Morgan, “ The 7 Phases of Church Life ,” The Unstuck Group, January 7, 2022, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmvmZcBPDo . 77 When the channel was first accessed, it displayed an excellent informative video at the top of the homepage [the front door], How We Help Churches Get Unstuck . The contents of this video described the mission of The Unstuck Group along with all the services and instructions, as well as the reasoning behind their compilation. After researching multiple channels that had no introductory videos, this was an unexpected yet pleasant surprise. For unknown reasons, when the channel was accessed on a different date, the same video was no longer high lighted on the front door. Instead, it had been embedded within a playlist filled with 31 other videos. This negates the channel’s ability to help viewers easily understand the organization’s brand and connect with people on a more personal level while mak ing a lasting impression and standing out from other channels. 148 The channel’s homepage contains a good photograph and an alluring color scheme, making it appear professional and contemporary. The videos vary in length, speaker, setting, and graphics, making them engaging to a multi -generational and culturally diversifi ed audience. The fourth YouTube channel considered was Ministry Pass. The URL is https://www.youtube.com/@MinistryPass/featured . The Ministry Pass channel was selected to be critiqued because it has an all -encompassing resource center for the church leader. The channel addresses numerous videos on a church's business and operational aspects. It also has videos discussing some of t he challenges church leaders encounter, including mental and emotional issues. However, it still lacks in the ministerial area of grief support challenges concerning the overall church and its members. The homepage does not elaborate on its mission, nor does it provide some form of a summary within the “About” section. There is no information available in that section other than 148 Natalia Kolkowska, “ How to Create an Engaging Video Introduction for Your Brand ,” Simple Show, January 25, 2023, https://simpleshow.com/blog/create -engaging -video -introduction -for -your -brand . 78 external links. A viewer would have to look through multiple playlists totaling 178 videos to find material relating to their specific need. The channel does highlight a video on the homepage, but it pertains to upcoming or seasonal podcasts, webinars, and other resources. It does not introduce the channel or explain its content, worth, or value. The channel displays the Ministry Pass logo, which consists of five colors depicting a stained -glass church window. No other imagery or pictures are utilized. The videos have a variety of well -spoken speakers who can keep viewers engrossed in the content. The channel’s “Hello Church!” videos have good opening graphic designs, backgrounds, and music that welcome the viewer into the speaker's world. 149 Although it lacks information addressing the problem statement, its primary approach is preparation —in other words, responding to situations instead of reacting. This is an excellent concept when dealing with the initial announcement of a church closure a nd the effects of collective grief among church members. When people experience a loss, they are generally only in tune with their own grief and mourning. A critical coping factor when grieving is a connection with others. When people experience collective loss, they are now linked and connected and in tune with the grief and mourning processes of others. 150 Many YouTube channels address individual grief, but scarcely any address collective or communal grief. All four YouTube channels analyzed within the Organizational Phase have video content that instructs and assists congregational members on a wide variet y of topics. Only two of the channels, Families First 149 David Crowson and Mike Hernandez, “ Balancing Church and Family: Real -Life Advice for Pastor Families ,” Ministry Pass, Accessed May 24, 2024, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blsMi_yBaj4&list=PLRfuixVIHV -aDmuOgE -LD_Pj3JL_Pym4k . 150 Asma Rehman, “What is Collective Grief .” 79 (https://www.youtube.com/@familiesfirst4095 ) and The Grief Channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeQz4 -WRg2us -wGNA2bzrJQ ) provided grief managing concepts when experiencing a human -to -human personal loss. The Grief Channel provided a parallel concept when experiencing a community -to -human loss. While this involves human collective grief, and the concepts can be used to rela te to the emotional, mental, and spiritual effects of congregational collective grief, the channel still does not explicitly address the factors involved in the loss of a church. Channel Target Audience Regardless of age or culture, people use YouTube to explore videos regarding different topics, projects, instruction, music, and more. As a result, this channel was made with two questions in mind: Who should be watching the uploaded videos, and why should they be watching them? 151 Because the production of videos often requires more time and investment, it must be ensured that the content speaks to an intended audience. So, before developing a video, a determination must be made regarding the target audience because it can impact t he video script, length, and format of uploaded videos in the future. 152 The YouTube Channel Micro -Project will effectively address the problem statement and reopen connections to those dealing with the loss, separation, and transitory effects of grief due to their church’s closure. This type of reconnection will not require them to step away from the fa miliarity of their home, decreasing feelings of displacement also caused by church closure grief. Church closures tend to affect a larger percentage of older members in the PBA and even 151 Wilson, “How to Create a YouTube Channel for Beginners in 2024 (Step -by -step),” 152 Sophia Bernazzani -Barron, “How to Write a Video Script,” HubSpot, March 15, 2024, https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how -to -write -a-video -script . 80 more so those with mobility issues. 153 With YouTube, individuals can go beyond the boundaries of their four walls and connect to a world outside of theirs without leaving the comfort and security of their homes. Now, in order for the targeted audience to find the channel and have access to the helpful videos, search engine optimization must be considered. This is a strategy to help boost views, engagement, and accessibility to a YouTube channel. Additionally, when a video is shared on YouTube, the target audience can find the content via YouTube and Google searches; therefore, optimizing videos on one platform nets benefits on the other. 154 William Welsh suggested inserting search words related to the problem statement and video topics. Keywords are an essential element of a video’s description, helping the algorithms understand the content of the videos and making them more discoverable to viewers. Over 24 keywords were entered under Basic Information within the tags field for the channel’s settings. These are keywords congregational members would use to search YouTube or Google if they were notified that their church was closing and needed grief counseling. Only 500 characters can be entered in this section; therefore, words directly relevant to the problem statement’s cause and effect were included. Including relevant keywords in the description improves the chances of the channel’s content appearing in search results and recommended videos, which can help increase views and engagement. 155 153 Schmidt ,“How to Create a YouTube Channel for Your Church. ” 154 Ibid. 155 Dean Shaw, “How To Choose Keywords That Will Get Your Video Content Noticed,” Digital Culture, Accessed June 19, 2024, https://digitalculturenetwork.org.uk/knowledge/how -to -choose -keywords -that -will -get - your -video -content -noticed . 81 As grief is collective, the healing should be as well. 156 The YouTube channel created for this micro -project will address topics related to the communal healing of a diminishing or diminished church body due to the building and organization no longer being available to represent a once vibrant congregation. Chur ches are closing rapidly each year, affecting thousands of congregations psychologically, yet thorough research has not been able to produce evidence of YouTube channels addressing such a prominent issue. Channel Establishment In order to engage the targeted audience, the YouTube channel had to be fully launched. This required an extremely detailed process to ensure all channel components were accessed, considered, and applied as needed. There are various ways to develop a YouTu be channel to meet the creator’s functional essentials, but the initial steps for establishing one are similar. Before launching the YouTube channel, a YouTube account was created by choosing the option to sign in. An existing Google email account was used, but a new account could have been created. After entering basic profile information for the account, the YouTube chan nel was established. At this point, the creativity and customization of the channel began by crafting a unique channel name and handle, similar to a social media name. The name of a new YouTube channel is essential so that it can be found easily through se arch engines. This helps eliminate confusion among people who are less tech -savvy than others. 157 Choosing a strong channel name is crucial for branding, discoverability, and overall channel success. 158 Selecting a strong channel name does not mean creating one that is too complicated; therefore, a simple, applicable, and 156 Schmidt ,“How to Create a YouTube Channel for Your Church. ” 157 Ibid. 158 Brian Dean, “YouTube Channel Name,” Backlinko, April 30 , 2024 , https://backlinko.com/hub/youtube/name . 82 recognizable name is better. As a result, the YouTube channel name selected for this micro - project was Church Closure Grief Care. This distinctive name cannot be confused with other channels or have its content mistaken for something else. Before uploading a profile picture or channel banner under the Basic Information section, an important step known as verifying the channel was taken. Completing this process allows a creator to unlock mission -critical and advanced features that involve loa ding fifteen -minute or longer videos, live streaming, and adding custom thumbnails to videos. 159 The process was accomplished by entering a valid phone number and then entering the code provided by YouTube via text. Verifying a phone number ensures there is an actual creator, not a robot. Essential channel features were also explored, and default settings were configured, allowing the creator to determine what happens to a video when uploaded to the YouTube channel. Other settings concerning viewer visibility, permissions, and roles were re viewed and applied as required. It was extremely important to declare if child -friendly content would be uploaded. YouTube received a hefty fine in 2019 and is now very cautious when it comes to content made for kids. 160 The channel can be terminated if the content is incorrectly designated. Upon completion of the channel’s framework, the branding was designed. A profile picture was selected and uploaded. The profile picture is the first object people see and associate with the channel, which can either make it enticing or place it at a signif icant disadvantage. 161 The picture was obtained from Canva, a graphic design platform that offers free art and design templates for YouTube channel branding. The picture selected for this YouTube channel was an 159 Wilson, “How to Create a YouTube Channel for Beginners in 2024 (Step -by -step).” 160 Ibid. 161 Evgeny Tekotev, “Best YouTube Profile Picture –Guide and Examples,” Animatron, Accessed June 12, 2024, https://www.animatron.com/blog/best -youtube -profile -picture . 83 empty cave with visible footprints inside of it. The reason for selecting this picture was that the empty cave provides imagery representing an empty tomb, and the footprints depict the activity of unseen movement. Both impart the promise of a better tomor row, which coincides with the hope emphasized in 1 Thessalonians 4:13 during the experience of grief. Another visual element of the YouTube channel is the banner. It is a large image that sits at the top of the channel, providing viewers with a preview of the channel and the content that can be expected based on this visual branding. 162 Both the profile picture and banner provide the YouTube channel with a recognizable identity and brand. 163 The graphics used relate to the purpose of the YouTube channel. The size of the images must be configured appropriately so that they look good no matter what type of device the YouTube channel is being viewed on. 164 Canva initially seemed to be the best option for developing an attention -grabbing banner, and it ensured that the banner size would comply with YouTube’s pixel recommendation of 2560 x 1440. Unfortunately, after a considerable amount of time spent on resea rching and developing an impactful banner, Canva did not provide a crucial piece of information that was necessary to prevent aspects of the banner from falling into dead zones spaces. These are areas not visible when viewed from different devices, such as television, computers, tablets, and cellular phones. 165 As a result, the original banner created on Canva was discarded. In his Peer Review, William also mentioned the issue of not taking into consideration the home page’s viewing 162 KC Kinniburgh, “ YouTube Banner Size, Dimensions, and Best Practices Guide in 2024, ”PROMO, November 8, 2023, https://promo.com/blog/youtube -banner -size -and -best -practices -guide. 163 Ibid. , 0:01:40. 164 Ibid., 0:0 2:00. 165 Chris Starkhagen, “ YouTube Banner Size: 5 Useful Design Tips for Great Banner Art ,” WeVideo , February 4, 202 2,www.wevideo.com/blog/for -work/youtube -banner -size -5-useful -design -tips -for -great -banner -art . 84 experience on a mobile device. Most people will be viewing a YouTube channel from mobile devices and tablets. Snappa, another free graphic design application, became the new solution for creating the banner because it provided templates incorporating gridlines showing each device's visible areas during its development. The banner created for this micro -project dep icts an individual's solemn and lonely expression in an empty church. His posture provokes the viewer to ponder or connect with the individual's mental, emotional, or spiritual state. Regardless of the speculated condition, hope is provided in the posted p hrase on the right of the banner stating, \"The Season may have ended, but the Journey is not over.” The goal is to unite the viewer’s church closure circumstances and grief stages with the banner’s imagery; doing so allows the viewers to immediately determ ine if the channel has been made for them. 166 After the banner was completed, a video watermark was uploaded under the branding tab so that viewers could subscribe to the channel while watching the video. Subscribing to a YouTube channel is a convenient way to stay informed of new content. It provide s instant notifications every time a new video is uploaded on the channel. 167 Many other options will be incorporated on the YouTube channel in the future, including good thumbnails, which William suggested to keep simple and catchy so they will draw attention. Often, too much writing and information on the thumbnail can make them hard to read and understand. 168 Another section, within the customization section, was filled out to connect viewers with the YouTube channel. A written description of the channel’s content was developed to 166 Wilson, “How to Create a YouTube Channel for Beginners in 2024 (Step -by -step) .” 167 “The Benefits of Subscribing to a YouTube Channel,” Accessed June 19, 2024, https://www.lsm.works/blogs/the -benefits -of -subscribing -to -a-youtube -channel . 168 “Titles & Thumbnails, YouTube Creators, September 16, 2022, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubFTkoJkNX4 . 85 demonstrate its value and what will be made available. The first few words of the channel’s description will appear on the front door of the YouTube channel; therefore, it needs to maximize the channel’s intent. When selected by a viewer, an “About” window will open up with a summary of information concerning the channel. Finally, keywords were added under settings to optimize searches by those whom church closures may have afflicted. William Welsh advised how this will allow the channel to appear at the top of searches. 169 This is the same concept used after developing a video. William suggested a few phrases as search statements to insert that would be useful, such as “Why has my church shut down?” and “How to heal after my church closed.” Other customization, video optimi zation, and earn screen options for monetization were reviewed, but this channel will not be used for that purpose. These are some options for creating a new YouTube channel that will be expanded on in the future for a ministry looking to address grief hindering the mental, emotional, and spiritual well -being of those once connected to a building, a church name, a commu nity, and a family that is seemingly no longer in existence after a church closure. Channel Introductory Video Along with a good profile picture and channel banner, an introductory video is vital to the YouTube channel’s front door. William Welsh shared that creating a trailer video and placing it at the top of the channel’s front door will not only introduce the c hannel and its content but is also helpful in providing the viewer with an immediate understanding of the channel’s primary area of focus. This is a critical aspect of any YouTube channel; however, this was a shortfall on three of the four previously analy zed channels within the Organizational Phase. None had 169 William Welsh , “Discussion Thread: Collaborating and Advising ,” June 8, 2024. 86 implemented introductory videos. The introductory video for this YouTube channel is approximately three minutes long, which is a good length for sharing information while maintaining viewer interest. 170 The retention level per channel on YouTube is only 35 to 40 percent, and finding avenues that will enhance retention and inspire the audience to finish the video is extremely important. 171 A creative introductory video will grab the audience's attention and help convey channel ideas with easy -to -understand visuals. It also decreases their level of curiosity and eases them into watching more of the channel’s content. 172 As a result, VideoScribe, a software for creating captivating and animated videos, was used to develop the channel’s introductory video. It is a free program with a purchase option to unlock premium features. The video displays a whiteboard and animatedly draws the narrator’s comments. Just as the development of the YouTube channel required an extremely detailed process, creating a video with VideoScribe was just as tedious. Websites Learners was used as a tutorial to learn how to make a handwriting animation video. 173 VideoScribe contains thousands of animations that can be drawn on a whiteboard. After gathering a good number of graphics, a setback occurred when it was realized that the animation process had to proceed, not precede the development of a script to be nar rated during the video. The goal of creating a well -written script is to draw the viewer’s attention at the beginning of the video while explaining the content of the 170 “How to Start and Growing Your Churches YouTube Channel,” January 16, 2021, YouTube video, 0:01:10 , Crazy Amazing Designs, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aGXoCbyc5M. 171 James Young, So Is It Important to Have a YouTube Intro Maker ,” January 15 , 202 1, https://bunnystudio.com/blog/so -is -it -important -to -have -a-youtube -intro -maker . 172 Ibid. 173 Bryan Edsel, “How to Make A Handwriting Animation Video,” Website Learners, August 3, 2022, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScsBz11iV9U . 87 video. 174 The script allows an opportunity to organize thoughts and tell an engaging story. 175 It would have been more complicated to set up the animations and then narrate them as they were being created. Once a creative, engaging, and thought -provoking script was developed, it had to be voice -recorded. Although sound quality and clarity are signi ficant factors in voice recordings, an iPhone 15 was trusted to produce the necessary quality. With the script developed and recorded, the animations corresponding to what was being stated could now be researched and added to the project. As an animation is selected, VideoScribe places each drawing on a whiteboard and a replica on the sequence bar at the bottom of the program. Once an animation is completed, the user determines which direction to scroll next for the proceeding animation. Af ter selecting all animations related to the script, timing must be linked. This aspect was extremely challenging. Linking the words' timing with the animation’s duration was a difficult task. If not aligned properly, it would seem like the dubbing process involved in the foreign film market, where the sound of the words does not match the movement of the lips. Fortunately, each animation had its own settings. Under the properties section, the user can adjust each graphic's animation time, the time for a pau se, and the transition time to the following graphic. Therefore, the timing and movement of each one could be sped up or slowed down to match the narration. While getting the sight and sound to match took some time, this feature solved the problem. Afterward, background music was incorporated. William Welsh also stated that music and sound grab a listener’s attention, and by not using them, an opportunity for a better emphasis or to make a lasting impression would be missed. The right song can set th e tone, enhance the 174 Bernazzani -Barron, “How to Write a Video Script.” . 175 Lydia Sweatt, “How to Write an Entertaining YouTube Video Script,” VidIQ, October 24, 2022, https://vidiq.com/blog/post/write -youtube -video -script . 88 emotion, and bring the entire production to life. On the other hand, the wrong song can distract from the message, ruin the mood, and even lead to copyright issues. 176 VideoScribe has a library with music and sound effects that can be used without fear of copyright infringement. The one selected for the animated video had a smooth, calm, and story -telling tone regarding the complexities of a person’s trials and tribulat ions. Within the background of the music, sounds similar to a church choir set the stage for the video’s content. It also contains somewhat of a crescendo that comes in while the goal of the YouTube channel is being explained. A crescendo is a gradual rise in volume and tempo, resulting in a sense of anticipation and leading to a high point. 177 Setting the timing of the crescendo with the narration of the channel’s goals was a vital part of the development of the video. The goal was to have the leading to the high point of the music reflect the same journey for the viewer when the YouTube channe l’s goals were being introduced, leading them to a high point in their grief circumstances. Once the voice -recorded script, handwriting animation, and background music were arranged, a separate program was needed to combine them. While VideoScribe could have rendered all three components, more familiarity was needed with the program to accomplish the task. After considering different options, it was decided to have all three components placed into iMovie for final adjustments and rendering. iMovie is a free video editing software that is available for Apple products. While there was some knowledge of using iMovie in the past, the process came with challenges. All three files had been recorded separately and then imported into iMovie. The YouTube channel’s profile picture and banner were also imported. 176 “The Importance of Choosing the Right Music for Your Videos ,” The Studio Sheringham, April 28, 2023, https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/importance -choosing -right -music -your -videos -the -studio -sheringham . 177 “Crescendo: A Gradual Increase in Volume,” Yousician Team, Accessed June 19, 2024, https://yousician.com/blog/crescendo?bx=true . 89 The iMovie program allows files to be duplicated. Then, they can be cut, overlapped, or trimmed as needed. The animation file was placed as the base, and the voice recording and music were then attached to the base. The first task was aligning the voice re cording with the animation. The three files could be moved forward or backward like a slide rule. After proper adjustments were made, the music had to be attached and aligned correctly. The music's tempo was steady in its original form, but the crescendo came much sooner than needed in order to instill the desired effect. At the point where the crescendo naturally comes in, the narration is still in the throes of expressing church closure grief and coming alongside the viewer's own emotional experience. At this point, a shift in tempo and tone in the music would have communicated unrealistic or false empathy. Therefore, the music had to be duplicated, spliced, and overlapped. This allows t he steady tone to continue longer than its original form until the narration reflects words of hope for the viewer. Once this process was completed, the sound levels for the narration and music were adjusted for proper sound quality. Dr. Talley referenced this key factor when he stated that the sound was clear, even when played at a low level. 178 Another feature of iMovie incorporated into the video was the addition of transitions. These are animated effects between clips to smooth or blend the change from one scene to another by having the clip fade or dissolve into the following clip, giving it a professional appearance. 179 These effects were added in between some of the downloaded still shots [pictures] to help animate the flow of the video. Ultimately, the completed video was rendered and formatted to an MP4 video. It was then uploaded to the YouTube channel. 178 Robert Talley , “ Implementation Phase Feedback ,” June 18 , 2024. 179 “Add Transitions in iMovie on Mac ,” iMovie User Guide, Accessed June 18 , 2024 , https://support.apple.com/guide/imovie/add -transitions . 90 An “End Screen” was added to the end of the video once it was downloaded to the Church Closure Grief Care channel. An End Screen, also referred to as an “End Card,” is a YouTube feature that appears in the last seconds of a video to promote other helpful v ideos on the channel. 180 This feature can be added to the YouTube video within the details section under the editor tab. End Screens can only be added at the end of a video and will only appear for a short duration. As more videos are developed, End Screens will be inserted to le ad others to additional helpful and resourceful videos. Three videos previously recorded in the second micro - project, Panel Discussions, were inserted at the end of the introductory video as placeholders. As additional videos, webinars, vlogs, tutorials, and even live content are created and uploaded for the YouTube channel, playlists will be developed to present and categorize the channel’s content. Playlists are an excellent tool to organize videos by the me, audience type, or content, enhancing the viewer’s experience and thus encouraging them to spend more time engaged in watching multiple videos listed on the channel. 181 Playlists are indexed separately in YouTube search results, so targeted audiences can see them when searching for various topics, including church closure grief care. 182 This will allow first -time viewers to be well -informed in determining if the channel has the beneficial information they are searching for to assist them with their collective grief. Video credits were not included because no one else worked on or helped develop the introductory video on this YouTube channel. 180 Cem Eygi, “How to Add End Screen on YouTube Videos,” January 5 , 2024 , YouTube video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSNNqEtD1WQ . 181 Amy Johnson, “How to Create YouTube Playlists & Why They Are So Important,” AudioSocket, Accessed June 20 , 2024 ,https://blog.audiosocket.com/social -media -guides/how -to -create -youtube -playlists -why - theyre -so -important . 182 Ibid. 91 All the settings for this YouTube channel micro -project were configured as needed for sustainability, and the channel’s video content will continue to be customized to reach, relate to, and support a targeted audience that has or will experience the compou nding grief effects of their church’s closure. Summary It was previously stated that the YouTube Channel Micro -Project was a platform geared toward information dissemination. Its content would consist of vital grief care information to assist those dealing with the emotional, mental, spiritual, and behavioral effects of their church’s closure. While the platform and purpose have been designed and developed, more important than the establishment of those facets is the establishment of its presence. During the research regarding options for developing a YouTube channel, one key piece of advice provided online had nothing to do with the format, graphics, or content. The advice is so rousing that it also applies throughout the portfolio journey. It is to “stop thinking about it…stop putting it off…and start right now.” 183 Actions on the part of the PBA concerning the implementation of counseling programs for its network of churches need to be considered with this advice in mind. Assistance for those afflicted by the consequential effects of the problem statement must be established now. Further delays can cause complic ations or increased risks for depression, substance abuse, disassociation, or suicidal tendencies. 184 The efficacy of this micro -project can limit or even eliminate existing psychological and behavioral effects of church closure grief conditions. After decades of being overlooked and becoming a failing point in ministry, church closure grief care is final ly available 183 Wilson, “How to Create a YouTube Channel for Beginners in 2024 (Step -by -step).” 184 “Complicated Grief,” Mayo Clinic, Accessed May 30 , 2024 ,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases - conditions/complicated -grief/symptoms -causes . 92 not only as a digital presence but also as a psychological and spiritual presence to serve as a promise of hope, symbolic of the empty tomb. Analysis of the Micro -Project While it is the third one, the YouTube Channel Micro -Project serves as the first opportunity to provide public awareness and assistance regarding a unique and unfamiliar topic that affects thousands of Christians each year. The awareness is provided through the establishment of a well -configured YouTube chann el. The assistance will be provided through the available content uploaded to the channel. All the information and support would be easily accessible from a shared link, Google search, or social media l eading to the channel. It has become apparent that this portfolio's problem statement and its development can be more far - reaching than the PBA, the regional churches, and its members, which this micro -project looks to assist. This is a much -needed venture that has long been overlooked. Creating this YouTube channel was a very enjoyable and gratifying experience. A lot of knowledge was attained concerning the channel’s development and all the components and configurations that had to go into not only establishing one correctly but also ma intaining one that would be a source of comfort, strength, and encouragement for multiple grief -stricken viewers resulting from church closure. A significant amount of research and planning was conducted to determine the best route to avoid YouTube channel pitfalls concerning the quality and quantity of the channel’s profile and content. Other YouTube channels were reviewed to gather information on what seemed to work and what needed to be improved. During the research, it was noted that YouTube channel creators are keen on developing live video recordings and inserting them as part of the channel’s content. While it is an extremely popular choice, the decision was made to bypass producing a live vide o and create an animated 93 one instead. At least, this was the case for the introductory video. William Welsh shared that YouTube has a playlist designed for video creators on its channel. 185 The channel is a valuable resource filled with videos that provide instructions about video equipment, editing, and more. 186 He also stated many important areas to consider when creating a video, such as the background, lighting, and camera angle. While it may sound simple, it was more demanding and time - consuming than anticipated. Based on the past experiences of creating live recordings during the second micro -project, another option was chosen, and the results were beyond expectations. Working with and counting on technological resources can sometimes have disadvantages. However, when functioning as intended, computers, programs, applications, search engines, voice recorders, and other software products can generate advantageous results, as was the case for this micro -project. In the previous micro -project, technology [software program] was almost the downfall of one of the panel discussions. While technology was complex for this third micro -project, it provided significant benefits and f acilitated the completion of the project in a manner unlike the previous ones. The first two micro -projects relied more heavily on human interaction and commitment than technology. The task of recruiting and interviewing suitable candidates, coordinating s chedules, explaining purpose and methodology, and receiving cooperation and meaningful responses created a daunting undertaking with precarious expectations. While reliance on technology can appear to remove a burden of uncertainty on a user due to its ant icipated efficiency, it instills a false sense of security that the task will be fulfilled as expected. 185 William Welsh , “Discussion Thread: Collaborating and Advising ,” June 8, 2024. 186 “Total Beginner’s Guide to Video Equipment, ” YouTube Creators, May 15, 2018, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkqosTC8G1g . 94 VideoScribe was an animation software that was used to create the introductory video. The software provides an abundant number of graphics, but searchable words limit the program. This posed a serious issue due to the limited number of animations that coul d be found directly related to the problem statement. Many hours were spent trying to find relatable graphics for simple and also challenging relevant keywords such as church closure, transitory grief, detachment, isolation, and many others. Improvisation had to be incorporated. Modified wording had to be used, and then numerous graphics were scrolled through to find one that may relate to the envisioned concept. This process was very time -consuming. Many of the graphics included in the project were classif ied under a different search title than reflected in the video. This micro -project involved dealing with five separate software programs, causing the process to be very challenging. A student looking to develop a YouTube Channel Micro -Project or other tech -heavy projects should have some form of technological practical knowledge. While many “how -to” YouTube videos were used to create this project, this student was slightly tech - savvy and familiar with some of the software programs utiliz ed. Due to the short timeframe and heavy workload of writing assignments, it is reco mmended that this be an option to consider after a semester break longer than a weekend. It would allow students the opportunity to research information on creating a YouTube channel and then make an informed decision about whether the project would be fea sible and an applicable solution for their established problem statement. Yes, there were challenges with writing papers and developing this micro -project. Obstacles had to be overcome by ensuring plans were established that included forward thinking. However, once the entire process has been completed, it will serve as a benefi cial solution for the problem statement. The PBA Director and others were provided with the URLs of the YouTube channel and the introductory video. There is excitement about the resourcefulness of this project, 95 its future content , and its potential as a ministerial asset for the PBA and its network of churches who can now empathize with the grief caused by church closures .96 CHAPTER 5 : MICRO -PROJECT FOUR The fourth Micro -Project this student conducted to address the ministry problem was Brochures. Similar to the third micro -project, this chapter examines another mea ns of information dissemination. Justification is provided regarding the value of this micro -project to effectively communicate with individuals without the use of the Internet. Justification Churc h closures have been a prevalent issue within the Peninsula Baptist Association and among many other church denominations throughout the United States. Due to cultural and economic changes that are creating declines in church memberships and finances, congr egations are having to close their church doors permanently and either sell or gift their church. Another increasing option for struggling churches is to merge with another church. As a result of this dilemma, the PBA initiated legal and financial as sistance programs for the impacted churches so they could navigate through the proper business aspects of the closures. Unfortunately, while the PBA considered the church's best interests, they overlooked a vital aspect of the impact on the congregation: c hurch closure grief. The congregations gathering for meetings, the churches’ staff, the ministers, the regional campus teams, and the elected councils each have their own connection with their communities of faith and their own myriad feelings about their ending. 187 The first two micro -projects developed, Interviews and Analysis and Panel Discussions, served as a means to research and gather information regarding the validity of the problem statement. Once a counseling deficiency within the PBA was identified and dial ogue was had to determine viable options and solutions to address the problem statement, the latter micro -projects 187 Richard Bott ,“What To Do With Your Grief When A Church Closes,” Broadview, March 30, 202 1, https://broadview.org/moderator -message -easter -2021 . 97 were considered as active approaches to disseminate helpful ideas and processes to manage church closure grief. As a Doctor of Ministry candidate in Pastoral Counseling, providing counsel to grief - stricken members of a closing church requires an ability to effectively communicate across broad lines of cultures and generations. Considering the common types of communi cation: verbal, nonverbal, written, and visual, a YouTube channel was selected as a third micro -project to address the PBA's limitations and to disseminate therapeutic information to lessen the adverse effects of transitory grief. This micro -project afford s grief counseling interaction and support within the context of verbal and visual communication. Utilizing th e Brochures Micro -Project allows additional opportunities to further broadcast grief counseling communications in a written and visual manner to interact with congregations unaware of online resources or those without the ability to access them. It is a powerful way to connect with those in need and convey the transformative impact counseling resources can have on their lives. 188 The intent is to limit the residual effects of transitory and disenfranchised grief caused by church closures. Grief involves moving through different emotions for change, healing, and growth. 189 Therefore, the goal is to maximize coping mechanisms available to those suffering the journey. Developing and incorporating brochures as part of church closure support systems allows the circulation of vital information concerning the availability of grie f care within PBA. The strategic dissemination of brochures also provides an opportunity to address even another type of grief: anticipatory grief. This type of grief is a state of deep, painful sorrow that occurs 188 Ethan Harper, “10 Ways to Market Your Counseling Services with Impactful Brochures, ”March 20, 2024, https://www.mycreativeshop.com/learn/10 -ways -to -market -your -counseling -services -with -impactful - brochures. 189 “Wh y Is The Grief Process Important For Christians ,”Seattle Christian Counseling, May 6, 20 19 , https://seattlechristiancounseling.com/articles/why -is -the -grief -process -important -for -christians . 98 before an impending loss. 190 Similar to being informed of a terminal disease, if proper counseling resources are not provided, the times leading up to the death of a person can be just as difficult to endure, if not worse, than the death itself. Being informed of a long -standing chur ch's upcoming closure has negatively impacted many PBA congregations emotionally, mentally, and spiritually due to the perceived loss or death of their church family, friends, or their role in the community. Engaging in the development of brochures is a gr eat way to build trust with the target audience. 191 By creating brochures containing insightful information about several church closure grief care topics and resources, people can be ministered to, comforted, and reassured about their future. Additionally, within the second micro -project, some panelists e mphasized that a lack of resources would not be the major obstacle to creating effective counseling programs within the PBA. The main issue would be accessibility to the resources versus availability. The YouTube Channel Micro -Project was implemented to easily reach those who prefer digital information, while the Brochures Micro -Project will cater to those who prefer hard copy information. Throughout the Bible, we are provided with many scriptures instructing us to put things in writing (Exodus 17:14, Revelation 1:19). In Habakkuk 2:2 -3 (NIV) it states, \"Write the vision and make it plain on tablets, that he may run who reads it. For the vis ion is yet for an appointed time; But at the end it will speak, and it will not lie. Though it tarries, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.\" Within the Bible, we have been tasked to write down communications of importance to benefi t others in the present or future. Brochures as a micro - 190 Lynne Eldridge, “What Is Anticipatory Grief, ”July 15, 2023, https://www.verywellhealth.com/understanding -anticipatory -grief -and -symptoms -2248855. 191 “The Benefits of Brochure Design, ”PhD Design Newsletter, April 19, 2023, https://wwwlinkedin.com/pulse/benefits -brochure -design -phddesign. 99 project aligns with scripture because its contents will serve to provide revelation or speak truth about a person's anticipatory or other forms of grief in the present and provide hope, with an ability to run or move toward comfort, that will come in due s eason. Peer Review The increase in church closures has been problematic for members, the leadership teams, and the governing body of churches. Pastors and church boards are left with making hard decisions on what to do with a building that is no longer sustainable due to dwi ndling congregations. 192 While there is a lot of data about the church trends, dynamics, and stances that led to the reforming of the religious entity, there is very little information addressing the emotional, psychological, and spiritual welfare of the people impacted by the ch ange. Within the first discussion thread, Lajuan Johnson and Michael Boyce, two students enrolled in DMIN854, shared their intrigue regarding the problem statement. They both commented on how this is definitely an overlooked aspect of Christian life. As the loca l church becomes a family of faith, church closures can indeed cause grief, leaving some former members unchurched and spiritually isolated. Lajuan questioned if the pandemic was the main factor in church closures within the PBA. 193 While the effects of COVID -19 impacted many churches, the pandemic only served to amplify and accelerate an ongoing issue. Lajuan also affirmed the progression of church closures based on his experiences and stated that “the mental and spiritual effect th at it has on the congregation should not be taken lightly.” The hardship of church closure can be a significant burden on members and leadership as well. 192 Herald Staff, “Thousands of Churches Closing Every Year in U.S.,” Houston Herald ,February 20, 20 24 , https://houstonherald.com/2023/01/thousands -of -churches -closing -every -year -in -u-s. 193 Lajuan Johnson , “Discussion Thread: A Defensible Micro -Project -DMIN854 ,” August 26, 2024. 100 At this point in the research, the problem statement has been validated, dialogue has been had concerning possible solutions, and courses of action have been implemented toward disseminating online and in -person grief counseling information. For the fourth project, the Brochures Micro -Project was selected to distribute grief care counseling literature for those dealing with pre -closure and post -closure grief. Promoting an effective counseling initiative through a brochure campaign is an excellent approach t o improving the relationship between the PBA and church members. A brochure can communicate empathy and deliver resources that create situational awareness and strengthen the community bonds of those dealing with church closure grief. 194 Lajuan concurred with the choice of the micro -project, stating it could be very effective and successful in helping people find resources to adjust to the many changes that this world brings. An initial concern was the effectiveness of this micro -project in terms of usability. Would people be enticed to read a brochure providing information on church closure grief care? Michael noted that the brochure would have to legitimize the idea of needing grief counseling. 195 Many people who need such counseling do not take advantage of available opportunities. 196 He added that the brochure would need to help the person not only see the need but also see counseling as a legitimate form of addressing the need. Someone dealing with conditions of transitory, disenfranchised, and anticipatory grief will gravitate towar d anything that could help them through it. 197 194 Catherine T., “Ultimate Guide On Creating The Best Church Brochure,” Brochure Designers, November 22, 2019, https://www.brochuredesigners.com/Ultimate -Guide -To -Church -Brochures -2300LR.html. 195 Michael Boyce , “Discussion Thread: Collaborating and Adv ising -DMIN854 ,” September 11, 2024. 196 Lauren J. Breen, Cameron J. Croucamp, and Clare S. Rees, “What Do People Really Think About Grief Counseling? Examining Community Attitudes,” Death Studies 43, no. 10 (November 26, 2019): 611 –18. 197 Jacob Siner, “How To Create Successful Brochures For Your Practice,” Practice Promotions, February 22, 2024, https://practicepromotions.net/successful -physical -therapy -brochures . 101 The content of a brochure is one of the most important aspects of the development process. An effective brochure contains a lot of information that must be consolidated to ensure readers understand the content without overwhelming them. One key item is a “call -to -action.” This is a prompt that encourages the target audience to take a specific action. 198 Michael suggested inserting a Quick Response (QR) code as a call -to -action if it can done without cluttering or overcomplicating the brochure. 199 He shared how QR codes allow for a quick and easy step in the call -to -action, leading a person to a website for more information or help them to receive continual updates. While Michael makes a good point about the ease and versatility of a QR code and ho w it can be a compelling call -to -action inclusion, it could also pose a challenge to those unfamiliar with this new technology. Additional advice was requested from peers on making brochures a practical resource for ministering to those whose long -tenured church closed. Lajuan suggested assisting with the many different types of spiritual and emotional grief. “The concept of coming to one’s aid in a variety of different ways depending on the problems seems to provide a broad and accurate model for counseling, better perhaps than the narrow, more limited approach.” 200 Michael provided information on brochure development software and royalty -free imagery to enhance the content while avoiding unintentional plagiarism. Lastly, Michael recommended small group ministries to help those afflicted quickly integrate into a heal thy church body. Once established, information concerning these small groups can be made available within the brochures as 198 Erika Varangouli, “How To Write A CTA That Converts,” Semruch Blog, May 27, 2024, https://www.semrush.com/blog/what -is -a-call -to -action . 199 Shintaro Okazaki et al., “The Curious Versus the Overwhelmed: Factors Influencing QR Codes Scan Intention,” Journal of Business Research 99 (June 2019): 499. 200 Larry Crabb, Effective Biblical Counseling (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan, 2013). 102 another call -to -action, a reconnection to the church body. The comments by both peers have accentuated that being in a caring church community is an important part of Christian life. 201 Implementation Many congregations within the PBA have been experiencing different forms of grief, affecting them emotionally, mentally, and spiritually due to the sudden or gradual closure of their churches. Several of these members are not tech -savvy, which limits their ability to gain access to helpful online resources to assist them in navigating through the process of transitional, disenfranchised, and anticipatory grief. As a result, some may feel as if they are left to manage this crisis alone, which could lead to f eelings of neglect, the need to isolate, or even the abandonment of their faith. By incorporating and developing the Brochures Micro -Project, information containing valuable counseling resources can be distributed in person or via email. Brochures can also include instructions on how to access online resources, including the one already made available through the third micro -project, the YouTube channel. Three brochures were designed and created to address a specific topic and different target audience unde r the umbrella of church closure grief. These three brochures can be accessed via the hyperlinks below. They each contain a unique design and purpose.

Charles, Nine Marks of a Healthy Church , Fourth edition (Wheaton: Crossway, 2021), chapter 4, section: “Why Join a Church? ”, ProQuest Ebook Central. 103 Brochure Purpose During the second micro -project, Panel Discussions, different panelists discussed feasible options for remedying the emotional and psychological effects of grief suffered by those who experienced their church’s closure. Some of the suggested measures inclu ded creating an online site where people could visit and watch helpful videos to gain assistance in navigating through their grief. This measure was implemented during the development of the third micro -project, the YouTube channel. Additional suggestions were made during the third of three panel discussions. Those who had been previously afflicted by church closures shared the importance of being provided information in writing. Initially, Dan McPeters, one of the panelists, stated that a better option for distributing information to the public was through a podcast. After additional dialogue with the other panelists concerning generational differences, he acknowledged that supplying hard -copy information would be more valuable. It would allow recipients to read and reread the content as needed for comprehension and guidance. The suggestion led to the research and development of the fourth micro -project, Brochures. In our increasingly digital world, some may think printed brochures have outlived their usefulness; however, printed materials remain valuable educational tools for those looking to disseminate important information about counseling assistance. 202 The PBA can maximize the use of this micro -project to distribute counseling resources and other pertinent information throughout its network of churches. Research has concluded that printed brochures are effective communication tools in raising awareness concerning new, significant, or adverse events. 203 Church closures can undoubtedly be categorized as an adverse event for people who have been 202 Kathi Rowzie, “Research Shows Importance of Printed Medical Brochures,” Two Sides, August 10 , 202 2,https://twosidesna.org/US/research -shows -importance -of -printed -medical -brochures . 203 Ibid. 104 informed that in the future, they will no longer be able to assemble in the same location they had been accustomed to for years with their families and friends. The PBA’s distribution of brochures can also be an effective channel for sharing how the differ ent forms of grief involved in this adverse event can be managed. 204 Adopting a strategy of circulating brochures throughout the PBA is valuable and beneficial for improving church closure empathy. Brochures can assist members of the PBA in breaking down information about church closures and some of the psychological and sp iritual grief challenges they may experience in clear and concise language, making it easier for them to comprehend instructions on different grief care options. 205 This will enable the implementation of previously suggested measures to decrease church closure grief effects on individuals. Developing brochures can also help members become more engaged in the church closure process by providing them with valuable info rmation in a format that is easy to appreciate, making them more likely to take an active role in the transition process instead of immediately choosing to leave or isolate themselves. 206 When a pending church closure is announced, representatives from the PBA attend church business meetings in an attempt to provide assistance by answering questions or tending to concerns about the process. Having the PBA provide members with detailed info rmation in a brochure before the business meetings can save time and allow the PBA to focus on answering more specific questions and concerns about the closure process rather than spending time on general counseling or closure information. 207 204 Rowzie, “Research Shows Importance of Printed Medical Brochures .” 205 Leah Dossey, “Three Benefits of Patient Education Brochures,” Blueleaf Creative, February 23, 2023, https://blueleafcreative.com/brochures/patient -education -brochures. 206 Ibid. 207 Dossey, “Three Benefits of Patient Education Brochures.” 105 Despite digital era preferences, brochures remain an effective medium due to their distribution versatility as either a handout or digital download and the lasting impression they leave on readers’ minds. 208 Brochure Application Considerations There were several different options available to consider when creating professional - quality brochures. Photo AD King is a free all -in -one graphic design marketing application for creating brochures. It provides over 70,000 fully editable graphic design templates and contains multiple design elements like a 3D editor, backgrou nds, custom fonts, and stock images. 209 An initial familiarization process with this application proved its ease of use, endless development opportunities, and links to video tutorials. The application contained numerous templates, including bi -fold and tri -fold options, but a fee had to be pai d before accessing them. Several templates requiring prepayment options provide users with a QR code creator, which would be helpful in a counseling brochure for those who do not know how to search for online resources. A QR code is an array of pixels set in a grid that a smartphone’s camera can use to quickly gain access to a website without having to type the web address. 210 Although it was an excellent recommendation by Michael in the Peer Review section, unless the recipient of the brochure is tech -savvy and knows how to use their smartphone with this type of technology, using a QR code could prove to be an ineffective tool . 208 Kai Tomboc, “Sixteen Creative Examples of Brochures You Can Edit and Print,” Piktochart, July 11, 2024, https://piktochart.com/blog/examples -of -brochures . 209 “Graphic Design Maker For You,” Photo AD King, Accessed August 25, 2024, https://photoadking.com . 210 Anthony Freda, “What Is A QR Code,” Avast, August 4, 2022, https://www.avast.com/c -what -is -qr - code -how -to -scan. 106 As a developer, exploring and designing a brochure with free templates proved straightforward. However, upon downloading the final version of the brochure, it only consisted of two Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) files, showing the front and back. This final product may create configuring or formatting challenges for many during the printing process. It would be difficult for a novice to know how to configure the printer settings to ensure the front and back of the templates were aligned right side up and fit completely inside the designated paper size. My Creative Shop was another template application explored that prides itself on being the easiest online brochure maker with limitless customization options for those with no design experience. 211 The design center was very elaborate, providing a variety of images, clipart, patterns, and smart snippets. Although it did not provide tutorials, the template designs included gridlines to facilitate the placement of text and imagery, keeping a user with in pre -set margins while maintaining proper spacing. It provided a QR code creator and custom Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) as an option to share the design digitally. It is advertised as a free brochure development application. While access to the temp lates and designing page did not require creating an account like other applications, printing or downloading any completed brochures required a form of payment. Due to its extensive collection of graphics, Canva was an application previously used to develop the YouTube Channel M icro -Project. Because a subscription had already been purchased, Canva was also considered for the Brochures Micro -Project. Canva’s brochure templates are dynamic and allow a user to conveniently view and work with both sides of the brochure simultaneously, unlike other applications. This facilitated a focused simplicity when 211 “The Easiest Online Brochure Maker,” My Creative Shop, Accessed August 25, 2024, https://www.mycreativeshop.com/brochure -maker.html. 107 editing one side of the brochure without losing sight of the desired format and intended final design. Many other brochure development options were researched. Venngage compiled a list of the top ten brochure design software in 2024. 212 While some of these had dazzling designs and thousands of graphics, they all required purchasing the software. Users are granted free access to different templates and editing tools up to a certain extent. Now, if an attempt is made to print or download a draft, the websites direct users to a payment window to create an account before the completed brochure is released. After thoroughly reviewing many applications and even though there were many better ones, Microsoft Word (MS Word) was chosen for the Brochures Micro -Project. MS Word has many of the same templates, graphics, and editing tools as the other applications without the associated costs. While a subscription to Microsoft Office is needed, almost every PC or Mac user already has it on their computer and can cre ate elaborate brochures with the software. Since this micro -project was being developed as an asset for t he PBA, using an already available and familiar application will enable them to develop additional brochures to address other topics or needs from templates created during this course without researching or purchasing additional software in the future. Thi s also allows the PBA to store and share documents and the opportunity for collaborative editing within its network of churches. 213 After much consideration, selecting the application for creating a brochure came down to the printing purpose and quality preference. Developing brochures for a one -time church event 212 Leticia Fonseca, “Ten Best Brochure Design Software in 2024,” Venngage, January 16, 2024, https://venngage.com/blog/brochure -design -software. 213 Marina Schlosser, “Best Document Creat ion Software,” G2, Accessed August 19 , 2024, https://www.g2.com/categories/document -creation . 108 would be much different and less tasking than the intent of this micro -project, which is to create counseling assistance brochures for mass distribution throughout the PBA for years to come. Brochure Design & Development MS Word was used to customize brochure templates and create the final design, which contains critical information about church closure grief care for dissemination. Similar to the YouTube Channel Micro -Project, the vision and purpose of the Brochures Micro -Project is to introduce available wellness programs within the PBA. The brochures contain counseling resources to effectively guide individuals through transitory, anticipatory, and disenfranchised grief effects that may be endured by congregations having experienced their church’s permanent closure. Once the application was selected, creating the brochure was critical for engaging those needing church closure grief care and making a lasting impression. A brochure can reach multiple people across different locations via email or regular mail. A poster can also be distributed but is usually more applicable and visible at central locations only. Creating a brochure allows for a more personal connection; therefore, its content is essential. While the ultimate goal of a brochure is to lead toward an action, it can only be accomplished if the brochure is opened and read. 214 Therefore, throughout the development of the brochures, various elements had to be considered for incorporation to draw the target audience's attention. Before starting the brochure design, the target audience must be determined for each brochure, such as demographics related to age and gender, allowing for the relevant visuals and text to be incorporated. 215 214 “Eight Key Brochure Design Elements,” Print Place, Accessed September 16, 2024, https://www.printplace.com/articles/key -brochure -design -elements . 109 After the target audience has been determined, the message to be conveyed within the brochure must be established via its design and layout. Creating an engaging layout strategically uses visual elements to guide the reader's attention and develop a sense of flow. 216 Brochures rely heavily on vibrant colors, higher -resolution images, and effective wording that appeals to the recipient’s interest and causes them to engage. The text font and size are also essential factors in how the counseling resource is received. The print cannot be too small, making it difficult to read, and it cannot be too large, cluttering the information. Helvetica is the font incorporated within each of the brochures. It is a safe choice for most publications because it is simple, good - looking, and easy to understand. 217 Finally, there are different types of folds to consider as well: Bi -fold, Tri -fold, Z -fold, and others. Tri -folds are an excellent choice for educational purposes and will enhance the impact of the material. 218 Ultimately, within the brochure development, specific color palettes were selected to assist in conveying a particular message of empathy while encouraging optimism, strength, and comfort. Including the right imagery was another vital aspect of relaying gr ief awareness and understanding. As simplistic as the font and size of the brochure would seem, appropriate variations were utilized to ensure the focus and content of the message were clear. Finally, the artistic folds add to the visual impact of the broc hure. Multiple folds were considered, with each 215 Sergiu Vidican, “The Anatomy of a Good Brochure Design,” FlipSnack, May 19, 2022, https://blog.flipsnack.com/brochure -design -anatomy. 216 Harper, “10 Ways To Market Your Counseling Services With Impactful Brochures.” 217 Zach McDaniel, “The Best Typography Fonts For Catalogs and Brochures,” FlipSnack Blog, September 19, 2019, https://blog.flipsnack.com/brochure -catalog -typography -font. 218 “Seven Popular Types of Brochure Folds,” Custom Printing Inc, Accessed August 26, 2024, https://customprintinginc.com/7 -popular -types -of -brochure -folds . 110 one dependent on the designs’ intent. Keeping in mind the different elements that make up a quality brochure, three different brochures were developed, each serving a distinct purpose. Design Content & Connection A brochure serves as a means to connect and communicate with an intended audience. Two of the three brochures have been developed to target the same audience, while the third brochure is intended for a different audience. The design concept for the first a nd second brochures is to reach people who have been recently made aware that their church will be closing. Several churches in the PBA have closed for various reasons, including those with older congregations that could not sustain evangelistic aspiration s, which led to decreased attendance, finances, and volunteer staff to assist with the upkeep of the church. As was acknowledged during the Interview and Analysis Micro -Project, in the past, when the congregations were initially notified of a church closure, people endured unfamiliar aspects of grief with no support system being made available. The first and second brochures have been designed to assist in overcoming this ongoing issue. The first brochure was created to provide awareness and be passed out in person or as part of large gatherings during the PBA’s initial encounter with members of churches pending closure. ( https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/tnrknnwiw4o5ss7ihtkga/DMIN854 -Brochure - 1.pdf?rlkey=pzpf0jwa8ky3ojz7mxkvc5o66&st=w54w6k4x&dl=0 ) During the second panel discussion, Jim Moynihan, one of the PBA leaders, stated, “It is important to approach congregations as individuals, couples, and even small groups to spend time listening and slowing down the effects of stress and anxiety.” 219 Passing out this type of brochure in a group setting provides an opportunity to distribute knowledge and encourage conversation regarding Pre - 219 Jim Moynihan, “Panel Discussion Micro -Project -DMIN852, April 9, 2024. 111 closure grief, which is the timeframe before the church actually closes. It is also geared toward developing understanding and promoting healing. The brochure addresses grief and two initial forms that could be experienced due to the closure: Transitory an d Anticipatory grief. The Z -fold template was incorporated into the first brochure to provide a visual impact and quickly captivate the viewer’s attention while leaving a lasting impression. 220 It also offers a unique yet easy transitional flow for the reader. The Z -fold was modified and inverted for ease of opening, transitioning the reader from a cover page of empathy to an explanation of what a church member may experience during a church clo sure by defining transitory and anticipatory grief. As the reader navigates through the brochure, the layout includes supportive PBA leadership quotes, commentary, and some grief symptoms they may be feeling. An adjustment was made to the original mockup s o that when folded, the leadership quotes would serve as the back cover of the brochure. Reassurance is made available not only within the imagery and wording but also through the use of colors. The color palette chosen is a soothing and grounded blue and beige that instills a calming effect, providing additional comfort and support during a time of crisis and despair. The purpose of these colors is to resonate with the target audience due to the importance of knowing who they are, how they feel, and what c ommunication is intended. 221 The brochure contains a call -to -action step. It was inserted to urge the reader to go beyond just flipping through the different panels and get any needed support. 222 It encourages 220 “Z Fold Brochure -The Ultimate Guide to Design and Marketing,” MVP Print, November 3, 2023, https://www.mvpprint.com.au/z -fold -brochure -the -ultimate -guide -to -design -and -marketing . 221 Tiffany Kenyon , “ Branding Your Therapy Practice: Six Color Palettes To Consider ,” TKD ,July 29 , 202 4,https://www.tiffanykenyondesign.com/blog -branding/color -palettes -therapy -practice . 222 Darpan Savani, “Brochure Call To Action Tips,” Sophisticated Cloud, Accessed September 4, 2024, https://www.sophisticatedcloud.com/all -blogs/brochure -call -to -action -tips -driving -conversions -with -precision . 112 church members to seek further assistance by visiting an established online site. Handing these brochures out at the onset of members being notified allows fewer individuals to suffer the long - term effects of church closure grief. Similar to the first brochure, the second brochure was created for initial notifications and to assist in the pre -closure phase of grief as well. (https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/lizn0kanu76kuq534obop/DMIN854 -Brochure - 2.pdf?rlkey=vxl75d5obi9bc6f5qwgt5myb3&st=ombnn2pd&dl=0 ) The difference between the second brochure and the first is that while the first is delivered in person to all those in attendance at the church business meeting with the PBA, the second was developed to be mailed to those who could not attend due to bei ng homebound or a nonresident member. While many churches within the PBA have members who attend services in person regularly, several homebound members, those who may be dealing with physical disabilities, do not have the opportunity to participate in ser vices. Additionally, many members have moved to outlying locations, but due to the benefits of live streaming, they are able to stay connected and maintain their membership from a distance. The category nonresident pertains to those who are church members but do not necessarily live close to the church or attend in person. They also maximize the ease of online access to services. Brochures can be a detailed reference of grief support services to create awareness and engage those in need, either through hand ing them out in person or a direct mail campaign. 223 By creating this brochure, members not in attendance can be kept abreast via mail of grief support initiatives the PBA has implemented for their well -being. 223 “The Purpose of Brochures and Why They Are Important,” Conquest Graphics, May 13, 2020, https://www.conquestgraphics.com/blog/conquest -graphics/2021/02/25/the -purpose -of -brochures -and -why -they -are - important . 113 The format selected explicitly for the second brochure was a Tri -fold. The front cover is an immediate source of information pertaining to the brochure's content and the PBA's purpose. The back panel was designed to resemble an envelope containing the PBA’ s and the recipient’s mailing address. It was developed in this mailing format to facilitate sending the information to nonresident and homebound members. It keeps them connected and informed about the church closure and the availability of counseling reso urces. When one panel is opened, the interior left - side panel brings the issue of church closure grief to light, explaining the reasoning behind the issue, causes, and emotions they may be encountering. Without completely opening the brochure, the inside r ight -side panel provides multiple call -to -action steps as well as the PBA’s contact information all in one location. The interior panels of the second brochure provide more detailed information concerning the recipient’s grief stages, questions, and answer s to assist in navigating the effects of their grief. The layout provides readers with grief care information within the interior panels of the brochure, while call -to -action steps are located on the exterior panels. The colors chosen for this brochure have been used by therapists looking to deliver a sense of optimism and hope. 224 Bright yellows were used because they deliver a sense of hope and happiness to those who may seemingly feel that all hope is lost due to their church’s closure and there is no reason for joy. Scripture advises Christians to grieve but not as those without hope. The intent behind the use of these colors is to visually reinstill that hope. The lavender was implemented to tie the colors together with its relaxing properties. 225 The circular and soft -edge shapes implemented throughout the second brochure were selected to coincide with the mood 224 Kenyon , “ Branding Your Therapy Practice: Six Color Palettes To Consider. ” 225 Ibid. 114 and vision of the design. Shapes with rounded edges depict approachability and convey protection, unity, love, and community. 226 The PBA’s goal is to reestablish community. Just like color palettes and imagery, the fonts used can either help carry the message to the right people or it can obscure the message. 227 The Helvetica font used in the first brochure was used in the second, but different size variations were applied to emphasize different points throughout the text. It is a safe brochure font that allows designers to creatively draw attention away from the text while drawing attention to the message. 228 While email distribution of brochures could be used as a secondary option to direct mail distribution, Bonnie Largena, a panelist in the third panel discussion, stated that receiving something personal, whether a letter or packet in the mail with helpful i nformation, shows the sender cared enough to mail it out. This act causes them to read it and engage in the healing process. Her comments also explain the reasoning behind creating the third brochure template. While the first and second brochures are simil ar due to their pre -closure grief care classification, the second and third are similar due to their direct mail classification. The third brochure was created to engage congregations of formerly established churches within the PBA. ( https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/z7qr7j5r37jgdqsoa5um2/DMIN854 -Brochure - 3.pdf?rlkey=526ibr64rfp4erfxxv3wxgcme&st=wzbv8lj3&dl=0 ) The purpose is to target an audience that was not previously afforded grief counseling as an option during their church closure due to its oversight or unavailability at the time. A lack of counseling resources during 226 Debbie O’Connor, “The Meaning Of Shapes In Design,” White River Design, November 10, 2019, https://www.whiteriverdesign.com/meaning -shapes -design . 227 Monica Kovach, “The DOs and DON’Ts of Fonts for Therapy Websites,” Hold Space Creative, April 10, 2020, https://www.holdspacecreative.com/blog -list/the -dos -and -donts -of -fonts -for -therapy -websites . 228 Dustin Hodgson , “ Ten Best Fonts For Brilliant Brochures ,” The Creative Shop ,September 26 , 2020, https://www.mycreativeshop.com/learn/10 -best -fonts -for -brilliant -brochures . 115 this seemingly traumatic season has left people scattered and disconnected from the bonds of church family and friends, known as post -closure grief. This brochure was made to reconnect with those no longer meeting as a vibrant church congregation and possi bly living disengaged due to disenfranchised grief. Many choose to isolate themselves after a church closure, and this response is usually the result of grief unbeknownst to them. The third brochure’s design and layout depict an invitation. This brochure i s a form of grief awareness and an invitation back into the family of God and the church community. The third brochure has a very distinctive design that required user development since no templates could be found in MS Word or online to match the desired design. Its unique configuration is a combination of a Tri -fold and C -fold format. Instead of a trad itional (short - side) right -to -left opening, it is formatted to open (long -side) up and down like a letter, with the front -facing panel containing the PBA’s and recipient’s mailing address and the Church Closure Grief Care logo created in the third micro -pr oject. Down arrows were inserted to guide the reader with the flow of the information. Even if opened differently, valuable information was strategically placed to draw the reader’s attention. Due to possibly having had extended periods without corresponde nce with past church members, receiving a letter can be perceived as more personable and less professional. This creates an initial and more lasting impact than information from a pamphlet -style brochure. Comparable to the second brochure, this brochure ca n be mailed to the last known address of former PBA church members, providing them with post -closure grief care support. An uplifting and rejuvenating color palette was used for this post -closure brochure. The colors inserted are uplifting and foster clarity. A mix of blue and green colors, promoting mental clarity and open dialogue, were incorporated within the shapes and t he font. Purples work 116 harmoniously with the greens to foster awareness, insight, and calmness, which is suitable for helping people work through the emotional, mental, and spiritual effects of church closure. 229 The Church Closure Grief Care picture designed for the YouTube channel is shown when the brochure is opened. Imagery connecting them to the past and present has been incorporated not as a means of sadness but as encouragement toward the future. The imagery of direct mail brochures should convey as much of the purpose as possible while portraying it in the best possible light. 230 The interior design provides awareness and an explanation of grief -related emotions and defines disenfranchised grief for better understanding. The bottom panel contains a call -to -action step inviting the reader to reunite with the PBA and its members. Th e back cover includes another call -to -action step that boldly expresses the recipient's importance to the PBA and their desire to help. Additional contact information is provided as well. People may not always reach out to the PBA for assistance, but equipping members with these informational brochures could be very useful. 231 Dissemination of information has been the constant premise throughout the third and fourth micro -projects, but information given without purpose or thought is received as just clutter. These brochures have been created with a lot of thought and with speci fic purposes not only to provide counseling information but also to show empathy and promote hope in an attempt to minister to those dealing with grief associated with the closure of their church. 229 Kenyon, “Branding Your Therapy Practice: Six Color Palettes To Consider .” 230 “Nine Benefits of Direct Mail Marketing Brochures,” The Print Image, August 26, 2024, https://printedimage.com/blog/nine -benefits -of -direct -mail -marketing -brochures . 231 Bonnie Largena, “Panel Discussion Micro -Project -DMIN852,” April 9, 2024. 117 Analysis of the Micro -Project The fourth Micro -Project, Brochures, serves as the final cornerstone for a counseling initiative and awareness program to serve current and former church members within the PBA who may have been or are sufferers of an overlooked and enduring crisis known as church closure g rief. Awareness will be made through the initial distribution of three specifically crafted brochures geared to minister to those impacted by the different types of associated grief at various points in their journey. The brochures serve their intended pur pose by depicting empathy within multiple documents containing counseling information, resources, and support. These brochures can be disseminated in person, via mail, or online to reach all those in need. Creating and designing brochures is not something to be taken lightly. A developer does not just throw a couple of images on paper, add color, insert some text, and suddenly produce a nice brochure. On the contrary, working on this micro -project shed light on all the crucial aspects involved in developing and designing not just a nice brochure but an impactful and effective one. The goal is not just to insert anything within a brochure to make it look good but something that genuinely connects with the reci pient and their emotions. The development of this micro -project teaches how to put oneself in the recipient's position. The primary purpose of these brochures is to connect the recipient with what the provider has available. The key word is connection. As it pertains to this micro -project, the word connection is multi -faceted. A connection is made via the presentation of im agery, color, shapes, and writing. At first, only images relating to churches or grief were being inserted within this micro -project. Learning how images and shapes can capture attention by drawing the eyes of the readers was very important in producing br ochures that not only depict the issue but also provide 118 a solution. 232 It was amazing to learn just how important the colors chosen can be to the brochure's success. Using the right colors conveys that the designer knows who the reader is, how they feel, and what is being communicated to them. 233 The written text is just as important as all the other aspects. A designer must provide a detailed overview of what is being made available without overwhelming the reader. The challenge comes in the editing portion. When there is a plethora of counseling resources, information, and processes, narrowing down what should be included and what gets excluded becomes extremely difficult to decipher A lesson learned was to consider each brochure's theme and target audience before choosing the graphics or colors. Some questions to consider: What message is the brochure trying to convey and to whom? More importantly, does this message resonate with the target audience? 234 The target audience for the problem statement is those impacted by church closure grief. Within this micro -project, the themes for each brochure caused the target audience to be specifically identified. Pre -closure and post -closure grief care themes were incorporated, creating two separate audiences. These people were addressed with similar counseling resources, yet still meeting them where they are at different places and stages in their grief. Once the theme is established and the audience is identified, the design of the brochure can begin. Utilizing MS Word seemed the best option for developing the brochure template designs, but it posed multiple challenges. Researching how to properly insert shapes, images, and text boxes into a Word document played a considerable role in designing a succes sful brochure. Images can be inserted into a document by copying them from another program (ensuring no 232 Christian Duron, “The Dos and Don’ts Of Designing A Brochure,” The TJB Business Magazine, August 21, 2023, https://www.americanbusinessmag.com/2023/08/the -dos -and -donts -of -designing -a-brochure. 233 Kenyon , “ Branding Your Therapy Practice: Six Color Palettes To Consider. ” 234 Vidican, “The Anatomy of a Good Brochure Design.” 119 copyright violations) and then selecting the paste option on the MS Word “home” tab. A person unfamiliar with this program would not understand why a previously inserted image moves from its intended location once another item is inserted. The issue arises from improper formatting and configuration. All the brochures' images, shapes, and text boxes had to be properly formatted. Each had to be selected individually and then under picture format; multiple steps were taken to ensure the item was not hidden beh ind the text and stayed in a fixed position on the page it was inserted into. This is a tedious process but one that is critical in maintaining the desired design. As previously mentioned, selecting color palettes is essential to the design. A major obstac le was that MS Word did not have the same colors on its standard color selections. It does have an option for more color fills, but this consists of providing a color wheel. Different colors are displayed as a cursor is moved around a wheel of different hu es of red, yellow, green, and blue. Engaging in this process of trying to match the selected color palette was time -consuming, and it seemed almost impossible to achieve the exact color. One final piece of formatting information to be aware of pertains to the printing process and the source. How brochures and their colors are seen on a computer screen is not always how they are printed. Attention must be paid to the margins and where the folds are with respect to the brochure’s content. Multiple drafts were printed due to needed adjustments, such as one side of the brochure being upside down compared to the other. Other fine -tuning was necessary because a brochure panel’s content overlapped with another panel once it was folded. Attention to detail is critic al when creating brochures to connect, minister, and provide hope to grieving congregations of church closures. While this micro -project is the final one, and there is a feeling of accomplishment, it is not the final piece of the solution. Along with the three other micro -projects, it lays a foundation on which to build for future counseling developments addressing the problem statement .120 CHAPTER 6: ASSESSMENT OF THE PROJECTS Introduction This chapter assesses the progressive selection of micro -projects and their implementation toward a viable solution for the problem statement. Each project was reviewed to determine what was learned and what was amiss while also conclud ing the strengths and weaknesses of the selected micro -projects. Additionally, an external assessment perspective is provided by integrating peer reviews and professor comments submitted during the development al phases of the micro -project s. Overall, the strategic effectiveness and possible shortfalls of the four micro -projects are provided retrospectively. Assessments Interviews and Analysis The first micro -project chosen was very challenging yet prolific . Researching different aspects of the interviewing process, finding participants, setting up the structure, and scheduling required a substantial amount of time before its implementation. Its benefits and difficulties were embedded in its development. This micro -project was purposefully chosen as a means to determine the validity of the problem statement by hearing directly from those who had been through a church closure . This goal was thoroughly accomplished by i nterviewing multiple people and listening to them express their experiences and emotions . This was a vital part of this micro -project and beneficial in gaining acces s to the heart of the matter. Hav ing conducted many employment interviews in the past, it is evident that they only serve as a means to obtain information. By developing well -thought -out open -ended questions, this micro -project instill ed an ability to go beyond information and get a glimpse of a person’s soul (mind, emotions, and will). Doing so was not a simple process because t he interview was not comprised of just a basic 121 question -and -answer session . The process e nhanced sensory skills by l isten ing intently to spoken words and pay ing attention to tone and inflection , which were vital aspects, as well as observ ing body language and facial expressions. It also afforded a greater understanding of the use of empathetic language, therefore humanizing the interview instead of creating an interrogation session. The micro -project provided a broader scope of counseling methods through a greater level of sensitivity and depth. Ensurin g all these aspects were noted, transcribing the interviews verbatim, and identifying themes was a challeng ing process , but one that develop s, not diminishes. The in tended goal of this micro -project was to determine if church closure grief existed. The definitions of grief and crisis were examined during the interview s. Grie f can manifest from an experience of loss , especially if what was once alive in the mind of a person is now perceived as dead. This can create an emotional, mental, or spiritual turning point known as a crisis. Dr. Zabloski shared that caution should be taken not to impose the interviewer’s view upon th ose being interviewed . If they voluntarily voice th e \"death\" metaphor, then it should be insert ed within the analysi s. 235 When executing this micro -project, data from the interview s would first be obtained before a valid analysis wa s conducted . As a result, this student learned to pose questions that did not lead a responder to answer in a select manner but to come to the conclusion stated within the problem statement on their own. His suggestion was successful in obtaining probable and not tainted data . This student did not expect to learn or gain spiritual revelations from this micro -project. One particular yet unexpected response re vealed that some people were not grieving the fallen leaves nor the dying tree but the lack of sun and water that caused its’ condition. The Interviews 235 Zabloski, “ DMIN 851: Justification For Selected Micro -Project Assignment.” 122 and Analysis provided participants an opportunity to voice ideas that could help address the problems, frustrations, and shortcomings they encountered throughout the transition of the church closure. It also highlighted some productive measures the PBA had taken in the past leading up to church closures and some they failed to take concerning church members and their transitory journey. The micro -project sometimes seemed ineffective due to the plausible misunderstanding of its intent. The questions were developed to collect information and experiential insight concerning the problem statement. They were not constructed to serve as counseling opportunities . As the questioning progressed toward the participant’s experience, it became evident that the interview could shift to propagating counseling sessions due to the raw emotions that were being shared. Therefore, k eeping the interview on tr ack and on time was not always feasible. Mikhail Jackson, a peer in DMIN851, recommended offering counseling sessions at a later time. 236 His suggestion aligns with the intended outcome or desired re solution of the problem statement but was not practical within the development of the micro -project. The objective of this micro -project wa s to obtain data through research and not through counseling. While a lot was learned throughout the research in this micro -project, better preparation could have been done before the interviews. Becoming more knowledgeable in adequately handling responses that kindled additional questions could have provided a greater insight into the participants ’ mindsets. A connection and rapport were established with the participants, causing them to be at ease and comfortable answering questions. This comfort level could have been maximized to gain even more access to deeper ins ights concerning their grief experiences and healing desires related to the ministry problem . 236 Jackson , “ Discussion Thread: Collaborating and Advising .” 123 Interviews and Analysis provided clarity and stimulated awareness and follow -up conversations within the PBA as the research moved forward. A detrimental shortfall was noted within the services of the PBA . One that affected the validity of their role in nurturing the emotional, mental, behavioral, and spiritual state of those congregations impacted by church closures within their region. The data justified the PBA’s need to address the problem, integrate recourses, and incorporate effective counseling plans to improve a congregation’s ability to navigate this context o f grief. Grief is experienced differently and is not a linear progression ; therefore, the PBA must be prepared to address the issue(s). Robert Clayton, a peer in DMIN851, asked an excellent question that helped reshape the questions developed for this micro -project and the PBA’s intended response to the problem statement . He asked if the questions would primarily focus on how the individual is feeling or felt during the grieving process or if they also include how the individual would have preferred to receive grief support from the PBA . Additionally, what can the PBA do differently with future closures? 237 Robert quoted Charles Allen Kolla r, who noted regarding becoming solutions - focused, “future -focus questions that lead to a potential plan of action that administers hope is essential to co -constructing solutions that develop a possibility of life without the problem(s) — and the possibility of a future without the pain.” 238 Since e veryone is different, these co - constructing questions and answers glean ed from the participants made this micro -project highly valuable in addressing the problem statement . This micro -project revealed that only certain parts of an ongoing issue (closure of churches) were considered . However, a more significant part of the problem was still not 237 Clayton , “ Discussion Thread: A Defensible Micro -Project .” 238 Charles Allen Kollar, Solution -Focused Pastoral Counseling: An Effective Short -Term Approach for Getting People Back on Track (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2011), 199. 124 understood and was being overlooked. Bringing this to light via the willingness and impact statements of those previously affected provided a feeling of courtroom success, which was very gratifying. Since church closures are inevitable, people are listening now and will continue t o listen for a long time. While this micro -project helped to identify that the problem did exist, it still did not produce a resolution. The data obtained aimed the research in the right direction. However , the micro -project lacked clarification as to what type of counseling programs would be needed and initiated or how to incorporate them for those dealing with different forms of grief experienced by the closures. These answers would need to be found within the follow -on micro -projects. Panel Discussions The implementation of the second m icro -project , Panel Discussions , was a prolific way of obtaining information from multiple sources. This micro -project contributed significantly to the first micro -project . Interviews and Analysis identified a problem within the PBA that needed to be resolved. Panel Discussions produced multiple counseling strategies to consider. Utilizing a diverse group of panelists geared toward finding a solution for a verified problem statement proved to be enlightening. Within the panelists’ dialogue, excellent suggestions about what would be helpful toward easing the transitory grief endured by individuals dealing with church closures were ascertained . The goal of the Panel Discussions to formulate thought -provoking questions around stages of grief and solici t responses to produce viable strategies for the PBA to implement counseling resource s to thwart the effects of church closure grief was achieved . Twelve people were recruited to serve as a group of panelists in search of ways to manage associated grief and dissemina te informational resources. During a d iscussion thread for 125 this micro -project , Matthew Ramsey, a peer in DMIN852, relayed the importance of the role of the panelists and their experience in grief counseling or in coming up with solutions for the problem statement. 239 One of the questions Gamino and Ritter seek to answer in their book Ethical Practice in Grief Counseling is “how grief counselors (or those used to assist others , in this case, panelists ) use personal loss experiences…in performing their work.” 240 Matthew ’s statement influenced the panelists' composition for th is micro -project . A diverse group of panelists were selected with not only varying positions and backgrounds but also personal experiences vital to address ing church closure grief. By selecting panelists who had or would be enduring the effects of a transitioning church, each could contribute valuable insight based on their own personal loss experiences. During a conversation with one of the panelists, Gamino and Ritter’s point of emphasis was realized. They state , \"I nstead of shying away from painful losses, they encourage people to lean into their experiences, which can be a source of comfort. ”241 One of the panelists not only shared ways to address the problem statement based on his own loss experiences but was also comforted by engaging in fruitful dialogue to assist others in the future. Another interesting item that Matthew mentioned was that “Gamino and Ritter tapped into a biblical concept. ” “In Paul’s second letter to the Corinthians, he reveals how God never wastes earthly anguish (2 Cor inthians 1:4). Rather, affliction experienced eventually becomes a source of reassurance for others. ” The panelist had experienced loss when he was the pastor of a church transitioning through closure. As the church leader, it was a season of shame, but now , through this micro -project, he served as a re source for others. 239 Matthew Ramsey, “Discussion Thread: A Defensible Micro -Project,” March 26, 2024. 240 Louse A. Gamino and R. Hal Ritter, Ethical Practice in Grief Counseling (New York: Springer, 2009). 31. 241 Ibid . 126 During this micro -project , some things could be controlled, and some could not; therefore, forward progress needed to be the impetus versus regression. Multiple crises arose pertaining to scheduling, location, recording and sound equipment, question development and protocols, and efficient software . The micro -project and stress level could have been simplified regarding the technical aspect s involv ed in recording the panel discussions. While cameras and microphones were important technical pieces, a specific application was used to ensure an easy upload to a YouTube channel . This application made troubleshooting issues more complicated and complex when something failed to work correctly. Other ways to record and execute the Panel Discussions could have been considered in a manner that would still look professional but would not involve all the other external components that caused so many challenges. Doing so would have made navigating the difficult circumstances easier instead of causing frustration and discouragement. Striving for excellence can always be a stress inducer, especially when it involves ensuring that all the details of this micro -project were considered , executed correctly , and on time. Another classmate enrolled in DMIN852, Paula Francis, offered insight on managing tasks efficiently. She provided information from a blog highlighting advice from David Allen , a productivity expert and author .242 The information included that i f a task can be completed in less than two minutes, do it immediately. 243 This will provide a sense of accomplishment and motivation to tackle the remaining tasks. If a task requires more than two minutes and is important, schedule a specific time slot to work on it. 244 Also, start with the most important tasks. 242 Paula Francis , “Discussion Thread: A Defensible Micro -Project,” March 26, 2024. 243 Stephanie Eckelkamp, “How to Avoid Getting Bogged Down in the Details & Focus on What’s Really Important ,”February 19, 2021, https://www.pertheworkedit.com/articles/howtonotgetboggeddowninthedetails . 244 Eckelkamp, “How to Avoid Getting Bogged Down in the Details .” 127 Finally, i f a task is better suited for someone else , delegate it appropriate ly .245 This information was helpful in the development of this micro -project and future ones . One area in which this micro -project lacked impact on the ministry problem dealt with the time constraints. V aluable insight s were lost when questions could not be asked due to a lack of time. This issue was caused by panelists who sp oke longer than the time allotted. Paula stated , \"I t is important to remember that as the moderator, the student is in charge of the discussion and has the power to keep things moving along smoothly.” If a panelist speaks for too long, it is important to remember that the audie nce may lose interest or become disengaged. The moderator can politely interrupt a long -winded person .246 Doing so allow s the moderator to regain control of the discussion and ensure all questions are answered. She emphasized that “taking these steps can help to ensure that the discussion is productive, engaging, and informative for everyone involved.” This micro -project will continue to significantly affect the PBA going forward. Within Interviews and Analysis , awareness came about more at the micro -level. As a result of the Panel Discussions and the ability for people to view them online, awareness has now come to a macro - level. Congregational members and church leadership within the PBA have become very interested and enthusiastic about the micro -project and its intended goal(s). The PBA administration is scheduling meetings to find out what they can d o to effectively implement measures discussed that would assist churches, not only within the business aspect but also within the grief aspect of church clos ure s. The PBA has also started researching other resources 245 Eckelkamp, “How to Avoid Getting Bogged Down in the Details .” 246 Dorie Clark, “How to Moderate a Panel Discussion,” Harvard Business Review, December 19, 201 8, https://hbr.org/2018/12/how -to -moderate -a-panel -discussion. 128 to consider different types of counseling information that could be made available and passed on to the churches’ leadership so it can filter down to the congregations. An unexpected lesson learned was how implementing stress management strategies can be crucial in conducting or developing micro -projects . The Panel Discussions micro -project require d an exorbitant amount of research to develop, coordinate, and implement, as well as the writ ten requirements involved. Th is micro -project involved more external coordination efforts and technical aspects than the Interviews and Analysis micro -project. As a result, there was more stress to manage , ensur ing that all details and ba ckup plans were established. High stress levels are to be expected regardless of the micro -project selected, but how that stress is handled can either push the micro -project over the top to make it successful or cause it to fall short of its intended goal of serving as a solution for the problem statement . Although there were stress ful technical shortfalls and scheduling conflicts during one of the panel discussions, this student was able to overcome what seemed , at times , to be disastrous situations. Problem -solving was a theme throughout this micro -project. Navigating so many obstacles to ensure the scheduling, personnel, logistics, and technology involved in th is micro - project were taken care of was critical for success. While many setbacks and other issues arose, having a n excellent team of panelists, technicians, and other support staff was an asset for executin g this micro -project. Despite all that was endured, this micro -project was a major accomplishment . It served the intended goal of developing various ideas that can be used as productive solutions for those impacted by the grief associated with church closures . However, answers were still needed regarding how these suggestions w ould be implemented. Therefore, it was critical to implement micro -project s that would incorporat e suggestions necessary to resolve the problem statement. 129 YouTube Channel The first two micro -projects were Interviews and Analysis and Panel Discussions. There was a progressive thought process when the decision was being made regarding what micro - project would proceed next , le ading to the selection of the YouTube Channel . The role of the first two micro -projects involved a lot of information gathering. The first micro -project had to establish if the problem statement was a valid research issue. Five people were interviewed concerning any church closure grief effects they might have experienced. After analyzing their responses, it was determined that the problem statement was affirmed. Then, the Panel Discussion micro -project was developed to c ollect information regarding the resources that needed to be developed and made available to those interviewed and those affected by church closure grief. The first two micro -projects produced a good amount of data that had to be explored concerning the grief issue and the suggested relief and support to be provided . The role of the following two micro -projects w ould necessitate publiciz ing and distribut ing the information. This was the purpose of the third micro -project, the YouTube channel. It serve d as both a platform to receive information and a vehicle to deliver information. The information received wa s about the grief issues that surfaced during the first micro -project, and the information delivered pertain ed to the practical solutions obtained from the second micro - project. While other micro -project options were considered, u sing the YouTube Channel as a platform to disseminate counseling resources was most suitable for address ing the problem statement at this phase. YouTube is one of the most popular social networks in society at present, providing users with a wide range of learning content accessible for free, making it a very useful 130 technological resource for sustainable education. 247 It was understood that the target audience would be limited by the topic and also by the viewer's lack of online resourcefulness. This limitation is addressed in the f inal micro -project. Unfortunately, even with the YouTube channel’s user -friendly popularity, its impact and effectiveness can only be measured by the number of views the channel receives. Therefore, aside from focusing on the correct target audience, the YouTube channel ’s content is extremely vital for addressing church closure grief. The first two micro -projects consisted of more of a collective effort involving interview participants and panelists assisting in its development. The YouTube channel micro -project was more of an individual effort. Havin g no previous knowledge in creating and adequate ly configuring a YouTube channel, development familiar ity and technical understanding of this micro -project was critical for efficacy. Establishing a YouTube channel can be a fascinating and gratifying venture, but it requires essential and relatable content , making it appealing and engaging to a viewer . Many YouTube channel “how to” videos only provide d the basics to establish a channel. Other videos offer ed additional insights for more advanced channel development, but integrat ing all the se details pose d challenges for a novice . Matthew Luten, a student enrolled in DMIN853, shared that “t he content produced will vary depending on the details of the population that is trying t o be reach ed (target audience) . There is potential to build community with the content that could facilitate some solution to the problem. ”248 Myron Williams presented this as an option when he wrote, “Posting videos to YouTube allows exposition of Scripture by a master teacher and, when you add discussion questions to the video, 247 Pilar Colás -Bravo, and Iván Quintero -Rodríguez ,\"YouTube as a Digital Resource for Sustainable Education ,\"March 18, 2023 ,Sustainability 15, no. 7: 5687 ,https://doi.org/10.3390/su15075687. 248 Matthew Luten , “Discussion Thread: A Defensible Micro -Project,” Ma y25, 2024. 131 a discipleship group can watch and discuss together.” 249 Matthew also shared that “i ncludin g professional counselors for interviews on strategies to deal with grieving may also be an option. ” Wael Osman described medical content by saying, “YouTube is a valuable source of health - related educational material which can have a profound impact on people's behaviors and decisions.” 250 Matthew advised that “r egarding medical advice on a social media platform, there are some rules to follow for legal purposes. ” All of his suggestions highlight the importance of content within this micro -project and its relevance to a resolution for the problem statement. Concern was had not only about the YouTube channel’s content but also its technical operation. William Welsh, another student enrolled in DMIN853, shared that “m any variables and factors can only be noticed once it is time to film and edit. ”251 YouTube has a channel designed for creators. The playlist is a valuable resource of instructional videos about recording equipment, editing, and more. 252 There are multiple technical items to consider , such as background, lighting, and camera angle. William stated that t hese details are just as important as the content to ensure the audience stays engaged and does not move on from what the YouTube channel is offering . A factor that involves both the content and technical elements is how the information is compiled for easy access and visibility. William suggested The Primal Video channel on YouTube. 253 Instruction is provided on how to compile videos based on topics and 249 Myron Williams, “Community, Discipleship, and Social Media,” Christian Education Journal 12, no. 2 (Fall, 2015): 381. 250 Wael Osman, Fatma Mohamed, Mohamed Elhassan, and Abdulhadi, Shoufan, “Is YouTube a reliable source of health -related information? A systematic review,” BMC Medical Education 22, no. 382 (2022): 1. 251 William Welsh , “Discussion Thread: Collaborating and Advising ,” June 8, 2024. 252 Maya Washington, “ Total Beginner’s Guide to Video Equipment, ”Shameless Maya, May 15, 2018, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkqosTC8G1g. 253 Justin Brown, “How to Make a Playlist on YouTube ,”Primal Video, February 23, 20 20 , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKtyetky4Zs . 132 then develop names for the play lists. William stated that “t he purpose is to explore searched words , referred to as search engine optimization (SEO), and doing this will help the YouTube channel’s content be placed at the top of searches through commonly researched words. He also suggested using keyword phrases like “W hy has my church shut down ?” and “H ow to heal after my church closed. ” William ’s input provided insight into how to technically set up and organize th e micro -project’s key content to facilitat e the channel’s online presence. This micro -project has become the genesis for the PBA’s much -needed development of counseling programs addressing the problem statement. It is the foundation on which collaborators within the PBA will build to launch new and creative ideas addressing multiple forms of grief concerning the problem statement . Pastors within the PBA have begun to watch videos uploaded to the YouTube channel. Many have shared their enthusiasm for the micro - project. They have expressed how critical it is to have this type of inf ormation readily available not just for those entering the church closure or church merger discussion but also for church leadership trying to stay abreast of grief issues impacting new members transitioning from formerly operational churches. Th is micro -project will also serve as a catalyst for the PBA, promoting innovative initiatives while generating a surplus of engagement and interest in their support activities. This micro -project provided an excellent learning experience , providing insight into all the details involved in constructing a YouTube channel and the necessary configurations for uploading videos. This micro -project, similar to the others, teaches how to become more detail - oriented than ever before. Th is student immersed him self in learning how to set up the channel and was meticulous in reviewing the correct default and the advanced settings required to ensure it would be searchable. Then, through the use of the same platform being develop ed , a YouTube 133 channel, instruction was received on how to create an animated video. This required the implement ation of different programs and software to produce a well -polished, professional - looking, and quality -sounding video. The success of this YouTube channel will only be evident through the meaningful engagement and support given to those grief -stricken by their church’s closure and the loss they have experienced within their community . Brochures The Brochures micro -project is a culmination of the three previous ones. Similar to the Interviews and Analysis micro -project, these brochures tell a story and enlighten people about discounted emotions they are experiencing that may have created an unstab le psyche oblivious to them. In alignment with the Panel Discussions, the Brochures demonstrate the value of the former church members by utilizing PBA insight and resources to provide assistance. The YouTube channel and the Brochures both offer a unique o pportunity to disseminate beneficial grief care information beyond the boundaries of proximity. While the YouTube channel and the Brochures are the two most similar micro -projects due to their function, they are different in their approach. Brochures conve y a more personable approach and appeal to the recipient. It shows the person receiving a brochure the PBA’s willingness to come to them to address the ministry problem versus the people having to go to the PBA. The phrase ‘be where the client is’ is meant to teach how to initially engage the client by meeting them where they are versus telling them how and where to be. 254 The ministry problem consists of the PBA’s lack of church closure grief counseling support programs. One micro -project alone may not solve the problem . However, this project and the three others serve d as a foundational piece from which other initiatives can be integrated 254 Greg Shamie, “Meeting Them Where They Are: Three Facilitation Tips,” The Leadership Program, Accessed September 30, 2024, https://www.tlpnyc.com/blog/meeting -them -where -they -are. 134 to diminish the effects and ultimately overcome the problem. Understanding cultural differences during the second micro -project provided a considerable advantage in the development of the Brochures micro -project. The brochures extend a personal invitation to those connected with or disconnected from the PBA struggling with church closure grief. While the YouTube micro - project addressed a tech -savvy culture, the Brochures project addressed an older or more traditional culture of people who appreciate persona l contact and communication. Therefore, the project opens a doorway to reality and acceptance of the problem statement. These are two necessary factors for overcoming grief stages induced by church closure. Lajuan Johnson, a peer enrolled in DMIN854, asked if the plan was to have a variety of biblical counselors contribute and assist with the development of the brochures in addressing the different types of spiritual and emotional grief. 255 This was a practical suggestion , yet it was mistakenly overlooked. Seeking outside counsel or involving the PBA with the development of the brochures was never considered and could have significant ly impact ed this micro -project . The PBA was only provided with copies of the completed brochures. During the second micro - project, church leaders, staff, and members within the PBA conversed and came up with multiple ideas on how to effectively address the problem statement. Handing out vital church closure grief care counseling information in a hardcopy format was one of their suggestions. Soliciting the input of those trained and educated within the field of grief counseling and involving the PBA to ensure the effective development of brochures will be incorporated in the future . This will afford the PBA an opportunity to make important contributions to a document they will ultimately distribut e within their network of churches. 255 Lajuan Johnson , “Discussion Thread: A Defensible Micro -Project -DMIN854 ,” August 26, 2024. 135 Michael Boyce, another student enrolled in DMIN854, provided insight into the impact this micro -project may or may not have on the ministry problem. He shared how he has observed frequently that counseling is seen as a secular, rather than spiritual, solution. Therefore, anything related to modern psychology and counseling is viewed with skepticism. 256 He relayed that s ocial and religious stigma will have to be overcome in the minds of many in order for people to be receptive to receiving and reading helpful information concerning their grief. While appearing skeptic al about the efficacy of the micro -project, Michael was in favor of an effective ministry helping long -term members cope with grief about church closure. He recommended small group ministries to help those impacted by the ministry problem to quickly integrate into healthy church bodies. His recommendation sets a platform in which to connect with individuals on a personal level and distribute the brochures as well . Grief is known to have no boundaries. With the completion of this micro -project, the PBA’s reach to address grief will also have no boundaries. This micro -project provides the wheels for the PBA’s vehicle to move forward in developing more counseling progr ams, resources, and initiatives address ing the ministry problem . It also provides the PBA an initial opportunity to connect with members or reconnect with former members of churches in their network. A culmination of creative (brochures), advanced (online) , and old (dialogue) forms of communication have been combined to bring the PBA on par with available resources to execute new and exciting brands of helpful resources. Connection and communication are vital to building relationships and inspiring action. This micro -project will positively affect the PBA for years to come. 256 Michael Boyce , “Discussion Thread: Collaborating and Adv ising -DMIN854 ,” September 11, 2024. 136 During DMIN853, Dr. Zabloski was featured in a video in which he shared that students should address the “Why” regarding the selection of a micro -project as it pertains to ministry. 257 As a result of his prompting, three spiritual insights were learned unexpectedly without intentionally seeking them . As the Brochure s micro -project was being developed, the student realized how its purpose (its why) mirrored a purpose within God’s Word. Old and New Testament scriptures speak of writing down what has been seen or experienced (Revelation 1:17). They also share the need to write down what will come at an appointed time (Habakkuk 2:2 -3). Developing this m icro -project showed how the past (someone’s pain, suffering, or failure ) should not be covered or forgotten. It should be exposed in writing to instill hope when information about prospects is written in the future. Grief should not be covered but exposed to the hope of tomorrow providing healing for today (1 Thessalonians 4:13). Another “Why” learned from this micro -project wa s the value of personal communication over professional communication. In the Bible, when God communicated with His people who needed direction and encouragement, He did so in a personal, not professional, manner. He spoke to individuals and then would use those individuals to speak to the multitudes. The content of the brochures provide d information that related to readers in a personal manner, not professional. A connection of intimacy could not have been ac complished using professional vernacular , which could have been incomprehensible to most readers. The goal of being renewed through God’s written Word involves repetition. What is gained by the text (compared with both live preaching and television) is the ability to go back over it and study it. 258 Providing brochures 257 James Zabloski, “ The Meaning of It All,” DMIN853, M odule 8,June 30, 2024, https://canvas.liberty.edu/courses/633108/pages/watch -the -meaning -of -it -all?module_item_id=66808219 . 258 Tim S tafford, \"The Face -to -Face Gospel and the Death of Distance: Al Erisman says we need to think about ministry in the digital culture the way missionaries think about the culture of the people they serve ,\"Christianity Today , June 2010, 30+. Gale In Context: Biography (accessed October 1, 2024 , Module 6 Reading ),https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/A228661210/BIC?u=vic_liberty&sid=summon&xid=2358526f. 137 to the multitudes offers them the same renewal opportunity by having proximate access to church closure grief care support that they can read repeatedly. The final “Why” was the importance of asking what is needed by those in need instead of assuming and telling them what they need. Throughout the gospels, Jesus asked many what they needed of Him. In Mark 10:51, Jesus asked the blind man what he needed from Him. Being the Son of God, He never asked a question He did not already know the answer to, but He gave the man a voice. This man immediately received his sight. This student learned that a voice needed to be provide d to those grieving the loss of their church . During th e development of this micro - project, time was given, and effort was made, but the application needed to be improved in some areas to provide this voice . If, throughout this micro -project, those grieving had been included by asking them what they needed, it would have allowed them to share things not included in the development of the brochures. The Brochures micro -project did address the ministry problem by appealing to a particular audience through graphics, colors, structure, and content. Its goal of containing insightful information about several church closure grief care topics and resources so people can be ministered to, comforted, and reassured about their future was achieved . The challenge will be to continue to unpack the changing culture, communicating effectively with the tools given and to the generation encountered. 259 Conclusion A comprehensive assessment of the micro -projects revealed that incorporating all four micro -projects was a natural progression toward finding solutions for people within the PBA who have experienced the adverse psychological and spiritual grief effects of their church’s 259 Stafford, \"The Face -to -Face Gospel and the Death of Distance .” 138 closure. Each micro -project developed for the problem statement was chosen to build off the previous one while providing awareness of varying types of grief. The Interview and Analysis encompassed being introduced to Transitory grief, which involves a range of emotions resulting from an experience of loss. This micro -project enlightened the PBA by shedding light on the stories of forgotten, grief -stricken people suffering the loss of their church . The Panel Discussions micro -project produced constructive di alogue among PBA leadership, generating ideas for possible solutions for multiple forms of grief, including Disenfranchised grief, which is grief that is not acknowledged or mourn ed appropriately .260 These solutions would serve as an attempt to demonstrate and reestablish regard for those impacted. The YouTube channel was one of the means by which to cast a line of hope to those dealing with Collective grief, which happens when a community of people experience s extreme change or loss. 261 This micro -project tended to those seemingly overlooked by making available an online therapeutic resource of videos. Finally, d eveloping and incorporating Brochures as part of a church closure support system allows the circulation of vital information concerning the availability of grief care within PBA. This micro -project also addressed Anticipatory grief, which is grief or sadness foreshadowing the actual experience of loss. Thes e are some of the categories of grief , successfully highlighted by each micro -project, that people fall into when experiencing the loss of their church. All the micro -project s contribute d to a foundational resolution of the ministry problem in a meaningful manner. With that stated, additional research is needed in the future to maintain the established counseling structure achieved by the collective resources found in each micro -project. The burden now lies 260 Nye, “On Grieving The Loss Of A Church .” 261 Rehman, “What is Collective Grief .” 139 on the PBA to implement additional measures addressing church closure grief within its network of churches. 140 CHAPTER 7: MIN ISTRY NEXT STEPS Introduction The previous chapters provide detailed information concerning the development, implementation, analysis, and assessment of four micro -projects chosen to address or resolve a ministry problem within the PBA . The PBA is a network of churches that has existed for decades and provid es various ministerial support activities to churches in Southeastern Virginia. However, it lacks counseling programs to assist members in transitioning through the grief experienced by church closure. Addressing a ministry problem and devising a solution are two distinct task s. The former involves acknowledg ing or bring ing attention to the problem, while the latter consists of generat ing a strategic course of action to bring the problem to a positive conclusion. The efficacy of the implemented micro -projects (Interviews and Analysis, Panel Discussions, YouTube Channel, and Brochures) was accomplished in addressing the ministry problem . W hile the latter two micro -projects we re instrumental in reaching a big -picture viable solution, more is needed to assist people in managing different forms of grief (a response to loss) menti oned throughout the portfolio . Therefore, more research is necessary to determine what should be done and incorporated next to achieve positive conclusions in the lives of many . Additional micro -projects to be implemented by the PBA will need to be considered as options, along with research conducted for developing future initiatives in the continuous support of dealing with those impacted by church closure grief . Next Steps Church closures are rapidly increasing, so various alternatives should be pursued for the welfare of those who are grief -stricken by the outcome. The problem statement addresses a PBA 141 shortfall in ministerial counseling , but an outright solution is still needed . The PBA must become more engaged and interactive within the lives of the churches within their region while they are still vibrant and not just toward the end of the church’s operational existence. The YouTube and Brochures micro -projects conceivably serve as basket s for the PBA to carry resources needed to address the ministry problem . However , the micro -project s do not formally fill the basket s with all the necessary counseling resources providing solutions . They currently offer a minimal amount of “ How To ” information for navigating through church closure grief . The research needs to be continued because there are still plenty of vital answers to be found. Options for Follow -On Micro -Projects There were seventeen micro -projects to choose from, but o nly four were required to be selected and developed for this portfolio . After successfully implementing and assessing those micro -projects, it has been determined that additional ones should be examined and pursued as part of an ongoing effort to help alleviate the psychological, emotional, and spiritual effects of those grieving the loss of their church. Eight other micro -projects should be considered by the PBA for implementation due to their feasib ility and eff ectiveness in dealing with the issues surrounding the ministry problem. Following the two micro -projects that provided information dissemination (YouTube Channel and Brochures), the next practical one could be the Illustrative or Interactive Messaging micro -project. Developing this micro -project allows the PBA to provide a dynamic and impactful live presentation that people will remember and reflect on . W ith th is micro -project's possible interactivity, the PBA can connect and offer minister ial opportunities to those feeling alone and forgotten. The interactivity and engagement open a doorway to hear ing from an audi ence dealing with church closure grief. It would be similar to the data gained from the 142 Interview and Analysis micro -project but at a larger scale. The implementation of this micro - project can also be used to interact with people before the announcement of a church closure as part of awareness and to promote empathy. The Instructional Video micro -project is another consideration along the same lines but fails in comparison to the interaction that can be had within the Illustrative Messaging micro -project. The established YouTube channel allows both micro -projects to be easily uploaded on this platform and shared individually or collectively . The ir availability can also be announced within the brochures. While these are excellent choices to proceed with what has already been incorporated , more counseling solutions must still be developed. A Ministry Development Plan (MDP) micro -project can be implemented as the foundation for a counseling ministry to address grief within the PBA . The research in this micro - project will provide an immense amount of data for the PBA to work with in providing different types of grief support. While this would be a favorable ministry within the PBA, it would need to be adequately vetted before being incorporated. Some initial questions needing to be addressed would be the actual need for a full -time ministry of this nature, the counseling staff requirements, and the financial availability for this type of undertaking. If time, talent, or money were no t an issue , this micro -project would be an exceptional addition to the cause. A nother follow -on micro -project to develop would be Advertisement for Ministry Launch. As stated in the name, this micro -project pro mot es awareness by advertising a new ministry within the PBA. The Website micro -project could also be included . Since the PBA already has an established website , it could be modified to include this newly launched ministry. The Podcasting and Blogging micro -projects are also viable options. During the Panel Discussions micro -project, panelists considered these two projects and discussed the usefulness 143 of each one to address the needs of the people . One panelist suggested that blogging had become an outdated platform compared to a podcast . In contrast, others felt a challenge would be encountered by those unfamiliar with these online platforms . The benefit of the Podcasting and Blogging micro -project s versus the MDP is that they do not necessitate the same support, manpower, or finances a full -time ministry requires. Guest speakers can be brought in from inside and outside the PBA to discuss different types of grief, personal experiences, and perhaps coping mechanisms to overcome the ministry problem. Finally, a Chronological Flowchart micro -project can be considered due to its directional emphasis and ability to lead someone on a path toward a specific goal, which in this context is to enable healing from church closure grief. The five remaining micro -projects would not be relevant in addressing the ministry problem within the PBA and, therefore, were not considered as next steps . Future Initiatives The overall goal of grief counseling is to help the individual adapt to the loss of some one or something loved and adjust to a new reality without it. 262 The PBA can establish initiatives that help develop coping skills for those impacted by the loss of their church so they can move forward in their ministry with God . Collaboration with the PBA and among its network of churches is paramount to achiev ing what is needed in the future. Pastoral conferences sh ould be implemented semiannually, allowing for early discussions on foreseeable topics as a form of advanced preparation concerning the ministry problem . These conferences would e nsur e constant communication and information flow with churches engaged in not only discussing closures but 262 William J. Worden, Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy : A Handbook for the Mental Health Practitioner ,Fourth edition ,New York, NY: Springer Pub. Co., 2009 , 84 . 144 also those involved in church mergers and other circumstances that can be potentially perceived as devasting . In the Panel Discussions micro -project, it was recommended that a committee be created utilizing some of the pastors and members within the PBA network to begin formulating ideas for implementing solutions suggested by the panelists . By examining the specific issues identified during the first micro -project and combining that research with what was recommended in the second micro -project, the committee can assess what needs to be created for effective counseling programs. The assessment can be expanded to i nclude perspectives from others not interviewed during the initial micro -projects by developing surveys or questionnaires for people to fill out online or in person. The committee could also develop or oversee content created for the YouTube channel based on suggestions to address church closure grief care. This would involve assigning roles to different people, such as managers, communications managers, and content managers. Their duties would involve creating videos containing ministerial information for the viewers. They would also organize and schedule webinars, video blogs, and other instructional material to be uploaded or live -streamed on the YouTube channel. The A/V teams within the PBA’s network of churches can collaborate on this effort. Multiple therapeutic options can be implemented , such as a celebration of life ceremony, bereavement retreats, and mont hly luncheon s, which can help achieve acceptance and closure . During one of the panel discussions, a panelist brought up the notion of a celebration of life. Unlike traditional funerals, w hen a loved one passes away, a celebration of life focuses on positive memories and allows individuals to connect and reflect on the past in an inspiring manner. The same is applicable to the loss of a church. This celebration can contain a slideshow containing photographs of historic and fun -filled events with uplifting music. People can share 145 funny memories and stories about momentous occasions. Another option is to organize the celebration as a grieving fire ritual. Individuals would be instructed to write on a piece of paper their fondest memories, names, events, and anything of significance concerning their tenure at the church. Once the fire pit or bowl is lit, members would then place their paper s in the fire. Small bottles filled with the as hes can be provided as a keepsake . Both a llow the person grieving to let go of the weight of sorrow and look to a new tomorrow. The PBA can coordinat e annual bereavement retreats, inviting all members who have lost their long -tenured church at one time or another to come together to celebrate memories of the old and navigate through any remaining emotional, mental, or spiritual residue of loss . Finally, monthly luncheons can be held at the PBA office or other rotating locations for individual churches. The respective members can meet with old church friends and family to share a joyous time of food, fun, and fellowship. These and other counseling interventions will help improve conditions by reducing anxiety, diminishing a lack of comprehe nsion , easing distress, and instilling hope in the lives of those dealing with church closure grief. These initiatives would contribute to addressing and providing solutions to the ministry problem for years to come . Conclusion Several factors were taken into consideration regarding what needs to be done next following the implemented ministry efforts addressing the necessity of church closure grief care within the PBA. These factors involved pursuing the development of additional micro -projects to aid in providing counseling resources and collaborating with members of the PBA and its leadership to implement new initiatives . The purpose is to address grief experienced from the loss of a church due to various reasons and the percei ved loss of a community of family and 146 friends. Therefore, more continuous work is required to discover and develop counseling resources to alleviate the effects, regulate responses, and promote healthy transitions. People respond very positively to the message that the experience of grief and loss can be normalized by understanding why and what they are feeling .263 The four micro -projects revealed the why and the what. The goal of these forward -thinking and ministry next -step initiative s is to deliver the how, and this will require “a whole range of creative and contemplative practices. 264 Grief never just goes away, but it does change its form over time. 265 With the research and develop ments in this portfolio , as well as a resurgence of interest and a changed perspective of church closure by the PBA, a positive conclusion of healing transformation is forthcoming . 263 Michael Merschel , “How Grief Rewires the Brain and Can Affect Health -and What to do about it,” American Heart Association News, March 10, 2021, https://www.heart.org/en/news/2021/03/10/how -grief -rewires - the -brain -and -can -affect -health -and -what -to -do -about -it . 264 Paul Metzler, “Shulman, Lisa M ,(2019) ,Before and After Loss ,A Neurologist’s Perspective on Loss, Grief, and Our Brain ,”Omega (Amityville, N.Y.
