The primary selling point is its AI-driven functionality, which likely automates aspects of video production — from generating content ideas to editing final outputs. This can appeal to a wide audience, including businesses looking to enhance their marketing materials, educators wishing to create engaging instructional videos, or social media influencers aiming to produce consistent content.\n\n#### 2. **User Accounts**\nTo begin using AutomateTube, users need to create an account. This process emphasizes the importance of maintaining accurate and secure account information. It’s worth noting that users must be at least 13 years old, which points to a compliance with general online safety regulations, particularly aimed at protecting younger users.\n\n#### 3. **Content Guidelines**\nAutomateTube addresses user-generated content within its platform, offering clarity on ownership and usage rights:\n\n- **Ownership**: Users retain full ownership of their content created on the platform. This is a significant point as it assures users that their creative outputs are rightfully theirs.\n- **Licensing**: While users own their content, they grant AutomateTube a license to host and showcase it. This is a standard practice in digital platforms, ensuring that the site can operate effectively with the content users generate.\n- **Prohibited Content**: The platform contains a strict list of content that is not permitted, including illegal materials, copyrighted works uploaded without permission, misleading information, and malicious software. This helps maintain a safe and trustworthy environment for all users.\n\n#### 4. **Payment Terms**\nThe terms around payment are clearly outlined, emphasizing that all fees are stated in USD. Payments are processed securely to ensure user protection. It's also indicated that some services may require a subscription, and prices are subject to change with prior notice. This transparency in financial terms cultivates trust with potential users.\n\n#### 5. **Liability Limitation**\nAutomateTube includes a clause limiting its liability in cases of indirect or consequential damages resulting from the use of its services. This is fairly standard in software services, helping to protect the company from litigation stemming from user dissatisfaction or technical issues.\n\n#### 6. **Terms Modifications**\nThe platform reserves the right to modify its terms and conditions.

The website suggests a dual functionality: one for creation and another for potentially sharing or monetizing the videos produced.\n\n#### 2. **Target Audience**\nThe services appear to be tailored not only for individual creators but also for businesses that may require bulk video production. This dual focus could broaden their user base significantly, tapping into both casual users and professional markets.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, AutomateTube emerges as a promising platform for anyone interested in creating video content efficiently through AI technology.

I'll earn a small commission if you make a purchase and it's no additional cost to you. #ai #videoediting 97 comments there's been an explosion of AI video editing tools this year but there's so many of them it's hard to weed through the ones that are actually useful so that's what I'm going to do in today's video list out the top 10 video editing tools of 2023 let's Jump On In so most AI tools cost a fee to use but some of the AI tools are actually built into the software that you already use and pay for like the Adobe Creative Cloud so the first one is in speech inside of Premiere Pro to get rid of background noise or Reverb automatically so here I have a clip where there's a lot of echo in the background the elements are really easy to customize inside of After Effects so instead of using a plugin which I had to use before I just go up here to enhance speech and turn this on and it will analyze the clip and now this is what it sounds like just simply find the effect that you want to use hover over it and click apply the elements are really easy to customize you can update the text Fields the media placeholders it's just so good here's another example where I'm talking on the beach so right now I'm on the beach and I'm using my iPhone mic it's pretty noisy right so if I just click on enhance speech this is what it sounds like and you know there's a lot of noise happening around me that background noise is just automatically removed so even if you record with just a built-in microphone on your camera or on your phone and a noisy environment you can now use the AI enhanced speech to fix it and you have this slider so you can choose to reduce the amount of enhancement or increase that depending on your shop so for stock video and music and sound effects for video my team uses invat elements to find these assets to then use in our projects previously we'd have to go to the web browser and search for these effects but now they developed a panel inside of Premiere Pro that's just called the invat extension so here if I go to window go to extensions invat you will see here that I have the invat panel open now of course you could go through here and search by keyword and you can find your assets here and download them and they will import directly into your project which is great but the reason why this is related to AI is because they now have this new search with invat AI so basically it can find assets based on the frame that's currently at your playhead click on search for sound effects and this will basically scrub the invat elements library for Relevant sound effects that might fit this scene so you can see that it got some soccer ball drops that's great but there's also some like random stuff here like a car bypass a zombie chase but there are a few soccer sound effects which is what I was looking for but the results will change depending on the particular frame so let's scrub to this moment where there's more water so at this moment I can go back and search for sound effects here's some rain for example so because I have a subscription I can download the wave file if you do not have the subscription that's okay you can still use it but you will get the version that has the preview Watermark which is this one so I'll go ahead and click download and it will start to download and import into my project panel and so then I can drag this sound effect and drop it here in my timeline so next let's try stock video let's move our play head to a shot here and let's see if we can find some more Boll clips that match it so we can go to video here and search with inv vato Ai and this is still in beta by the way but I think it's going to be super useful to a lot of you who need to find more Boll directly inside of your app so we can scrub through and see if we can find any clipss here that look remotely similar I see here on the second page that there are a few clips that could work so we can download these and same with music you can search for music tracks based on the image the playhead is at and you will get results now most of the results here are just named like on the Lake based on the image but if we play this back audio jungle jungle it's pretty generic right but it could work there's also rainforest audio jungle also pretty generic but let's try this one I like this one cuz it evokes more of a documentary feel which is what I would want to get but it would be nice if we had other controls here to refine it by genre or mood again this is still in beta but if you want to try it out the panel is completely free you don't need a subscription but if you want to download without the watermarks then you need to sign up for a subscription and you can use my link below to get 70% off your first month to try it out okay so next up is photoshop's frame extension this is the video timeline workspace in Photoshop if you didn't know Photoshop can work with video so here is the cool part if we click on the crop tool here and what I'm going to do first is just kind of expand the top part so I don't want to do the bottom yet because that will require a actual prompt to generate let's say a wooden table in front of me so up here I've expanded this let's hit generate and this is literally just expanding the frame upwards and you might be like wait a minute where did it go well that's because it created a layer over here inside of the video group and what I want to do is actually drag this video layer beneath and then if we scrub over you can see this is our generative expansion so I can pull this over and you can see the result now and let's go ahead and let's roll this out and now you can see that it Blends in pretty well but we have two other variations here but I think the first one looks good and this is what it looks like already we have a taller video clip now what about beneath us I can expand again a little bit to get a space here to put a desk let's type in table generate all right so here's the first result It cast a little bit of a shadow here this one looks pretty good let's try this one I'm not sure what that is some coins on a table let's go with the second one here and I can expand this layer inside of our timeline here for the duration of the full video so to use this new vertical video go up to file export render video here you can choose your specific format settings and then hit render and here is our new expanded vertical version that we can now use back in Premiere Pro now this works great for static backgrounds the generative fill is a static image it's not yet video I would love to see that in the future because probably in the future they're going to have generative video inside a Photoshop or maybe even in Premiere Pro so next up is an app called end boost that uses AI to automatically mix your sound levels here inside of Premiere Pro I have this video that has dialogue it has a music track and it has sound effects down here now if I play this back element you can see that it's hard to hear myself the sound effects are a little bit difficult to hear and the music is really loud so what you need to do is press s to solo each track and then you can go to export to export each individual audio track as its own wave file then inside of end boost click on open and let's import our four different tracks here end boost will detect what type of audio it is and sometimes it'll make a mistake so first of the first track is correct this is our voice this next one is actually music so we need to change this to music and then here this is sound effects so let's change this to the sound effects label and down here there's sound effects as well next there's a few different things that we can do to make sure that the AI can improve our mix so the first thing we need to do is confirm whether we have a constant source for our microphone so just one mic or multiple and in this case we do not have multiple just constant and then compression I'm going to choose natural but of course you can try out different compression levels for the music I will choose the default here as well as the ducking how much ducking which is lowering of the volume do you want when I am talking and then the sound effects I'm just going to leave this as the default level three and not have ducking turned on and then mastering is like the compression of your overall mix and in this case I think it sounds better when it's just general and then you can choose your delivery Target so online you know for social media is what we're going to use all right so the analysis is done let's click on export and let's save this as Final Mix I'm going to drag in our final mix here into our timeline and I'm going to turn this off for now I'm going to mute it so you can hear the original first you can barely hear me talking at all so let's go ahead and let's mute all of these tracks here and this is the final mix all the ele perform much faster because they were natively it sounds a lot better right so it even does the ducking so it lowers when I'm talking and it increases when I'm not talking so if you don't want to deal with having to mix inside a Premiere Pro manually you can use end boost to do it for you next up is autopods Jump cut editor now you can use autopod to basically assign values to each of the speakers on camera autopod will go through and cut to whichever person is speaking which is very useful but they've also added a new tool called the jump cut editor which will essentially cut out the silences inside of your timeline so what you need to do first is Nest all your Clips together as one video clip and then you can choose the silence cut off decibel level once you have one that you select you just select create jump cuts and then it will have a completed jump cut edit for you and you can see that these Cuts were automatically made which is a great starting point for people that are just about to go on to the next stage of editing which is refinement after the rough cut stage and of course there's a free trial link just down below the next tool that my team and I use all the time is runways AI magic tools so here inside of Runway underneath video we're going to click on edit videos and click on in painting Runway is a completely online app so you have to upload all your footage so I've already uploaded my video clip I'm going to just drag it here into this empty space and then it will load open the inpainting app so this is an aerial clip here but in the background there's this barge the ship that I don't want this little orange buoy and this post here so let's go ahead and let's remove it and I recommend starting from the beginning and let's just paint over this barge that we don't want paint over the orange buoy and as we start to do it it starts to remove these items from our scene so let's paint out this post as well and the shadow beneath and just like that it's gone so let's go ahead and let's preview it and as it moves it key frames that rotoscoping that it does automatically to remove and fill in those areas just using AI which is just incredible so this is great if you need to remove anything from your videos quickly and then reexport it out to use it in whatever software that you use so in this case I would just click export and I would choose Pro res and Export it out to use it back in Premiere Pro the next one that might be useful to you is blurring faces that don't want to be seen on screen so I have a clip here of this protester I'm just going to double click c on it I've already uploaded it and it will automatically start to detect faces for you so all you're doing here is you're just waiting there's nothing yet here that will actually allow you to choose which faces specifically you want to blur it'll just blur all of the people in the shot so I think the next iteration of this would be you selecting which people that can be on camera and the other ones that need to remain blurred so this is the original video here of him holding the sign and if we turn on the Blurred portion you can see it blurs his face automatically we didn't need to create a mask or create any movement it does it for you automatically and once again you can click export or you could go through here and choose to add some more padding or some more blurriness to that square that overlays on top of his face all right next is super slow motion so let's say you shoot something at normal speed at 24 frames per second but you want to make it super slow motion what you can do here is click on super slow slow motion and you can upload your clip here so this is shot at regular speed at 30 frames per second now what I can do is choose to lower the speed to like point for the original speed and then click on process so here's the original and let's go back and here is the processed it looks great right it doesn't look choppy it looks like it was naturally shot at a higher frame rate all right next up is is text to color to generate a l or a look for your video so here you have this text field and let's say I want it to be in Orange punch look meaning that it's just has a lot of orange and saturation in this look so we can just click on generate and it will just take a few seconds to apply whatever prompt you type in to that footage and so here is the result so it's kind of like an orange tealy type of look so if you like this you can download the cube file F and a cube file is just a l file that you can apply to footage in any editing software program whether you use resolve Premiere cap cut finnal cut anything you can download this Cube file version of this color grade or you can just export the video clip and then use it in your software so next the most exciting thing in AI is AI generation meaning text to video so here underneath generate videos you can go to text image to video so you can upload an image to say oh you want to produce a video like this image or you can upload an image plus a description to add more description to AI to help them generate it or you can just use text alone so here we can type out our scene a realistic ship sailing through a sea storm at night and then click on free preview CU you can preview results before you generate because the generation Works based off of credits which is why I clicked on free preview before you click on generate cuz then it will use your credits that you have to generate with so here are the results the images look great let's try this one here let's generate 4 seconds all right let's see the results interesting it animates the ocean in a unique way where it's not moving as naturally as I would like but overall I mean if I was going to include this inside of like a reenactment Style video like back in 1549 we were sailing in this ocean storm I mean I think it looks beautiful so it's pretty incredible what you can create with these AI tools and I just want to reiterate that all of these tools that I listed in this video they're not replacing you they're just assisting you in your creative process a lot of these tools enable you to create things that was not imaginable just a few years ago which I think is really exciting so if there's any other tools that I missed in this video that you use and you want to share with other people in the community just leave a comment below and if you want to check out the video that I created on how I made a music video just using AI you can click right over here and be sure to subscribe just by clicking on my profile as always thanks so much for watching and keep creating better video with gal see you next time bye",

Remove unwanted content: Delete or untag yourself from any posts, photos, or comments that you no longer want associated with your online persona. This includes content on your own profiles and content created by others. Manage search engine results: Search for your name and see what information appears in search engine results.

Software that doesn't make you want to bang your head against the wall Features that just work (crazy concept, right?) Easy sharing without those annoying 'file size too big' messages AI that's actually helpful, not just another headache So here's what happened - I was working on this super important project last month, totally stressed about the deadline, when a friend told me about WeVideo. Not gonna lie, it was a total game-changer. Like, imagine going from riding a rusty bike to cruising in a sports car! The best part? I can edit my videos anywhere - even from my favorite coffee shop while having my third cappuccino of the day (don't judge!). Look, here's the deal - different people need different things. Maybe you just need something quick and easy for your TikTok videos. Or maybe you're aiming to be the next big YouTuber. But if you're like me and just want to make cool videos without getting a headache? These new AI cloud editors are where it's at. Just pick something that doesn't make you want to pull your hair out every time you use it. Because honestly? Life's too short to spend hours watching tutorial videos! 😅 Upvote · 95 Related questions More answers below Which is the best AI tool for video editing for YouTube? What is a video editing AI?

Among the many AI video editors available today, Wondershare Filmora AI stands out as one of the best options in 2024. Filmora AI offers a combination of intuitive AI-driven features, user-friendly design, and a wealth of creative assets, making it an ideal choice for beginners and intermediate users. In this article, we’ll explore why Wondershare Filmora AI is better than other AI video editors by diving into its features, pros, and cons. Features of Wondershare Filmora AI 1. AI-Powered Editing Tools One of Filmora AI’s biggest advantages is its range of AI-powered editing tools. These tools simplify many of the tasks that editors typically spend hours on. Some of the standout AI features include: AI Auto-Reframe: This feature automatically resizes and adjusts the framing of videos to fit different aspect ratios, such as 1:1, 16:9, and 9:16. It ensures that the focal point of the video remains centered and keeps important details in focus, making it easier to create content for multiple social media platforms. AI Audio Enhancements: Filmora AI provides a range of audio enhancement tools that leverage AI, including noise reduction, automatic leveling, and background music suggestions that match the video's mood. These tools help ensure high-quality audio without the need for extensive manual adjustments. AI Smart Cutout: The AI-powered Smart Cutout feature allows users to remove unwanted objects or people from a video easily. The AI is trained to distinguish between the foreground and background, making complex edits more efficient. 2. Motion Tracking and Object Recognition Filmora AI incorporates advanced motion tracking that allows users to track moving objects or subjects in the video automatically. The tracked elements can then have text, images, or effects attached to them to follow along naturally. This is particularly useful for creators looking to add titles, blur sensitive information, or incorporate graphics that follow the subject’s movement. 3. AI Scene Detection With Filmora AI’s Scene Detection feature, the software can analyze a video clip and automatically cut it into separate segments based on changes in scenery. This feature saves users considerable time by breaking down footage into manageable chunks for more efficient editing. 4. One-Click AI Effects and Filters Filmora AI includes a wide range of AI-enhanced filters and visual effects that can be added to video clips with just a single click. These effects are automatically tailored to the scene and lighting, taking the guesswork out of enhancing visual quality. 5. AI-Driven Instant Mode The AI-driven Instant Mode is perfect for users who want to create quick edits without spending a lot of time on the timeline. Users can import their clips, and Filmora AI will automatically analyze the footage and assemble a polished edit complete with transitions, music, and effects. This feature is a boon for beginners and social media creators who must publish content frequently. 6. Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech Filmora AI makes captioning videos effortless with its Speech-to-Text tool, automatically generating captions from spoken words. Similarly, the Text-to-Speech feature helps convert on-screen text into voiceover narration, adding an extra layer of video accessibility. 7. Built-In Stock Media and Royalty-Free Music Filmora AI has a stock media library with royalty-free images, clips, and music tracks. Users can integrate these elements seamlessly into their projects, ensuring their content is visually rich and captivating. 8. AI-Enhanced Color Matching and Color Correction Color grading is essential to video editing, and Filmora AI offers AI-powered tools for color matching and correction. These features analyze the color properties of selected clips and apply consistent grading throughout the entire project, saving time and creating a professional look. Pros of Wondershare Filmora AI 1. User-Friendly Interface Filmora AI offers a highly accessible interface that remains simple to navigate, even with the addition of its advanced AI tools. The drag-and-drop approach makes video editing approachable for beginners while retaining enough power to satisfy more experienced editors. The learning curve is minimal compared to other AI video editors, such as Adobe Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve, making Filmora AI popular among hobbyists and content creators. 2. Time-Saving AI Features The AI-driven features such as Auto-Reframe, Smart Cutout, and Scene Detection save users hours of manual work. These tools allow for a faster workflow, which is invaluable for content creators who must produce videos regularly. The one-click enhancements also ensure that users can achieve professional-looking results without in-depth editing expertise. 3. Versatile Asset Library The built-in library of effects, transitions, royalty-free music, and stock images helps users create engaging videos without the need to source materials from third-party websites. This feature is particularly beneficial for content creators working tight schedules. 4. Affordability Compared to professional editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro, Wondershare Filmora AI offers a more affordable pricing structure. With subscription-based and one-time purchase options, users can choose a plan that best suits their needs and budget. 5. High-quality audio and Video Tools The integration of AI audio enhancements, such as noise reduction and background music matching, ensures that audio quality matches the visual quality of the video. Combined with AI-driven color correction tools, Filmora AI helps create a balanced, professional-quality video without the need for extensive knowledge of audio or color grading techniques. 6. Cross-Platform Compatibility Filmora AI is available on both Windows and macOS, making it accessible to users regardless of their operating system. Furthermore, the software allows for easy exporting of video projects in various formats and for different platforms, ensuring versatility in distribution. 7. Excellent for Social Media Creators The Instant Mode and Auto-Reframe feature make it easy to produce content tailored for social media. Creators can quickly adjust their videos to match platform-specific aspect ratios without crop or resizing footage manually. Cons of Wondershare Filmora AI 1. Limited Customization Compared to Professional Tools While Filmora AI offers many valuable features, it lacks some depth and control available in professional-grade video editors such as Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, or Final Cut Pro. Advanced users looking for features like multi-camera editing, advanced composing, or intricate keyframe animation might find Filmora AI limiting in comparison. 2. Watermark in Free Version The free version of Filmora AI includes a watermark on exported videos, which can be a significant drawback for those not wishing to upgrade to a paid plan. This is common among video editing software, but it’s worth noting for users seeking a free solution. 3. Performance Issues with Complex Projects Some users report that Filmora AI can experience lag or performance issues when dealing with large video projects or multiple high-resolution clips, particularly on lower-spec devices. This is a potential downside for editors working on resource-heavy projects. 4. AI Limitations Although the AI tools in Filmora AI are great for simplifying tasks, they can still lack the finesse of manual edits by an experienced editor. For instance, features like Smart Cutout or Auto-Reframe may not always yield perfect results, and users may need to make manual adjustments to achieve the desired outcome. Why Wondershare Filmora AI is Better Than Other AI Video Editors Wondershare Filmora AI sets itself apart from the competition by focusing on accessibility, ease of use, and the power of AI to simplify the editing process. Unlike more advanced editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve, Filmora AI strikes a balance between complexity and user-friendliness, making it appealing to a broader audience, including beginners, hobbyists, and content creators who want professional-looking videos without investing a significant amount of time in learning complex tools. Other AI video editors might offer similar AI-driven features, but Filmora AI uses a more user-centered approach. The interface is highly intuitive, and the tools are clearly labeled and accessible, reducing the learning curve significantly. Unlike other AI editors that cater primarily to professionals, Filmora AI offers a middle ground for those who want to create visually appealing content without the need to learn the ins and outs of video editing. Another important factor is Filmora AI’s pricing. It offers most of its features at a much lower price than professional video editing software. While editors like Adobe Premiere Pro may require ongoing subscription fees that add up over time, Filmora AI offers a more budget-friendly alternative that still delivers powerful AI capabilities. The availability of Instant Mode is a game-changer for social media creators. In an era where content production needs to be quick to keep up with social trends, Filmora AI provides a streamlined editing experience that allows for rapid creation and distribution. This convenience is something that high-end editing software often lacks, as it is built with advanced editors and filmmakers in mind rather than everyday content creators. Ultimately, Wondershare Filmora AI excels by making advanced video editing accessible to all users. While it may not replace professional-grade tools for large-scale film production or high-end editing, it is ideal for individual creators, YouTubers, social media influencers, and small businesses needing a robust yet easy-to-use editor that leverages AI technology to improve their workflow. The combination of AI tools, a rich asset library, affordability, and a user-friendly design makes Wondershare Filmora AI the best choice for many looking to create high-quality content efficiently.

We've put together a list of the best available video editing AI tools. October 27, 2023 • 3 min read Share this post Video Editing Tips & Resources If you spend any amount of time on social media, you probably already know that AI has suddenly popped up everywhere. We all remember those stylized AI pictures everyone was posting a few months ago. But AI is more than just a fun trend or craze. It can also help take content creation and video editing tasks off your plate, giving you more time back in your day — and your life. If you want to get precious hours back by essentially outsourcing your video editing, the best way to do that is by taking advantage of AI. Luckily, there are several great options available now. And, to save you even more time, we’ve put together a list of our top 5 video editing AI tools. 5 Video Editing AI Tools 1. Zubtitle ‍ Time for some shameless self-promotion!
