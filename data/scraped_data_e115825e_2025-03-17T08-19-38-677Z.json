Twitter Linkedin Facebook https://colossyan.com/posts/tech-stack-behind-ai-video-generation Colossyan is a synthetic media company that provides a world-class video-editing platform that uses AI actors to tell your story. These AI avatars allow you to facilitate human connection while also creating large amounts of content at scale. Colossyan is a powerful tool with many different feature offerings – and more constantly being added. We built our tech stack by leveraging different open source AI solutions, trained with our actors, built into a complete SaaS product. In this blog, we'll provide a glimpse into the engineering problems and solutions we encounter at Colossyan. Introduction to AI video generation AI video generation is a rapidly evolving field that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to create high-quality videos. This cutting-edge technology has a wide range of applications, from training videos to social media content creation and more. By automating the video creation process, an AI video generator allows you to create more engaging content more quickly and cost effectively than traditional videos. With an AI avatar as your video host, you won't have to hire human actors, spend hours filming them, and even more time editing all of your footage together. Instead, you can skip the lengthy and manual video creation process with a text-to-speech AI actors, allowing you to create content in minutes instead of weeks. This technology not only streamlines the video production process, but also opens up opportunities for creative storytelling and interactive content that wouldn't be possible with a traditional video. Colossyan is a powerful AI video generator that helps you quickly create engaging videos What are AI actors? Before we jump to the full stack, let's talk about the heart of our product: the AI actors. Different AI models such as our actors require compute power to run. Usually these models compromise on either quality and speed: the better the quality of the actor, the longer a user has to wait for it to be generated. Also, the underlying compute resources can vary a lot based on what the chosen (cloud) provider can offer. As GPUs are also quite expensive in the cloud, we have to own a flexible setup: autoscaling of instances using GPUs is a must for any company running AI models at scale in production. We use AWS, and we run G4 EC2 instances that have GPUs in it. For automatic scaling we leverage AWS ECS, and taking it one step further we benefit from AWS Batch for batch processing the work. We did not immediately start off with stream based processing as GPU-based instance scaling is still a bottleneck most of the time. However as our models and other parts of the stack are being improved, we get closer and closer to achieving real-time actor synthetisation. Colossyan currently offers a diverse range of more than 150 AI avatars to choose from on our platform. These AI actors are ready to be used in your videos, so you're able to select whichever actor best represents your audience or message. Colossyan offers 150+ AI avatars to choose from Or, you can create an AI avatar of yourself using our new instant avatar feature. Instant avatars can be created instantly using just seconds of footage. The AI technology stack Besides all the actor AI models, there are plenty of well-known industry-standard components that we build our stack upon. From the top to the bottom, our React UI kit was brought to the customers at a very fast pace – just check out our changelog powered by Canny. There's usually a major UI update every 2 weeks. Our web backend and API is bundled in a NodeJS container, orchestrated in Kubernetes. Kubernetes comes with a lot of features to ship our product easily (like rolling upgrades), and also many auxiliary services help us in our everyday work: Prometheus for monitoring, Nginx for ingress, logging, etc. Our product metrics related analytics platform is Mixpanel, providing us with a lot of insights. We pay significant attention to the numbers and raise the bar higher and higher every week. We are actively monitoring many product-related metrics and detecting any anomalies that occur. Our infrastructure has just recently been put to the test: our Hide the pain Harold prank video campaign. We peaked at several thousand of videos generated in a single day, without major interruption or more than 15 minutes queueing time, but that story will be told in a future blog post. Hide the pain Harold's prank The future of our AI tech stack We’ll actively work on creating proper SLAs in the future, by the time we reach product maturity we have to get ready to provide an excellent service to our customers. Failed video generation or major UI flaws all fall into this category. There are also plenty of new features in our roadmap. From an engineering perspective they differ in complexity, we will uncover them in later blog posts. What's next? Want to know how AI models are assembled? How were we able to improve the scalability and robustness of the system?

Armed with this insight, you decide to launch a cold brew promotion, and bam! Suddenly, you're the talk of the town. But it's not just about listening; it's also about engaging. When you actively interact with your audience on social media—replying to comments, answering questions, or even just liking their posts—you're building relationships. And trust me, people love feeling heard and appreciated. Plus, social media gives you a direct line to your customers. You can gather feedback, conduct polls, or even run contests to keep them engaged and excited about your brand. So, can social media marketing really help your business? Absolutely. But remember, it's not just about being present; it's about being strategic and genuine in your interactions. Social listening and social media monitoring with Brand24 definitely can help you with that. I hope this helped!

With AI text-to-video, AI-generated avatars, and tons of other awesome new AI video features, literally anyone can create unbelievably high-quality content. I made this anime trailer, and I think it’s pretty cool. The pictures, animation, and even the song were all generated by AI. Let me break down the process and tell you how it was done 👇 pic.twitter.com/Y117zidiei — Framer 🇱🇹 (@0xFramer) August 22, 2024 But with so many options flooding the market, it can be tough to figure out which tool is the right fit for you. Each promises to be the best, but how do you know which will deliver on that promise and actually be the best AI video generator? We made this guide to help you navigate the crowded field and find the tool that suits your needs. We've carefully selected and reviewed seven top contenders, focusing on what they offer, where they excel, and where they might fall short. So, if you've ever wondered, \"What is the best AI video generator?\" you're in the right place. What is an AI video generator? In the simplest of terms, an AI video generator is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to automate the video creation process. Instead of manually editing clips, adding effects, and syncing audio, these tools handle the heavy lifting for you. You just input text, images, or other media, and AI turns that into a complete video through text to video generation. By using AI, these tools automatically select the best visuals, create smooth transitions, and even generate voiceovers with realistic AI avatars. This means you can focus more on crafting your message and less on getting bogged down in the technical details. How do AI video generators work? AI video generators work by using advanced algorithms to analyze and process your input, whether it’s text, images, or other media. When you provide the content, the AI interprets it and makes decisions about how to structure the video. This includes selecting visuals, syncing audio, and applying effects—all in a matter of minutes. ✨ From Photo AI image to video with @LumaLabsAI's video model that came out today called Dream Machine It's absolutely state of the art and the best video model available right now I think It's able to highly accurately predict 3d surroundings from just a photo, I think up… pic.twitter.com/KDetDBdGIS — @levelsio (@levelsio) June 13, 2024 At the core of these tools is machine learning, which allows the AI to improve over time. The more data it processes, the better it becomes at making creative decisions that result in high-quality videos. For example, if you input a script, the AI video tool can generate corresponding scenes, choose relevant images or video clips, and even create a voiceover. The process is surprisingly intuitive. You simply provide the material, and the AI organizes it into a cohesive video that aligns with your vision. How we chose the best AI video generators To ensure you pick the best AI video generators and generative AI editing tools, we chose products that truly deliver on their promises of creating amazing videos. No matter how skilled you are at video editing, you need an AI tool that simplifies the process. Next, we evaluated the range of features. A great AI video maker should offer more than just basic editing—it should allow you to customize and tweak your video clips until they look like they were made by a professional film crew. We also compared the pricing plans, ensuring that they offer a solid mix of features without breaking the bank. Our goal was to find tools that help you save time and money. ‍ 1. AI Studios by Deepbrain AI DeepBrain AI’s video generator is a robust all-in-one tool that brings realistic AI avatars, natural text-to-speech, and intuitive video creation into one seamless platform. Whether you’re making educational videos, marketing content, or AI-powered presentations, it streamlines the entire process with easy-to-use tools and customizable features. The standout feature here? 150+ ready-to-use AI avatars that instantly add a human touch to your content. You can pair these avatars with lifelike AI voices, customize their look, and even use templates to get a head start. Tools like script generation, voice cloning, and text-to-speech make content creation feel effortless, even if you’re not a video editing pro. Why we like AI Studios by Deepbrain AI: New and powerful For teams, DeepBrain AI shines with collaborative features that let you sync up in a shared workspace. Add to that the ability to export videos in multiple formats, and you’ve got a powerful tool for turning ideas into polished videos – fast. Whether you're experimenting with the free plan or scaling up with Team and Enterprise options, the flexibility here ensures there’s something for everyone. Where AI Studios could improve We love the power and usability of this tool, but since they are relatively new to the space, they could benefit from more brand recognition. Once more people are familiar with this tool and how it can help with creative workflow, we are confident it will be a go-to product for designers and creatives of all stripes. Pricing options: Free plan ($0.00) Personal ($24.00/month) Team ($55.00/month) Enterprise (Custom) 2. Luma Dream Machine Dream Machine by Luma Labs is a video creation tool that uses AI to generate extremely lifelike videos. You can quickly turn your images or text prompts into professional-looking clips. The process of creating a video takes just a couple of minutes. Each video is about five seconds long and can include multiple shots, making them richer and more detailed than many competitors’ outputs. During my tests, some videos were ready quickly, while others took longer, but all captured motion better than any other tool I’ve tried. Whether you're crafting an epic scene or a visually intense moment, Dream Machine captures the essence of storytelling with visuals that feel straight out of Hollywood. Created product mockup videos with Luma Dream Machine V1.5 text-to-video model, and I’m really happy with the results. You can find the prompts in the thread, and you can use the same ones with Midjourney or Flux.#LumaDreamMachine pic.twitter.com/VISWZK8TEp — Gizem Akdag (@gizakdag) August 21, 2024 Why we like Dream Machine: Most cinematic If you're a creator with a flair for the cinematic, you're going to love making videos with Dream Machine. What really stands out is that you don't need precise details for motion areas, Dream Machine still manages to capture motion concepts effectively. Itfollows the laws of physics, ensuring that every shot feels grounded and realistic. Plus, it’s super fast! As their website mentions, Dream Machine can currently produce 120 frames in 120 seconds, which is not too shabby to say the least. Where Dream Machine could improve Although Dream Machine is generally fast, some users have experienced slower processing times when working on intricate projects with a lot of elements. The discard rate can be around 98% with Reddit users pointing that most of the videos generated are unusable because of random elements, incorrect motion, or distortion. Pricing options: Free Plan ($0.00) Lite Plan ($7.99/month) Standard Plan ($23.99/month) Plus Plan ($51.99/month) Pro Plan ($79.99/month) 3. Runway Gen-3 Alpha Runway calls their latest model, Gen-3 Alpha, the new frontier for video generation, and we are here to say that they could definitely be right. The Gen-3 Alpha supports text to video, image to video, advanced camera control, multi motion brush, and after testing some of these features out, we were seriously impressed by how smooth and sharp the results are. The video creation workflow feels super streamlined, thanks to the improved fidelity and motion—it’s clear this model was built for powerful things. Add expressiveness and intention to your generations with Multi Motion Brush. Learn how with today's Runway Academy: https://t.co/EUbxc4aA0D pic.twitter.com/qredD7vsXu — Runway (@runwayml) January 23, 2024 Why we like Runway: Most dynamic Runway's Gen-3 Alpha is one of the most impressive AI video generators we’ve come across. Not only is it a powerful tool for video that makes content creation seem limitless, but it has a shockingly friendly interface and is easy to use. With the Multi Motion Brush, you can select up to five areas with independent motion and control across 3 directional axis (x, y, z) for more precise and expressive generations. Another highlight is how well it handles human-like characters. The AI generates lifelike figures with natural expressions and gestures, adding a level of realism that’s hard to beat. We aren't exaggerating when we say you'll likely be blown away by what you generate with this tool. The videos are truly cinematic and offer an exciting glimpse into the future of creativity. Where Runway could improve Runway is an extraordinary tool, so it is hard to say where it can improve. Of course, with such a dynamic AI video generator comes cost, which might be the only thing holding back casual users or if you're on a budget. Plus, it is true that sometimes the final results might look a little \"wonky,\" but overall the quality is top-tier. Pricing options: Basic Plan ($0 per editor per month) Standard Plan ($12 per user per month, billed annually as $144) Pro Plan ($28 per user per month, billed annually as $336) Unlimited Plan ($76 per user per month, billed annually as $912) Enterprise Plan (Customized with Runway team) 4. Hailuo AI Hailuo AI is an AI-powered video generator designed to make content creation simple but still extraordinary. Whether you’re making cinematic videos for marketing, detailedproduct explainers, or social media ads, this tool automates the heavy lifting—giving you professional-looking results in minutes. Instead of spending hours fine-tuning every frame, creators can focus on storytelling while the AI ensures smooth motion, clean edits, and stunning visuals. #Hailuo AI is absolutely insane for creating Hollywood-style blockbuster scenes! 🎬🔥 Every test is a thrill pic.twitter.com/idaAJWb2BZ — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) March 6, 2025 Why we like Hailuo AI: Fast yet eye-popping For businesses and content creators who need speed, flexibility, and truly remarkable videos, Hailuo AI delivers. One of the standout features is its customizable templates, which allow users to tweak layouts, colors, and visual styles without advanced editing skills. So regardless of what kind of content you ar making, whether it's onboarding video or a marketing campaign, Hailuo AI makes sure your content looks tailored, not cookie-cutter. Where Hailuo AI Could Improve While the AI does a great job with automation, some users may find the customization options a bit limited. For example, while templates are helpful, they don’t always allow for fine-grained control over pacing and scene composition. Additionally, industries needing highly specific branding—like film production or high-end advertising—might need more flexibility in motion effects and camera angles. Pricing options: Standard plan ($14.90 per month) Unlimited plan ($94.90 per month) 5. Kling AI The Kling AI video generator produces highly realistic 1080p videos up to two minutes long, all from a single prompt. The key difference? It doesn’t just generate good-looking footage—it ensures movements and physics behave naturally, making everything feel more lifelike. Have an Amazing Day!☀️🙂☕️ Name: Flower Care Made with @Kling_ai 1.6 Text to Video#AIart Good Monday #MondayMotivation #Mondayvibes pic.twitter.com/MEvNj9HVrw — Jay Kay (@JayKay65220066) March 10, 2025 Why we like Kling AI: Smooth, natural motion What sets Kling apart is how well it captures human motion and expression. Thanks to its 3D face and body reconstruction technology, characters move fluidly and show natural emotions—all from a single image. Its physics engine also shines, allowing for believable object interactions and environments that behave like real-world scenes. Whether you're creating short films, virtual influencers, or AI-generated marketing content, Kling delivers a level of realism that’s hard to match. Where Kling AI could improve While Kling is impressive, it’s not perfect. Some users report slow processing times, especially for highly detailed scenes. Occasionally, minor inconsistencies appear, like hand distortions or subtle motion glitches. More control over camera angles and fine-tuning details would make it even stronger for professional creators. Pricing options: Basic (free) Standard ($72.90 yearly) Pro ($293.04 yearly) Premier ($728.64 yearly) 6. revid AI This tool might be new on the scene, but for improving video productivity for socials, revid is quickly becoming one of our favorites. Their mission is all about helping creators like you make short videos that have a potential to go viral. Why we like revid AI: Best for social media What we like most about revid AI is that it has a specific focus. The AI does the heavy lifting from finding ideas, adding sound effects, creating scripts, and then transforming everything into viral videos for your social media content. It’s a company that knows its lane, and we can certainly appreciate its dedication to being the master of one instead of the jack of all AI video trades. Where revid AI could improve The main drawback with revid AI is that it is niche. This is fine if you need this specific type of content, but it may be lacking if you're searching for a more powerful tool. Pricing options Hobby ($49/month) Growth (Launch offer $49/month) Ultra ($199/month) 7. Colossyan Whether you're making screen recordings for employee training, video marketing content for social media platforms, or educational videos for compliance training, Colossyan offers features that simplify video making for established businesses. Why we like Colossyan: Best for large businesses Colossyan is awesome with AI video editing, offering tools like prompt to video and AI script assistants that help you create excellent videos without needing tons of experience. While it is definitely on the more corporate side of video creation, we saw this tool streamline the creation process and make it easy to produce high-quality generated videos super fast and efficiently. Plus, Colossyan’s extensive library of AI avatars and multilingual support make it a nice choice for large companies and diverse clients. Where Colossyan could improve While Colossyan has a ton of cool features, it may require a bit of a learning curve for those new to AI video tools. The sheer number of options, from AI avatars to multiple export formats, can be overwhelming for beginners. Pricing options Starter Plan ($19/month, annually) Pro Plan ($61/month, billed annually) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 8. HeyGen HeyGen is one of the more impressive platforms we tested. A big reason for this is because it is hassle-free and easy to use, so jumping in was a simple process. More specifically, HeyGen is one of the best when it comes to generating AI avatars. The process of creating a HeyGen avatar boils down to three steps: choosing or creating an avatar, recording or choosing a voice to go with it, selecting a video template, then letting HeyGen put it all together in a matter of minutes. Why we like HeyGen: Most intriguing video generator One of the coolest features of HeyGen is its AI avatars, which are constantly evolving. The platform frequently updates these avatars to include enhanced visual details, expanded speech abilities, and more lifelike animations. Another great feature is the change videos to multiple langauges. HeyGen allows you to create videos in over forty languages from your original video, letting you reach audiences from all parts of the world. Where HeyGen could improve While HeyGen offers a lot of flexibility, the pricing for the Team plan might be higher for smaller teams or individual creators. Additionally, the Free plan, although great for beginners, limits users to just 3 videos per month, which may not be enough for those who need to produce content regularly. Pricing options Free Plan ($0) Creator Plan ($24/mo) Team Plan ($69/seat/mo) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 9. Haiper AI After diving into Haiper AI, we quickly realized it’s a promising tool for anyone looking to explore the world of AI-driven video creation. One of the first things that stood out to us is how Haiper AI makes the video creation process both accessible and efficient, even for those just starting. With just 3 images, @escelce transported us through 3 different universes, holy cow! #KeyframeConditioning #AIvideo #MadeWithHaiper https://t.co/6FwlLObhIK pic.twitter.com/JZdJOq3QMb — Haiper AI (@HaiperGenAI) August 19, 2024 Why we like Haiper AI: Best for beginners What we appreciated most about Haiper AI is its flexibility and how user friendly it was. The platform allows for up to 10 creations per day on the Free plan, which is generous for a no-cost option. That, on top of the text-to-speech feature helps make Haiper a solid tool. For those who need more, the Explorer and Pro plans offer expanded features that cater to different levels of use. Where Haiper AI could improve One of the primary limitations is that the Free plan doesn’t allow for commercial use or watermark-free videos. This might be a dealbreaker for users who need to produce content for business purposes but aren’t ready to invest in a paid plan. Pricing options Free Plan (Beta, $0/month): Explorer Plan (Beta, $8/month, billed yearly) Pro Plan (Beta, $24/month, billed yearly) Enterprise APIs (Custom Pricing) ‍ 10. Synthesia Synthesia is a game-changer for simplifying the process of making (sometimes scarily) realistic AI avatars. With simple text-based prompts, Synthesia turns your script into a polished, video ready project featuring life-like avatars. Why we like Synthesia: Excellent for avatars Even if you're new to video Synthesia has an intuitive interface that makes creating and editing your video feel straightforward. You simply choose an avatar, input your text prompts, and watch as the AI works its magic, transforming your words into engaging content. Plus, the AI video editor allows you to tweak and refine your video, so you can take the time to make those small changes that really make your vision come to life. So whether it is explainer videos, content creation for blog posts, or other marketing projects, Synthesia is excellent for businesses who want to make videos for their products or services. Where Synthesia could improve One of the main limitations is the degree of control available for the AI avatars. The avatars do look polished, but the options for appearance and expressions are somewhat limited compared to more advanced tools. Pricing Options Free Plan (€0/mo) Starter Plan (€20/mo) Creator Plan (€59/mo) Enterprise Plan (custom pricing) ‍ ‍ Wrapping up: The future of AI Video Tools AI in video and avatar creation has come a long way.

Top characteristics of a good prompt with examples An example of a good prompt – Credits Gridfiti A good prompt possesses several key characteristics that can enhance the effectiveness and quality of the responses generated. Here are the top characteristics of a good prompt: 1. Clarity: A good prompt should be clear and concise, ensuring that the desired question or topic is easily understood. Ambiguous or vague prompts can lead to confusion and produce irrelevant or inaccurate responses. Example: Good Prompt: “Explain the various ways in which climate change affects the environment.” Poor Prompt: “Climate change and the environment.” 2. Specificity: Providing specific details or instructions in a prompt help focus the generated response. By specifying the context, parameters, or desired outcome, you can guide the language model to produce more relevant and tailored answers. Example: Good Prompt: “Provide three examples of how rising temperatures due to climate change impact marine ecosystems.” Poor Prompt: “Talk about climate change.” 3. Context: Including relevant background information or context in the prompt helps the language model understand the specific domain or subject matter. Contextual cues can improve the accuracy and depth of the generated response. Example: Good Prompt: “In the context of agricultural practices, discuss how climate change affects crop yields.” Poor Prompt: “Climate change effects 4. Open-endedness: While specificity is important, an excessively narrow prompt may limit the creativity and breadth of the generated response. Allowing room for interpretation and open-ended exploration can lead to more interesting and diverse answers. Example: Good Prompt: “Describe the short-term and long-term consequences of climate change on global biodiversity.” Poor Prompt: “List the effects of climate change.” 5. Conciseness: Keeping the prompt concise helps ensure that the language model understands the essential elements and avoids unnecessary distractions. Lengthy or convoluted prompts might confuse the model and result in less coherent or relevant responses. Example: Good Prompt: “Summarize the key impacts of climate change on coastal communities.” Poor Prompt: “Please explain the negative effects of climate change on the environment and people living near the coast.” 6. Correct grammar and syntax: A well-structured prompt with proper grammar and syntax is easier for the language model to interpret accurately. It reduces ambiguity and improves the chances of generating coherent and well-formed responses. Example: Good Prompt: “Write a paragraph explaining the relationship between climate change and species extinction.” Poor Prompt: “How species extinction climate change.” 7. Balanced complexity: The complexity of the prompt should be appropriate for the intended task or the model’s capabilities. Extremely complex prompts may overwhelm the model, while overly simplistic prompts may not challenge it enough to produce insightful or valuable responses. Example: Good Prompt: “Discuss the interplay between climate change, extreme weather events, and natural disasters.” Poor Prompt: “Climate change and weather.” 8. Diversity in phrasing: When exploring a topic or generating multiple responses, varying the phrasing or wording of the prompt can yield diverse perspectives and insights. This prevents the model from repeating similar answers and encourages creative thinking. Example: Good Prompt: “How does climate change influence freshwater availability?” vs. “Explain the connection between climate change and water scarcity.” Poor Prompt: “Climate change and water. 9. Avoiding leading or biased language: To promote neutrality and unbiased responses, it’s important to avoid leading or biased language in the prompt. Using neutral and objective wording allows the language model to generate more impartial and balanced answers. Example: Good Prompt: “What are the potential environmental consequences of climate change?” Poor Prompt: “How does climate change devastate the environment?” 10. Iterative refinement: Crafting a good prompt often involves an iterative process. Reviewing and refining the prompt based on the generated responses can help identify areas of improvement, clarify instructions, or address any shortcomings in the initial prompt. Example: Prompt iteration involves an ongoing process of improvement based on previous responses and refining the prompts accordingly. Therefore, there is no specific example to provide, as it is a continuous effort. By considering these characteristics, you can create prompts that elicit meaningful, accurate, and relevant responses from the language model. Read about —-> How LLMs (Large Language Models) technology is making chatbots smarter in 2023? Two different approaches of prompting Prompting by instruction and prompting by example are two different approaches to guide AI language models in generating desired outputs. Here’s a detailed comparison of both approaches, including reasons and situations where each approach is suitable: 1. Prompting by instruction: In this approach, the prompt includes explicit instructions or explicit questions that guide the AI model on how to generate the desired output. It is useful when you need specific control over the generated response or when you want the model to follow a specific format or structure. For example, if you want the AI model to summarize a piece of text, you can provide an explicit instruction like “Summarize the following article in three sentences.” Prompting by instruction is suitable when you need a precise and specific response that adheres to a particular requirement or when you want to enforce a specific behavior in the model. It provides clear guidance to the model and allows you to specify the desired outcome, length, format, style, and other specific requirements. Examples of prompting by instruction: In a classroom setting, a teacher gives explicit verbal instructions to students on how to approach a new task or situation, such as explaining the steps to solve a math problem. In Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), a therapist provides a partial physical prompt by using their hands to guide a student’s behavior in the right direction when teaching a new skill. When using AI language models, an explicit instruction prompt can be given to guide the model’s behavior. For example, providing the instruction “Summarize the following article in three sentences” to prompt the model to generate a concise summary. Tips for prompting by instruction: Put the instructions at the beginning of the prompt and use clear markers like “A:” to separate instructions and context. Be specific, descriptive, and detailed about the desired context, outcome, format, style, etc. Articulate the desired output format through examples, providing clear guidelines for the model to follow. 2. Prompting by example: In this approach, the prompt includes examples of the desired output or similar responses that guide the AI model to generate responses based on those examples. It is useful when you want the model to learn from specific examples and mimic the desired behavior. For example, if you want the AI model to answer questions about a specific topic, you can provide example questions and their corresponding answers. Prompting by example is suitable when you want the model to generate responses similar to the provided examples or when you want to capture the style, tone, or specific patterns from the examples. It allows the model to learn from the given examples and generalize its behavior based on them. Examples of prompting by example: In a classroom, a teacher shows students a model essay as an example of how to structure and write their own essays, allowing them to learn from the demonstrated example. In AI language models, providing example questions and their corresponding answers can guide the model in generating responses similar to the provided examples. This helps the model learn the desired behavior and generalize it to new questions. In an online learning environment, an instructor provides instructional prompts in response to students’ discussion forum posts, guiding the discussion and encouraging deep understanding. These prompts serve as examples for the entire class to enhance the learning experience. Tips for prompting by example: Provide a variety of examples to capture different aspects of the desired behavior. Include both positive and negative examples to guide the model on what to do and what not to do. Gradually refine the examples based on the model’s responses, iteratively improving the desired behavior. Which prompting approach is right for you? Prompting by instruction provides explicit guidance and control over the model’s behavior, while prompting by example allows the model to learn from provided examples and mimic the desired behavior. The choice between the two approaches depends on the level of control and specificity required for the task at hand. It’s also possible to combine both approaches in a single prompt to leverage the benefits of each approach for different parts of the task or desired behavior.

Also, over the past few years, there’s been a significant shift in our approach to learning and teaching, a change largely fuelled by the advancements in artificial intelligence. AI video tutorial creators are leading this charge, transforming how we acquire new skills with their dynamic capabilities. But what is this AI video tutorial creator? Put simply, this is a software platform that uses the power of AI to enable the easy creation of captivating and informative video tutorials. Gone are the days when producing quality educational content was synonymous with having access to a professional studio or top-tier equipment. Now, thanks to AI, even those with limited technical expertise can craft tutorials that are both professional in appearance and effective in content delivery. The impact of this technology on learning and teaching is profound. According to a CAGR, AI in education is expected to grow to $21.52 billion by 2028. This growth is conditioned by increasing demand for personalized learning experiences and more accessible educational resources. AI tutorials videos cater to these needs perfectly, providing content that is not only customizable but also interactive and engaging. For instance, imagine a scenario where a maths teacher wants to create a tutorial on algebraic equations. Instead of spending hours filming and editing, the teacher can use an AI video tutorial creator to generate a video that explains the concept and includes interactive elements like quizzes and animated examples. Diving into the Core of AI Tutorial Video Generators Embark with me on exploring the intriguing realm of AI tutorial video generators. This technology is a symphony of modern artificial intelligence, sophisticated machine learning algorithms, and high-end multimedia tools, all synchronized to craft something extraordinary and impactful. How exactly does this technology weave its magic? Picture this: you have a tutorial script ready. Like a masterful conductor, the AI takes this script and breathes life into it. The process begins with a detailed analysis of your text as the AI grasps its context and subtle details. Here, machine learning plays a pivotal role – the AI, through extensive data, learns to decode and comprehend language, much like an advanced, accelerated form of reading development. Once the script is analyzed, the AI proceeds to the production phase. Here, it selects appropriate visuals, be it animations, images, or on-screen text. It’s akin to a director setting the stage for a play, ensuring everything perfectly aligns with the script’s narrative. But it’s not just about visuals. The AI also generates voiceovers. Special text-to-speech technology converts your texts into natural-sounding audio. It’s like having your own virtual narrator. An example of this in action is a science tutorial. You input a script about the solar system, and the AI video tutorial generator creates a video featuring animations of planets revolving around the sun, all narrated by a voice that explains the concepts in an easy-to-understand way. It’s like having your own personal science documentary tailored specifically to your script. But what truly sets AI tutorial video generator apart is its ability to customize content. Depending on the platform, you can choose different voices, accents, and even the appearance of virtual instructors. It’s as if you’re the conductor of an orchestra, with every element, from visuals to sound harmonizing, to create an educational masterpiece. In essence, the technology behind the AI tutorial video generator is a perfect symphony of AI and multimedia elements working together to transform ordinary scripts into extraordinary learning experiences. It’s a tool that not only simplifies the content creation process but also elevates it to a whole new level of engagement and professionalism.
