  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, let’s kick back and break this down. You tossed me the URL https://transcript.study/, and I’ll take a wild stab at what it’s all about. First off, the name “transcript” is a big hint. This could be a site focused on educational stuff, maybe diving into study materials or resources for students. Think about it: transcripts are those official records of your grades and coursework. So, it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine this place is geared toward helping students understand or improve their academic performance. Now, “study” in the URL feels like it’s pointing towards the whole learning process. Maybe it’s a hub for study guides, resources on how to learn better, or even tips for acing exams. It might be a spot where you can find helpful articles on various subjects—like an online study buddy ready to dish out knowledge when you're cramming for finals or just trying to wrap your head around complex topics. There’s also a vibe that suggests it could be a community space. Picture it like a forum where students share notes, discuss different subjects, or swap tips on effective study strategies. You know how it is—sometimes, the best insights come from chatting with your peers rather than just from textbooks. So, it might have features like discussion boards or user-generated content where folks can pitch in their own experiences and resources. On top of that, given the whole online education scene these days, it’s likely that the site could be linked to online courses or tools for remote learning. With everything shifting to digital, maybe it’s curating resources for MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), offering access to lectures, or even linking to platforms where you can enroll in various classes. Then again, let’s not forget about study aids! Maybe they’ve got tools like flashcards, practice quizzes, or even software to help with note-taking. It could be a sort of one-stop-shop for anyone looking to boost their study game without the hassle of jumping around from site to site. So, yeah, pulling it all together—this site probably feels like a cozy little corner of the internet aimed at students. Whether it’s about accessing transcripts, finding study tools, or just connecting with others hustling through school, it sounds like a space specifically designed to make learning a bit easier and maybe even more enjoyable. Who knows, it might even have some chill articles or guides on balancing study time with life, like self-care tips for stressed-out students. So, there you have it! That’s my take on what https://transcript.study/ could be serving up. Just a friendly, supportive nook for academic hustlers trying to make it through the maze of learning. Cheers!",

Pexels.com 4 comments hello everyone in this video I'm going to go over 20 study hacks to help you start the school year right now this is going to be rapid fire I'm going to go over some of my favorite study hacks and some of them you might have heard before if you've seen any of my other videos and some of these may be completely new so be sure to stay tuned for the entire list in order for you to start the school year off with the best study tips in mind and of course be sure you subscribe so you don't miss out on any of my content featuring life science and life lessons here on this channel all right number one is find your green time now I've heard this refer to as different things I'll call it green time in this video but with this basically means is the time of day when you are the most productive the time of day where your brain just turns on and feels like it can do the most things it can pay attention now this is going to be different for everyone because of their lifestyle and circadian rhythms and sometimes your schedule doesn't always match with your green time for example if you're a high school student and you have to wake up super early but you feel the most productive late at night may not be the best thing to stay up really late at night to do your work but if you can rearrange your schedule at all try to find the time of day where you're going to be able to get the most done and be the most productive and put a good chunk of your schoolwork in that part of your day for me I am the most productive in the mornings I feel the most energized I can tackle the most things think the most critically and creatively during that time so for me I like to make my cup of coffee get up super early in the morning and get a few things done now my entire workday doesn't fit into my morning but I find I am the most productive at the very start of the day so find the time that works for you number two is habit stacking now you might have heard of this as doing two habits at once which is kind of the same thing but basically it's getting into the habit of doing one thing and then doing another so for example washing your face and then brushing your teeth before you go to bed at night but for you this could be something as simple as whenever you get to your home room and you unpack your laptop you also check your email for the day or whenever you get home you're done relaxing you've had some time to decompress you open up your computer and you make sure you have all of your homework listed and figured out what you need to do for that night as you have your afternoon snack and this doesn't just have to be two habits it can be two or three and it can be as simple as whenever you make your lunch the night before school is also when you put your backpack and your chargers all together so you don't forget them when you're going to school all right number three is Temptation bundling similar to Habit stacking this is where you're doing something that you like along with something that you have to get done sort of as a reward along the way so for example you take the snack example again you have a special snack that you treat yourself to whenever you're doing your math homework because you don't really like to do your math homework but you are enjoying it because you have a little bit of a Temptation or a reward along with the activity this helps you enjoy something during the activity instead of just hanging it in front of yourself as a reward for later on all right number four is multitask but the right way so your brain can't actually multitask very well when it is dealing with something that is cognitively heavy so for example your brain is not going to do a good job paying attention to a show or music while you're trying to do important problems for your science class or you're studying for your history test but you can do things that have a low cognitive load along with something that has a higher cognitive load for example you could put on a podcast or YouTube lecture about the science topic that you're studying while you go on a walk or doing some exercise you can watch a YouTube video while you're on an exercise bike you can do flashcards while you're on the bus to school so as long as you're multitasking with something that doesn't require the same type of cognitive energy you might be able to do a few things at the same time all right number five when it comes to notes good is better than pretty so I know a lot of people at the start of the school year have these great ideas of doing bullet journaling or having fancy note taking styles with pretty colored pens but in the long run the stuff that's going to help you remember our notes that are clear spse enough to get across the main ideas and something that you can go back and use later for studying this also brings me to point number six which is when it comes to notes a lot of notes does not mean that they are better so actually verbatim note takers are not going to be as strong note takers as people people who are able to parse out the main ideas and have good bullet points because what you're doing as you are simplifying those notes and making them shorter is actually going through the information in your head thinking about it and storing it in a new way this helps you understand the ideas and retain them for longer so remember good notes don't have to be super super long number seven you might have heard of active recall as a study strategy which basically means quiz yourself all the time especially right after a study session and then a little bit later 24 48 Hours make sure to give yourself a gap time to forget and then time to remember information the more you practice active recall and trying to think of that information that you already received and then put it out there again the better you're going to remember it down the road for a quiz or a test or a class discussion so whether that's flash guards practice questions or just explaining the information you learned in class to a friend quiz yourself all the time all right number eight is something I've kind of already mentioned a little bit but to make your studying mobile don't just restrict your studying or your homework to one particular location that's going to limit you and make you less flexible than somebody who has flash cards or has the ability to access their study materials on their phone on the go this way if you have a minute where you're waiting somewhere instead of just scrolling whatever site or app that you like to scroll you can take out your study materials and take advantage of small chunks of time this also goes back to number seven where you can quiz yourself wherever you are if you have your flashcards in your backpack or your notes on your phone don't be afraid to use new and different studying tools like for example try podcast this year or listen to the audio of YouTube explainer video video about the content that you're studying in class all right number nine is to physically move when you're in the middle of a long study session it is great to be able to get your blood flowing stop and take a break so whether that's working at a standing desk taking a mental break to go and take a walk be outside with your friends and then coming back to your studying all of this can benefit you by being more refreshed and able to take on new information after a period of time which brings me to number 10 which is if you haven't already you should try the Pomodoro method the Pomodoro studying method is about chunking your study time and giving yourself timed study intervals along with specifically programmed in breaks where you have to put your work away after a set period of time now the traditional Pomodoro method starts with 25 minutes of work time 5 minutes break five times and then you take a longer break after those five initial sessions you can chunk the time however you want to though just make sure you do time it and take the breaks when the timer goes off this will help you refresh your brain and get back on track when it's time to get back to work I've used theodoro method to work a lot and it's super effective especially in preventing mental fatigue I love being in a flow State and really digging into my work but if I find I've gone too long without taking any breaks I do start to drag and I'm not as quick and efficient as I could be so make sure you schedule those breaks in Pomodoro or whatever method you choose all right number 11 is to adjust your video player speed more than likely you'll have to watch a video or two for any number of classes that you'll be taking this year I prefer to watch my videos on 1.5 even 1.75 two times speed as long as I can still retain the information if you're somebody who needs to slow the video down though please take advantage of that as well it is okay to turn a video speed down even mine I know I talk fast in order to retain the information in the way that best suits your needs all right number 12 when it comes to studying a brain dump is more effective than highlighting your notes so instead of going to your notes and highlighting all the key wordss and pieces of information that you think you'll need to review for a test put the notes away and take a blank sheet of paper and write down all the information you remember from them and especially what you think will be important then go back compare your brain dump with your notes see what you missed see what errors and gaps in your knowledge you have and do it again this is going to be much more effective than just the highlighting method for studying which is shown to be not as effective when it comes to other studying methods study hack number 13 is to take a note card while you read and cover up the words on top of the text that you have already read this will prevent you from rereading information over and over again and help you move forward focusing only on the key lines that are in front of you now of course if you have to go back and reread a passage because you didn't understand what you just read that's totally fine but using the not card method can definitely help increase your reading speed especially if you're someone who struggles with rereading the same words over and over again or getting stuck on passages number 14 another note-taking hack is to outline your notes before you read the text so a lot of textbooks will have an outline in the back of the chapter that tells you the main ideas that it covered or you can even go by your teacher's outline or go by the section headers in the text once you have a pre- outline done you can take notes by filling in the gaps with important information that you come across as you read this will help provide a structure to your notes and make note tying faster instead of just writing down random information that you might think is important as you're reading number 15 when you are studying lean into pneumonics I have a whole video on pneumonics and different type of memorization strategies so be sure to check that out but pneumonics are some of my favorite ways to memorize important information especially complicated science stuff that has a lot of important details all right number 16 is is another productivity tip which is eat the Frog what this means is doing the task that you are least looking forward to First once you get that task out of the way it's so much easier to go and do the rest of your work so for example if you have a practice sheet of stoy geometry problems for chemistry and you really don't want to do that practice sheet because you know it's going to take a long time where you feel like it's going to be challenging try it first if you do find your get yourself getting stuck that's okay you can put it to the side and try it again later but once you get into something that you think may be challenging or difficult or just something you don't want to do the more likely you are to continue or to keep the momentum going with other tasks this doesn't have to be a difficult task for example it could be as simple as organizing your backpack you really don't want to do it you've been putting it off if you do that first you'll be more likely to continue with the other things that you need to do in your studying schedule number 17 is to use your teachers as a resource too many students that I've encountered even myself in my high school days we're too nervous to go to teachers and ask for help this is not a sign of weakness in fact asking teachers for help is one of the best ways to build relationships with teachers and for them to get to know you better so make sure you use your teachers if you're feeling confused if you need extra support or even if you're doing just fine and you want to learn more about a particular topic that you're excited about in class so whether or not they offer office hours or study sessions during lunchtime or have offered maybe for extra resources or additional reading materials that they could can provide take advantage of those things and use your teachers for Help number 18 is similar but it's use your friends and your community talk to people who are in the same classes as you see what study resources they're using talk to people who have been in the classes before see what students have done to be successful in the classes that you have already taken number 19 is to keep your big goals in mind when you are in the study trenches it may feel like the only thing that matters is getting an A on the next assignment or finishing your notes for your reading quiz the next day but remember when you are doing difficult and challenging things what you are in it for why do you want these good grades are you trying to apply to a college that you really want one day are you interested in a career path in that particular field do you just feel like it's something you have to do because of Parental pressure peer pressure pressure put on by the school whatever it is make sure you take a breather and remember what's important to you prioritizing things like your mental health your physical health and your relationships with people around you and when you feel like things are getting difficult keep your big goals in mind as inspiration to keep going my 20th study hack the last one I'll share with you today is to subscribe to this channel so you don't miss out on any other life science or life lesson resources that I post thanks so much for watching best of luck with this school year give this video a like if it's been helpful and I'll see you later [Music]",

It is a story of the average student. But the fact that you're asking this question proves you're not average, isn't it? Thus we reveal the secret to you which is consistency and dedicated smart work. We’ve gathered wisdom from five thousand books, innumerable internet scrollings and so on and give you our pick on how to be smarter and better. Don’t mug up. Be a do-er: Do problems, don’t just read theory. Actively recall things you have studied. Mugging up and cramming before a test does not lead to long term memory. Spaced repetition is the key. Here is a diagram showing the forgetting curve and the process you need to follow to commit things to memory. 2. Stop Scrolling: Scrolling is a lot of work for your brain although it may not seem so. Also it drastically reduces attention span and the ability of your memory to commit to detail and remember stuff. Stop this soon. Disable stuff from your phone and uninstall instagram. 3.Learn Stuff right after they are taught: Ideally, go through the material taught in class soon after and don’t wait for exams. This ensures maximum retention. 4. Create an un-complicated time table: No, you do not need to subscribe to light academia aesthetic with sticky notes and pastel coloured expensive journals. You can get it done with as little as a piece of paper everyday. Jot things down that you have to do that day on it and use a calendar to keep track of deadlines. 5. Use in between class times to work on homework: The real fun will begin at night anyway, so do not use the time in between classes to chat up with friends. Instead, use those breaks to get away and get work done. 6. Stay Healthy: Eat well, don’t eat processed foods, actually study, exercise and take frequent breaks.

Improve your working memory. Working memory and its translation into long term memory is what I have noticed as a student to be the difference between a highly successful career and a struggling career. #3 will handle the translation into long term memory, however the working memory can best be improved using something like Brain Workshop. I have found it to be useful. Change your study habits so that they work with you. I am going to make an assumption that you study for a certain amount of time and you simply want to make that time better and more productive. To do this, you need to create an environment in your own life that is most productive to retention. This should be coupled with studies preferably from research institutes for the greatest effectiveness. Transition to Long Term: There are two strategies I have utilized for this, and they might prove to be useful. Unconscious repetition: This is sort of an experimental strategy I have been working on over the past few months, but the idea behind it is that your brain can replay events and situations practically unconsciously. By learning how to force your mind to speed this processing through classical conditioning, it can improve your base ability to memorize things over the long term. Building a Global Understanding System: I will put you through a task. In 1776, the Continental Congress declared independence from the British Empire. During this time, Louisiana was under the control of?… the Spanish. Now, how do I know this? Well, I think back to the political situation that was present in Europe during the time. I can completely skip over American history for this one and focus on British foreign affairs during the time to determine this. Due to Spanish-British relations not being exactly that great. The British actually wanted to prevent confrontation with the Native Americans and the Spanish for the very reason of trying to reduce the reasoning for war on an economically vital colony. Also considering the French were booted out of North America in 1763 following the 7 Years War, there is no way that the British allowed the French to keep the colony. I understand global history to a level where I can deduce what happened without ever knowing whether it is true or not. Think of it this way; knowledge is like a Pareto efficient puzzle. But, 99% of the full knowledge of a certain field can be deduced by 1% of the known information. This is just for history alone. For Chemistry, it is even more profound when you consider how much is published every day compared to how little knowledge you need to understand what you are reading. When you build your fundamentals in a field to a certain level, you start to become intuitively able to figure things out with only a few deviations. This is actually the fact that makes humans better than machines right now. We can take a few fundamental principles and logically reason from there. We don’t have to apply algorithms to solve our problems, we have heuristics that are developed because our perception of things is fueled by a global understanding. Build your fundamental knowledge to absolute mastery, and you will be able to memorize significantly more because you simply will have logical reasoning system to help jog your memory. If you want tricks for your specific school or college, I have always seen filler classes and easy professors to be your best bet. The professor you get can really make a difference between earning a 50% or a 90%, because policies do dictate grading much more than people think. But, here’s a truth with this logic and the reason why I never liked it: A. Schools do ask for subject specific GPAs. My school has a Physics and Math GPA that is set aside from my normal GPA. So, you can’t use filler classes to get past that. B. School should be an accurate representation of your performance. Unless you are meaning to just get through high school, your performance should matter to you. Accepting a grade makes you a better student and a much more successful learner. Taking hard classes challenges your ability to be a good student. That resilience is more important than any grade or GPA you get.

I got my act together in AP classes, though. I don't endorse this method, unless you are too busy to study. Don’t do it to see if you can get away with it. THE WISE IDIOTS GUIDE TO STUDYING How well you are able to do with this method comes down to three factors: 1.) Can you pick up information faster than the average student? Brutal honesty hour here, (screw politically correctness.) All students are not created equal. Student A could study for 3 hours and get a B on the big test, while Student B aced it with 30 minutes of studying. The majority of teachers teach to the “Average Joe” student, leaving the bottom of the class confused, and the top bored out of their minds. Where do you stand? Is what the teacher provides enough for you to consistently reach the grades you want? If your not getting the grades you want now, there is no way you’re going to get them without studying. Is it realistic that you would get A range on your tests? Your best guess right now is how you preform on pop quizzes. If you are on the fence of being able to do this, (read: B+ to A- range), here are some tips that will make you slightly more productive in lecture hour. Take notes. Even if you never look over them again, writing increases comprehension. (and makes the teacher think you are a good student!) Writing it once = reading it 7 times. If the teacher is reviewing stuff, write it down, again. I don't care if its one+one, writing = retention. But don't mindlessly copy. You have to actually understand what is being taught when the test comes. A good test to see if you actually understand it is: Could you explain the topic to the dumbest person in the class? If you can’t, you are either mindlessly copying or this method isn't for you (and that is okay!) Constantly “grade” yourself on the worksheets, homework, and review assigned in class. 27/30 eh? Thats an A-. And don't lie to yourself, the teacher will know on the test! Why did I not get that right? Was that a brainless error or did I actually not know that? How you do here will predict if you do on the exams. However, these notes won't solve all your problems(tm). You won't go from average student to straight A valedictorian due to these notes. Im sorry. This technique was made by an above-average student that never really needed to try that hard, for an above average-student that never really needed to try very hard. In essence, your class time is your study time. 2.) Does the teachers teaching mesh with your learning style? The best students in your class probably either spend hours a day busting their butt studying, OR the way the teacher presents information appeals to them. Different people learn in different ways. Find out how you learn best, prepare accordingly. What's Your Learning Style? Take the quiz. It could save you hours of studying. Really. Also, you might be able to understand what I’m saying in the next couple bullet points. If a teacher’s style really doesn't mesh with yours, its okay! You just gotta put a little more effort into these notes I mentioned. These all important-god given notes (solves all your problems!) should be written for people of your learning style. If you’re a tactile or kinesthetic learner, include tons of example problems and details on that science lab. If you learn by hearing, sit by the front and worship Khan academy on confusing topics. These (often unknown) preferences determine how you should play your cards. If you are an auditory learner, congratulations! 90% of classes will be wired to your favor. Dont write your notes the way the teacher would write them, write them in a way that actually helps you. Think of it this way: If you don't speak German, you wouldn't read a book in German. Find a translation. Study partners are a lot more useful when they share your learning style. Just saying. 3.) Do you know stuff about this topic beforehand? If you are a science nerd, most science classes will be painfully easy for you. Still take the notes. If your prior knowledge isn't as good as you would like it to be, seek out someone who knows more than you. Education isn’t you vs the other students. Its you vs the grading scale. Remember that, if faced with a terrible teacher, other students might be your salvation. OTHER MISCELLANEOUS TIPS When writing an essay, choose topics that you know some about, but are also unique. It should stand out from the ~150 other essays your teacher has to grade. You want the teachers to like you. They will cut you more slack. Trust me, I got a Biology teacher to bump up my 91 into a 93 for that reason alone. Dont copy the “good students” to what works for you.

Anything that you learn about nutrition and how your body works best, will be a strong enhancer of your thinking ability. Warren Buffet was once giving a talk to a group of teenagers (it’s on You Tube) and he said: “ Look after your body with the same loving care, and attention, that you would give to looking after a brand new car”, or words to that effect. If you want your body and mind to function well, in addition, I recommend that you read Matthew Walker’s book “Why we sleep”; or watch his very informative talks on You Tube. The better your sleep, the better your memory functions, the lower your stress level is, the more your grades will start to increase. There are a lot more benefits from adequate sleep, apart from those I’ve mentioned. And daily exercise and taking regular breaks will also help. Studying for 50 minutes and then always taking a short, ten minute break will enhance your academic work, by ensuring you don’t get fatigued.

Sit at the front of the class. Sitting at the front of the class isn't so you can suck up to the instructor, it's to increase your chances of paying attention and remembering what is being taught. You're less likely to be distracted by other students if you sit at the front of the class. 3. Resist using your computer for non-class related items. If your class is being held in a computer lab, or if you bring your own laptop (or tablet) to class, resist the temptation to use it for non-class related stuff. Close all your email and social media programs while in class. If you're only using your computer to take notes or view presentation slides, disconnect from the internet. By disconnecting yourself from the internet (and email and social media) you are giving yourself a chance to resist the temptation to pay more attention to your computer than your teacher. Any activity that is not class-related should be avoided while in class. Use your in class time to pay attention. 4. Put your hand up. If you have a question in class, ask it. If you think you know the answer to a question the instructor asks, answer it. If class participation is part of your class grade, asking and answering questions in class will help you get those points. Being verbal in class will also draw the attention of your instructor, who may then get to know you and consider you a student who is interested in learning. 5. Speak to your instructor. The best person to help you get better grades is the person who gives out those grades. Make an appointment to speak with your instructor about your performance. Let your instructor know that you aren't satisfied with your grades and you want to improve. Ask your instructor where you might be going wrong. Ask if there are any specific areas where you should focus. 6. Finish your assignments by the due dates. Many instructors will allow assignments to be handed in late, but they'll deduct points automatically for late assignments. Therefore, work it into your schedule to submit your assignments on time to ensure you can get the most possible points for your hard work. 7. Enroll in classes you actually enjoy. Chances are, not all your classes are required or mandatory. For your elective classes, select topics that you actually like and want to study. Liking and enjoying the subject matter not only makes attending class easier, it makes remembering the material easier. 8. Get lots of sleep. Scientific studies have actually shown that cramming for an exam or test the night before doesn't actually work. You are actually more likely to do better on the test if you stop studying and get some sleep, than if you spend the whole night attempting to remember everything for the test. Teenagers need at least 8 to 10 hours of sleep every night to be able to function effectively the next day. Children between the ages of 6 and 13 need 9 to 11 hours of sleep every night in order to be able to function well the next day. While it may seem like a good idea to grab an extra cup of coffee or drink that can of Red Bull, the more caffeine you consume in the afternoon means you'll have a harder time sleeping that night. Try to keep drink caffeinated beverages only in the morning. Method 2 of 3:Focusing on What's Important 1. Reduce your stress levels. Learning and studying shouldn't be stressful. Being stressed out can actually make it harder to learn and remember things. Think about the reasons why you're stressed out and try to resolve those reasons (remove them from your life). For example, if you get stressed out about assignments because you leave them to the last minute to finish, create yourself a study schedule. Build enough time into the study schedule so that you finish your assignments well enough in advance of the due dates to eliminate any of the stress you were feeling. 2. Keep a positive attitude. If the grades you're receiving aren't that great it can be easy to let negativity take over. Bad grades are disappointing, but the mere fact that you're looking for ways to improve your grades means you're trying to think positively. Acknowledge to yourself that your grades aren't that good, but you're going to do something about it. Start thinking about how you're going to make things better, rather than concentrating on where you are right now. 3. Figure out where you're going wrong. If your grades are lower than you want or are expecting, chances are you're not doing something you should, or you're doing something you shouldn't. The best way you can fix whatever is wrong is to first figure out what is wrong. If you already know what you might be doing wrong — great, you're on the right track! If you aren't sure what you're doing wrong, take a ‘deep dive' into your study history and grades. Look for a pattern or a sudden change. Were your grades always not-so-good, or did they start to decline after a specific time period? Is there a specific subject or task that you seem to have the most trouble with, or does it seem to be an overall problem? Are there any reasons, other than school, that might be the cause of your problems? Is there anything else going on in your life that may be impacting your grades? 4. Pay attention to the signals from your body. Learning may not seem like a physical process, but it can take a physical toll on your body. If your body and your brain are telling you to take a break, then take a break. Restart whatever you were doing once you feel better. If you're tired and find you can't concentrate on what you're learning, take a nap. Taking a 10-45 minute nap can actually improve your ability to learn. Method 3 of 3:Changing Your Learning Methods 1. Work to improve your note-taking skills. Depending on the type of course you're taking, being able to take good notes may be vital to your success. Take a look at your current notes and see where you might be able to improve. Make sure your notes are legible. If you can't read your own notes, you're not going to be able to use them. If you take your notes by hand, type them out after class both to help you remember what you learned and to help make them more legible. Make sure your notes are organized. Have a separate notebook or binder for each subject. Includes titles and dates where a new class starts so you can keep them in order. Use headings and subheadings throughout so you can skim your notes to find what you're looking for quickly. Use coloured pens or pencils or highlighters to make certain points stand out. 2. Use a metaphor or an analogy. When trying to memorize complex concepts and ideas, don't try to memorize the concepts and ideas as they are, use metaphors and analogies to remember them. A metaphor is a word or phrase that has one meaning but it is used to describe something else in order to show how the two things are similar. In other words, a metaphor is an object, activity or idea that is used as a symbol. An analogy is the comparison of two things based on the fact that they are alike in some way. An example of a metaphor is \"the test was a breeze.\" An example of an analogy is \"life is like a box of chocolates.\" 3. Combine visualization with something visceral. Visualizing something isn't always enough. Instead add some additional items associated with your other senses like sounds, textures, feelings and smells. When trying to remember something important, don't just visualize it, add these visceral items as well. An example might be a pie chart you need to remember that shows some important information. Visualize the pie chart like various pieces of pie. Maybe the larger pieces of pie are your favourite types of pie (e.g. strawberry), while the smaller pieces are your least favourite types of pie (e.g. pecan). 4. Pretend you have to explain something to a kid. Simplifying an idea or concept to its lowest and most basic elements can help you remember them. When trying to remember a particular difficult concept or idea, pretend you need to explain that concept or idea to a 5 year old. 5. Draw a diagram or mind map. This method starts off similar to a visualization, but instead of just making the one idea visual, connect that first idea to other ideas and concepts using a mind map. The multiple ideas in the mind map can be pictures or diagrams of the concepts. 6. Create a story. Strict memorization can make it difficult to remember a lot of information all at once. Instead of simply memorizing everything, turn it into a story. Create a story that goes along with the concept or idea you're trying to remember. Instead of a story you can also try acronyms. If you need to remember a list of things, use the first letters in each of the items to create a word that's easier to remember than the actual list. 7. Break your work down into smaller pieces. One of the best ways to learn a complex idea or concept is to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Don't try to tackle an entire complex concept or idea as a whole, break the material into smaller pieces you can review and learn separately.

Next, set yourself some targets and create a schedule that allows you time for your study, hobbies and some freetime for relaxation. Think of some rewards that will also be meaningful for you and put them in your diary. Put your schedule on your wall, where you can see it the moment you open your eyes in the morning, and also on your IT (phone, laptop etc). Know that after 7pm it will take you 2.5 hours to learn something that you can learn in 20mins before 7pm as your circadian rhythms will be adjusting for sleep, so reserve the evenings for revision and re-reading notes. Learn new stuff during the day ONLY. Aim to revisit new things you learned during the day within 24 hours so you retain 80% of it. If you fail to do this, you will forget 80% of it. Do not put yourself in a position where you have to thrash yourself to learn. Work WITH your body and brain, not against it. Aim to finish your revision/re-consulting of notes by 10pm and get your books ready for the next day. Check you know what topics you have got and where the lectures will be. Spend 30mins relaxing, shower or do meditation to bring yourself down, ready for sleep. To learn something new requires 3 passes through the material and each one has to be different to allow your brain to connect with it and form bigger mental maps of what you are learning. So get creative. A pass can be a walk-and-talk with a friend in the park about it - give them some cue cards and tell them what you know. They can then check your answers, ask questions, and correct you. Write a skit about it, or create a gaint poster bringing all the salient points together. Create a mindmap where you pitch two contrasting books or theories against each other, one on one side and one on the other side of the mindmap. Build it over several days. This will be more effective and fun than highlighting endless lines of text and writing that into notebooks (which is, incidentally, just about the most ineffective way of trying to learn new material). Set yourself complex tasks (because your brain likes doing complex work) and move from what you know into what you don’t know, allowing your brain time to absorb and re-ochestrate what it knows. Bring your learning together with someone else’s into a set of notes which you share. This is called Meta-Learning. Write down a ton of questions and ask them in your lectures - don’t just let it pass and accept what your lecturer says. Schedule 3 passes through your new material to be completed by the end of each week, then create your final notes, file them and keep re-reading them during the term so that by the time the exams come along, you will really KNOW them. Use your exams to bring up new thinking and relate it to the topics in hand - this is what will get you your A grades. Finally pay attention to your nutritional needs. Your brain needs amino acids three times per day to even be able to make good decisions, and this include deciding how and what to learn. Your brain cannot store them, so you have to feed it the nutrients it needs so it can do what you are asking of it. To get this down, warry around with you a mixture of sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and raisins in a small pocket-sized container. Three tsp of the seeds and 2 tsp of the raisins constitutes complete meal, including protein, starch, fibre, trace elements and minerals. Chew this slowly and you will stay alert and focussed. If you cannot find a small plastic container, use some small zliplock bags. Carry 3 of these around each day so you can have some if you are finding yourself missing a meal, but do try to eat sensibly. This is not a long-term solution to starving yourself. It is supposed to be a super-student’s super snack. PS I am also a Super-Learning Coach.

It is a story of the average student. But the fact that you're asking this question proves you're not average, isn't it? Thus we reveal the secret to you which is consistency and dedicated smart work. We’ve gathered wisdom from five thousand books, innumerable internet scrollings and so on and give you our pick on how to be smarter and better. Don’t mug up. Be a do-er: Do problems, don’t just read theory. Actively recall things you have studied. Mugging up and cramming before a test does not lead to long term memory. Spaced repetition is the key. Here is a diagram showing the forgetting curve and the process you need to follow to commit things to memory. 2. Stop Scrolling: Scrolling is a lot of work for your brain although it may not seem so. Also it drastically reduces attention span and the ability of your memory to commit to detail and remember stuff. Stop this soon. Disable stuff from your phone and uninstall instagram. 3.Learn Stuff right after they are taught: Ideally, go through the material taught in class soon after and don’t wait for exams. This ensures maximum retention. 4. Create an un-complicated time table: No, you do not need to subscribe to light academia aesthetic with sticky notes and pastel coloured expensive journals. You can get it done with as little as a piece of paper everyday. Jot things down that you have to do that day on it and use a calendar to keep track of deadlines. 5. Use in between class times to work on homework: The real fun will begin at night anyway, so do not use the time in between classes to chat up with friends. Instead, use those breaks to get away and get work done. 6. Stay Healthy: Eat well, don’t eat processed foods, actually study, exercise and take frequent breaks.

Improve your working memory. Working memory and its translation into long term memory is what I have noticed as a student to be the difference between a highly successful career and a struggling career. #3 will handle the translation into long term memory, however the working memory can best be improved using something like Brain Workshop. I have found it to be useful. Change your study habits so that they work with you. I am going to make an assumption that you study for a certain amount of time and you simply want to make that time better and more productive. To do this, you need to create an environment in your own life that is most productive to retention. This should be coupled with studies preferably from research institutes for the greatest effectiveness. Transition to Long Term: There are two strategies I have utilized for this, and they might prove to be useful. Unconscious repetition: This is sort of an experimental strategy I have been working on over the past few months, but the idea behind it is that your brain can replay events and situations practically unconsciously. By learning how to force your mind to speed this processing through classical conditioning, it can improve your base ability to memorize things over the long term. Building a Global Understanding System: I will put you through a task. In 1776, the Continental Congress declared independence from the British Empire. During this time, Louisiana was under the control of?… the Spanish. Now, how do I know this? Well, I think back to the political situation that was present in Europe during the time. I can completely skip over American history for this one and focus on British foreign affairs during the time to determine this. Due to Spanish-British relations not being exactly that great. The British actually wanted to prevent confrontation with the Native Americans and the Spanish for the very reason of trying to reduce the reasoning for war on an economically vital colony. Also considering the French were booted out of North America in 1763 following the 7 Years War, there is no way that the British allowed the French to keep the colony. I understand global history to a level where I can deduce what happened without ever knowing whether it is true or not. Think of it this way; knowledge is like a Pareto efficient puzzle. But, 99% of the full knowledge of a certain field can be deduced by 1% of the known information. This is just for history alone. For Chemistry, it is even more profound when you consider how much is published every day compared to how little knowledge you need to understand what you are reading. When you build your fundamentals in a field to a certain level, you start to become intuitively able to figure things out with only a few deviations. This is actually the fact that makes humans better than machines right now. We can take a few fundamental principles and logically reason from there. We don’t have to apply algorithms to solve our problems, we have heuristics that are developed because our perception of things is fueled by a global understanding. Build your fundamental knowledge to absolute mastery, and you will be able to memorize significantly more because you simply will have logical reasoning system to help jog your memory. If you want tricks for your specific school or college, I have always seen filler classes and easy professors to be your best bet. The professor you get can really make a difference between earning a 50% or a 90%, because policies do dictate grading much more than people think. But, here’s a truth with this logic and the reason why I never liked it: A. Schools do ask for subject specific GPAs. My school has a Physics and Math GPA that is set aside from my normal GPA. So, you can’t use filler classes to get past that. B. School should be an accurate representation of your performance. Unless you are meaning to just get through high school, your performance should matter to you. Accepting a grade makes you a better student and a much more successful learner. Taking hard classes challenges your ability to be a good student. That resilience is more important than any grade or GPA you get.

I got my act together in AP classes, though. I don't endorse this method, unless you are too busy to study. Don’t do it to see if you can get away with it. THE WISE IDIOTS GUIDE TO STUDYING How well you are able to do with this method comes down to three factors: 1.) Can you pick up information faster than the average student? Brutal honesty hour here, (screw politically correctness.) All students are not created equal. Student A could study for 3 hours and get a B on the big test, while Student B aced it with 30 minutes of studying. The majority of teachers teach to the “Average Joe” student, leaving the bottom of the class confused, and the top bored out of their minds. Where do you stand? Is what the teacher provides enough for you to consistently reach the grades you want? If your not getting the grades you want now, there is no way you’re going to get them without studying. Is it realistic that you would get A range on your tests? Your best guess right now is how you preform on pop quizzes. If you are on the fence of being able to do this, (read: B+ to A- range), here are some tips that will make you slightly more productive in lecture hour. Take notes. Even if you never look over them again, writing increases comprehension. (and makes the teacher think you are a good student!) Writing it once = reading it 7 times. If the teacher is reviewing stuff, write it down, again. I don't care if its one+one, writing = retention. But don't mindlessly copy. You have to actually understand what is being taught when the test comes. A good test to see if you actually understand it is: Could you explain the topic to the dumbest person in the class? If you can’t, you are either mindlessly copying or this method isn't for you (and that is okay!) Constantly “grade” yourself on the worksheets, homework, and review assigned in class. 27/30 eh? Thats an A-. And don't lie to yourself, the teacher will know on the test! Why did I not get that right? Was that a brainless error or did I actually not know that? How you do here will predict if you do on the exams. However, these notes won't solve all your problems(tm). You won't go from average student to straight A valedictorian due to these notes. Im sorry. This technique was made by an above-average student that never really needed to try that hard, for an above average-student that never really needed to try very hard. In essence, your class time is your study time. 2.) Does the teachers teaching mesh with your learning style? The best students in your class probably either spend hours a day busting their butt studying, OR the way the teacher presents information appeals to them. Different people learn in different ways. Find out how you learn best, prepare accordingly. What's Your Learning Style? Take the quiz. It could save you hours of studying. Really. Also, you might be able to understand what I’m saying in the next couple bullet points. If a teacher’s style really doesn't mesh with yours, its okay! You just gotta put a little more effort into these notes I mentioned. These all important-god given notes (solves all your problems!) should be written for people of your learning style. If you’re a tactile or kinesthetic learner, include tons of example problems and details on that science lab. If you learn by hearing, sit by the front and worship Khan academy on confusing topics. These (often unknown) preferences determine how you should play your cards. If you are an auditory learner, congratulations! 90% of classes will be wired to your favor. Dont write your notes the way the teacher would write them, write them in a way that actually helps you. Think of it this way: If you don't speak German, you wouldn't read a book in German. Find a translation. Study partners are a lot more useful when they share your learning style. Just saying. 3.) Do you know stuff about this topic beforehand? If you are a science nerd, most science classes will be painfully easy for you. Still take the notes. If your prior knowledge isn't as good as you would like it to be, seek out someone who knows more than you. Education isn’t you vs the other students. Its you vs the grading scale. Remember that, if faced with a terrible teacher, other students might be your salvation. OTHER MISCELLANEOUS TIPS When writing an essay, choose topics that you know some about, but are also unique. It should stand out from the ~150 other essays your teacher has to grade. You want the teachers to like you. They will cut you more slack. Trust me, I got a Biology teacher to bump up my 91 into a 93 for that reason alone. Dont copy the “good students” to what works for you.

If you want your body and mind to function well, in addition, I recommend that you read Matthew Walker’s book “Why we sleep”; or watch his very informative talks on You Tube. The better your sleep, the better your memory functions, the lower your stress level is, the more your grades will start to increase. There are a lot more benefits from adequate sleep, apart from those I’ve mentioned. And daily exercise and taking regular breaks will also help.

Sit at the front of the class. Sitting at the front of the class isn't so you can suck up to the instructor, it's to increase your chances of paying attention and remembering what is being taught. You're less likely to be distracted by other students if you sit at the front of the class. 3. Resist using your computer for non-class related items. If your class is being held in a computer lab, or if you bring your own laptop (or tablet) to class, resist the temptation to use it for non-class related stuff. Close all your email and social media programs while in class. If you're only using your computer to take notes or view presentation slides, disconnect from the internet. By disconnecting yourself from the internet (and email and social media) you are giving yourself a chance to resist the temptation to pay more attention to your computer than your teacher. Any activity that is not class-related should be avoided while in class. Use your in class time to pay attention. 4. Put your hand up. If you have a question in class, ask it. If you think you know the answer to a question the instructor asks, answer it. If class participation is part of your class grade, asking and answering questions in class will help you get those points. Being verbal in class will also draw the attention of your instructor, who may then get to know you and consider you a student who is interested in learning. 5. Speak to your instructor. The best person to help you get better grades is the person who gives out those grades. Make an appointment to speak with your instructor about your performance. Let your instructor know that you aren't satisfied with your grades and you want to improve. Ask your instructor where you might be going wrong. Ask if there are any specific areas where you should focus. 6. Finish your assignments by the due dates. Many instructors will allow assignments to be handed in late, but they'll deduct points automatically for late assignments. Therefore, work it into your schedule to submit your assignments on time to ensure you can get the most possible points for your hard work. 7. Enroll in classes you actually enjoy. Chances are, not all your classes are required or mandatory. For your elective classes, select topics that you actually like and want to study. Liking and enjoying the subject matter not only makes attending class easier, it makes remembering the material easier. 8. Get lots of sleep. Scientific studies have actually shown that cramming for an exam or test the night before doesn't actually work. You are actually more likely to do better on the test if you stop studying and get some sleep, than if you spend the whole night attempting to remember everything for the test. Teenagers need at least 8 to 10 hours of sleep every night to be able to function effectively the next day. Children between the ages of 6 and 13 need 9 to 11 hours of sleep every night in order to be able to function well the next day. While it may seem like a good idea to grab an extra cup of coffee or drink that can of Red Bull, the more caffeine you consume in the afternoon means you'll have a harder time sleeping that night. Try to keep drink caffeinated beverages only in the morning. Method 2 of 3:Focusing on What's Important 1. Reduce your stress levels. Learning and studying shouldn't be stressful. Being stressed out can actually make it harder to learn and remember things. Think about the reasons why you're stressed out and try to resolve those reasons (remove them from your life). For example, if you get stressed out about assignments because you leave them to the last minute to finish, create yourself a study schedule. Build enough time into the study schedule so that you finish your assignments well enough in advance of the due dates to eliminate any of the stress you were feeling. 2. Keep a positive attitude. If the grades you're receiving aren't that great it can be easy to let negativity take over. Bad grades are disappointing, but the mere fact that you're looking for ways to improve your grades means you're trying to think positively. Acknowledge to yourself that your grades aren't that good, but you're going to do something about it. Start thinking about how you're going to make things better, rather than concentrating on where you are right now. 3. Figure out where you're going wrong. If your grades are lower than you want or are expecting, chances are you're not doing something you should, or you're doing something you shouldn't. The best way you can fix whatever is wrong is to first figure out what is wrong. If you already know what you might be doing wrong — great, you're on the right track! If you aren't sure what you're doing wrong, take a ‘deep dive' into your study history and grades. Look for a pattern or a sudden change. Were your grades always not-so-good, or did they start to decline after a specific time period? Is there a specific subject or task that you seem to have the most trouble with, or does it seem to be an overall problem? Are there any reasons, other than school, that might be the cause of your problems? Is there anything else going on in your life that may be impacting your grades? 4. Pay attention to the signals from your body. Learning may not seem like a physical process, but it can take a physical toll on your body. If your body and your brain are telling you to take a break, then take a break. Restart whatever you were doing once you feel better. If you're tired and find you can't concentrate on what you're learning, take a nap. Taking a 10-45 minute nap can actually improve your ability to learn. Method 3 of 3:Changing Your Learning Methods 1. Work to improve your note-taking skills. Depending on the type of course you're taking, being able to take good notes may be vital to your success. Take a look at your current notes and see where you might be able to improve. Make sure your notes are legible. If you can't read your own notes, you're not going to be able to use them. If you take your notes by hand, type them out after class both to help you remember what you learned and to help make them more legible. Make sure your notes are organized. Have a separate notebook or binder for each subject. Includes titles and dates where a new class starts so you can keep them in order. Use headings and subheadings throughout so you can skim your notes to find what you're looking for quickly. Use coloured pens or pencils or highlighters to make certain points stand out. 2. Use a metaphor or an analogy. When trying to memorize complex concepts and ideas, don't try to memorize the concepts and ideas as they are, use metaphors and analogies to remember them. A metaphor is a word or phrase that has one meaning but it is used to describe something else in order to show how the two things are similar. In other words, a metaphor is an object, activity or idea that is used as a symbol. An analogy is the comparison of two things based on the fact that they are alike in some way. An example of a metaphor is \"the test was a breeze.\" An example of an analogy is \"life is like a box of chocolates.\" 3. Combine visualization with something visceral. Visualizing something isn't always enough. Instead add some additional items associated with your other senses like sounds, textures, feelings and smells. When trying to remember something important, don't just visualize it, add these visceral items as well. An example might be a pie chart you need to remember that shows some important information. Visualize the pie chart like various pieces of pie. Maybe the larger pieces of pie are your favourite types of pie (e.g. strawberry), while the smaller pieces are your least favourite types of pie (e.g. pecan). 4. Pretend you have to explain something to a kid. Simplifying an idea or concept to its lowest and most basic elements can help you remember them. When trying to remember a particular difficult concept or idea, pretend you need to explain that concept or idea to a 5 year old. 5. Draw a diagram or mind map. This method starts off similar to a visualization, but instead of just making the one idea visual, connect that first idea to other ideas and concepts using a mind map. The multiple ideas in the mind map can be pictures or diagrams of the concepts. 6. Create a story. Strict memorization can make it difficult to remember a lot of information all at once. Instead of simply memorizing everything, turn it into a story. Create a story that goes along with the concept or idea you're trying to remember. Instead of a story you can also try acronyms. If you need to remember a list of things, use the first letters in each of the items to create a word that's easier to remember than the actual list. 7. Break your work down into smaller pieces. One of the best ways to learn a complex idea or concept is to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Don't try to tackle an entire complex concept or idea as a whole, break the material into smaller pieces you can review and learn separately.

Think of some rewards that will also be meaningful for you and put them in your diary. Put your schedule on your wall, where you can see it the moment you open your eyes in the morning, and also on your IT (phone, laptop etc). Know that after 7pm it will take you 2.5 hours to learn something that you can learn in 20mins before 7pm as your circadian rhythms will be adjusting for sleep, so reserve the evenings for revision and re-reading notes. Learn new stuff during the day ONLY. Aim to revisit new things you learned during the day within 24 hours so you retain 80% of it. If you fail to do this, you will forget 80% of it. Do not put yourself in a position where you have to thrash yourself to learn. Work WITH your body and brain, not against it. Aim to finish your revision/re-consulting of notes by 10pm and get your books ready for the next day. Check you know what topics you have got and where the lectures will be. Spend 30mins relaxing, shower or do meditation to bring yourself down, ready for sleep. To learn something new requires 3 passes through the material and each one has to be different to allow your brain to connect with it and form bigger mental maps of what you are learning. So get creative. A pass can be a walk-and-talk with a friend in the park about it - give them some cue cards and tell them what you know. They can then check your answers, ask questions, and correct you. Write a skit about it, or create a gaint poster bringing all the salient points together. Create a mindmap where you pitch two contrasting books or theories against each other, one on one side and one on the other side of the mindmap. Build it over several days. This will be more effective and fun than highlighting endless lines of text and writing that into notebooks (which is, incidentally, just about the most ineffective way of trying to learn new material). Set yourself complex tasks (because your brain likes doing complex work) and move from what you know into what you don’t know, allowing your brain time to absorb and re-ochestrate what it knows. Bring your learning together with someone else’s into a set of notes which you share. This is called Meta-Learning. Write down a ton of questions and ask them in your lectures - don’t just let it pass and accept what your lecturer says. Schedule 3 passes through your new material to be completed by the end of each week, then create your final notes, file them and keep re-reading them during the term so that by the time the exams come along, you will really KNOW them. Use your exams to bring up new thinking and relate it to the topics in hand - this is what will get you your A grades. Finally pay attention to your nutritional needs. Your brain needs amino acids three times per day to even be able to make good decisions, and this include deciding how and what to learn. Your brain cannot store them, so you have to feed it the nutrients it needs so it can do what you are asking of it. To get this down, warry around with you a mixture of sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and raisins in a small pocket-sized container. Three tsp of the seeds and 2 tsp of the raisins constitutes complete meal, including protein, starch, fibre, trace elements and minerals. Chew this slowly and you will stay alert and focussed. If you cannot find a small plastic container, use some small zliplock bags. Carry 3 of these around each day so you can have some if you are finding yourself missing a meal, but do try to eat sensibly. This is not a long-term solution to starving yourself. It is supposed to be a super-student’s super snack. PS I am also a Super-Learning Coach.

Learn More The Three-Step Strategy to Study Hard Without Burning Out April, 2014 40 Comments | Comments | Share Most of the time I talk about learning better, I try to focus on long-term habits. Build good habits over months and years, and they’ll serve you for the rest of your life. Even if you fall off the wagon, it’s easier to rebuild old habits than construct fresh ones. Sometimes, however, you won’t have that luxury. You’ll have a big test or deadline which you need to learn a lot, fast. In this article, I’m going to share the strategy I used both when tackling the roughly four-fold pace of the MIT Challenge and currently, learning to speak Chinese over three months. What makes this strategy powerful is that it is the opposite of how most people approach tough learning deadlines, and why they eventually succumb to procrastination or burnout. Burnout and Procrastination, Symptoms of a Poor Strategy The typical student’s approach to a looming deadline is something like this: force yourself to spend all your time in the library, eliminate all social activities and fun, beat yourself up for wasting time or getting distracted. It’s a common pattern because its a reinforcing cycle. You start getting distracted, so you force yourself to buckle down and spend more time studying. This drains you more, making it easier to get distracted, which guilts you into spending even more time in isolation. This generally continues until you’re either operating at very low levels of your peak efficiency, or you’re burned out and have given up. What’s hard for these students to realize is that they can learn more, by spending less time studying. (Or, more accurately, less time guilting themselves into studying since in the unfocused haze of semi-work, very little studying is actually occurring.) How to Study Hard Without Burning Out The key of the method is simple: constrain your studying hours, but make them higher quality. Here are the three steps, which I’ll explain in detail: Set concrete studying hours that leave room for rest time. Switch passive learning tasks to active ones. Build a comfortable, but distraction-free working environment. Step One: Concrete Studying Hours with Ample Rest Time The first mistake is believing you can study non-stop. This is a dangerous temptation, and the bigger the exam or deadline looms, the easier it is to fall into this trap. I’m not going to tell you that the optimal amount of hours of studying should be leisurely. If you want to study hard, you’re going to have to work hard. But think of it like running a race, there’s a hard pace you can stick to and a pace that goes too fast and you run out of air. Separating the two is a fine line. The easiest way to separate that line is to set concrete hours that allow you enough time to rest. I personally find working 5 days per week 8am-6pm plus an additional half day (with breaks, of course), to be about the best I can do for more than several weeks at a time. I used this schedule throughout the MIT Challenge, and I’m using it now while learning Chinese. Notice that this schedule means every evening is free as is one whole weekend day (and half of another). This means that going out to meet friends, exercising or anything else you do for fun doesn’t need to be sacrificed. If you’re currently studying hard, feeling burned out, and are trying to switch strategies, your transition workload needs to be even less than this. I might do only half as much for a few days or a week until I build back up to this schedule. If you’re winded when running, you need to go back to a slower pace for awhile before you return to your sustainable pace. Step Two: Switch Passive Learning Tasks to Active Ones I’ve used the running metaphor to explain why setting concrete hours is essential. However, the running analogy fails because mental and physical tasks are fundamentally different. If you’re in a race and start feeling you’re running too fast, you have to slow down. If you’re in a mental race and start feeling you’re pushing too much, your body can compensate by wrecking your focus. When your focus is damaged, your learning speed is curtailed significantly, but you’re still putting in a lot of effort. This means you may be putting in the same effort as someone who stuck with a concrete schedule, but you’re learning far less. The next step to combating this problem is to switch your tasks from passive to active ones. These will strain you more, so if you’re transitioning from a burnout schedule to a fixed one, you’ll need to set even more minimal hours for the first few days. However, the benefit of active tasks is that they force you in a higher efficiency direction with your studying. Activeness is a spectrum so there aren’t two categories of studying tasks that are labelled either passive or active. Rather, some tasks are higher-focus, higher-efficiency than others. Self-testing is an active task. Re-reading notes is a passive one. The Feynman Technique is an active task. Skimming is a passive one. A good rule of thumb is that if there’s no point in your studying routine where you have the possibility of finding out you’re incorrect, it isn’t an active task. I would make some limited exceptions to that list (some mnemonic techniques have no feedback, but are mentally demanding and fairly efficient) but it’s a small one. Step Three: Build a Comfortable, Yet Distraction-Free, Work Environment This step is obvious: if you work where you have distractions, you’ll get distracted. I do my non-conversational studying of Chinese at a cafe where I don’t have internet access. If you need to use the internet for part of your work, use an app like SelfControl to selectively block all websites that aren’t work-related. If you can go without internet altogether, even better. Put your phone on silent, or don’t even bring it while you’re studying. Go somewhere your friends aren’t (although I picked my studying location in Chinese so that it can occasionally facilitate random Chinese conversations, it’s the exception which proves the rule). Even though you don’t want to be distracted, don’t worry about taking breaks. The ideal should be to create an environment where breaks are boring (but still relaxing) so you don’t get tempted into giving up studying. Choosing break activities that fit that criteria in advance can help you sustain your focus over an entire day. During the MIT Challenge, I’d often go for short walks or just sit quietly for fifteen or twenty minutes. These are good breaks because they allow you to give your mind a short breather, but they are boring enough that returning to your original task doesn’t require willpower. Surfing the internet, chatting with friends or playing phone games aren’t good break activities. My frequency of breaks depends a lot on the type of activity I’m doing. I took frequent breaks during the MIT Challenge because the hard math problems and long reading assignments were difficult to sustain focus for more than an hour or so. During this language challenge I rarely take long breaks because the mental task of grammar exercises or vocabulary building is less taxing. How to Transition from a Burnout Schedule to an Effective One Despite knowing these lessons deeply, I even recently succumbed to the temptation to work too much. I built my language-learning routine around immersion, which meant nearly constant engagement with the language. That worked with Spanish, where studying time itself was rather minimal in comparison to simply interacting, but it broke down when applying it to Chinese. My problem wasn’t the No-English rule, but rather, trying to fill each day with too many activities that were mentally demanding. Always listening to ChinesePod instead of music, only watching Chinese television and media, studying every day instead of taking a day off each week. By the time I noticed I was about to hit a wall, I had a Chinese-language presentation looming in the following few days I couldn’t get out of, and it burned me. I probably lost a few days of good studying time and possibly more in lowered efficiency due to my mistake. But mistakes happen, and once I realized I had fallen into that trap, I redesigned a new studying schedule which followed the above rules and eased into it over a few days. Now I’m back on track and I’m getting at least as much studying done as I had been before, but I’m not exhausting myself to do it. Sometimes you can fall into a burnout schedule but not recognize it for what it is. This can happen when you aren’t making enough progress towards your goal (or are procrastinating so much) that you feel you should be working more, not less. In these cases, it can sometimes be hard to recognize that your inability to stay focused is a symptom of unconstrained work hours, not laziness. Join my weekly newsletter AND GET 5 BOOKS FOR FREE!

In order to maximize our ability to focus we need to beat distractions and get into a flow state. If we want to stay consistent we need to stay healthy and keep our energy levels up. Learn How To Learn Learn How To Learn helps your get top grades. While saving hours of studying every week. Alexander Young The following study tips are all backed up by evidence: 1. The Energy Management Tip Our first step towards studying consistently is to understand the principle of energy management. Let’s be honest, we all have our own quirks and preferences. Some of us are early birds while others are night owls. The key is to understand which one we are and plan our study strategy around it. After all, we can have the best environment, a clear set of goals and all the materials we need but it’ll all be for nothing if we’re running low on energy and don’t have the willpower to even open our laptop. It's therefore crucial that we identify the peak times when we feel most energized and plan our study sessions during these periods for maximum efficiency. For me I always found that going to bed around 10:30 and then waking up early around 6:30 and going straight to my desk was when I had the most willpower to overcome distractions and the most energy to work on difficult topics. Psychologist Roy F Baumeister outlined this in his book Willpower and he basically says that as our energy levels decrease during the day we're more likely to tire and become distracted or produce lower quality work. Ultimately, when it comes to energy management and taking breaks we want to discover what drains our energy and what causes us to feel energized. Recognizing the optimal time for studying allows us to organize work sessions in a way that promotes an efficient workflow. You then just need to come up with a schedule that works for you and stick to it! 2.The Breaks Tip To manage our energy effectively we need to prioritize taking meaningful breaks between work which is study tip number 2. Maintaining a high energy level will result in a deeper focus and critical thinking, so prioritizing tasks for when we feel most energetic will work wonders for the quality of the work we produce. We can always reserve the less demanding activities (like reviewing notes or organizing your study materials) for times when our biological battery is feeling a bit low. It's also important we break our study tasks into manageable chunks. When I was in med school and attempting to study for hours on end without breaks it led to mental fatigue and exhaustion, not better grades. Instead, I would set specific goals for each study session, such as completing a certain number of practice questions and reward myself with something fun or relaxing after hitting that goal. I'd reward meaningful progress rather than just time spent studying. Short, frequent breaks of around 5 to 10 minutes every hour can help recharge our energy and improve our overall concentration. The best use of these breaks is to stretch, hydrate, or even do a quick mindfulness exercise. 3. Perform Active Tasks Tip Now, changing your approach to how you study isn’t going to be easy but adopting good habits and positive strategies, even if it takes months or years, will definitely pay off in the long run. Trust me, I know what it’s like to fall into the pattern of cramming for a test at the last minute, it's what I did during my first year at med school, but it’s not healthy or productive and I actually ended up burning out through cramming and learning far less than if I had stuck to a set schedule. And cramming is also stressful, which in itself can hinder our ability to concentrate! To break out of this vicious cramming cycle, we first need to switch our study sessions from passive to active ones. The aim here is to increase our efficiency so that we waste less time and it becomes easier for us to sit down and focus on doing active tasks like active recall questions where we're engaged with the material than just passively reading which I always found was less engaging and I was more likely to get distracted especially if the chapter I was reading was boring. So an activity like re-reading your notes is considered to be passive studying while self-testing (or getting a friend to test you) is an active study method. A simple way to think of it is that any activity that fails to challenge you is passive, whereas an active task may force you to find out you were wrong about something and allow you to rectify it immediately. 4. Reward Yourself So that’s all well and good, but it still doesn’t motivate you to want to sit down and study in the first place. For this, we need to get into the mindset that the work we do is good for us and recognize that we’re building towards something positive in the future. All too often, we tend to lose sight of our end goal, be it a career that pays lots of money and allows us to live comfortably, or passing a test that will ultimately let us do something we want or need (like being able to drive). Creating a short-term reward system, might help you to combat this and it works as a good motivator for some people. If I'm struggling to sit down and work for example, I'll set a reward for myself at the end of it like going to the gym, grabbing a coffee or watching a show on Netflix. It sounds a little silly at first, but having a clear sense of purpose can help you sustain your energy and enthusiasm. As long as you have the self-discipline to see it through, this technique can be very effective when used correctly. 5. The Organized Workspace Tip Tip number 5, is probably the most impactful change I made when I was in medical school in terms of boosting my ability to get into a flow state and it's simply about creating a dedicated and organized workspace. To really get the most out of our study sessions, we must eliminate as many distractions as we can, remember top grades are a function of our ability to focus and to be consistent. It goes without saying that the world we live in is full of distractions that limit out focus and consistency, from smartphones and social media to TV and games, but a simple way to avoid all of these is to keep them out of sight and out of mind. I have my desk setup the night before with my workspace tidied and tasks for the following day laid out. Whn I wake up I go straight to my desk with my phone on silent or outside the room I'm currently in to avoid the temptation of looking at it. If you're really struggling here there are apps you can download that will regulate your screen time, blocking access to certain features during your scheduled study times. Whether I'm working from home, on holiday or in a noisy office, I make sure my team, family and friends know when I'll be in deep work mode and I'll use noise cancelling headphones and lofi music to help me get into a flow state quickly. 6. The Study Group Tip Now the study tips so far have been mainly centered on improving our ability to focus. Getting top grades is a function of our ability to focus and our ability to stay consistent and the next few tips are going to look more at consistency and building study habits. Tip number 6 is something that I highly recommend doing and it's finding a study community, this is either a partner or a group of people whom you can study with on regular occasions. Not only does this increase our focus and productivity, but it will also provide motivation and hold you accountable as a member of the group. What’s more, the opportunity to pause and engage in discussions about challenging topics with fellow students constitutes a high-impact learning strategy (again it’s active, not passive). This approach enhances long-term retention and can help to identify and fill in the gaps in your learning that we may not have found on our own. Whether you decide to study solo or with others, you’ll want to vary your studies to avoid suffering from burnout. We don’t always need to be doing something heavy to be productive. Some people like to ‘gamify’ their studies, coming up with fun and interesting ways to test themselves. Personally, I find this doesn’t work too well for me but as I said before, we’re all different and coming up with a game to help you learn something could be a welcome change to the usual routine. No matter what anyone else says, you need to find study techniques that work for you. Don’t be afraid to experiment and get creative! 7. The Well-Being Tip To be consistent we need to stay healthy and energised but from personal experience it can be really difficult to do so around stressful exam times or if we're trying to find time to learn around a busy schedule as a working professional. And of course, any strategies or techniques you choose to adopt have zero chance of succeeding if you don’t actively manage your personal well-being.. As with studying, we need to take time to appreciate things and understand what self-care means. For some people, this might involve going out with friends or doing some retail therapy by buying some new clothes. For others, it could be as simple as going for a walk, lifting weights, or reading. There are lots of things you can do to de-stress and it’s crucial that you spend some time away from studying to focus on yourself. For me self-care is a non-negotiable part of my learning routine. I'll actively practice a guided mindfulness meditation before and after a study session since there is strong evidence that doing so improves our ability to learn. My other non-negotiables are then getting enough sleep, exercising and eating healthily which we'll touch on in the next three tips starting with the importance of sleep. 8. The Plenty of Sleep Tip Getting plenty of sleep because sleep is very important for learning. Given that sleep disruption is a key characteristic of burnout, it's unsurprising that a strategic and prioritized approach to maintaining healthy sleep habits is recommended by multiple studies. REM sleep plays a key role in solidifying long-term memories, while poor sleep can result in severe lapses in attention. Making sure you get a good 7 hours of rest each night and sleeping at regular intervals will help to calibrate your body clock, providing a strong foundation for everything else we’ve discussed so far. What I have found that works for me is having a fairly strict wind-down routine where I won't drink any caffeine in the afternoon and will then stop working around 7pm and relax before bedtime around 10 to 10:30. I've noticed that when I don't do this my racing mind stops me from going to sleep and my quality of sleep won't be as good. I'll then ensure my sleep environment is cool and dark and I'll wake up without an alarm ready to attack the day. One of the main things I've noticed is that if I don't exercise during the day my quality of sleep won't be as good and there is tonnes of evidence showing that sleep and exercise and learning have a reciprocal relationship so let's look at exercise next. 9. The Regular Exercise Tip Regular exercise, has been proven to rebalance negative emotions and alleviate stress. When you're less stressed, your mind is more clear and receptive to learning. Even just going outside and staying in touch with nature is a good way to keep yourself grounded. Now if you’re not a physically active person the thought of this can actually increase your stress level, at least to begin with. If that’s the case, I'd suggest creating a list of activities that feel like a break or reward which are also easy for you to do like going for a walk while listening to your favourite podcast! The aim is to gradually incorporate physical activities into our routine, dedicating short periods of 15 to 20 minutes twice per day. I like setting myself exercise challenges to stay active, such as performing push-ups, sit-ups, or wall sits and trying to beat my previous record or following a lifting routine for the gym and trying to beat my max reps. Just like sleep I'll also schedule in gym sessions as a non-negotiable and try and mix cardio, push and pull sessions with yoga and classes to mix things up. Now occasionally if I do a really high effort crossfit class for example I can end up feeling tired afterwards if I'm not eating enough or following a proper diet and then this can impact my work and study ability so let's look at diet next. 10. Manage Your Diet Managing our diet is another crucial aspect of active well-being that helps us to remain consistent when studying by keeping our energy levels high throughout the day despite our body's normal blood sugar fluctuations. Healthy inputs equals beneficial outputs. So, staying hydrated and eating well are key for maintaining energy levels. I try to avoid drinking tons of coffee or eating sugary foods, which will lead to inevitable crashes in energy. Instead, I'll opt for balanced meals and snacks that provide sustained energy, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins as well as lots of healthy snacks like nuts and blueberries which have been shown to be beneficial to our brain's ability to function at it's best. Just like exercise, the thought of obtaining, preparing, and enjoying meals during a dedicated study period can appear daunting to begin with, but you don't need to be a nutritionist in order to comprehend what you can eat everyday and what you need to avoid. It needn’t be a costly or time-intensive process. Cheap, healthy meals cooked in a slow cooker can be prepared in bulk on a Sunday, and you can reserve special meals as a treat or reward to simplify the overall meal preparation process. 11. Practise Stress Management Techniques Okay so my final evidence-based study tip is to incorporate stress management techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or mindfulness practices into your daily routine. I mentioned earlier I do these daily and I find just 5-minutes of meditation reduces stress and can also help prevent burnout during intensive study periods. When working I find it enhances my ability to concentrate and maintain focus on tasks, reducing distractions and improving productivity. Some studies suggest that regular meditation can improve memory and cognitive function too, making it easier to grasp complex concepts and recall information during exams. Most studies recommend a quick 5-minute mindful breathing exercise or guided meditation prior to starting a study session and then one at the end will confer a significant benefit on our ability to focus and retain information. Studying consistently and avoiding burnout involves optimizing our daily routine to align with our natural energy patterns, setting achievable goals, and taking care of our physical and mental well-being. By implementing these eleven principles, we can maintain a sustainable and effective study routine over the long term without burning out. Keep in mind that our energy levels and circumstances may change, so be flexible and be willing to adjust your study routine as needed.

Thanks in advance for your answer. Read more Add a comment Sort by: Best Open comment sort options Best Top New Controversial Old Q&A [deleted] • 7y ago The best time to study for your exams is throughout the semester. I don't mean setting aside 30 minutes every other day to study for a class, I mean actually doing the shit you are supposed to do during the semester. Paying attention in class and actually doing your homework are two things that a lot of students don't do and it hurts them more than they realize. For example, you might think doing your homework in class is pretty efficient, but it's literally the worst thing you could possibly do. You aren't really doing the homework (since you're also trying to listen to the lecture) and you aren't really understanding the lecture (since you're trying to do your homework). Always, always give your undivided attention in lecture. Reply reply [deleted] • 7y ago I agree. Don't half ass homework, and you won't have study as much. I barely studied for my vector calc midterm, and it's because I spent effort in my homework to do it all correct. It makes you retain so much info. Reply reply 1 more reply 1 more reply More replies 12 more replies 12 more replies More replies sydnee228 • 7y ago Pretty odd method, but it works for me. I make a study guide from all the material and then I copy the study guide 4-5 times. I just re-write it a few times and it works great for me. Reply reply I_Am_Simple • 7y ago I did something like this while I was in school. I would take all of my written notes from lectures and type them up into a word document. The document at midterms and finals were the greatest study materials I ever had. Reply reply 2 more replies 2 more replies More replies 4 more replies 4 more replies More replies [deleted] • 7y ago Time is one of the most important factors. If you're not putting in enough time, then it doesn't matter what technique you use. The \"6-9 hours per week for each class\" is a good rule to follow IMO, but you can get by with quite a bit less if you aren't aiming for A+ Reply reply usernamebrainfreeze • 7y ago On the flip side of that if your study methods are terrible and you end up just skimming the chapter while watching TV and stop to talk with everyone who walks by then it doesn't matter how much time you spend studying, its not going to help much. A moderate amount of quality study time is worth a mega shit ton of crappy study time. Reply reply 4 more replies 4 more replies More replies More replies Knitaplease • 7y ago Blowjobs. Definitely blowjobs. No, I had to learn how I study best. I did a lot of searching on the internet and YouTube, and I just tried different techniques until I figured it out. Some people will suggest study groups, well, I have horrible anxiety so that's not a good idea for me. Some people will recommend listening to recorded lectures. That doesn't work for me because I zone out without someone in front of me teaching the material. It is seriously just trial and error. I tried to do 2 chapters of each method. I'd study just the Powerpoints for 2 chapters, listen to the recordings for 2 chapters, take notes from the book for 2 chapters, etc. I wish I could say \"Do XYZ and you'll be golden\" but it is soooooo much more than that. Everyone is different with how they learn. Just spend some time researching techniques. Also, a big issue for me was wasting time. The Pomodoro technique (again, Google it if you've never heard of it) helped me soooooo much. Reply reply 4 more replies 4 more replies More replies phylogenik • 7y ago • Edited 7y ago I'd say the strategies most integral to my classroom/grade success historically (summa cum laude w/ a 3.9-something with bio and geo majors at a top-15 undergrad, 4.0 as a 5th year PhD ABD now) were: Understanding the material when it was presented in lecture. If there was something I didn't understand, I'd raise my hand (or shout out, depending on the mood) and ask for clarification. If after some short back-and-forth I still didn't understand, I'd chat with the instructor after class or send them (or the TA) an email. A handful of times I went in for office hours for more directed assistance. I typically did this only for higher level, conceptual things, or if what they said contradicted my earlier understanding. For simpler stuff I just made a note and looked it up on my own time. It always puzzled me how rarely people did this -- you have domain expert (a fantastic resource!) being paid to be available to you, why not use them? I'd occasionally try asking students adjacent to me if they understood something the instructor had just covered and they'd reply no -- then why not ask!? (they were not socially anxious in other contexts and were otherwise academically conscientious). This applies doubly to more discussion oriented classes (e.g. most of the philosophy classes I took). In doing this it was also important to curtail my own weakness for loquacious know-it-all argumentative show-off-iness, and only disrupt the class when I could be reasonably confident in a legitimate deficit in my own understanding that was relevant to the immediate lesson being taught. Having both instructed and TA'd several classes now I think I did a good job back when, judging by what I see in my own students -- sometimes I get one who'll derail the class with random stuff and I need to deflect and steer us back to the lesson, but almost always questions result in illuminating discussions of related tangentia or let me clarify a tricky concept that lots of people in the class are struggling with. Also good for linking lessons to things that are relevant or interesting in the students' own lives. 2) Related to the above, but when the instructor's asked a question and nobody's answered, and their eyes desperately scan the room for some bare hint of engagement -- offer up your own thoughts! Don't be shy! Even if -- especially if -- you're not certain of your answer or are insecure in your understanding of the topic. Wear your ignorance like a badge! Show it to everyone that they might more easily remove it! I found that sort of real-time feedback to be invaluable to the learning process. 3) To study for exams, I'd look through my notes from class (never really bothered with textbooks, though I would google around if I didn't understand something and skim through any supplemental, optional papers the professor tossed online; and ofc I'd use textbooks for self-study topics) and take notes on my notes, essentially condensing 30+ pages of writing into 2-3, focusing on things that I found \"surprising\" (i.e. didn't remember offhand during review). I would read these over every other night in the week leading up to the exam. Occasionally I'd carry them around with me and try to remember things from them throughout the day during downtime, e.g. waiting on an elevator. Sort of a sloppy implementation of spaced repetition. 4) Every test I took I took 3-4 times, doing my best to forget my answers from earlier rounds, and then later comparing versions and making note of any discrepancies. Caught lots of silly reading comprehension-type mistakes this way, basic math errors, etc. This is sort of a \"wisdom of the crowds\" approach except the crowds are comprised of slightly different time-displaced versions of yourself. 5) When learning new things, I'd try to integrate them into what I already knew as best I could, so that no facts or concepts would be memorized completely unconnected to anything else. I also read a lot of stuff indirectly related to whatever I was studying formally at the time, which was good for identifying connections later. I tried to make sure my understanding was the sort I could explain to someone else, or reproduce from scratch if need be (e.g. if reading about an experiment, I'd try to understand it well enough that I could replicate it and the authors' analyses myself). Basically rubber duck debugged my own miscomprehension. 6) I read essay/exam prompts carefully and asked about anything important-seeming I found ambiguous. A lot of the times the teacher's desiderata are spelled out very explicitly (and nowadays I give for everything a very detailed grading rubric) but people often avoid reading them completely. When they're not a quick email resolves ambiguities trivially. 7) Pay attention to feedback, and always seek feedback out when it's offered but not required. As an example, I'll assign students an essay, due in 5 weeks. I'll tell them (and write in the syllabus and lecture notes) that I'm happy to sit down with them and give them feedback on their essay, but the amount of feedback I give will be proportional to the amount of time left before the essay's due. If they give me a draft with four weeks to spare, I'll grade the essay completely, up to and incl. line edits, and tell them exactly what they need to do to improve it and get an A+. Two weeks out, I'm happy to read it over, let them know where they were strong and where they were weak at the paragraph resolution and what they should focus on for revisions. A day out I can give a thumbs up or thumbs down but not much more. Inevitably half the students never bother to send me any drafts, and of those that do the overwhelming majority do so in the last week. Reply reply [deleted] • 7y ago Comment deleted by user Reply reply 1 more reply 1 more reply Zegnaro • 7y ago Pay attention in class and learn how to take good notes. Buy that 6 pack of different colored highlighters and go to town with them. If your class involves reading, space it out and don't read everything at once. Take notes as you're reading, I like to use tabs. If there's a PowerPoint, ask the Prof if they can email it to you. Look at it in advance if you have access to it. Flashcards are pretty great. Dedicate a whole day to studying and take short breaks. I'd say the most important thing is to experiment with a bunch if different study techniques and see which ones work for you.

The \"6-9 hours per week for each class\" is a good rule to follow IMO, but you can get by with quite a bit less if you aren't aiming for A+ Reply reply usernamebrainfreeze • 7y ago On the flip side of that if your study methods are terrible and you end up just skimming the chapter while watching TV and stop to talk with everyone who walks by then it doesn't matter how much time you spend studying, its not going to help much. A moderate amount of quality study time is worth a mega shit ton of crappy study time. Reply reply 4 more replies 4 more replies More replies More replies Knitaplease • 7y ago Blowjobs. Definitely blowjobs. No, I had to learn how I study best. I did a lot of searching on the internet and YouTube, and I just tried different techniques until I figured it out. Some people will suggest study groups, well, I have horrible anxiety so that's not a good idea for me. Some people will recommend listening to recorded lectures. That doesn't work for me because I zone out without someone in front of me teaching the material. It is seriously just trial and error. I tried to do 2 chapters of each method. I'd study just the Powerpoints for 2 chapters, listen to the recordings for 2 chapters, take notes from the book for 2 chapters, etc. I wish I could say \"Do XYZ and you'll be golden\" but it is soooooo much more than that. Everyone is different with how they learn. Just spend some time researching techniques. Also, a big issue for me was wasting time. The Pomodoro technique (again, Google it if you've never heard of it) helped me soooooo much. Reply reply 4 more replies 4 more replies More replies phylogenik • 7y ago • Edited 7y ago I'd say the strategies most integral to my classroom/grade success historically (summa cum laude w/ a 3.9-something with bio and geo majors at a top-15 undergrad, 4.0 as a 5th year PhD ABD now) were: Understanding the material when it was presented in lecture. If there was something I didn't understand, I'd raise my hand (or shout out, depending on the mood) and ask for clarification. If after some short back-and-forth I still didn't understand, I'd chat with the instructor after class or send them (or the TA) an email. A handful of times I went in for office hours for more directed assistance. I typically did this only for higher level, conceptual things, or if what they said contradicted my earlier understanding. For simpler stuff I just made a note and looked it up on my own time. It always puzzled me how rarely people did this -- you have domain expert (a fantastic resource!) being paid to be available to you, why not use them? I'd occasionally try asking students adjacent to me if they understood something the instructor had just covered and they'd reply no -- then why not ask!? (they were not socially anxious in other contexts and were otherwise academically conscientious). This applies doubly to more discussion oriented classes (e.g. most of the philosophy classes I took). In doing this it was also important to curtail my own weakness for loquacious know-it-all argumentative show-off-iness, and only disrupt the class when I could be reasonably confident in a legitimate deficit in my own understanding that was relevant to the immediate lesson being taught. Having both instructed and TA'd several classes now I think I did a good job back when, judging by what I see in my own students -- sometimes I get one who'll derail the class with random stuff and I need to deflect and steer us back to the lesson, but almost always questions result in illuminating discussions of related tangentia or let me clarify a tricky concept that lots of people in the class are struggling with. Also good for linking lessons to things that are relevant or interesting in the students' own lives. 2) Related to the above, but when the instructor's asked a question and nobody's answered, and their eyes desperately scan the room for some bare hint of engagement -- offer up your own thoughts! Don't be shy! Even if -- especially if -- you're not certain of your answer or are insecure in your understanding of the topic. Wear your ignorance like a badge! Show it to everyone that they might more easily remove it! I found that sort of real-time feedback to be invaluable to the learning process. 3) To study for exams, I'd look through my notes from class (never really bothered with textbooks, though I would google around if I didn't understand something and skim through any supplemental, optional papers the professor tossed online; and ofc I'd use textbooks for self-study topics) and take notes on my notes, essentially condensing 30+ pages of writing into 2-3, focusing on things that I found \"surprising\" (i.e. didn't remember offhand during review). I would read these over every other night in the week leading up to the exam. Occasionally I'd carry them around with me and try to remember things from them throughout the day during downtime, e.g. waiting on an elevator. Sort of a sloppy implementation of spaced repetition. 4) Every test I took I took 3-4 times, doing my best to forget my answers from earlier rounds, and then later comparing versions and making note of any discrepancies. Caught lots of silly reading comprehension-type mistakes this way, basic math errors, etc. This is sort of a \"wisdom of the crowds\" approach except the crowds are comprised of slightly different time-displaced versions of yourself. 5) When learning new things, I'd try to integrate them into what I already knew as best I could, so that no facts or concepts would be memorized completely unconnected to anything else. I also read a lot of stuff indirectly related to whatever I was studying formally at the time, which was good for identifying connections later. I tried to make sure my understanding was the sort I could explain to someone else, or reproduce from scratch if need be (e.g. if reading about an experiment, I'd try to understand it well enough that I could replicate it and the authors' analyses myself). Basically rubber duck debugged my own miscomprehension. 6) I read essay/exam prompts carefully and asked about anything important-seeming I found ambiguous. A lot of the times the teacher's desiderata are spelled out very explicitly (and nowadays I give for everything a very detailed grading rubric) but people often avoid reading them completely. When they're not a quick email resolves ambiguities trivially. 7) Pay attention to feedback, and always seek feedback out when it's offered but not required. As an example, I'll assign students an essay, due in 5 weeks. I'll tell them (and write in the syllabus and lecture notes) that I'm happy to sit down with them and give them feedback on their essay, but the amount of feedback I give will be proportional to the amount of time left before the essay's due. If they give me a draft with four weeks to spare, I'll grade the essay completely, up to and incl. line edits, and tell them exactly what they need to do to improve it and get an A+. Two weeks out, I'm happy to read it over, let them know where they were strong and where they were weak at the paragraph resolution and what they should focus on for revisions. A day out I can give a thumbs up or thumbs down but not much more. Inevitably half the students never bother to send me any drafts, and of those that do the overwhelming majority do so in the last week. Reply reply [deleted] • 7y ago Comment deleted by user Reply reply 1 more reply 1 more reply Zegnaro • 7y ago Pay attention in class and learn how to take good notes. Buy that 6 pack of different colored highlighters and go to town with them. If your class involves reading, space it out and don't read everything at once. Take notes as you're reading, I like to use tabs. If there's a PowerPoint, ask the Prof if they can email it to you. Look at it in advance if you have access to it. Flashcards are pretty great. Dedicate a whole day to studying and take short breaks. I'd say the most important thing is to experiment with a bunch if different study techniques and see which ones work for you.
