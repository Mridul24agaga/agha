How to Overcome Social Anxiety View more Gradually sharing about yourself and learning about your new friend can help build a strong bond. Rethink your fear of rejection It’s normal to worry about whether people will like you or not. It may be encouraging to know that people often underestimate how much others like them. And when people are told to assume others like them, they actually become warmer and friendlier. Going in with the attitude that a person will like you can make you even more likable. And remember, if you don’t click with a new person, that’s OK. Not every friendship is meant to take off. Get help for social anxiety Sometimes, a mental health condition, like social anxiety disorder, can make it difficult to make new friends. Social anxiety is when you feel anxious or self-conscious around other people and fear meeting new people. If you’re struggling with these feelings, speaking with a therapist may help you overcome them. They can help you understand what’s causing your social anxiety. They can also help you practice new social skills to help overcome it. Where do adults find new friends? One of the best ways to make friends as an adult is through shared interests and activities. Here are some places where you can look for new friends to get you started. 1. Book clubs If you enjoy reading, you might find that a book club is a great place to meet new people. Visit your local library or check with nearby bookstores to see what’s available. You can also check for options online using an internet search, social media, or websites like Meetup. 2. Sports leagues and workout classes Adult sports activities — particularly those involving teams or clubs — can help improve your social life and physical health. Alternatively, a weekly Zumba or yoga class also gives you the opportunity to connect with others while enjoying a healthy, fun activity. Some sports you may want to try are: Softball Basketball Disc golf Pickleball Volleyball Flag football Tennis Soccer Even if you’re not into team sports, athletic activities that involve small groups, like golf, can also get you out and socializing. Or, if you don’t feel particularly fit or have physical limitations, there may be other activities that you might enjoy. You can consider options like playing pool or bowling. Local recreation centers like the YMCA often offer organized sports and classes. Look for these and other activities in your area. 3. Gaming groups Are you into social games like Magic: The Gathering or Dungeons & Dragons? These kinds of games can be a great way to make connections. You may be able to find in-person or online groups to play with. And local game stores and restaurants often offer organized events. Local community centers may also offer other types of games, like: Bingo Mahjong Board games Card games 4. Adult education classes Many community centers, libraries, schools, and local stores offer educational classes for adults. For example, local art leagues often hold craft or painting classes. And camera stores sometimes provide photography classes for beginners. In some areas, you can also find adult development courses, such as in cooking, languages, or woodworking. You can start by searching online for local organizations that offer classes. 5. Friendship apps Some people enjoy using platonic friendship apps to meet new people. This can be a less intimidating way to connect with others. Popular examples include Bumble BFF and Nextdoor. Some apps are even geared toward people with common interests or experiences, like Peanut, which allows people at similar stages of life to connect. Search online or in your smartphone app store to find more options. 6. Parenting groups If you have children, it may be easiest for you to connect with other parents. Many communities offer playgroups where kids can play together, while parents get to know one another. You can also search for parenting groups through local nonprofits and online. If your kids attend school, consider volunteering for school activities or joining the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA). And don’t forget to say hello to other parents during pickup times and sports meets. 7. Senior centers Older adults are some of the most likely people to experience loneliness and social isolation. But some communities offer activities specifically for older adults. Search online for community groups geared toward older people in your area. Your local community center or parks and recreation department may also offer activities geared specifically to older groups. 8. Churches or spiritual groups In many areas, churches, synagogues, and other places of worship are the most active community groups around. Ask around at your church or spiritual practice center about options to socialize with other attendees. This could include being part of a volunteering squad or a Bible study. You can also search online for local options and consider visiting other places of worship that interest you. 9. Volunteering For some, volunteering may be an ideal way to meet people with similar interests and values. You can search online for opportunities with centers and groups like these in your area: Food banks Pet shelters Political organizations Social cause groups Litter cleanup crews Afterschool centers If you need additional ideas, enter your location into the website VolunteerMatch to see what’s available near you. 10. Work friends Many people meet some of their closest friends in the workplace. It’s like when you used to make friends at school when you were a kid: When you spend 8 hours a day with people, friendships often develop automatically. Sometimes, it may take a little more work to become friendly with your colleagues. To kick things off, try asking a group of your colleagues to go out to dinner or grab coffee with you after work one day. 11. Tapping into your current social networks One of the easiest ways to make new friends is to meet your friends’ friends. Tell your friends that you’re trying to expand your social group, and ask if they know anyone you might get along with. Then, consider coordinating with your friends to set up a group hangout so you can get to know the new people. 12. Social media You can meet new friends through social media by browsing through profiles in your area (or friends of your current friends). Then, try messaging people who seem to share some of your interests. If you’re honest about your friendship goals, chances are you’ll find other people who are in the same position. There are also many social media groups that are designed to connect people with similar interests. Just remember that many adults struggle to make friends, so you’re likely to find other people looking for friends if you put yourself out there. Why is it hard to make friends as an adult? There are many reasons that adults of all ages may struggle with making or keeping friends. Potential hurdles include having: A busier schedule More responsibilities Social anxiety A tendency to be more introverted Many children socialize every day with their peers at school. However, some adults, including older adults, may be less likely to have built-in social groups. And more people have begun working remotely over the past few years. While there are many benefits to remote work, not going into an office can make it more difficult to make friends. Tips on socializing with other adults Fortunately, there are ways adults can proactively improve their social connections. Here are some tips that may help you find and start up new relationships: Look for friends who are available to spend time with you. Some people may be too busy to invest in a new relationship. So, try not to take it personally if someone doesn’t seem interested in your friendship. There are plenty of people out there looking to connect. Start by seeking out like-minded people. People with similar backgrounds and viewpoints tend to get along best. Initiate conversations and try to get to know people. This will help you find out if someone would make a good friend for you. You can start by simply smiling at someone and introducing yourself. Remember that not everyone you meet will make a compatible friend. Keep interacting with people until you find people you click with. Frequently asked questions What are the benefits of making new friends? expand_more Research shows that friendship is good for your physical and mental health. Having close friends can improve your mood and lower stress levels. People with strong social connections are more likely to live longer and experience fewer illnesses.

However, putting in the effort to build your social circle may improve your physical and emotional health. Looking for people with common interests can be a great place to start. There are a variety of activities you might try to make new connections. You can start by looking for activities, classes, and social groups in your area. Why trust our experts?

Social anxiety is when you feel anxious or self-conscious around other people and fear meeting new people. If you’re struggling with these feelings, speaking with a therapist may help you overcome them. They can help you understand what’s causing your social anxiety. They can also help you practice new social skills to help overcome it. Where do adults find new friends? One of the best ways to make friends as an adult is through shared interests and activities. Here are some places where you can look for new friends to get you started. 1. Book clubs If you enjoy reading, you might find that a book club is a great place to meet new people. Visit your local library or check with nearby bookstores to see what’s available. You can also check for options online using an internet search, social media, or websites like Meetup. 2. Sports leagues and workout classes Adult sports activities — particularly those involving teams or clubs — can help improve your social life and physical health. Alternatively, a weekly Zumba or yoga class also gives you the opportunity to connect with others while enjoying a healthy, fun activity. Some sports you may want to try are: Softball Basketball Disc golf Pickleball Volleyball Flag football Tennis Soccer Even if you’re not into team sports, athletic activities that involve small groups, like golf, can also get you out and socializing. Or, if you don’t feel particularly fit or have physical limitations, there may be other activities that you might enjoy. You can consider options like playing pool or bowling. Local recreation centers like the YMCA often offer organized sports and classes. Look for these and other activities in your area. 3. Gaming groups Are you into social games like Magic: The Gathering or Dungeons & Dragons? These kinds of games can be a great way to make connections. You may be able to find in-person or online groups to play with. And local game stores and restaurants often offer organized events. Local community centers may also offer other types of games, like: Bingo Mahjong Board games Card games 4. Adult education classes Many community centers, libraries, schools, and local stores offer educational classes for adults. For example, local art leagues often hold craft or painting classes. And camera stores sometimes provide photography classes for beginners. In some areas, you can also find adult development courses, such as in cooking, languages, or woodworking. You can start by searching online for local organizations that offer classes. 5. Friendship apps Some people enjoy using platonic friendship apps to meet new people. This can be a less intimidating way to connect with others. Popular examples include Bumble BFF and Nextdoor. Some apps are even geared toward people with common interests or experiences, like Peanut, which allows people at similar stages of life to connect. Search online or in your smartphone app store to find more options. 6. Parenting groups If you have children, it may be easiest for you to connect with other parents. Many communities offer playgroups where kids can play together, while parents get to know one another. You can also search for parenting groups through local nonprofits and online. If your kids attend school, consider volunteering for school activities or joining the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA). And don’t forget to say hello to other parents during pickup times and sports meets. 7. Senior centers Older adults are some of the most likely people to experience loneliness and social isolation. But some communities offer activities specifically for older adults. Search online for community groups geared toward older people in your area. Your local community center or parks and recreation department may also offer activities geared specifically to older groups. 8. Churches or spiritual groups In many areas, churches, synagogues, and other places of worship are the most active community groups around. Ask around at your church or spiritual practice center about options to socialize with other attendees. This could include being part of a volunteering squad or a Bible study. You can also search online for local options and consider visiting other places of worship that interest you. 9. Volunteering For some, volunteering may be an ideal way to meet people with similar interests and values. You can search online for opportunities with centers and groups like these in your area: Food banks Pet shelters Political organizations Social cause groups Litter cleanup crews Afterschool centers If you need additional ideas, enter your location into the website VolunteerMatch to see what’s available near you. 10. Work friends Many people meet some of their closest friends in the workplace. It’s like when you used to make friends at school when you were a kid: When you spend 8 hours a day with people, friendships often develop automatically. Sometimes, it may take a little more work to become friendly with your colleagues. To kick things off, try asking a group of your colleagues to go out to dinner or grab coffee with you after work one day. 11. Tapping into your current social networks One of the easiest ways to make new friends is to meet your friends’ friends. Tell your friends that you’re trying to expand your social group, and ask if they know anyone you might get along with. Then, consider coordinating with your friends to set up a group hangout so you can get to know the new people. 12. Social media You can meet new friends through social media by browsing through profiles in your area (or friends of your current friends). Then, try messaging people who seem to share some of your interests. If you’re honest about your friendship goals, chances are you’ll find other people who are in the same position. There are also many social media groups that are designed to connect people with similar interests. Just remember that many adults struggle to make friends, so you’re likely to find other people looking for friends if you put yourself out there. Why is it hard to make friends as an adult? There are many reasons that adults of all ages may struggle with making or keeping friends. Potential hurdles include having: A busier schedule More responsibilities Social anxiety A tendency to be more introverted Many children socialize every day with their peers at school. However, some adults, including older adults, may be less likely to have built-in social groups. And more people have begun working remotely over the past few years. While there are many benefits to remote work, not going into an office can make it more difficult to make friends. Tips on socializing with other adults Fortunately, there are ways adults can proactively improve their social connections. Here are some tips that may help you find and start up new relationships: Look for friends who are available to spend time with you. Some people may be too busy to invest in a new relationship. So, try not to take it personally if someone doesn’t seem interested in your friendship. There are plenty of people out there looking to connect. Start by seeking out like-minded people. People with similar backgrounds and viewpoints tend to get along best. Initiate conversations and try to get to know people. This will help you find out if someone would make a good friend for you. You can start by simply smiling at someone and introducing yourself. Remember that not everyone you meet will make a compatible friend. Keep interacting with people until you find people you click with. Frequently asked questions What are the benefits of making new friends? expand_more Research shows that friendship is good for your physical and mental health.

Here are some important things to consider that make certain activities stand out: 1. Opportunities for Social Interaction The best activities for meeting people offer ample chances to socialize, either during the activity itself or immediately after. Look for sports or fitness classes that: Include partner or team exercises Have natural breaks or downtime for conversation Encourage collaboration or friendly competition 2. Comfort and Convenience To facilitate easy connections, the activity should be: Accessible to beginners and experienced participants alike Located in a convenient setting, ideally with nearby social spaces Structured in a way that doesn't put too much pressure on performance 3. Recurring Nature Activities that happen regularly provide more opportunities to: See the same faces multiple times, allowing relationships to develop naturally Build a sense of community among participants Create a routine that integrates socializing into your fitness regimen 4. Inclusive Atmosphere The best environments for meeting new people are those that: Welcome diversity in skill levels, ages, and backgrounds Foster a supportive and encouraging community Minimize intimidation factors that might deter newcomers By considering these criteria, you'll be better equipped to choose activities that benefit your physical health and maximize your chances of making meaningful connections. In the following sections, we'll explore specific sports and activities that excel in these areas, helping you find the perfect fit for your social and fitness goals. Top Sports and Fitness Activities for Meeting New People Here, you'll find the types of sports that work well with examples and some considerations to help you pick the best option for your individual needs, whether you're looking for an accountability partner, fitness date ideas, or sports to make new friends over. 1. Individual Sports with Social Aspects Individual sports that offer social interaction opportunities are excellent for meeting new people. Sports like golf, tennis, badminton, and pickleball provide one-on-one or small-group interactions, allowing plenty of time for conversation. These activities attract a wide age range and can be played both casually or competitively. However, it's worth noting that some of these activities can be expensive or weather-dependent. Summary: Best for fitness dates and finding accountability partners. The one-on-one nature of these sports allows for deeper conversations and personal connections. 2. Team Sports Team sports naturally foster camaraderie and provide ample opportunities for social interaction, making them excellent for building friendships and teamwork skills. Volleyball, basketball, and soccer are prime examples of team sports that can help you meet new people. Keep in mind that participating in team sports may require a consistent time commitment. Summary: Ideal for making new friends and expanding your social circle. The team dynamic creates a natural environment for forming bonds with multiple people at once. 3. Outdoor Activities Outdoor activities are highly accessible and allow for flexible pacing alongside beautiful scenery, which can serve as great conversation starters. Hiking, running, and cycling are popular choices in this category. While these activities are excellent for meeting people, they can be weather-dependent and may require travel to suitable locations. Summary: Great for fitness dates and finding accountability partners. The relaxed pace and natural surroundings provide ample opportunity for conversation and shared experiences. 4. Fitness Classes Regular fitness classes help foster a sense of community and cater to various fitness levels and interests. Group fitness classes such as spinning, HIIT, bootcamp, CrossFit, and calisthenics, are great options. These classes offer structured environments for meeting like-minded individuals, though they can sometimes be intimidating for newcomers. Summary: Excellent for finding accountability partners and making new friends. The regular schedule and shared goals create a supportive environment for forming connections. 5. Adventure Sports Adventure sports encourage teamwork and trust-building, often involving group excursions that create shared experiences. Rock climbing, bouldering, kayaking, and canoeing are excellent examples of adventure sports that can help you meet new people. Keep in mind that these activities may require specialized equipment. But for example, indoor bouldering is a beginner friendly activity where most gyms provide you with all the equipment you need. Summary: Perfect for sweat dates and making new friends. The exciting nature of these activities creates memorable shared experiences, fostering stronger connections. 6. Martial Arts and Combat Sports Martial arts and combat sports build confidence and discipline while often involving partner work. They foster a strong sense of community in many dojos. Karate, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and boxing are popular choices in this category. However, these sports can be intense for beginners. Summary: Ideal for finding accountability partners and making new friends. The discipline and partner work involved naturally create strong bonds and mutual respect. 7. Dance and Rhythmic Activities Dance and rhythmic activities, especially partner dances, are inherently social. They provide a fun and energetic atmosphere while improving coordination. Salsa, Zumba, and ballroom dancing are great examples of these activities. Some people may feel self-conscious at first, but the social nature of these activities often helps overcome initial hesitation. Summary: Excellent for fitness dates and making new friends. The close interaction and fun atmosphere make these activities perfect for breaking the ice and forming connections. 8. Water Sports Water sports offer low-impact activities suitable for all ages and fitness levels. They provide refreshing and enjoyable experiences, especially in summer. Swimming, water aerobics, and surfing are popular water sports for meeting new people. While these activities are great for socializing, keep in mind that there may be limited conversation during actual swimming. Summary: Good for making new friends and finding accountability partners. The refreshing nature of water sports creates a positive environment for bonding, especially during pre and post-activity interactions. 9. Winter Sports Seasonal activities like winter sports offer a unique way to meet people, especially at resorts or local rinks. Skiing, snowboarding, and ice skating are excellent options for winter enthusiasts. However, these activities have seasonal limitations and can be expensive. Summary: Great for sweat dates and making new friends. The seasonal nature and resort settings provide a fun, vacation-like atmosphere conducive to forming connections. 10. Mind-Body Practices Mind-body practices promote mindfulness and stress relief, offering opportunities for partner work and group sessions. Yoga, Tai Chi, Qigong, and Acro Yoga are popular choices in this category. While these practices are great for meeting like-minded individuals, some may find them too quiet for extensive socializing. Summary: Best for finding accountability partners and potentially for fitness dates. The focus on mindfulness and self-improvement creates a supportive environment for forming meaningful connections. 4. How to Find People to Meet Through Sports and Fitness Activities Depending on your situation, you might be looking to do the friend-finding during the activities themselves or set up sweat dates beforehand. Here are some tips whether you're going solo or pre-arranging sweaty meet-ups. Going Solo When venturing out on your own to meet new people through sports and fitness, consider these key tips: Choose classes or events that match your interests and skill level Arrive early to strike up conversations before the activity begins Be open and approachable; smile and maintain positive body language Introduce yourself to people nearby before or after the activity Offer help or ask for assistance to initiate interactions Compliment others on their performance or effort Join post-activity social gatherings if available And for more in-depth tips, read our article on how to make friends at the gym the right way.

But for example, indoor bouldering is a beginner friendly activity where most gyms provide you with all the equipment you need. Summary: Perfect for sweat dates and making new friends. The exciting nature of these activities creates memorable shared experiences, fostering stronger connections. 6. Martial Arts and Combat Sports Martial arts and combat sports build confidence and discipline while often involving partner work. They foster a strong sense of community in many dojos. Karate, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and boxing are popular choices in this category. However, these sports can be intense for beginners. Summary: Ideal for finding accountability partners and making new friends. The discipline and partner work involved naturally create strong bonds and mutual respect. 7. Dance and Rhythmic Activities Dance and rhythmic activities, especially partner dances, are inherently social. They provide a fun and energetic atmosphere while improving coordination. Salsa, Zumba, and ballroom dancing are great examples of these activities. Some people may feel self-conscious at first, but the social nature of these activities often helps overcome initial hesitation. Summary: Excellent for fitness dates and making new friends. The close interaction and fun atmosphere make these activities perfect for breaking the ice and forming connections. 8. Water Sports Water sports offer low-impact activities suitable for all ages and fitness levels. They provide refreshing and enjoyable experiences, especially in summer. Swimming, water aerobics, and surfing are popular water sports for meeting new people. While these activities are great for socializing, keep in mind that there may be limited conversation during actual swimming. Summary: Good for making new friends and finding accountability partners. The refreshing nature of water sports creates a positive environment for bonding, especially during pre and post-activity interactions. 9. Winter Sports Seasonal activities like winter sports offer a unique way to meet people, especially at resorts or local rinks. Skiing, snowboarding, and ice skating are excellent options for winter enthusiasts. However, these activities have seasonal limitations and can be expensive. Summary: Great for sweat dates and making new friends. The seasonal nature and resort settings provide a fun, vacation-like atmosphere conducive to forming connections. 10. Mind-Body Practices Mind-body practices promote mindfulness and stress relief, offering opportunities for partner work and group sessions. Yoga, Tai Chi, Qigong, and Acro Yoga are popular choices in this category. While these practices are great for meeting like-minded individuals, some may find them too quiet for extensive socializing. Summary: Best for finding accountability partners and potentially for fitness dates. The focus on mindfulness and self-improvement creates a supportive environment for forming meaningful connections. 4. How to Find People to Meet Through Sports and Fitness Activities Depending on your situation, you might be looking to do the friend-finding during the activities themselves or set up sweat dates beforehand. Here are some tips whether you're going solo or pre-arranging sweaty meet-ups. Going Solo When venturing out on your own to meet new people through sports and fitness, consider these key tips: Choose classes or events that match your interests and skill level Arrive early to strike up conversations before the activity begins Be open and approachable; smile and maintain positive body language Introduce yourself to people nearby before or after the activity Offer help or ask for assistance to initiate interactions Compliment others on their performance or effort Join post-activity social gatherings if available And for more in-depth tips, read our article on how to make friends at the gym the right way.

In youth, socialization was a daily part of our routine. We went to school, surrounded by peers. Our parents put us in after school programs, summer camps, and sports leagues with other kids. Then we graduated into the working class, commuting to an office every day. We interacted with our coworkers and business partners, attending post-work happy hours. But now many of us work from home. We can go days without speaking to another human in person. Many of us live semi-nomadic lives, working remotely from different cities throughout the year. And so do our friends. It’s hard to know who’s in town to hang. Then the babies come. It’s more difficult to find time to spend time with friends that have children. Parents have even more responsibilities that eat into their weekends. Impromptu hangs are almost impossible when hiring a sitter is required. It’s easy to live in isolation. We’re more connected online than ever before, yet loneliness is abundant. As much as I love the internet and its ability to bring people together, we’re biologically wired for IRL human connection and many aren’t getting it. So, what’s the solution? Social sports. Or at least, it might help. Social sports are activities you can do with friends or strangers (aka future friends). They’re a Schelling point that minimizes coordination effort, a filter for people with likeminded interests, and an ice breaker for the socially anxious. Examples of social sports Technically nearly every sport could be social, but some are better suited for connecting with others and adaptable to varying skill levels. Here’s a far-from-comprehensive list[1] of social sports: Running Cycling Golf Padel, Tennis, Pickleball Rock Climbing, Bouldering Basketball, Soccer, Baseball Skiing, Snowboarding Surfing Recently I got into rock climbing and bouldering[2], a sport that’s uniquely single and multiplayer. Sometimes I go to the gym solo and end up striking up a conversation with another climber. Climbing culture is very welcoming and positive as people co-conspire strategies for scaling a wall. Sometimes I go with friends. Unlike some sports like golf, climbing is very accessible. If you’ve climbed a tree as a child, you can crush a v0 bouldering Your CTA If you’re feeling isolated, looking for new things to do with friends, or want to meet new people, pickup a social sport. Join a basketball league. Participate in a run club. Organize a Sunday morning cycle crew. Get a membership to a rock climbing gym. Start a padel players group chat for your city.

However, moving to a new city or town may feel a little intimidating if you don’t know very many people. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to make friends in your new location. If you’re looking for some tips on how to do so on your next travel nurse assignment, follow our ideas below. 1. Volunteer in the community As a nurse, there is no doubt you already love to give back. When you have a passion for giving back, it is easy to find others who share that passion. Find the perfect volunteer opportunity for you on VolunteerMatch.org by entering your city and your areas of interest. 2. Join an amateur sports team Whether you are highly athletic or just enjoy having fun, there is a sports league for you. From competitive softball to flag football, to “just for fun” dodgeball leagues, sports leagues create great ways to meet new friends in new cities. 3. Join a gym and try an exercise class Working in patient care, it can be easy to forget about your own health and well-being. Joining a gym and trying a class is a great way to stay fit and get social. You may find something you really enjoy, and a new workout partner could become a friend outside the gym as well. 4. Join a dance class You don’t need to be an experienced dancer to join a class! If you enjoy great music and staying active, dance classes provide one of the best ways to meet new friends. 5. Run a local road race Races and running clubs offer fun ways to meet new friends, see your town from a new perspective, and break a sweat. 6. Join your local Chamber of Commerce or a Professional Networking Group If you own your own business, joining the Chamber of Commerce is a highly effective way to meet new people and build a network of referrals. If you don’t own your own business, networking events are the number one way to meet people in a travel nursing profession. 7. Join a religious group or cultural club Becoming active in a local church, synagogue or mosque will ensure that you engage with a community of like-minded people who will support you. If religion isn’t for you, but you have strong ties to your culture, consider seeking out the local club or chapter that represents your culture in your city. 8. Join a wine club If you enjoy a nice glass of wine and good conversation, it won’t be hard to make new friends in a wine club. Many cities have wine clubs that tour the local wine bars and wineries (where applicable). Learn more about wine and make friends on the journey! 9. Join a book club Unwind with a new book each month and join a club where you can find new friends and enjoy a discussion. Finding the right book club is easy with websites like My Coffee and Book Club. 10. Join a sports team fan club Do you love your team? You aren’t alone! Chances are there are others in your city who also love them. Joining a fan club is one of the great ways to meet friends online! The easiest way to find these clubs is through your team’s official website. 11. Take your dog to the park If you love dogs and the outdoors, taking your dog to the dog park is definitely one of the best ways to meet new friends. No dog parks nearby? Walk your dog in a popular place like downtown where there will be a lot of people around. 12. Go to the beach or lake You spend a lot of time in healthcare facilities as a travel nurse, so go enjoy the sunshine at a beach or lake when you can! Spending time at the beach or lake is a fun activity by yourself, but it creates lots of opportunities to meet new friends. Consider taking a water-based class like paddleboarding or snorkeling and use these activities to meet friends. 13. Join local Facebook Groups One of the best ways to meet friends online is to join Facebook Groups. There are so many groups you can join to find other people with similar interests. Maybe you want to find fellow travelers that are in the area temporarily or a local who can show you fun activities to do on the weekends. Just use the search bar at the top of the home page and select “groups” to narrow down results to your liking. Use the search bar at the top of the home page and select “groups” to narrow down results to your liking. 14. Go to bars with events like Trivia Night If you enjoy a competitive round of trivia, consider making new friends by joining a team at a local bar or brewery. 15. Visit a museum, zoo, aquarium or national park Spending time at one of these public places can be a great way to enjoy the day and meet new friends who share similar interests. 16. Go to a local music, food or art festival Festivals are very communal, centered around having fun, and often include group activities like games, competitions, and demonstrations that will encourage interaction with others. 17. Take a foreign language class Learning a new language is a fantastic way to continue your education and open yourself up to a new culture. Learning in a group setting makes it easy to form new connections, but it can also be a great way to meet friends online. 18. Shop at local businesses Spending time in the local boutiques and restaurants in your town creates opportunities to meet other members of the community who also “shop local” and could become shopping buddies. 19. Go to a farmer’s market Many towns offer monthly farmer’s markets full of great produce and local products. Like shopping locally, farmer’s markets create a fun way to support your community and surround yourself with neighbors who are interested in doing the same. 20. Take a local brewery tour In addition to great beer, these breweries often offer tours and classes, making them a great place to meet new people and have fun. 21. Join MeetUp.com Perhaps one of the very best ways to meet new friends is to join MeetUp.com. This online forum allows you to enter your city and interest to view endless numbers of “meetups” near you. Try Something That Interests You Adjusting to a new city can be difficult, but always remember that you’re not alone!

Skip to content Menu Menu Book Articles Core Concepts How to Host a Party Party Name Tags How to Do Icebreakers Guest Bios Party Reminder Messages Collect RSVPs Party Supplies List Who To Invite to Your First Party Categories Articles » Tutorials , How To Make New Friends: Tips and Tricks Last updated: November 12, 2024 Hey! My name is Nick Gray and I will teach you how to make friends, meet new people, and even build big relationships. Making new friends can be challenging, but it can also be transformative. It certainly was for me. My friends motivate and inspire me, offer support, and even played a role in starting my last business. Whether you’ve relocated to a new city, begun a new job, or simply want to expand your social circle, there is plenty of advice online on how to make new friends. However, I’m going to share a few unconventional ideas you might not have thought of, including: Joining a sports league. Discover the best sports for making new friends. Exploring local clubs. Learn where to find listings for these. Guided tours. This unexpected idea really works! Find out why. And many more tips! I’ve tried this advice with numerous people who have gone on to meet countless new friends and acquaintances. If you want to jump straight to the heart of meeting new people, I can summarize my advice like this: “If you want to meet interesting people, you have to do interesting things.” In addition to common tropes like joining a sports club or attending a church event, I’ll also give you some non-traditional ideas for where and how you can meet new people. I’ll show you how to make it easy, how to make it fun, and then how to make the types of friends who inspire and encourage you. Why you should trust me: I moved to New York City hardly knowing anyone. I wasn’t outgoing, socially confident, and I definitely didn’t know how to host a party. Over the last 15 years I’ve met thousands of people and hosted hundreds of parties to build big relationships. I wrote this article and interviewed several others who have used these techniques to meet new friends, best friends, and even boosted their careers. Keep reading to see our best tips. Table of Contents Toggle Why Making New Friends is Important Ways to Make New Friends Join a Club or Organization Find an Online Group (and Where) Special Interests and Hobbies Guided Tours, Especially When Traveling Talk to Your Co-workers or Neighbors More Places to Meet New Friends Host a 2-Hour Cocktail Party Conclusion Why Making New Friends is Important Making new friends can help you in a variety of different ways. You can learn how to meet new people and make friends. When you do, you’ll get invited to more events, have a greater sense of community, and generally be happier. Science backs this up: studies show that as we get older, we need more friends to stay connected in our community. Making friends is a crucial skill that is not taught in school. It can be scary and uncomfortable, but once you know what to do it is exciting and worthwhile! Ways to Make New Friends I’ll outline and describe each of these techniques below: Join a Club or Organization Find an Online Group (and Where) Special Interests and Hobbies Guided Tours, Especially When Traveling Talk to Your Co-workers or Neighbors More Places to Meet New Friends Host a 2-Hour Cocktail Party or happy hour Pro tip: You need to break the ice in order to build new connections. Take a look at these questions that you can ask when you meet someone interesting. Join a Club or Organization Get involved in any activity that matters to you. It is where you’re most likely to meet people with similar values and interests as you. Clubs are excuses for people to hang out with each other consistently. Some examples of clubs are: Book club Gym or exercise class Country clubs and Golf resorts Rec sports like kickball Yoga studios Foodie clubs Ski clubs Pro tip: Kickball is the best sport to play for making friends because the teams are large, and you’ll spend half the time hanging out in the dugout altogether. Organizations are more purpose-driven. They are a great way to make a difference and create new friends who have similar interests as you. Some examples of organizations are local committees, local non-profits, and language classes. Find an Online Group (and Where) You can find online communities around your passions. List some of your favorite hobbies and activities. Then search online to find groups about those things. I find that the best place to look for these online groups is discord channels, slack communities, Facebook, and forums. Where To Find Local Communities Meetup.com has a surplus of small local events that you can go to. Toastmasters is another one that literally forces you to speak to new people. Facebook groups that have consistent events. Event boards and newsletters. Special Interests and Hobbies Ask yourself these two questions: What do you do with your free time already? How can you go to areas filled with other people doing this same activity? For example, if you love yoga and you always practice at home with YouTube videos by yourself, you should sign up for a yoga studio. Many have complimentary sample or trial memberships. Or find a nearby park where locals host their own yoga classes. Barb in Florida suggests visiting some galleries. Their daughter, Rachel, shared her strategy and “cheat code” for meeting new people in any new area. Attending art gallery shows often host receptions with refreshments and hors d’oeuvres. A perfect life hack to meet new people in the area and get free food and drinks while you’re at it. Guided Tours, Especially When Traveling The point of traveling is to experience a new part of the world. And the best way to get a more immersive experience in an area is to take a tour. You get to surround yourself with people who are traveling just like you. This is a perfect opportunity to connect with people and make new friends. Here are a few tours that you might find on Airbnb Experiences, TripAdvisor, Yelp, or elsewhere: Art tours Museums National parks Food tours Boat tours Bus tours Talk to Your Co-workers or Neighbors Make sure to talk to them about their interests, their hobbies, and whatever else seems important to them. Since every human being’s favorite subject is themselves, it makes it really easy to connect with someone by talking about their passions. My friend, Sujan, did something genius! He printed out friendly family flyers and put them in everyone’s mailbox in his suburban neighborhood. It’s not a core group in the traditional sense, but it still got him enough RSVPs to have the confidence to invite more people to his first gathering. More Places to Meet New Friends Here are some more suggestions from people who read early drafts of my book: “Look at organizations for ex-pats like InterNations. They have groups in over four hundred cities. I find ex-pats can be more open to connecting. Unlike locals, they don’t have established networks and might have just moved to a city.” —Judhajit De “I have invited a few very distant relatives that live in town to parties. For example, my mother-in-law’s cousin’s daughter. She’s someone I met once at a big family event, seemed cool, and it turned out we could be friends in addition to extremely distant in-laws.” —Alex Gates “For women looking to meet new friends, try the Bumble app and use the Bumble BFF setting. It’s a great way to connect. I met a number of new people using it and invited them to my parties.” —Gena Stanley “Join a recreational sports league in your area. I play on soccer teams and have made many friends over the years. My own Party Pro Tip: To maximize the opportunity of meeting people, play kickball because that sport has the largest teams.” —Seth Hanes “Reach out to people from your yoga, boxing, or gym classes. Invite the coaches and instructors too.” —Rui Zhang Host a 2-Hour Cocktail Party Now that you’ve made a bunch of new friends or met several new people, it is time to connect them all. Hosting a party can be a great way to deepen your relationships and make new friends. Ask your five closest friends if they are available to meet up on a specific day. They will form the “Core Group” of your party attendees. The best time frame is three weeks away. I suggest hosting your party on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday night since it will be easier for people to attend. Pro tip: Learn more about hosting a cocktail party here.

Once you start using these tips and techniques, it’ll become much easier to make new friends. I hope that I’ve convinced you of the benefits of hosting a small party, too.

More about how to meet people which is a needed start to make friends. But how do you turn chatting with someone at a yoga class into a friendship? There is a long distance between going to an event and having a real circle of friends that goes deeper than quaffing beers and pretzels after a kickball game. Reply Nick Gray November 5, 2024 at 09:26 Hey, thanks for reading! You’re absolutely right—there’s a big difference between just chatting at an event and building a real friendship. A good next step after meeting someone is to follow up casually, like sending a quick message about something you both enjoyed or even planning to meet up for another activity you’re both into (maybe grabbing coffee after the next yoga class). From there, it’s about finding shared interests or values. Do stuff that naturally brings you together more regularly—it could be joining the same class, grabbing lunch every so often, or even introducing them to other friends if things click. That’s when things start to go deeper and feel like a genuine circle of friends rather than just acquaintances.

My name is Nick Gray and I will teach you how to make friends, meet new people, and even build big relationships. Making new friends can be challenging, but it can also be transformative. It certainly was for me. My friends motivate and inspire me, offer support, and even played a role in starting my last business. Whether you’ve relocated to a new city, begun a new job, or simply want to expand your social circle, there is plenty of advice online on how to make new friends. However, I’m going to share a few unconventional ideas you might not have thought of, including: Joining a sports league. Discover the best sports for making new friends. Exploring local clubs. Learn where to find listings for these. Guided tours. This unexpected idea really works! Find out why. And many more tips! I’ve tried this advice with numerous people who have gone on to meet countless new friends and acquaintances. If you want to jump straight to the heart of meeting new people, I can summarize my advice like this: “If you want to meet interesting people, you have to do interesting things.” In addition to common tropes like joining a sports club or attending a church event, I’ll also give you some non-traditional ideas for where and how you can meet new people. I’ll show you how to make it easy, how to make it fun, and then how to make the types of friends who inspire and encourage you. Why you should trust me: I moved to New York City hardly knowing anyone. I wasn’t outgoing, socially confident, and I definitely didn’t know how to host a party. Over the last 15 years I’ve met thousands of people and hosted hundreds of parties to build big relationships. I wrote this article and interviewed several others who have used these techniques to meet new friends, best friends, and even boosted their careers. Keep reading to see our best tips. Table of Contents Toggle Why Making New Friends is Important Ways to Make New Friends Join a Club or Organization Find an Online Group (and Where) Special Interests and Hobbies Guided Tours, Especially When Traveling Talk to Your Co-workers or Neighbors More Places to Meet New Friends Host a 2-Hour Cocktail Party Conclusion Why Making New Friends is Important Making new friends can help you in a variety of different ways. You can learn how to meet new people and make friends. When you do, you’ll get invited to more events, have a greater sense of community, and generally be happier. Science backs this up: studies show that as we get older, we need more friends to stay connected in our community. Making friends is a crucial skill that is not taught in school. It can be scary and uncomfortable, but once you know what to do it is exciting and worthwhile! Ways to Make New Friends I’ll outline and describe each of these techniques below: Join a Club or Organization Find an Online Group (and Where) Special Interests and Hobbies Guided Tours, Especially When Traveling Talk to Your Co-workers or Neighbors More Places to Meet New Friends Host a 2-Hour Cocktail Party or happy hour Pro tip: You need to break the ice in order to build new connections. Take a look at these questions that you can ask when you meet someone interesting. Join a Club or Organization Get involved in any activity that matters to you. It is where you’re most likely to meet people with similar values and interests as you. Clubs are excuses for people to hang out with each other consistently. Some examples of clubs are: Book club Gym or exercise class Country clubs and Golf resorts Rec sports like kickball Yoga studios Foodie clubs Ski clubs Pro tip: Kickball is the best sport to play for making friends because the teams are large, and you’ll spend half the time hanging out in the dugout altogether. Organizations are more purpose-driven. They are a great way to make a difference and create new friends who have similar interests as you. Some examples of organizations are local committees, local non-profits, and language classes. Find an Online Group (and Where) You can find online communities around your passions. List some of your favorite hobbies and activities. Then search online to find groups about those things. I find that the best place to look for these online groups is discord channels, slack communities, Facebook, and forums. Where To Find Local Communities Meetup.com has a surplus of small local events that you can go to. Toastmasters is another one that literally forces you to speak to new people. Facebook groups that have consistent events. Event boards and newsletters. Special Interests and Hobbies Ask yourself these two questions: What do you do with your free time already? How can you go to areas filled with other people doing this same activity? For example, if you love yoga and you always practice at home with YouTube videos by yourself, you should sign up for a yoga studio. Many have complimentary sample or trial memberships. Or find a nearby park where locals host their own yoga classes. Barb in Florida suggests visiting some galleries. Their daughter, Rachel, shared her strategy and “cheat code” for meeting new people in any new area. Attending art gallery shows often host receptions with refreshments and hors d’oeuvres. A perfect life hack to meet new people in the area and get free food and drinks while you’re at it. Guided Tours, Especially When Traveling The point of traveling is to experience a new part of the world. And the best way to get a more immersive experience in an area is to take a tour. You get to surround yourself with people who are traveling just like you. This is a perfect opportunity to connect with people and make new friends. Here are a few tours that you might find on Airbnb Experiences, TripAdvisor, Yelp, or elsewhere: Art tours Museums National parks Food tours Boat tours Bus tours Talk to Your Co-workers or Neighbors Make sure to talk to them about their interests, their hobbies, and whatever else seems important to them. Since every human being’s favorite subject is themselves, it makes it really easy to connect with someone by talking about their passions. My friend, Sujan, did something genius! He printed out friendly family flyers and put them in everyone’s mailbox in his suburban neighborhood. It’s not a core group in the traditional sense, but it still got him enough RSVPs to have the confidence to invite more people to his first gathering. More Places to Meet New Friends Here are some more suggestions from people who read early drafts of my book: “Look at organizations for ex-pats like InterNations. They have groups in over four hundred cities. I find ex-pats can be more open to connecting. Unlike locals, they don’t have established networks and might have just moved to a city.” —Judhajit De “I have invited a few very distant relatives that live in town to parties. For example, my mother-in-law’s cousin’s daughter. She’s someone I met once at a big family event, seemed cool, and it turned out we could be friends in addition to extremely distant in-laws.” —Alex Gates “For women looking to meet new friends, try the Bumble app and use the Bumble BFF setting.

Do you have any suggestions on local groups, leagues, clubs, events, etc? I am open to almost anything - sports (softball, dodgeball..), classes (cooking, painting, sewing, music..), outdoor (running, fishing, hiking...), bar leagues (corn hole, darts..), art shows, wine/food events, etc. Is there a good resource that aggregates info on this (other than AOA of course)? We suspect moving here from a really big metro area -- especially one like NYC or San Francisco or Seattle -- takes a bit of an adjustment in terms of finding the sort of stuff Brian's looking for. Sure, there's a smaller number of total options and the range is maybe not as wide. But there is plenty of stuff to do around here -- it's just that, unlike one of those big metros, you maybe have to put a bit more effort into finding them. It sounds like Brian's looking for some specific suggestions, and if you have some, great. But we're also curious about more general strategies you might have. Maybe you can share a little bit about your own experiences finding your niche or crowd here. It could be a big help to Brian and other people who move here. Please share! photo: Andy Kainz Photography 30 comments tags: Capital Region, moving here Comments When I was new to the area I used Meetup.com. There are lots of groups in the capital district for all types of activities. As with any large group of people, you have to weed through some strange ones to find your buddies but it makes for great stories. ... said Chrissy on Mar 5, 2014 at 10:58 AM | link Albany Running Exchange! ... said boy3706 on Mar 5, 2014 at 11:12 AM | link Become a member worker at the Honest Weight Food Co-op. You'll meet a wide range of people there. You can work a weekly or monthly shift, depending on how much time you've got. In general I've found there is more potential for developing friendships when you interact with a group regularly than events that are one shots. Also anything interactive instead of just being in an audience will yield more social contacts. ... said chrisck on Mar 5, 2014 at 11:38 AM | link Get a dog! Getting a dog helped me meet my neighbors and gave me a reason to really get to know them through dog park hang outs. Though I got the dog because I wanted a dog, not friends. Also volunteer and get involved. Albany Barn needs docents and volunteers. Capital District Community Gardens needs volunteers (speaking of - community gardening helped me get to know lots of people who live near me). ... said Jenna on Mar 5, 2014 at 11:46 AM | link Get a dog and walk it multiple times a day! Great way to get exercise and meet your neighbors. ... said Wendy (Troy) on Mar 5, 2014 at 11:51 AM | link Check out live music! The Low Beat, Pauly's Hotel, Fuller Roadhouse, The Linda are just some smaller venues for great music. The Egg, The Pepsi, The Palace are bigger venues! First Friday events in Albs to see art! Last Friday in Troy! Farmer's Markets all over the place! Cooking classes at Different Drummer's Kitchen! When it's warmer: Larkfest, TulipFest, Empire State Plaza Events Food Swaps in Troy and Albs! And that's just a few things... ... said Nic on Mar 5, 2014 at 12:09 PM | link Many local bars do trivia nights (check out City Beer Hall, Center Square Pub, Graneys, Juniors, Suzies, etc.), and this may be a good way to meet people. ... said tryit on Mar 5, 2014 at 12:14 PM | link not just a shameless plug -- the albany all stars roller derby league is a super nice group of people (not just ladies- we have refs and volunteers of all kinds!) there is also the capital district trauma authority, a men's league that skates out of the armory as well. there is also a curling club in the area which is quite popular, Albany Scenario paintball club, and darts leagues at a lot of the area bars. You might also want to check out the Albany Society for the Advancement of philanthropy- they hold events throughout the year, not just the speedo sprint. ... said Amelia on Mar 5, 2014 at 12:39 PM | link Check out any events that http://albanysociety.org/ might throw. Lionheart has a fun dart league. I ended up joining a random team that needed teammates one year. Food swaps are pretty great too. ... said Lola on Mar 5, 2014 at 12:59 PM | link There are a couple places that do dart leagues - Lionheart has mixed leagues and a women's league, Wolff's Biergarten did, might still have one too. I would encourage checking out Ultimate (frisbee) this spring/summer, http://albanyultimate.com runs 3 summer leagues (social, competitive, women's) and it's a sport that I've found to be great exercise, and very fun. The people are very inclusive & helpful and the sport is self-officiated with \"spirit of the game\" mentality. Do what you like, and look the part / show it off. There are lots of passionate people and if you're identifiable about some common interest it's more likely to create an interaction. If you're having trouble finding something, take a little initiative and try to start something. Running anything will leave you no choice but to get to know new people. And if it turns out your idea exists already, you can link up with the existing crew. ... said Jeff D on Mar 5, 2014 at 1:06 PM | link To echo some of the previous suggestions, ARE, Farmer's Markets and classes at both the Different Drummer't Kitchen and the Co-op are all great! I can also suggest the Albany Chapter of the ADK Mountain Club and the Albany Vegan and Vegetarian Meetup Group. Troy Night out is always a blast with a wide range of activities downtown. ... said Jona on Mar 5, 2014 at 1:06 PM | link Ladies (natives and those who are new to Rensselaer County like I am) are welcome to check out the Junior League of Troy. We are a group of volunteers dedicated to improving childhood literacy. I moved to Troy two years ago and have met several new friends through the Junior League. I really enjoy helping my new community and enjoy giving children's books away to young people. I love reading and the excited looks on their face make me feel so happy! We are in the middle of a project that will install bookcases full of books for the children of Vanderheyden Hall in Wynantskill. Volunteers also encourage parents to read to their children. Visit the website for more details : http://www.jltroy.org ... said Kathleen Lisson on Mar 5, 2014 at 1:08 PM | link Playing kickball has increased my social circle in Albany from decently sized to huge. Spring and Summer leagues are usually a full 16 teams with 18-24 members, and hanging out at the sponsor bar afterwards helps you meet people beyond your team. I think last year we had over 300 people in the spring league. Www.kickball.com ... said Tim on Mar 5, 2014 at 1:10 PM | link Softball leagues will be starting in the next couple of months. Andy's on New Scotland Ave and Lynn's Uptown Tavern on Colvin both host large leagues. I know that Lynn's has a mechanism for matching individuals with teams who need players and I assume Andy's does, too. Afrim's has a ton of soccer leagues and I believe they have hosted dodgeball tournaments before, too. ... said Sharon on Mar 5, 2014 at 1:13 PM | link softball or kickball leagues.....great way to meet people Beer Bingo at City Beer Hall ... said jen on Mar 5, 2014 at 1:24 PM | link First, go to Moveable Feast!

It's Saturday, 3/29 and worth every penny. http://www.historic-albany.org/feast.html (If you can't make it to this event I definitely recommend Historic Albany Foundation's fall event called BUILT.)

If you like it, there are lots of leagues you can join. Fun game, and a lot of good people. ... said Jon In Albany on Mar 5, 2014 at 3:58 PM | link There are a number of good suggestions above. I agree with those recommending the dart leagues at the Lionheart. I know they have a Wednesday night league as well as a Monday night league, and might also still have a women's league (I know they did in the past). The Wednesday night league is usually a lot of fun and has a handicap system so you don't have to be a dart master to play (though there are many talented players in it). The Monday night league is a bit smaller, but I've heard that it's also a good time. And I would also second the recommendation to look into groups on Meetup.com. If you like hiking, nature walks and/or snowshoeing the Hiking Mates of the Capital Region is a really good meetup group based in the Albany area; there are local kayaking meetup groups; the Capital Region Volunteers is a meetup group whose members participate in various volunteer activities around the region; and the Hudson Valley Hikers is a great group for hiking, camping, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, etc. (they are based a bit further downstate in the Hudson Valley, but they do a lot of stuff in the Catskills and Adirondacks). There are many other Meetup groups catering to various other interests, as well. ... said KJS on Mar 5, 2014 at 6:16 PM | link If Volleyball is your thing then check out the \"OCC\" club at the Polish Community Center in Albany. If you get in touch with the organizer and say you're looking for a team, they might know of a team looking for a player. Or, just go there on Wednesday nights, which is the pick-up night. If you're halfway decent, people will let you know about other pick up opportunities (Clifton Park/Delmar/Niskyuna...) that are more ad-hoc. During the indoor season, I recommend the Bethlehem Parks and Rec Club - three different levels on three different nights, and no need to form your own team. ... said Jessica R on Mar 5, 2014 at 6:31 PM | link When I first moved to town, I almost immediately started volunteering with a local theater - working backstage, the ticket booth, pretty much whatever was needed. Met amazing people I'm still friends with today and it opened up a huge community of like-minded people to me. And any of the community theaters are always looking for volunteers of all sorts, not just actors, if that's your thing at all! ... said Amy on Mar 5, 2014 at 7:39 PM | link Empire state kickball league. It is owned and run by a local who draws a lot of fun and interesting people. It is competitive but also really fun and a great way to meet new people (you can sign up and be put on a team as a free agent). Sponsored by lark tavern so free pitchers, cheap food and trivia after the games. Highly recommend it! The spring season starts in April. you would be surprised how many kickball enthusiasts there are in the area.

      "title": "New to the area, how to meet people and find activities? | All Over Albany All Over Albany People Food Stuff To Do Maps Archive Feeds About New to the area, how to meet people and find activities? posted Mar 5, 2014 Ask AOA Brian emails: I recently moved to Albany from Manhattan and I am looking to get involved in the area and meet new people. Do you have any suggestions on local groups, leagues, clubs, events, etc? I am open to almost anything - sports (softball, dodgeball..), classes (cooking, painting, sewing, music..), outdoor (running, fishing, hiking...), bar leagues (corn hole, darts..), art shows, wine/food events, etc. Is there a good resource that aggregates info on this (other than AOA of course)? We suspect moving here from a really big metro area -- especially one like NYC or San Francisco or Seattle -- takes a bit of an adjustment in terms of finding the sort of stuff Brian's looking for. Sure, there's a smaller number of total options and the range is maybe not as wide. But there is plenty of stuff to do around here -- it's just that, unlike one of those big metros, you maybe have to put a bit more effort into finding them. It sounds like Brian's looking for some specific suggestions, and if you have some, great. But we're also curious about more general strategies you might have. Maybe you can share a little bit about your own experiences finding your niche or crowd here. It could be a big help to Brian and other people who move here. Please share! photo: Andy Kainz Photography 30 comments tags: Capital Region, moving here Comments When I was new to the area I used Meetup.com. There are lots of groups in the capital district for all types of activities. As with any large group of people, you have to weed through some strange ones to find your buddies but it makes for great stories. ... said Chrissy on Mar 5, 2014 at 10:58 AM | link Albany Running Exchange! ... said boy3706 on Mar 5, 2014 at 11:12 AM | link Become a member worker at the Honest Weight Food Co-op. You'll meet a wide range of people there. You can work a weekly or monthly shift, depending on how much time you've got. In general I've found there is more potential for developing friendships when you interact with a group regularly than events that are one shots. Also anything interactive instead of just being in an audience will yield more social contacts. ... said chrisck on Mar 5, 2014 at 11:38 AM | link Get a dog! Getting a dog helped me meet my neighbors and gave me a reason to really get to know them through dog park hang outs. Though I got the dog because I wanted a dog, not friends. Also volunteer and get involved. Albany Barn needs docents and volunteers. Capital District Community Gardens needs volunteers (speaking of - community gardening helped me get to know lots of people who live near me). ... said Jenna on Mar 5, 2014 at 11:46 AM | link Get a dog and walk it multiple times a day!

The Low Beat, Pauly's Hotel, Fuller Roadhouse, The Linda are just some smaller venues for great music. The Egg, The Pepsi, The Palace are bigger venues! First Friday events in Albs to see art! Last Friday in Troy! Farmer's Markets all over the place! Cooking classes at Different Drummer's Kitchen! When it's warmer: Larkfest, TulipFest, Empire State Plaza Events Food Swaps in Troy and Albs! And that's just a few things... ... said Nic on Mar 5, 2014 at 12:09 PM | link Many local bars do trivia nights (check out City Beer Hall, Center Square Pub, Graneys, Juniors, Suzies, etc.), and this may be a good way to meet people. ... said tryit on Mar 5, 2014 at 12:14 PM | link not just a shameless plug -- the albany all stars roller derby league is a super nice group of people (not just ladies- we have refs and volunteers of all kinds!) there is also the capital district trauma authority, a men's league that skates out of the armory as well. there is also a curling club in the area which is quite popular, Albany Scenario paintball club, and darts leagues at a lot of the area bars. You might also want to check out the Albany Society for the Advancement of philanthropy- they hold events throughout the year, not just the speedo sprint. ... said Amelia on Mar 5, 2014 at 12:39 PM | link Check out any events that http://albanysociety.org/ might throw. Lionheart has a fun dart league. I ended up joining a random team that needed teammates one year. Food swaps are pretty great too. ... said Lola on Mar 5, 2014 at 12:59 PM | link There are a couple places that do dart leagues - Lionheart has mixed leagues and a women's league, Wolff's Biergarten did, might still have one too. I would encourage checking out Ultimate (frisbee) this spring/summer, http://albanyultimate.com runs 3 summer leagues (social, competitive, women's) and it's a sport that I've found to be great exercise, and very fun. The people are very inclusive & helpful and the sport is self-officiated with \"spirit of the game\" mentality. Do what you like, and look the part / show it off. There are lots of passionate people and if you're identifiable about some common interest it's more likely to create an interaction. If you're having trouble finding something, take a little initiative and try to start something. Running anything will leave you no choice but to get to know new people. And if it turns out your idea exists already, you can link up with the existing crew. ... said Jeff D on Mar 5, 2014 at 1:06 PM | link To echo some of the previous suggestions, ARE, Farmer's Markets and classes at both the Different Drummer't Kitchen and the Co-op are all great! I can also suggest the Albany Chapter of the ADK Mountain Club and the Albany Vegan and Vegetarian Meetup Group. Troy Night out is always a blast with a wide range of activities downtown. ... said Jona on Mar 5, 2014 at 1:06 PM | link Ladies (natives and those who are new to Rensselaer County like I am) are welcome to check out the Junior League of Troy. We are a group of volunteers dedicated to improving childhood literacy. I moved to Troy two years ago and have met several new friends through the Junior League. I really enjoy helping my new community and enjoy giving children's books away to young people. I love reading and the excited looks on their face make me feel so happy! We are in the middle of a project that will install bookcases full of books for the children of Vanderheyden Hall in Wynantskill. Volunteers also encourage parents to read to their children. Visit the website for more details : http://www.jltroy.org ... said Kathleen Lisson on Mar 5, 2014 at 1:08 PM | link Playing kickball has increased my social circle in Albany from decently sized to huge. Spring and Summer leagues are usually a full 16 teams with 18-24 members, and hanging out at the sponsor bar afterwards helps you meet people beyond your team. I think last year we had over 300 people in the spring league. Www.kickball.com ... said Tim on Mar 5, 2014 at 1:10 PM | link Softball leagues will be starting in the next couple of months. Andy's on New Scotland Ave and Lynn's Uptown Tavern on Colvin both host large leagues. I know that Lynn's has a mechanism for matching individuals with teams who need players and I assume Andy's does, too. Afrim's has a ton of soccer leagues and I believe they have hosted dodgeball tournaments before, too. ... said Sharon on Mar 5, 2014 at 1:13 PM | link softball or kickball leagues.....great way to meet people Beer Bingo at City Beer Hall ... said jen on Mar 5, 2014 at 1:24 PM | link First, go to Moveable Feast!

If you like it, there are lots of leagues you can join. Fun game, and a lot of good people. ... said Jon In Albany on Mar 5, 2014 at 3:58 PM | link There are a number of good suggestions above. I agree with those recommending the dart leagues at the Lionheart. I know they have a Wednesday night league as well as a Monday night league, and might also still have a women's league (I know they did in the past). The Wednesday night league is usually a lot of fun and has a handicap system so you don't have to be a dart master to play (though there are many talented players in it). The Monday night league is a bit smaller, but I've heard that it's also a good time. And I would also second the recommendation to look into groups on Meetup.com. If you like hiking, nature walks and/or snowshoeing the Hiking Mates of the Capital Region is a really good meetup group based in the Albany area; there are local kayaking meetup groups; the Capital Region Volunteers is a meetup group whose members participate in various volunteer activities around the region; and the Hudson Valley Hikers is a great group for hiking, camping, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, etc. (they are based a bit further downstate in the Hudson Valley, but they do a lot of stuff in the Catskills and Adirondacks). There are many other Meetup groups catering to various other interests, as well. ... said KJS on Mar 5, 2014 at 6:16 PM | link If Volleyball is your thing then check out the \"OCC\" club at the Polish Community Center in Albany. If you get in touch with the organizer and say you're looking for a team, they might know of a team looking for a player. Or, just go there on Wednesday nights, which is the pick-up night. If you're halfway decent, people will let you know about other pick up opportunities (Clifton Park/Delmar/Niskyuna...) that are more ad-hoc. During the indoor season, I recommend the Bethlehem Parks and Rec Club - three different levels on three different nights, and no need to form your own team. ... said Jessica R on Mar 5, 2014 at 6:31 PM | link When I first moved to town, I almost immediately started volunteering with a local theater - working backstage, the ticket booth, pretty much whatever was needed. Met amazing people I'm still friends with today and it opened up a huge community of like-minded people to me. And any of the community theaters are always looking for volunteers of all sorts, not just actors, if that's your thing at all! ... said Amy on Mar 5, 2014 at 7:39 PM | link Empire state kickball league. It is owned and run by a local who draws a lot of fun and interesting people. It is competitive but also really fun and a great way to meet new people (you can sign up and be put on a team as a free agent). Sponsored by lark tavern so free pitchers, cheap food and trivia after the games. Highly recommend it! The spring season starts in April. you would be surprised how many kickball enthusiasts there are in the area.

Free Audio Guide About Contact Media Coaching Private Coaching Coaching Case Studies Corporate Training Free AI Coach Courses Social Accelerator Blog Do you know your ​communication style? Take my quiz and get a custom report with specific tips ​based on your ​unique results. START THE QUIZ 30+ (Fun) Ways To Meet New People11/9/2021 Looking for ways to meet new people?You’re in the right place!Maybe you’ve just moved to a new city and you’re looking to get out there and make new friends.Maybe you’ve lived in your city for years, but you’ve been stuck in a routine.Either way, here’s a list of 30+ ways to meet new people.First: The secret to meeting new people? Consistency.Before we dive into the list, here’s a pro-tip for meeting new people.​Be consistent!Most people go to one meetup, they don’t have an earth-shattering time making the best friends of their life. Then…they quit.Don’t be like that.To find people you LOVE hanging with, you’re going to have to meet several dozen people and go to events and meetups regularly. The more time you spend trying new events and starting conversations while you’re there…the higher your chances of meeting new people go way up.Repeat after me: “It takes time. And that’s okay.”Okay, let’s dive in!1. VolunteeringVolunteering is a fantastic way to do a little good in the community, and meet other volunteers at the same time.Often, it can be easier to connect with people when connecting isn’t the sole reason for interacting with them.​When you have a shared reason for being around each other, connection can happen naturally. 2. Cooking classesCooking classes are a great way to level up your cooking skills, and meet new people at the same time! Pro-Tip: If you hit it off with people at other events on this list, you can even show off your cooking skills and invite them to a dinner party!3. Hiking clubFeel like getting outside? Hiking clubs are great for exploring the great outdoors, breaking a sweat, and meeting new people who are also into nature!4. Martial arts classesKicking and punching your way to friendship!​There’s something about physical activity that help people break the ice in social situations. My hunch is that people are too tired to feel nervous.5. ​Fitness classesCould be Tae Bo (kidding) Zumba, CrossFit, HIIT classes, or anything else that gets the blood pumping.6. Running groupsI used to be a competitive runner, and running groups are a great way to meet new people.Many running groups will have people at all skill levels, so don’t worry about slowing down the group if you’re just getting into running.​After a few meetings, you’ll be going out for beer and tacos soon enough!7. Group dance classesMy wife and I took swing dancing classes for a couple of years and it was fun learning new moves.​Most mid-size cities have dance events where people get together and dance the night away!8. Yoga classesAh, yoga class!It’s a very chill way to spend a Friday night.Pro-Tip: If it’s your first time going, be sure to stay behind after class for a few minutes and start some conversations with the instructor and some fellow students!9. ​Art classesMaybe you want to level up your doodles to drawings, or you just want to paint and sip wine.​Either way, art classes are a great way to meet new people who are fun and creative.10. ​Meetup.comThis one is a go-to there are 1,000s of meetups on every conceivable topic. Keep in mind that it can be a little bit of a process to find a Meetup that you LOVE.A rule I picked up from a reader: “I’ll go once, just to see if I like it.” This is the best mindset to have as you meet new people.Go once, just to see if you like it!Click here to find a meetup near you.#element-a7b9bfc8-08ed-4940-a949-c1c929fa45be .callout-box-wrapper { padding: 20px 0px;

Most meetups will have a theme or BYOB (Bring your own board) options.12. ​Meet people in your neighborhood!Don’t sleep on this oneIf your neighborhood has events, great! If not, take some walks around your neighborhood and stop and chat with your neighbors! (Optional: Get involved with your neighborhood association, assuming they aren’t full of old busybodies who complain about people who don’t mow their lawns every weekend.)13. ​Book clubsYou might be into reading and sharing your interpretations of books!​This is a fantastic way to meet new people because you already have something to talk about. (the book!)14. ​Book readingsCheck out local bookstores for readings. Be sure to stick around and meet the author and other people who enjoy their work! 15. ​Say yes to invites!This is another tip to not sleep on. Be sure to say “yes” to as many invites as possible when you’re trying to meet new people.​Invites lead to more invites, so if you’re at a new job and someone invites you out to drinks with your coworkers: SAY YES! Putting yourself in social situations is half the battle of being more social. Plus, you’re much more likely to get invites in the future if you say yes today.16. ​Dog parksI’m a well documented cat person, but for those people who enjoy having a pet love you unconditionally, I hear dog parks are great places to meet new people. “Which one’s yours?” is basically the last conversation starter you’ll need at the dog park. Bonus: My town has something called a Bark Bar…it’s a bar where you can bring your pup. Maybe your city has one too. It’s probably in the trendy area of town.17. ​Online Groups for your interestHave a niche interest? Live in a tiny rural town? Online/Facebook/Reddit groups are a great option to meet new people. Over time, you can even FaceTime them and deepen the relationship.​I know plenty of people who met great friends online years before they met them in real life. Just remember to be patient!18. ​Trivia night at your local barOh boy! Trivia night!​A great way to flex your knowledge of obscure geography after your second beer! Also, a great way to meet new people who aren’t on a trivia team of join an existing one. 19. ​Cultural events in your cityMuseum openings, walking tours, interesting speakers, art exhibits, these are fun ways to meet new people who are out exploring their city (just like you are) ​20. ​Beer tasting/Brewery ToursIf you’re into beer and want to learn more about how it’s brewed, hit up a beer tasting event or a brewery tour in your city.Chances are, there are some cool local breweries in your town.​Years ago, I even helped a local brewery bottle their beer for a day. They paid me in beer…which was great for a 21 year old me.21. ​Improv classesYou don’t have to be an aspiring SNL cast member to have a good time meeting new people at an improv class.Silly situations, spur-of-the-moment topics and learning how to “yes and…” your way to making people laugh is a great way to push your comfort zone and hopefully meet some fun people along the way.22. ​Adult sports leaguesA few years ago, my wife joined a kickball league, she had a great time meeting new people at games.​If you’re a athletic person who likes a little friendly competition, joining an adult sports league could be a great option to find new people to hang with.23. ​Networking eventsNot just for handing out business cards and talking up the 5 year vision for your career.​The secret to “networking” is being human, and having good conversations with people. The more people you have conversations with, the higher the chance is that you’ll meet new people that you really hit it off with!Also, online networking is an option too:24. ​ConferencesIn a similar vein as networking event, conferences can be fantastic places to meet new people. I especially like traveling to new places to go to conferences that focus on topics that I’m interested in. Mandatory tip: The conference isn’t over at 5 PM! Make sure to go to local bars/restaurants with other attendees. This is where the real fun of conferences is to be had.25. Toastmasters clubsPolishing up your public speaking skills, and meeting new people who are doing the same, what’s not to like?​As with other places to meet new people, be sure to stay after for 5-10 minutes to introduce yourself to some people.Click here to find a local Toastmasters club.26. Speed DatingThis is a fun one that many people write-off. Will you end up meeting the love of your life at a speed dating event? Maybe. What’s more likely is that you’ll have a bunch of short conversations in rapid order with new people.​Part of improving your people skills is practicing, and speed dating is a great way to practice your conversation skills.27. ​Bumble BFFAh apps!Bumble BFF is a uber-convenient way to meet new people. Create an account, upload a picture, and fill out your interests and profile and get to swiping. If you match with someone, you’ll have a limited amount of time to make the first move. Pro-tip: Get good candid pictures preferably taken by a professional. Friend of BMC and personal stylist Peter Nguyen does this for his personal styling clients, and it makes a huge difference.28. ​Self-Development groupsThis one’s a little broad, but if you’re into self-development, finding a group that meets regularly can be a great way to meet new people who are constantly trying to stay motivated and improve.29. ​Language learning groupsLast year, my wife and I started learning American Sign Language (ASL) and she started an ASL meetup group where people could come, have lunch and practice their skills.If you’re into learning a new language, this is a fantastic way to meet new people and improve your language skills at the same time! Win/win!30. Dinner at the bar of a restaurant ​This is another low-key awesome way to meet new people.Find a restaurant that you love, and sit at the bar and have dinner there a couple of nights per week. You’ll meet the bartender, staff, and people hanging out nearby. Pro tip: If you’re feeling a little nervous about going out alone.Bring a book and read it casually at the bar. (Meaning taking frequent breaks from reading to sip your drink, eat some food, etc.)​People WILL ask you what you’re reading. This is an easy way for other people to start conversations with you.31. Reach out to friends-of-friendsSuper underrated tip here.​If you’ve met a friend of a friend a few times, reach out to them and ask them if they want to grab some coffee.Making friends doesn’t mean you have to start from zero! Since you already have connections in common, it’s easier to break the ice and get the conversation started! Pro tip: When asking people to hang out, it’s important to keep the ask low-pressure and give them an option to decline. Saying “We should grab some coffee sometime” and adding “If that doesn’t work for you, that’s totally cool, I’m sure I’ll see you around!”32. Groupon dealsThis is a really outside of the box idea, but you can check your city’s Groupon deals under the “Things to do” section to find some interesting things to do that might put you in a position to meet new people.33. ​Get on your city’s subreddit and ask for recommendations.This is another under-the-radar way to meet new people. Many cities that have over…say…150K population have a subreddit.​This can be a great way to get local recommendations for things to do from people that you may not have heard of.And there are usually new people who are moving to town that are looking for people to hang out with.Pro-tip for US folks: Here’s a list of a bunch of US city subreddits.Bonus tip: How to Start a Conversation at a Meetup or EventThe following is taken from this post on starting conversations.Meetups and classes have the benefit of being structured.Everyone signed up to be there and came specifically to gather and learn or do something together. This takes a lot of the pressure off you because you know the people around you signed up for this!​Try some of these conversation starters to pique interest and make new friends:Hey, it’s my first time here, is this the [Meetup Name] Meetup?Hi, I’ve never tried a [Class Name] Class before.

Take my quiz and get a custom report with specific tips ​based on your ​unique results. START THE QUIZ 30+ (Fun) Ways To Meet New People11/9/2021 Looking for ways to meet new people?You’re in the right place!Maybe you’ve just moved to a new city and you’re looking to get out there and make new friends.Maybe you’ve lived in your city for years, but you’ve been stuck in a routine.Either way, here’s a list of 30+ ways to meet new people.First: The secret to meeting new people? Consistency.Before we dive into the list, here’s a pro-tip for meeting new people.​Be consistent!Most people go to one meetup, they don’t have an earth-shattering time making the best friends of their life. Then…they quit.Don’t be like that.To find people you LOVE hanging with, you’re going to have to meet several dozen people and go to events and meetups regularly. The more time you spend trying new events and starting conversations while you’re there…the higher your chances of meeting new people go way up.Repeat after me: “It takes time. And that’s okay.”Okay, let’s dive in!1. VolunteeringVolunteering is a fantastic way to do a little good in the community, and meet other volunteers at the same time.Often, it can be easier to connect with people when connecting isn’t the sole reason for interacting with them.​When you have a shared reason for being around each other, connection can happen naturally. 2. Cooking classesCooking classes are a great way to level up your cooking skills, and meet new people at the same time! Pro-Tip: If you hit it off with people at other events on this list, you can even show off your cooking skills and invite them to a dinner party!3. Hiking clubFeel like getting outside? Hiking clubs are great for exploring the great outdoors, breaking a sweat, and meeting new people who are also into nature!4. Martial arts classesKicking and punching your way to friendship!​There’s something about physical activity that help people break the ice in social situations. My hunch is that people are too tired to feel nervous.5. ​Fitness classesCould be Tae Bo (kidding) Zumba, CrossFit, HIIT classes, or anything else that gets the blood pumping.6. Running groupsI used to be a competitive runner, and running groups are a great way to meet new people.Many running groups will have people at all skill levels, so don’t worry about slowing down the group if you’re just getting into running.​After a few meetings, you’ll be going out for beer and tacos soon enough!7. Group dance classesMy wife and I took swing dancing classes for a couple of years and it was fun learning new moves.​Most mid-size cities have dance events where people get together and dance the night away!8. Yoga classesAh, yoga class!It’s a very chill way to spend a Friday night.Pro-Tip: If it’s your first time going, be sure to stay behind after class for a few minutes and start some conversations with the instructor and some fellow students!9. ​Art classesMaybe you want to level up your doodles to drawings, or you just want to paint and sip wine.​Either way, art classes are a great way to meet new people who are fun and creative.10. ​Meetup.comThis one is a go-to there are 1,000s of meetups on every conceivable topic. Keep in mind that it can be a little bit of a process to find a Meetup that you LOVE.A rule I picked up from a reader: “I’ll go once, just to see if I like it.” This is the best mindset to have as you meet new people.Go once, just to see if you like it!Click here to find a meetup near you.#element-a7b9bfc8-08ed-4940-a949-c1c929fa45be .callout-box-wrapper { padding: 20px 0px;
