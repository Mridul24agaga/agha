  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, let’s kick back and dive into what this site at https://helpy-ui.com/ might be all about. From the name alone, “helpy-ui,” it suggests a focus on user interface (UI) design or tools that help with user experience (UX). So, I’m thinking it’s probably a platform aimed at making things easier for designers, developers, or even businesses looking to spruce up their digital spaces. Picture this: a sleek, modern site that’s all about providing resources for building interfaces that are not just functional, but also aesthetically pleasing. They might offer templates, design kits, or UI components that you can plug into your own projects. You know, the kind of stuff that makes your app or website look professional without having to start from scratch. There’s a good chance they’ve got some pretty snazzy examples showcasing how their tools can transform a drab webpage into something that really pops. Maybe they highlight user-friendly features that keep design principles in mind—like accessibility, mobile responsiveness, and overall usability. It's all about creating a smooth experience for end-users, right? If they cater to developers, there’s probably some nifty documentation or guides to help folks integrate their designs into various frameworks or codebases. Think of it as a friendly helping hand for those who might feel a bit overwhelmed by the design side of things. It’s the kind of site that makes you feel like you can tackle that next project after a few sips of coffee. Now, let’s not forget the community vibe. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’ve got a blog or forum where users can share tips, tricks, and maybe even some cool design hacks. It’s always nice when a site fosters that sense of camaraderie, giving people a place to ask questions or show off their latest creations. There’s a certain warmth in sharing knowledge and learning together. And if I’m really reading between the lines here, they might be offering some kind of subscription or one-time purchase model for their resources. This could range from free assets to premium stuff—like exclusive templates or design systems that are worth their weight in gold if you’re deep into UI/UX work. All in all, I’m betting that Helpy UI is your go-to spot for simplifying the design process, providing tools that help creators work smarter, not harder. It’s all about empowering folks to build better digital experiences, whether they’re seasoned pros or just starting out. So yeah, next time you’re in a design pickle, or feel like giving your website a fresh coat of paint, Helpy UI might just be the place to check out. Cheers to that!",

Cards Cards are like mini information hubs in the digital world. They’re like tiny frames that hold content – text, images, and buttons – all bundled together. Imagine having your own collection of neatly organized snapshots, each card sharing a bite-sized piece of information, creating an engaging and visually appealing layout for users to explore. 19. Breadcrumbs Breadcrumbs are like your digital trail markers. They show where you’ve been on a website or app, like breadcrumbs in a forest. Think of them as a path that helps you retrace your steps, making navigation easier and ensuring you never get lost in the vast digital woods. They let users see their current location and show the hierarchy of content 20. Pagination Pagination is like splitting a long story into readable chapters. It divides content into manageable chunks, like turning pages in a book. Imagine a digital flipbook – pagination lets you navigate through a series of pages, ensuring you don’t get overwhelmed while enjoying the content, one page at a time. 21. Avatars Avatars are like your digital alter egos. They’re tiny profile pictures or icons representing you or others in the virtual world. Think of them as your visual signatures – avatars give a personal touch to your online presence, making interactions more human and helping you stand out in the digital crowd. 22. Progress Indicators Progress indicators are like digital cheerleaders showing things happening behind the scenes. They spin, move, or fill up as tasks complete or load. Picture a waiting game with a countdown – progress indicators assure you that your request is being processed, making the anticipation a bit more bearable while adding a touch of excitement. 23. Search Bars Search bars are like your personal digital detectives. They’re the go-to tool for finding specific content – just type in your query, and they’ll hunt down the information you’re seeking. Imagine a helpful friend who knows where everything is – a search bar quickly leads you to your desired destination in the vast digital landscape. 24. Tags Tags are like virtual sticky notes for organizing content. They’re short labels that categorize or label things, creating neat little groups. Think of them as digital markers – tags help you sort through information, making it easier to find and explore specific topics or items, usually in the same category, in a clutter-free, organized manner. 25. Chips Chips are like bite-sized nuggets of information in the digital world. They’re compact elements that display text or icons, often used for filters or selections. Imagine having a handful of mini info tokens – chips help you quickly choose options or categorize content, making your digital interaction efficient and engaging. 26. Call-to-Action (CTA) Blocks Call-to-Action (CTA) blocks are like friendly prompts in the digital realm that invite you to take action. They’re attention-grabbing boxes with buttons or links, encouraging you to do things like “Sign Up,” “Buy Now,” or “Learn More.” Picture them as virtual signposts, guiding you towards specific tasks and interactions, making your digital journey interactive and purposeful. 27. Navigation Bars Navigation bars are like your digital compasses, guiding you through a website or app. They’re the top-level menus or toolbars that offer links to different sections. Think of them as your digital map – navigation bars help you explore and move around, ensuring you don’t get lost in the vast digital terrain while making your journey seamless and intuitive. 28. Feedback Messages Feedback messages are like your digital cheerleaders, keeping you in the loop. They’re notifications or alerts that inform you about successful actions or errors. Imagine a helpful friend who pats you on the back or lends a hand when things go wrong – feedback messages give you reassurance and guidance, ensuring you’re always in the know during your digital adventures. 29. Message Boxes Message boxes are like digital notes that pop up to deliver critical information. They’re like virtual sticky messages that provide alerts, warnings, or instructions in a UI design. Imagine a friendly reminder – message boxes keep you informed and ensure you know crucial details, adding a layer of communication and clarity to your digital experience. 30. Text Fields Text fields are like blank canvases for your digital words. They’re input boxes where you can type, like leaving a digital trail of your thoughts. Imagine writing a quick note – text fields let you share information, provide answers, or interact with forms, usually in a single line or multiple lines, making your digital conversations and interactions come to life with text. Bonus UI Element: Feeds Feeds are like digital newsstands, delivering a constant stream of content. They’re like a personalized magazine, displaying updates, posts, or articles that display user activity in chronological order. Imagine a never-ending scroll – feeds keep you informed and entertained, serving up a variety of content that you can browse and engage with, tailored to your interests and preferences.: These common UI elements form the foundation of user-friendly and visually appealing designs. By mastering these elements, designers can create engaging and intuitive interfaces that cater to users’ needs and expectations in 2025 and beyond. Bottom Line In the vast digital design landscape, UI elements illuminate the path to seamless user experiences. Like building blocks, they create a cohesive and engaging interface, guiding users with familiarity and grace. By mastering these elements, designers possess the keys to unlock a world of creativity and innovation, where every click, tap, and interaction becomes a harmonious melody of design and functionality. So, as you embark on your design journey, remember that UI elements are not just tools – they’re the threads that weave together the tapestry of digital brilliance.

Free lifetime updates We'll let you know when we release future updates. What is Untitled UI PRO LITE? Untitled UI PRO LITE is a premium and lightweight version of the full Untitled UI PRO STYLES kit. It's 55% lighter, faster, and is designed to include everything you need and nothing you don't. It's still incredibly powerful, but the perfect size for moving fast and for smaller projects! Untitled UI PRO LITE New! Untitled UI PRO STYLES What is the difference between PRO STYLES and PRO LITE? We've kept the most useful components and removed the rest. The result is 55% fewer overall layers. Both kits include almost identical foundational components and styles but have far fewer variants and additional components across the rest of the kit. We've also slimmed down the page examples. Even though PRO LITE is 55% smaller than the full PRO STYLES version, the new PRO LITE kit is an incredibly robust and powerful UI kit in its own right. It's still more comprehensive and advanced than other kits we've seen in the market! It also supports Figma's latest Auto Layout 5.0 features. You can preview both the PRO STYLES and PRO LITE versions side-by-side and decide which is best at the start of each new project. The good news is you can always copy components back in from the PRO STYLES version if you find you need them later on. Why did we create PRO LITE? We've designed Untitled UI to be the largest and most advanced UI kit for Figma in the world. Not all projects need that kind of firepower. We encourage users to delete components they don't need at the start of each project to keep things light, but this can take a while... We created PRO LITE to help with this process! We've spent weeks creating a lightweight little brother to the full PRO STYLES version so you now have two options: start with the complete PRO STYLES version or ship faster with PRO LITE. Why is it included for free? Because we hope that it will come in handy next time you have a smaller project or a tight timeframe. Plus, we want to say thanks to everyone who has bought Untitled UI so far. Simple as that! At the start of each project, you'll now have the option to use the complete PRO STYLES version, or save a bit of time and start with the lightweight PRO LITE version. FAQs Frequently asked questions Need help with something? Here are our most frequently asked questions. General What is Untitled UI? Untitled UI is the largest and best-selling Figma UI kit and design system in the world. Tired of wasting thousands of hours starting from scratch on every project and rebuilding the same components? Untitled UI comes packed full with everything you need to design modern and beautiful UI and websites. Join 280,000+ designers from the world's top companies. Kickstart any project, save thousands of hours, and level up as a designer. Why do I need a UI kit? Good question! We used to ask this all the time. You don’t realize the power of a high-quality UI kit until you start using one. A good UI kit saves you time and money usually spent on meticulously building the same components over and over again. It can 10-100x your workflow. A good way to frame it is to ask the question, “will this UI kit save me a few hours of work in a project?” If the answer is YES, it’s probably worth the investment. Then it becomes an asset you can use in unlimited future projects. We built Untitled UI out of necessity. We tried a bunch of UI kits for Figma, but found they lacked in size, flexibility, or quality — usually all three — and we ended up having to remake all the poor-quality components. We needed an “ultimate starter” kit for new freelance projects and design systems, rather than having to start from scratch each time. We were sick of rebuilding the same common components over and over again... It's also the boring part in the design process! Untitled UI was built to solve this. We’ve thought of everything you need to design modern and beautiful UI and websites and have wrapped it into one neatly organized package. You can use this UI kit in unlimited projects. In fact, we designed it this way — to be as neutral, flexible, and scalable as possible to use as a kickstarter for any project. Does Untitled UI include the new Figma features? Yes! We’ve completely refactored Untitled UI to support Figma’s latest new features, including those released at Framework 2024 and Config 2024. This includes color variables (dark mode), spacing, radius, typography, and effects variables, Auto Layout 5.0, min/max widths, Auto Layout wrapping, and much more. We're always working to make Untitled UI better than ever with and implement new Figma features into our products as fast as possible. You can follow along with updates to Untitled UI via our changelog. We'll also update everyone via email when we release an update. What is the difference between the three versions? We’ve split the PRO version of Untitled UI into three different versions: Untitled UI PRO VARIABLES: Supports all the latest features announced at Config 2024, including color, spacing, radius, width, typography, and effects variables (including dark mode!) and Auto Layout 5.0 (min/max widths and wrapping). Untitled UI PRO STYLES: Supports Auto Layout 5.0 (min/max widths and wrapping) but does not include variables for those who prefer to keep their workflow simple.‍ Untitled UI PRO LITE: Our lightweight version of the full Untitled UI PRO STYLES kit has also been updated to support Auto Layout 5.0 (min/max widths and wrapping). It’s 55% lighter and faster and includes everything you need. All three UI kits are included for the price of one when you purchase Untitled UI. Why? So you can choose which system works best for your workflow or project. Designers and teams should feel empowered, not overwhelmed. If you aren’t using design tokens or variables already in your projects, it can be easy to feel overwhelmed. You don't have to use variables in Figma if you don't want to! We will continue to update a non-variables version of Untitled UI for the foreseeable future so you can continue to work with styles if you prefer to. It’s just as up-to-date with all the other new features. Is there a dark mode version of the kit? Dark mode is here! Untitled UI PRO VARIABLES support Figma’s latest features announced at Config 2024, including color variables and dark mode. Variables allow you to switch any component, layout, or page to dark mode with one click! You can preview how this works in Untitled UI by navigating to the example marketing website and application example pages. Free version Is there a free version available? Yes, we have a free version of Untitled UI available for you to try out! It's an incredibly powerful and large UI kit for Figma in it's on right, but it doesn't use the latest component property features announced at Config 2022 or the latest variables and Auto Layout 5.0 features announced at Config 2023, Framework 2024, and Config 2024. You can duplicate this free UI kit and use it in as many projects as you'd like. What does the free version include? The free version of Untitled UI is essentially a slimmed-down version of the full UI kit. It includes global styles, basic components, and a few page examples. Try out the free version! Lifetime updates What does \"lifetime access\" mean? Once you have purchased the UI kit, you will have access to all of the future updates, free of charge. We'll let you know when updates and improvements are made. How do I access the files after purchasing? After purchasing, you will be provided with unique links to access to all the Figma files. You will have full edit access of these files to use in your Figma account. How do I access updates after purchasing?

Using Figma Do I need to know how to use Figma? This design system does take full advantage of Figma's more advanced features, including nested components, variants, Auto Layout 5.0, interactive components, the new component properties announced at Config 2022 and the new variables and Auto Layout 5.0 features announced at Config 2023, Framework 2024, and Config 2024. If you're new to Figma, or keen to learn best practices, check out our free version to see if it's a good fit. The full version will always be here whenever you are ready. We also recommend checking out Figma's Help Center for the best tutorials on these features. Do I need to use variables? You don’t have to use variables if you don’t want or need to! We dive into this topic more deeply in our variables documentation page within Untitled UI. The decision whether or not to use variables is entirely up to you. We've released two different versions of Untitled UI PRO — one that uses color, spacing, and radius variables and one that uses styles instead. Both are included so you can try them both and see which suits your workflow better! Support How does support work? If you're having trouble with Untitled UI, we're here to try and help via hello@untitledui.com. We're a small team, but will get back to you as soon as possible. Please note we are not Figma support. If you have a Figma-related question, we recommend checking our Figma's Help Center as a start. Their educational content and documentation is incredibly helpful. Figma also have great tutorials for key features, such as components, variants, Auto Layout 5.0, interactive components, and component properties. Do you provide video tutorials? Not yet, but we're working on it! In the meantime, we've done our best to make it as intuitive as possible and we're adding even more notes and documentation to components. Education discounts Do you provide an education discount? We offer a 50% discount for students which is far more generous than our competitors. Please shoot us an email at hello@untitledui.com from your student email and attach a student ID with valid dates before purchasing! Do I need to pay for Figma if I'm a student? Figma's Starter plan is 100% free for individuals. If you want to use more advanced features such as team libraries, you'll need to purchase a Professional plan. However, Figma have generously announced all the paid perks of their plans are 100% free for students and educators! You can learn more at Figma Education. Affiliates Do you have an affiliate program? Yes, we do! We've recently launched our affiliate program — a simple and easy way to make money for referring people to Untitled UI. Get 30% of every sale you refer. There's no limit on how much you can earn. Licensing Can I use it for commercial projects? Of course! We'd love to see it. You can use this UI kit to build any type of commercial business, website, app, or project. You can also use it to create unlimited designs for clients and charge them for your services (we won't tell them). However, you can't use Untitled UI or any assets within Untitled UI to create another UI kit, theme, or template, even if it's not in Figma. Please read our License Agreement before purchasing. Can I use it for multiple projects? Absolutely! You can use Untitled UI for as many projects as you like. Please read our License Agreement before purchasing. What is a user? A “user” is classified as anyone in your team using the Figma files, assets within the Figma files, or the Figma files published as a library in your team or organization. You may share access to the Figma files or a published Figma library with your team members or other users only if you've bought a PRO TEAM, PRO ENTERPRISE, or PRO UNLIMITED license. Do I need a team license? If you're working solo you only need a single user license. However, if you need to share access to the Figma files or a published Figma library with your team, you'll need to purchase a PRO TEAM, PRO ENTERPRISE, or PRO UNLIMITED license (depending on how big your team is). Can I use Untitled UI with more than 12 users? Absolutely! When you get to the purchase page, just choose the PRO UNLIMITED tier. PRO UNLIMITED is perfect for large design teams, companies, and organizations. Can I upgrade to a team or enterprise license? If you need to upgrade your license, we'll discount the amount you've paid for your existing license. Just shoot us an email at hello@untitledui.com. Can I use this to create and sell a similar product? Of course not. You may not use this to build, sell or distribute similar design products on your website or on marketplaces. This includes UI kits and templates for other platforms and software. License agreements exist for people like you. Please read our License Agreement before purchasing. Payments & billing Is it a one-time payment? Just a one-time payment! No recurring charges or surprises, we promise. Do I need to pay for Figma? Figma's Starter plan is 100% free for individuals. If you want to use more advanced features such as team libraries, dev mode, or multiple variable modes, you'll need to purchase a Professional plan. Learn more about how Figma's pricing works. Figma have generously announced all the paid perks of their plans are 100% free for students and educators! You can learn more at Figma Education. Is payment secure? We use Lemon Squeezy and Gumroad to handle the tricky payment process. They use secure 128-bit SSL encrypted payments, so you're pretty safe! Can I get an invoice? If you purchased through Lemon Squeezy, you can generate an invoice from your My Orders page if you made an account. Just click the Generate Invoice button. Here's a guide on how to generate an invoice in Lemon Squeezy. If you didn't make a Lemon Squeezy account, just click the Generate button in your original purchase email. These are sent from hello@lemonsqueezy-mail.com with the subject You purchased Untitled UI – Figma UI kit and design system. If you purchased through Gumroad, just click the Generate button on your receipt from Gumroad after your purchase. Here's a guide on how to generate an invoice in Gumroad. What is your refund policy? If there are any serious issues with the file, reach out and let us know within 30-days and we'll issue a full refund. None of our competitors offer refunds, which we thought was a bit sketchy. Please note we cannot issue a refund if you simply change your mind after purchasing or are unfamiliar with Figma's features. We back Untitled UI 100% and know you'll love it too, but we ask that you please try out the free version of Untitled UI and preview the full version before purchasing to make sure it's right for you and fits your needs. You'll no longer be able to use Untitled UI in any projects if we issue a refund (including personal/non-commercial projects). We think that's pretty fair! You can read the full refund policy in the License Agreement. Splitting up the library Can I split up the library into smaller files? Absolutely! Figma recently introduced a move published components feature to deal with just this. This allows you to split up the library into smaller libraries that can be published independently. For example, you may want to split the file into four libraries: Styles and shared components Marketing components Application components Page examples You don't have to split up the library if you don't want to — it's entirely a personal preference and it can be easier to manage a single library. We suggest trying out a single library, but moving all the example pages to a separate file once you've published the library. This way they'll always be there if you need them, but it'll remove ~40% of the file size from your file in one go! Why isn’t the library split up already? Good question! Currently, it isn’t possible to import more than one file at a time into Figma without breaking links to instances in the design system across the files. Because of this, the file needs to be imported together and then split up into separate libraries (if you want to do that) after it’s imported. Hopefully, this functionality will be introduced soon! Others Is there a version for Sketch or XD? Unfortunately, no. There are no plans to do a Sketch or Adobe XD version of Untitled UI. Figma is life. Is Untitled UI affiliated with Figma? Untitled UI is not affiliated with Figma or Figma's team, nor is it endorsed or sponsored by Figma. We're just big fans!

Free lifetime updates We'll let you know when we release future updates. What is Untitled UI PRO LITE? Untitled UI PRO LITE is a premium and lightweight version of the full Untitled UI PRO STYLES kit. It's 55% lighter, faster, and is designed to include everything you need and nothing you don't. It's still incredibly powerful, but the perfect size for moving fast and for smaller projects! Untitled UI PRO LITE New! Untitled UI PRO STYLES What is the difference between PRO STYLES and PRO LITE? We've kept the most useful components and removed the rest. The result is 55% fewer overall layers. Both kits include almost identical foundational components and styles but have far fewer variants and additional components across the rest of the kit. We've also slimmed down the page examples. Even though PRO LITE is 55% smaller than the full PRO STYLES version, the new PRO LITE kit is an incredibly robust and powerful UI kit in its own right. It's still more comprehensive and advanced than other kits we've seen in the market! It also supports Figma's latest Auto Layout 5.0 features. You can preview both the PRO STYLES and PRO LITE versions side-by-side and decide which is best at the start of each new project. The good news is you can always copy components back in from the PRO STYLES version if you find you need them later on. Why did we create PRO LITE? We've designed Untitled UI to be the largest and most advanced UI kit for Figma in the world. Not all projects need that kind of firepower. We encourage users to delete components they don't need at the start of each project to keep things light, but this can take a while... We created PRO LITE to help with this process! We've spent weeks creating a lightweight little brother to the full PRO STYLES version so you now have two options: start with the complete PRO STYLES version or ship faster with PRO LITE. Why is it included for free? Because we hope that it will come in handy next time you have a smaller project or a tight timeframe. Plus, we want to say thanks to everyone who has bought Untitled UI so far. Simple as that! At the start of each project, you'll now have the option to use the complete PRO STYLES version, or save a bit of time and start with the lightweight PRO LITE version. FAQs Frequently asked questions Need help with something? Here are our most frequently asked questions. General What is Untitled UI? Untitled UI is the largest and best-selling Figma UI kit and design system in the world. Tired of wasting thousands of hours starting from scratch on every project and rebuilding the same components? Untitled UI comes packed full with everything you need to design modern and beautiful UI and websites. Join 280,000+ designers from the world's top companies. Kickstart any project, save thousands of hours, and level up as a designer. Why do I need a UI kit? Good question! We used to ask this all the time. You don’t realize the power of a high-quality UI kit until you start using one. A good UI kit saves you time and money usually spent on meticulously building the same components over and over again. It can 10-100x your workflow. A good way to frame it is to ask the question, “will this UI kit save me a few hours of work in a project?” If the answer is YES, it’s probably worth the investment. Then it becomes an asset you can use in unlimited future projects. We built Untitled UI out of necessity. We tried a bunch of UI kits for Figma, but found they lacked in size, flexibility, or quality — usually all three — and we ended up having to remake all the poor-quality components. We needed an “ultimate starter” kit for new freelance projects and design systems, rather than having to start from scratch each time. We were sick of rebuilding the same common components over and over again... It's also the boring part in the design process! Untitled UI was built to solve this. We’ve thought of everything you need to design modern and beautiful UI and websites and have wrapped it into one neatly organized package. You can use this UI kit in unlimited projects. In fact, we designed it this way — to be as neutral, flexible, and scalable as possible to use as a kickstarter for any project. Does Untitled UI include the new Figma features? Yes! We’ve completely refactored Untitled UI to support Figma’s latest new features, including those released at Framework 2024 and Config 2024. This includes color variables (dark mode), spacing, radius, typography, and effects variables, Auto Layout 5.0, min/max widths, Auto Layout wrapping, and much more. We're always working to make Untitled UI better than ever with and implement new Figma features into our products as fast as possible. You can follow along with updates to Untitled UI via our changelog. We'll also update everyone via email when we release an update. What is the difference between the three versions? We’ve split the PRO version of Untitled UI into three different versions: Untitled UI PRO VARIABLES: Supports all the latest features announced at Config 2024, including color, spacing, radius, width, typography, and effects variables (including dark mode!) and Auto Layout 5.0 (min/max widths and wrapping). Untitled UI PRO STYLES: Supports Auto Layout 5.0 (min/max widths and wrapping) but does not include variables for those who prefer to keep their workflow simple.‍ Untitled UI PRO LITE: Our lightweight version of the full Untitled UI PRO STYLES kit has also been updated to support Auto Layout 5.0 (min/max widths and wrapping). It’s 55% lighter and faster and includes everything you need. All three UI kits are included for the price of one when you purchase Untitled UI. Why? So you can choose which system works best for your workflow or project. Designers and teams should feel empowered, not overwhelmed. If you aren’t using design tokens or variables already in your projects, it can be easy to feel overwhelmed. You don't have to use variables in Figma if you don't want to! We will continue to update a non-variables version of Untitled UI for the foreseeable future so you can continue to work with styles if you prefer to. It’s just as up-to-date with all the other new features. Is there a dark mode version of the kit? Dark mode is here! Untitled UI PRO VARIABLES support Figma’s latest features announced at Config 2024, including color variables and dark mode. Variables allow you to switch any component, layout, or page to dark mode with one click! You can preview how this works in Untitled UI by navigating to the example marketing website and application example pages. Free version Is there a free version available? Yes, we have a free version of Untitled UI available for you to try out! It's an incredibly powerful and large UI kit for Figma in it's on right, but it doesn't use the latest component property features announced at Config 2022 or the latest variables and Auto Layout 5.0 features announced at Config 2023, Framework 2024, and Config 2024. You can duplicate this free UI kit and use it in as many projects as you'd like. What does the free version include? The free version of Untitled UI is essentially a slimmed-down version of the full UI kit. It includes global styles, basic components, and a few page examples. Try out the free version! Lifetime updates What does \"lifetime access\" mean? Once you have purchased the UI kit, you will have access to all of the future updates, free of charge. We'll let you know when updates and improvements are made. How do I access the files after purchasing? After purchasing, you will be provided with unique links to access to all the Figma files.

Using Figma Do I need to know how to use Figma? This design system does take full advantage of Figma's more advanced features, including nested components, variants, Auto Layout 5.0, interactive components, the new component properties announced at Config 2022 and the new variables and Auto Layout 5.0 features announced at Config 2023, Framework 2024, and Config 2024. If you're new to Figma, or keen to learn best practices, check out our free version to see if it's a good fit. The full version will always be here whenever you are ready. We also recommend checking out Figma's Help Center for the best tutorials on these features. Do I need to use variables? You don’t have to use variables if you don’t want or need to! We dive into this topic more deeply in our variables documentation page within Untitled UI. The decision whether or not to use variables is entirely up to you. We've released two different versions of Untitled UI PRO — one that uses color, spacing, and radius variables and one that uses styles instead. Both are included so you can try them both and see which suits your workflow better! Support How does support work? If you're having trouble with Untitled UI, we're here to try and help via hello@untitledui.com. We're a small team, but will get back to you as soon as possible. Please note we are not Figma support. If you have a Figma-related question, we recommend checking our Figma's Help Center as a start. Their educational content and documentation is incredibly helpful. Figma also have great tutorials for key features, such as components, variants, Auto Layout 5.0, interactive components, and component properties. Do you provide video tutorials? Not yet, but we're working on it! In the meantime, we've done our best to make it as intuitive as possible and we're adding even more notes and documentation to components. Education discounts Do you provide an education discount? We offer a 50% discount for students which is far more generous than our competitors. Please shoot us an email at hello@untitledui.com from your student email and attach a student ID with valid dates before purchasing! Do I need to pay for Figma if I'm a student? Figma's Starter plan is 100% free for individuals. If you want to use more advanced features such as team libraries, you'll need to purchase a Professional plan. However, Figma have generously announced all the paid perks of their plans are 100% free for students and educators! You can learn more at Figma Education. Affiliates Do you have an affiliate program? Yes, we do! We've recently launched our affiliate program — a simple and easy way to make money for referring people to Untitled UI. Get 30% of every sale you refer. There's no limit on how much you can earn. Licensing Can I use it for commercial projects? Of course! We'd love to see it. You can use this UI kit to build any type of commercial business, website, app, or project. You can also use it to create unlimited designs for clients and charge them for your services (we won't tell them). However, you can't use Untitled UI or any assets within Untitled UI to create another UI kit, theme, or template, even if it's not in Figma. Please read our License Agreement before purchasing. Can I use it for multiple projects? Absolutely! You can use Untitled UI for as many projects as you like. Please read our License Agreement before purchasing. What is a user? A “user” is classified as anyone in your team using the Figma files, assets within the Figma files, or the Figma files published as a library in your team or organization. You may share access to the Figma files or a published Figma library with your team members or other users only if you've bought a PRO TEAM, PRO ENTERPRISE, or PRO UNLIMITED license. Do I need a team license? If you're working solo you only need a single user license. However, if you need to share access to the Figma files or a published Figma library with your team, you'll need to purchase a PRO TEAM, PRO ENTERPRISE, or PRO UNLIMITED license (depending on how big your team is). Can I use Untitled UI with more than 12 users? Absolutely! When you get to the purchase page, just choose the PRO UNLIMITED tier. PRO UNLIMITED is perfect for large design teams, companies, and organizations. Can I upgrade to a team or enterprise license? If you need to upgrade your license, we'll discount the amount you've paid for your existing license. Just shoot us an email at hello@untitledui.com. Can I use this to create and sell a similar product? Of course not. You may not use this to build, sell or distribute similar design products on your website or on marketplaces. This includes UI kits and templates for other platforms and software. License agreements exist for people like you. Please read our License Agreement before purchasing. Payments & billing Is it a one-time payment? Just a one-time payment! No recurring charges or surprises, we promise. Do I need to pay for Figma? Figma's Starter plan is 100% free for individuals. If you want to use more advanced features such as team libraries, dev mode, or multiple variable modes, you'll need to purchase a Professional plan. Learn more about how Figma's pricing works. Figma have generously announced all the paid perks of their plans are 100% free for students and educators! You can learn more at Figma Education. Is payment secure? We use Lemon Squeezy and Gumroad to handle the tricky payment process. They use secure 128-bit SSL encrypted payments, so you're pretty safe! Can I get an invoice?

If there are any serious issues with the file, reach out and let us know within 30-days and we'll issue a full refund. None of our competitors offer refunds, which we thought was a bit sketchy. Please note we cannot issue a refund if you simply change your mind after purchasing or are unfamiliar with Figma's features. We back Untitled UI 100% and know you'll love it too, but we ask that you please try out the free version of Untitled UI and preview the full version before purchasing to make sure it's right for you and fits your needs. You'll no longer be able to use Untitled UI in any projects if we issue a refund (including personal/non-commercial projects). We think that's pretty fair! You can read the full refund policy in the License Agreement. Splitting up the library Can I split up the library into smaller files? Absolutely! Figma recently introduced a move published components feature to deal with just this. This allows you to split up the library into smaller libraries that can be published independently. For example, you may want to split the file into four libraries: Styles and shared components Marketing components Application components Page examples You don't have to split up the library if you don't want to — it's entirely a personal preference and it can be easier to manage a single library. We suggest trying out a single library, but moving all the example pages to a separate file once you've published the library. This way they'll always be there if you need them, but it'll remove ~40% of the file size from your file in one go! Why isn’t the library split up already? Good question! Currently, it isn’t possible to import more than one file at a time into Figma without breaking links to instances in the design system across the files. Because of this, the file needs to be imported together and then split up into separate libraries (if you want to do that) after it’s imported. Hopefully, this functionality will be introduced soon! Others Is there a version for Sketch or XD? Unfortunately, no. There are no plans to do a Sketch or Adobe XD version of Untitled UI. Figma is life. Is Untitled UI affiliated with Figma? Untitled UI is not affiliated with Figma or Figma's team, nor is it endorsed or sponsored by Figma. We're just big fans!

Discover what’s new FacebookXLinkedIn User interface (UI) design is the process of designing the look, feel, and interactivity of a digital product. It’s important to note that UI design is not the same as UX—although the two regularly go hand-in-hand. Instead, UI design handles the visuals of the product while UX design handles the functionality. In this guide, you’ll find a thorough introduction to the topic of UI design, covering: Table of Contents What is user interface (UI) design? A definition What’s the difference between UX and UI design? An overview of the UI design process 6 Fundamental UI design principles An introduction to UI design tools and software What skills do you need to be a UI designer? Is UI design a good career path? How to start a career in UI design UI design is a vast and broad field, so we recommend using this guide as a starting point for further research. [GET CERTIFIED IN UI DESIGN] Take our Professional Certificate in UI Design course What is user interface (UI) design? A definition A user interface (UI) is the point of interaction between humans and computers. User interface design is the process of designing how these interfaces look and behave. Imagine you’re using an app on your smartphone to book flights. The screens you navigate, the buttons you tap and the forms you fill out are all part of the user interface. A user interface is made up of the following elements: Input controls: These are interactive elements that enable a user to enter information. Input controls include things like checkboxes, buttons, text fields and dropdown lists. Navigational elements: These help the user to navigate an interface in order to complete their desired task. Navigational components include things like search fields, sliders and menus. Informational components: These communicate useful information to the user, for example through message boxes, notifications and progress bars. Containers: Containers are used to group content into meaningful sections. A container holds various elements, keeping them to a reasonable maximum width based on the user’s screen size. An example of a container in UI design is the accordion menu—a vertically stacked list of headers that can be clicked to hide or show content. UI design considers all of these elements and how they work together to create interfaces that are both easy to navigate and visually pleasing. As such, UI design covers: Interactivity—how the user interface and its various elements behave and function. For example, what happens when a user clicks on a particular button. Visual design—how the interface looks, considering things like colour, typography, imagery and graphics, logos, icon design and spacing. A variety of resources exist to help in this process. For example, the Flaticon website offers an extensive library of free-to-use icons and other graphics that can be implemented in your designs. Information architecture—how the content within the user interface is organised and labelled. A well-designed user interface is crucial to ensuring a good user experience. Now that we have a basic definition of UI design, let’s consider the difference between UX and UI design and how they work together. What’s the difference between UX and UI design? User experience (UX) design and user interface (UI) design go hand in hand but they are two distinct disciplines. Colman Walsh, CEO of the UX Design Institute, likens UX and UI design to architecture and interior design: As Colman explains: if you were tasked with building a new 5-star hotel, you’d need an architect to design the overall structure of the hotel. Before designing anything, they’d consider key questions such as: What are we building? Why are we building it? Who are we building it for? The architect would then plan out the structure of the hotel, considering the layout of all the different rooms and how the guests will move around the hotel. With the hotel blueprint mapped out, the interior designer steps in to consider all the visual aspects of the hotel. They consider things like lighting, furnishings and materials to create a certain look and feel. In the context of product design, UX designers are the architects and UI designers are the interior designers. UX design considers the entire user experience from A to Z, always keeping the target users’ needs, goals and pain-points in mind. The goal of UX design is to create products and experiences that are easy, efficient, enjoyable and rewarding for the end user. While UX considers the overall user experience, UI focuses on the visual and interactive elements a person uses to interact with a digital product. What does the user see when they use a digital product and what touchpoints do they encounter? How does the visual appearance of the interface help them to navigate and complete certain tasks? Which elements should go where? Does the product’s aesthetic capture and reflect the brand? A key difference between UX and UI is that while UI design relates solely to digital interfaces, UX design can be applied to anything, not just websites and apps. Anything that can be experienced can be designed, whether it’s the experience of going into your local bank to open an account, ordering something online or getting directions from your navigation system. UX and UI call upon different skills, tools and processes but both are concerned with usability, accessibility and creating a great experience for the user. You can learn more about the differences between UX and UI design in this guide. [GET CERTIFIED IN USER RESEARCH] Take our Professional Certificate in User Research An overview of the UI design process Just like the interior designers in our hotel analogy, UI designers come in at the later stages of the product design process. Some key steps in the UI design process include: Understanding the context You can’t design the user interface for a product without knowing who will be using it and what they’ll be using it for. The UI designer will start by getting familiar with the project brief in order to understand the target audience they’re designing for and the purpose of the product. Conducting competitor analysis UI designers might conduct competitor analysis to see what other brands operating in the same space are doing. This helps them understand what their users expect when interacting with certain products, allowing them to design interfaces that are easier to use. Designing screens and UI elements Of course, a substantial part of the UI design process focuses on design. UI designers will design all the individual screens that make up the user journey and the different elements that feature on these screens. This includes designing icons and buttons, selecting or creating imagery, making decisions about colours and typography and designing any animations and interactions. Creating prototypes During the UI design process, UI designers will create prototypes, building on UX designers’ wireframes and early drafts of prototypes. As initial ideas progress to concrete design decisions, high-fidelity, clickable prototypes are used to model the final look and feel of the product. With high-fidelity prototypes, UI designers can communicate not only what the product UI should look like but also how it should behave when the user interacts with it. Handing off to developers Once the product UI has been finalised, it’s over to the developers to turn the UI designer’s prototypes into a real, working product. It’s important to be aware that moving from high-fidelity prototypes to development might not always be straightforward as developers and other stakeholders may have feedback, requiring you to iterate on your designs. 6 Fundamental UI design principles There are certain guiding principles that inform the UI design process. These include: Consistency The most delightful, user-friendly interfaces are those that are consistent. UI designers should strive for visual consistency—keeping fonts, colours, buttons and icons uniform throughout the product—and functional consistency, ensuring that certain elements represent the same function or action in all contexts. The more consistent the UI, the easier it will be for a user to get to grips with. Familiarity and predictability This relates to how a user expects a particular interface to function. Based on our experience with similar websites and apps, we learn to associate certain UI elements with certain actions. We also expect things to be in certain places (for example, when browsing a website, we’d usually head to the top of the page to find the menu). UI designers should leverage familiarity and predictability to create comfortable, user-friendly interfaces. Feedback As the user moves through an interface, it’s essential to provide them with feedback. This guides them towards their goal, letting them know if they’ve successfully completed a certain action or informing them if something’s gone wrong. Feedback can be provided visually — like a tick appearing on the screen to let the user know their desired action is complete — or through clear, concise messaging. Flexibility When designing an interface, it’s important to provide flexibility in terms of how users can complete certain tasks. Ultimately, your user interface should be consistent while simultaneously allowing for some degree of customisation depending on the user. Efficiency While new users might require more guidance, experienced users should have access to shortcuts and accelerators which enable them to speed up frequently-performed actions. Accessibility UI designers have a responsibility to create interfaces that are accessible for all users. This includes providing sufficient contrast between text and the background it’s placed on, ensuring that interactive elements such as links and buttons are easy to identify, leaving enough space around buttons and touchpoints and creating designs for different sized viewports. You can learn more about designing for web accessibility here. An introduction to UI design tools and software UI designers use various tools and software to help them create delightful interactive interfaces. Some of the most popular UI design tools include: Sketch: A vector graphics editor used for drawing, wireframing, prototyping and design handoff. Sketch is considered an industry-standard design tool, used by both UX and UI designers. Figma: A web-based interface design tool built for fast and collaborative design. Figma is a vector graphics editor that will take you from early-stage ideation through to interactive prototyping. Gravit Designer: A web-based tool for UI design. Gravit Designer has an intuitive interface with robust vector editing tools and reusable components. Plus, it’s free! You can discover more tools in our complete UI design tools guide. What skills do you need to be a UI designer? If you’re interested in UI design as a potential career path, you might be wondering: What are the most important skills for a UI designer to have? The most important job-specific UI design skills are: Knowledge of basic design principles such as typography and colour theory Familiarity with industry-specific tools such as Sketch, Adobe XD and Figma Wireframing and prototyping An understanding of UX design Knowledge of interaction design principles Knowledge and understanding of information architecture In addition to those hard skills, UI designers will also need to demonstrate: Creativity and an eye for detail Empathy and an interest in accessible, inclusive design A collaborative spirit and excellent communication An aptitude for problem-solving Is UI design a good career path? If you’re creative and visually inclined, UI design can be a very good career path. There are an ever-growing number of websites and apps, and just about every one of them needs at least one UI designer to maintain its visuals. As a result, there are a lot of UI jobs to go around and the pay also reflects that demand. According to talent.com, Jr. UI designers make approximately $60,000/year, mid-level UI designers make around $100,000/year, and Senior UI designers make around $134,750/year. Learn more about UI design salaries with our guide. Importantly, even with the rise of AI, the human knowledge a UI designer brings to the table is still invaluable. UI designers have real-world knowledge of visual design, user research and user behaviour, something AI is unlikely to replicate anytime soon. As a result, UI designers are still invaluable members of the product design team. How to start a career in UI design UI designers can come from any number of backgrounds. You can have a background in web and graphic design or something that has nothing to do with design at all. If you’re a complete beginner, you’ll need to learn the basic skills and principles of UI design, and the best way to do this is through a course. Consider a professional UI design course, especially one that has been accredited by a university, such as UX Design Institute’s Professional Certificate in UI Design. This course covers all the core principles and practical techniques you’ll need to design high-quality user interfaces, plus a project and portfolio module, so you can apply to and interview for jobs.

The updated curriculum with 15 expanded modules includes new examples, case studies and insights from the industry. Discover what’s new FacebookXLinkedIn User interface (UI) design is the process of designing the look, feel, and interactivity of a digital product. It’s important to note that UI design is not the same as UX—although the two regularly go hand-in-hand. Instead, UI design handles the visuals of the product while UX design handles the functionality. In this guide, you’ll find a thorough introduction to the topic of UI design, covering: Table of Contents What is user interface (UI) design? A definition What’s the difference between UX and UI design? An overview of the UI design process 6 Fundamental UI design principles An introduction to UI design tools and software What skills do you need to be a UI designer? Is UI design a good career path? How to start a career in UI design UI design is a vast and broad field, so we recommend using this guide as a starting point for further research. [GET CERTIFIED IN UI DESIGN] Take our Professional Certificate in UI Design course What is user interface (UI) design? A definition A user interface (UI) is the point of interaction between humans and computers. User interface design is the process of designing how these interfaces look and behave. Imagine you’re using an app on your smartphone to book flights. The screens you navigate, the buttons you tap and the forms you fill out are all part of the user interface. A user interface is made up of the following elements: Input controls: These are interactive elements that enable a user to enter information. Input controls include things like checkboxes, buttons, text fields and dropdown lists. Navigational elements: These help the user to navigate an interface in order to complete their desired task. Navigational components include things like search fields, sliders and menus. Informational components: These communicate useful information to the user, for example through message boxes, notifications and progress bars. Containers: Containers are used to group content into meaningful sections. A container holds various elements, keeping them to a reasonable maximum width based on the user’s screen size. An example of a container in UI design is the accordion menu—a vertically stacked list of headers that can be clicked to hide or show content. UI design considers all of these elements and how they work together to create interfaces that are both easy to navigate and visually pleasing. As such, UI design covers: Interactivity—how the user interface and its various elements behave and function. For example, what happens when a user clicks on a particular button. Visual design—how the interface looks, considering things like colour, typography, imagery and graphics, logos, icon design and spacing. A variety of resources exist to help in this process. For example, the Flaticon website offers an extensive library of free-to-use icons and other graphics that can be implemented in your designs. Information architecture—how the content within the user interface is organised and labelled. A well-designed user interface is crucial to ensuring a good user experience. Now that we have a basic definition of UI design, let’s consider the difference between UX and UI design and how they work together. What’s the difference between UX and UI design? User experience (UX) design and user interface (UI) design go hand in hand but they are two distinct disciplines. Colman Walsh, CEO of the UX Design Institute, likens UX and UI design to architecture and interior design: As Colman explains: if you were tasked with building a new 5-star hotel, you’d need an architect to design the overall structure of the hotel. Before designing anything, they’d consider key questions such as: What are we building? Why are we building it? Who are we building it for? The architect would then plan out the structure of the hotel, considering the layout of all the different rooms and how the guests will move around the hotel. With the hotel blueprint mapped out, the interior designer steps in to consider all the visual aspects of the hotel. They consider things like lighting, furnishings and materials to create a certain look and feel. In the context of product design, UX designers are the architects and UI designers are the interior designers. UX design considers the entire user experience from A to Z, always keeping the target users’ needs, goals and pain-points in mind. The goal of UX design is to create products and experiences that are easy, efficient, enjoyable and rewarding for the end user. While UX considers the overall user experience, UI focuses on the visual and interactive elements a person uses to interact with a digital product. What does the user see when they use a digital product and what touchpoints do they encounter? How does the visual appearance of the interface help them to navigate and complete certain tasks? Which elements should go where? Does the product’s aesthetic capture and reflect the brand? A key difference between UX and UI is that while UI design relates solely to digital interfaces, UX design can be applied to anything, not just websites and apps. Anything that can be experienced can be designed, whether it’s the experience of going into your local bank to open an account, ordering something online or getting directions from your navigation system. UX and UI call upon different skills, tools and processes but both are concerned with usability, accessibility and creating a great experience for the user. You can learn more about the differences between UX and UI design in this guide. [GET CERTIFIED IN USER RESEARCH] Take our Professional Certificate in User Research An overview of the UI design process Just like the interior designers in our hotel analogy, UI designers come in at the later stages of the product design process. Some key steps in the UI design process include: Understanding the context You can’t design the user interface for a product without knowing who will be using it and what they’ll be using it for. The UI designer will start by getting familiar with the project brief in order to understand the target audience they’re designing for and the purpose of the product. Conducting competitor analysis UI designers might conduct competitor analysis to see what other brands operating in the same space are doing. This helps them understand what their users expect when interacting with certain products, allowing them to design interfaces that are easier to use. Designing screens and UI elements Of course, a substantial part of the UI design process focuses on design. UI designers will design all the individual screens that make up the user journey and the different elements that feature on these screens. This includes designing icons and buttons, selecting or creating imagery, making decisions about colours and typography and designing any animations and interactions. Creating prototypes During the UI design process, UI designers will create prototypes, building on UX designers’ wireframes and early drafts of prototypes. As initial ideas progress to concrete design decisions, high-fidelity, clickable prototypes are used to model the final look and feel of the product. With high-fidelity prototypes, UI designers can communicate not only what the product UI should look like but also how it should behave when the user interacts with it. Handing off to developers Once the product UI has been finalised, it’s over to the developers to turn the UI designer’s prototypes into a real, working product. It’s important to be aware that moving from high-fidelity prototypes to development might not always be straightforward as developers and other stakeholders may have feedback, requiring you to iterate on your designs. 6 Fundamental UI design principles There are certain guiding principles that inform the UI design process. These include: Consistency The most delightful, user-friendly interfaces are those that are consistent. UI designers should strive for visual consistency—keeping fonts, colours, buttons and icons uniform throughout the product—and functional consistency, ensuring that certain elements represent the same function or action in all contexts. The more consistent the UI, the easier it will be for a user to get to grips with. Familiarity and predictability This relates to how a user expects a particular interface to function. Based on our experience with similar websites and apps, we learn to associate certain UI elements with certain actions. We also expect things to be in certain places (for example, when browsing a website, we’d usually head to the top of the page to find the menu). UI designers should leverage familiarity and predictability to create comfortable, user-friendly interfaces. Feedback As the user moves through an interface, it’s essential to provide them with feedback. This guides them towards their goal, letting them know if they’ve successfully completed a certain action or informing them if something’s gone wrong. Feedback can be provided visually — like a tick appearing on the screen to let the user know their desired action is complete — or through clear, concise messaging. Flexibility When designing an interface, it’s important to provide flexibility in terms of how users can complete certain tasks. Ultimately, your user interface should be consistent while simultaneously allowing for some degree of customisation depending on the user. Efficiency While new users might require more guidance, experienced users should have access to shortcuts and accelerators which enable them to speed up frequently-performed actions. Accessibility UI designers have a responsibility to create interfaces that are accessible for all users. This includes providing sufficient contrast between text and the background it’s placed on, ensuring that interactive elements such as links and buttons are easy to identify, leaving enough space around buttons and touchpoints and creating designs for different sized viewports. You can learn more about designing for web accessibility here. An introduction to UI design tools and software UI designers use various tools and software to help them create delightful interactive interfaces. Some of the most popular UI design tools include: Sketch: A vector graphics editor used for drawing, wireframing, prototyping and design handoff. Sketch is considered an industry-standard design tool, used by both UX and UI designers. Figma: A web-based interface design tool built for fast and collaborative design. Figma is a vector graphics editor that will take you from early-stage ideation through to interactive prototyping. Gravit Designer: A web-based tool for UI design. Gravit Designer has an intuitive interface with robust vector editing tools and reusable components. Plus, it’s free! You can discover more tools in our complete UI design tools guide. What skills do you need to be a UI designer? If you’re interested in UI design as a potential career path, you might be wondering: What are the most important skills for a UI designer to have? The most important job-specific UI design skills are: Knowledge of basic design principles such as typography and colour theory Familiarity with industry-specific tools such as Sketch, Adobe XD and Figma Wireframing and prototyping An understanding of UX design Knowledge of interaction design principles Knowledge and understanding of information architecture In addition to those hard skills, UI designers will also need to demonstrate: Creativity and an eye for detail Empathy and an interest in accessible, inclusive design A collaborative spirit and excellent communication An aptitude for problem-solving Is UI design a good career path? If you’re creative and visually inclined, UI design can be a very good career path. There are an ever-growing number of websites and apps, and just about every one of them needs at least one UI designer to maintain its visuals. As a result, there are a lot of UI jobs to go around and the pay also reflects that demand. According to talent.com, Jr. UI designers make approximately $60,000/year, mid-level UI designers make around $100,000/year, and Senior UI designers make around $134,750/year. Learn more about UI design salaries with our guide. Importantly, even with the rise of AI, the human knowledge a UI designer brings to the table is still invaluable. UI designers have real-world knowledge of visual design, user research and user behaviour, something AI is unlikely to replicate anytime soon. As a result, UI designers are still invaluable members of the product design team. How to start a career in UI design UI designers can come from any number of backgrounds. You can have a background in web and graphic design or something that has nothing to do with design at all. If you’re a complete beginner, you’ll need to learn the basic skills and principles of UI design, and the best way to do this is through a course. Consider a professional UI design course, especially one that has been accredited by a university, such as UX Design Institute’s Professional Certificate in UI Design. This course covers all the core principles and practical techniques you’ll need to design high-quality user interfaces, plus a project and portfolio module, so you can apply to and interview for jobs.

But one framework stands out from the pack: React. React is currently one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks, with so many component UI libraries built on top of it. These UI libraries provide pre-built and customizable components that reduce the development process, enhance code reusability, and deliver polished user experiences via a consistent design system and style guide. In this article, we will look at the benefits of using React component libraries, things to consider before choosing one, and the top React UI component libraries available. What Are React UI Component Libraries? React UI component libraries are collections of ready-to-use or pre-coded user interface elements that help accelerate software development. These pre-designed elements range from buttons, modals, and cards to complex components like data tables and charts. React UI component libraries are created to simplify the creation of user interfaces by providing developers with building blocks and elements that follow best practices in design and accessibility. The Benefits of Using a React UI Component Library Below are a few of the benefits of using a React UI component library: Speed: Using a React UI component library simplifies and speeds up the process of implementing design features and functionalities by providing pre-built solutions. This means we don’t have to write the code for every React component from scratch. Easy to use: CSS takes time to learn, and designing complex user interfaces can be challenging. With React UI libraries, even beginners can import and use the available elements without focusing too much on the CSS designs. Consistency: React UI libraries ensure a consistent look and feel across your application, as they are designed with a cohesive style guide. Productivity: React UI component libraries significantly accelerate development time by reducing the need to build components from scratch, allowing developers to focus on more complex functionality. Customization: Besides offering ready-to-use React components, these libraries are often highly customizable to fit your project's specific requirements. Community Support: Popular libraries benefit from large communities, which means continuous development, bug fixes, and plenty of documentation. You will find that developers often extend the libraries they use with new and unique React components., since these UI libraries often have large communities and maintainers. Accessibility: Many UI libraries prioritize accessibility, making it easier to create applications that are usable by everyone. Top React UI Component Libraries Material UI Material UI is an open-source developed by MUI, it's a react component library that implements Google’s Material Design. It includes a pre-built collection of out-of-the-box components that are ready to use in production. It has over 92.9k GitHub stars and over 3.8 million weekly downloads on NPM. KEY FEATURES Typography: Material UI follows its typography guidelines to ensure all text elements have consistent text styling. Icons: Material UI provides a collection of icons that can be used in your application. The icons can be imported from the @mui/icons-material package. Form controls: Material UI provides a range of form components like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and select menus, to make creating a user-friendly form easy and accessible. Themes: Material UI offers theme toggling customization with support for dark and light modes. You can customize the theme to your preferred choice using the ThemeProvider component. BENEFITS Aesthetics: Material UI has modern, beautiful designs to select from. They follow their very intuitive design guidelines to make sure the design aesthetics are top-notch. Customization: Material UI offers customization options that allow developers to easily tailor components and themes to their preferred designs. Accessibility: Material UI prioritizes accessibility. The library is designed to be accessible by default, making it easier to create usable applications for everyone. Responsive Design: Material UI components are responsive to ensure your application works well on different screen sizes and devices. Developer-Friendly: The documentation is well-written, so developers can easily understand and use the library. The components are also easy to import and implement. Chakra UI This is another fast-growing, popular, and accessible React UI library. Chakra UI is a simple, modular library that gives you the building blocks to build your React applications. Chakra UI has over 37.3k stars on GitHub and 533k weekly downloads on NPM. KEY FEATURES Style Props: Chakra UI makes use of style props to style components.

For this website, we handcraft and style most components using Tailwind CSS. However, for certain components like modals, selects, toggles, radio button groups, tabs and disclosures, we use @headlessui/react.
