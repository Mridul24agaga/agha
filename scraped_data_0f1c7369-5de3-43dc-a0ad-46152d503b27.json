  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, man, let’s take a chill stab at this URL. So, https://automatetube.com/—the name alone is giving off some serious vibes, right? “Automate” and “Tube” kind of blend the whole tech and video-sharing scene. My guess is this site is either all about automating some aspects of video content creation, sharing, or maybe even managing social media. You know how there are tons of platforms for sharing videos? This one might be offering tools to make that process way smoother. Like, think automated video uploads or smart scheduling that saves you from the grind of putting your content out there manually. Imagine a place where you can set it and forget it, and just let the content flow while you kick back and enjoy a drink. Another angle? This could be a resource hub for creators. Like, tutorials, tips, and tricks on how to optimize your video game—totally sounds like something that would be a hit for anyone trying to make their mark on platforms like YouTube or TikTok. They might have guides on SEO for videos, how to create eye-catching thumbnails, or even insights on trending topics to jump on. Or hey, maybe it’s something more community-based—like a spot for creators to connect, share their experiences, and maybe collaborate on projects. You know how the creative scene thrives on connections? This site could be fostering that kind of vibe, where videographers and filmmakers can network and even find partnerships or feedback on their work. Then again, it could also be a tool for businesses looking to up their video marketing game. We all know how powerful video content is for grabbing attention in this digital age. So maybe they’re offering automated solutions for businesses to create and distribute promotional videos, ads, or maybe even social media clips without needing a full production team. Now, if I had to take a wild card guess, there’s a chance that they might even have some analytics features baked in—stuff that tracks how your videos perform, who’s watching, and what’s resonating with your audience. In today’s world, you gotta know what sticks, right? So yeah, overall, AutomateTube is probably all about making video creation and sharing less of a hassle and more accessible for creators and businesses alike. Whether it's through automated tools, community support, or practical resources, they seem to be aiming to empower folks in the ever-evolving landscape of video content. And honestly, whatever the case may be, if it helps people express themselves creatively while keeping it simple, then that's a winning combo in my book! Cheers to that, right?",

Use these free AI tools to take your video creation process to the next level. will transform your video creation so you can learn how to edit videos, faster & easier. Find the best AI video editor for YOU. AI video tools are really changing the game, because they make it possible for anyone to produce high quality video, fast. Best AI video editor is probably inside this video :) I've covered my favorite tools that I personally use for video editing, and for video enhancement. A great AI video creator is also covered in this video. So basically I've listed every single tool that you might possibly need for all your AI video needs. 00:00 Intro 00:06 Tool 1 02:46 Tool 2 04:37 Tool 3 07:05 Tool 4 10:45 Tool 5 12:32 Tool 6 3 comments here are the top five AI video editing tools to turn you into a total video editing Beast all right so check out this first tool and I love it because it helps you create an avatar clone of yourself so check out this video over here so I'm going to play this video and look this is not actually me this is my AI clone okay it's crazy because it looks so much like me but it is a clone that I've created with this tool so look how real the says the movement is absolutely natural okay it looks like me but it is an AI clone it is a completely AI created video which is insane guys I mean it's just it blows my mind because it looks so so natural and of course with this kind of Clone you can create your own social media videos you can also create like normal YouTube videos with this because now you don't need to even be on camera because you can generate yourself with this tool this Avatar of course can speak with your own voice or you can choose any of the pre-made voices the other super cool thing that I love about this is if you don't want to be yourself you don't want to clone yourself you just want to create an avatar that will talk in your videos you can just go here into the Avatar selection and you can choose any of these avatars they all look extremely realistic and they will also speak in the predetermined voice they will say anything that you want them to say okay so you can you can put this person for example into your videos and everything will be lip synced the sound will be awesome and of course they've got a ton of premade avatars both male and female of different races so you can find one of these avatars to be you essentially on camera because that way you can scale your content production and if you shy you don't want to be on camera you can just use one of these avatars to kind of be you but then of course you can also create an avatar of yourself you can see that here I just uploaded a video of myself and I created that Avatar that you saw just earlier so I bet you want to know what tool this is and this is haen guys so hen.com I'll walk you through the pricing they've actually got a free pricing tier so I've been doing everything that I showed you I did in the free pricing tier but if you want a bit more quality you can of course go for some of the higher plans okay but even with the free uh with a free plan you can do three videos per month and you can create your own custom avatar so you can test all of those features and really you know just for some quick tasks you can just get away with the free plan of course you can always open two or three of these plans if you wanted to um and once you decide to upgrade you want some more features then you can go for the for the other for the paid plans but totally possible to start on the free plan this next tool is super awesome because it automates so so many things and I'm going to show you just one of the features here which is called AI edit so I'm here in the dashboard now if I go into AI edit I can up upload a video and it will automatically add images Transitions and sounds based on a particular style to really spice up your video automatically so let's just upload a video here and you can see how with just one click I can make these amazing edits to edit the video and it will create overlays special effects sounds and captions automatically for us which is crazy good step one is go to etsy.com and search for personalized name necklace you'll see lots of stores selling personalized name necklaces this one made 154,000 sales and this store made 2.1 million sales there are also other functions in here for example you can create viral clips from longer videos so you can click on these AI shorts and here you can just baste a YouTube link and this tool is going to break up your longer video into viral shorts automatically and it also has got this function to generate talking videos automatically so you don't need to be on camera you can just clone your own avatar and from there it can create videos just like what you can see here these have been generated from this software without you being on camera it just creates your own clone and then it creates videos just like this so you can Outsource this production of these videos or if you don't want to be on camera you can just quickly make a perfect video of yourself every single time and this tool that I just showed you is called captions AI it's available as applications for iOS Mac Android and you can also use it on a web based basis and you can start for free which is is actually a really generous plan because it allows you to do a lot of stuff for free but then of course if you want to upgrade there are paid plans as well this next tool that I want to share with you is called the script and it introduces some unique and totally mindblowing editing features using AI the script allows you to edit video as simply as editing text and it is super convenient and I use it for a lot of my projects so you can put all of your raw footage into the script the script will then scan all your Raw footage and it will convert it into text format and then if you would like to cut out certain parts you can simply just select them in here and you can delete them so if I don't want this anymore I can just delete this as text and now the script has automatically added the corresponding part of the video to cut out that bit that I've just deleted as text it's also super simple to do automated captions all you need to do is just click these captions button and then from here you've got all of the preset caption formats over here so you can just select which one you want and it will automatically generate and put really nice awesome looking captions for you the script can also automatically correct the eye contact for you so for example if in the initial footage the speaker is looking left and right and not looking at the camera the script can automatically using AI features correct it so that you're always looking at the camera just like it's been corrected over here there are also tons of other features for example if you select all all of this text and then you click this button called ask Underlord so Underlord is the AI assistance so to speak you can then ask for all of these things look at this you can edit for clarity you can make it sound like Studio sound to edit your audio file you can remove all of the filler words you can remove retak so it automatically picks up if you repeat the same thing time and time again like I do with my videos if you do 10 takes it will clean that up and it will remove retake for you it'll shorten the word gaps it can automatically add chapters it can correct eye contact this is what we talked about a moment ago Center active speaker so basically there are so many amazing AI features over here in the script for you with the script you can also get started on the free plan and there are quite a lot of really awesome tools that you can use on the free plan however if you would like to improve your productivity you can go up to the hobbyist or the Creator plan they're also quite reasonably priced starting from about $112 per month for the premium plans this next tool if you're not familiar with it is really going to blow your mind and even if you know it there could be some things here that you don't know about this tool is cap cut it's a free video editing platform which is crazy because it has so many things that will allow you to become a really good video editor there are also AI features here so I managed to make this video in cap cut and there are some complicated animations like for example this animation over here just take a quick look at this okay so this this animation this kind of zooming in zooming out flying in flying out like normally if you wanted to program this manually yourself in something like Premier Pro or in final card this would take you so so long to do because you have to input all of these things one by one but in cap cut one of the features of cap cut that I really enjoy is that there are a lot of pre-made animations so if you don't have super complicated video editing needs it makes it very very simple and easy actually to create these Nic looking effects and you do that by just choosing the part of the video for example this clip and you can go into video and then where it says animation here at the top you can click that and then you can actually control control the start the end and the middle of the animation by using these in out and combo effects okay so all of these effects basically are pre-made animations and look how many there are um these are not custom of course but the benefit of that is that in just one click you can do something that might take like 3 hours to do in Premier Pro so this is how I've created this video I'm still kind of learning a little bit um more about how this works but all of this was done in just one click guys okay one click one click and look how engaging all of these animations actually are and not only that there are also effects over here on the left hand side and they're all pre-made effects for video effects okay there are tons of effects for example like uh if I wanted to make snow fall over here all I need to do is just drag and drop this and snow will fall all right you can see the snow is falling so it's all pre-made pre-programmed like if I wanted to create these fireworks I can do that by just drag and dropping it and there we go we've got the fireworks there are literally hundreds of different effects that you can add uh that's not all you can also go to Transitions and there are tons of transition effects I mean I I don't know exactly how many but there are hundreds possibly thousands in there you can search for the best ones it's crazy powerful and it allows you to just edit really nice engaging videos very very quickly now specifically about AI there are also many AI features you can select the clip that you want to apply your AI to and you can go here at the top to Ai stylize and from here you can actually enable AI effects see all of these AI effects you can even write a prompt for exactly what you would like to happen again this is all AI supported there is AI painting that you can apply AI photos that you can apply there are tons of other effects like text effects see this here this animation uh all of this was just with one click using this cap cut software and guys this was all 100% free once again to use this next tool allows you to create tons of shorts automatically out of any long format video so I could take this tutorial that I uploaded about cing AI I could take the URL of this tutorial and then drop this link over here and I could click this button get Clips in one link and this software is going to create YouTube shorts for me or Instagram rails basically short form content that I can distribute anywhere automatically there are additional features that you can get with Opus clip which is b-roll so automatically Opus clip will apply b-roll to your footage to make your videos much more engaging and all of that is done automatically you can get automated animated captions and caption are really important on social media these days plus you've got other features that you can see over here such as AI reframe brand templates team workspace Etc in terms of pricing it's very reasonable once again because you can start for free what I showed you just before was done on a free plan you've get credits per month of course as with all software you can get multiple accounts if you find that you 60 credits is not enough you can just open two accounts with two emails or three accounts Etc but but if you really want some of the premium features then you can go for some of these other plans which are starter or Pro so it's about $15 per month or thereabouts all right so let's check out this has been processed for us and you can see here are our Clips so Opus clip has automatically figured out what the most important parts that I'm showing are and what most interesting bits of the video are and it has created Clips which you can just download and upload to your social media which is very powerful because it can save you so much time by doing this automatically this next tool that I want to show you is my favorite solution at the moment to produce AI videos it is accurate it produces high quality content and you can use it for free so these are the type of videos look at the quality of these that you can create this is realistic looking and very very high quality of course it can create some uh fantasy Style videos some animated videos like this and I mean the quality is just mind-blowing for each of them you can actually click on the video then you can preview what the video looks like and you can actually see the prompt so if you want to create something similar all you need to do is just use the same prompt and then you will get a similar result so that is also very powerful because you can learn from the other videos and produce similar videos using the same prompts here you can see some of the videos that I've produced in the history okay on this account like this is a zombie video that I generated now guys this is all AI generated with just like one click which is crazy I mean it is so so powerful and this is another one where I asked it to show me being blown away by water okay so that's pretty cool as well I thought okay and these are also all just automatically generated which is really really crazy now if you guys want to learn how to turn your AI video skills into $500 to $1,000 a day how I personally do this you can go to faster videos.com enter your email and you can get access to my training course where I'm showing you how I'm getting tons of views and making money using AI content so go to fast videos.com",

the competitive YouTube landscape 4 comments [Music] guys I'm about to blow your minds a lot of the times people ask me how are you able to make videos for so cheap and have them be so high quality I don't get it it's almost impossible even with the existence of AI so guys previously I've talked about how script writing and voice acting is all able to be done by AI but video editing is still human so although yes video editing is still human I want to take a step back on that because you can make the majority or the base of the video using Ai and looks really good and then what you're going to do is have a video editor a human video editor come and actually touch it up and make it even better to make it act a very high quality production and I'm going to show you exactly how to do it so I'm going to show you the steps that you need to share with your video editor as well or maybe even steps you do and then have your video editor kind of take the rest right so let me just show you something right so this right here is called visla so I created a new account just to show you guys how I do this this right here is called Visa it's a a I video editing tool and it's really cool because not only do you get to create AI edits with your uh narrations or even texts but it also allows you to actually edit the videos on their platform so what you'll do is essentially you can either give it a text or you can give it a uh audio narration that you've already had done by AI using 11 Labs or even another platform like speechify and then essentially what happens is you would provide it with let's say this what I would do is I would give it a voice narration and then it would essentially pair up Clips within its library that match what the narration is talking about and that's so powerful because you basically cut out the video editor almost entirely with it so let me show you guys what I did so I have this voice narration that I downloaded uh that I had somebody do for me and this is an old narration that was actually done by a human but I'm for the purpos of this video I'm going to show you what it does so essentially what you do is you come over here you click upload you know you add video and audio you can also do from text right you can actually have it give you ideas or even input a URL but we're going to click this one so voice and video and then we're going to do is upload that uh file right that MP3 file of the narration uh so I'm going to click here and then it's right here right so it's a space topic that this is a narration that I've done as you can see it's uploading right here uh it's about a 12 minute uh script right it's a it's a 12-minute narration that's already been done um so I already went ahead and did this for the sake of the video but over here once it's done uploading you're going to want to say say render video or create video right and then it looks like over here I already have it done so this is what happens right it actually breaks down the entire video into something that's actually entertaining like check this out I'm going to play this so this is what the video looks like and right now there's a watermark on it because the account that I'm using isn't a premium version but as soon as you get the premium version these watermarks will be removed and you'll be able to access a lot of different features but for the sake of this video and the reason why I'm not showing my actual visista account is because there's a ton of uh confidential stuff on there I I just can't share it but check this out ignore this beginning ignore the beginning 15 space technologies that will change everything welcome back to fact nominal today we are exploring 15 space technologies that will change everything number 15 3D printing in space 3D printing is a process of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital file this proc so I know you're thinking this video is kind of boring and the background music sucks and that is true it does uh so this is the point here you the the beauty of this is you have already created the base of the video so I'm going to fast forward you see the base of the video is already created which means this is the next step so what you can do is first of all you can click edit and you can come through and actually edit each individual scene to match up exactly what what you wanted you can actually completely replace that video right you can click adjust footage or even you can replace your own footage to put it there or what you can do is like let's say you know you did this all yourself and you completely replac the footage with what you wanted and then you you wanted to make it even spicier what I would recommend you doing is finding video editors on Fiverr which uh I actually have a video talking about that exactly but you find video editors on Fiverr and you message them using the text prompt somewhere above or like text uh message you can Mass send it to them and then let them know that you have essentially the video ready for them and then you want a very low price for them to make that video even better and when I say make that video even better is have them use another platform like Runway and what Runway does is it's essentially a text to image or sorry it's a text to video or even an image to video for example look at this photo right here this could essentially be a thumbnail for one of my videos but sometimes what pisses people off is they make they have a thumbnail but they actually the viewers don't end up seeing that thumbnail in the actual video so what this app actually allows you to do is turn photos into actual Clips so this right here this is the photo right I ended up putting it in Runway and actually turned it into into a video check this out so now it's like it seems real it seems like actually part of the video so now you can include this in the video and people aren going to think that oh like they're going to be less mad about you click baiting them right and that's kind of the idea of the whole thing and then look at this right here I used a prompt right here uh and I said show a high a Hightech looking spaceship frying through space past planet Earth and this is the result it gave me it gave me this video right here let's see if we can load and although it's so the prompt I give was so simple and if I get more and more complex I give it more complicated things and I make the scene more specific it will actually give me such a better clip now the point here is that you can use Runway combined with visista to give you a very entertaining video right and then you can end up replacing some of the clips that you don't like that seem too GIC and seem too stock footage like with better Clips right and the thing is this edit that you see visista creating for me is just because I'm using the free version with this account right but as soon as you get the premium version it'll actually give you access to a bunch of bigger libraries and give you just much better options to work with I actually have the pricing right here by the way guys I'm not sponsored by Visa I'm not sponsored by Runway this is just things that I think are really good tools and as you can see if you pay $19 a month you get unlimited everything right which is insane like this is really good stuff uh this is really cheap compare that to an actual video editor so now the reality is an actual video editor is going to cost you $35 to $100 per edit but if you give them the base of the video using Visa and then a combination of Runway or you can have them use these tools themselves and make it even cheaper but use Visa yourself use Runway yourself combine and make it a good video and then send it to your editors you know negotiate with a bunch of editors and find out who can actually spruce up the video or make the video Even Better by just adding things or changing some clips themselves so what I would recommend next doing next is going to story blocks or invado elements or motion array all serve the same function and these websites are essentially places where you can find uh video elements or text elements for example let's go to invado and let's go to uh let's see graphic templates right uh let's actually type in um text overlays right so you're going to want to do is you're going to or if you look at the Visa video right here there's not really any text overlays on any of these clips right it's just straight up stock footage um so it actually looks like Visa grabs this from story blocks which is cool this is one of the sites I showed you so essentially what you're going to is you're going to want want to go over here and find a text overlay that floats your boat you know something that looks very animated and stylish and something that's really going to add some flavor to the video and then you're going to want to download these elements and send them to your video editor that you choose and then your video editor just let them know like hey I want you to go to this video and add stock footage where you or sorry text overlays where you see fit other overlays where you see fit by the way there's there's so many overlays you can add not just text but other things that could add just add a sense of quality to the video uh for example like a glitch overlay like this is something simple that overlays on the video that adds a glitch effect or overlay broken particles or something that just adds a little bit of um a deeper Essence to the video right so find the overlays that you think would work for you and you can send them like 30 overlays um and then send them like one or two text overlays and just have them use those um and then over time your you and your editor will get a better relationship and they'll be able to pump out videos so fast because not only are you sending them the videos using Visa because you can pump out really quickly right but you're also having them you know spice up the video using elements that you send them so um not only is this going to make your video production super super fast but it's also going to allow you to actually upload decent quality videos like good quality videos to the point where you're not going to have a low average view duration right and then so normally like when it cost like $30 to $100 right something like that for a video editor to start a video from beginning to end now it's going to cost you roughly like $10 to $15 Max per Video Edit because all they're doing is grabbing the base of the video going and editing even deeper to make it a lot better and then boom that's really it from there there really isn't much and they'll send you the video back and then you would upload the video now of course if you had a channel manager they would be running all this themselves right but I I do once again recommend that you run the channel yourself you do the beginning initial steps yourself and see how you can actually learn it fully and then find a manager and then teach them fully if they don't know already and then say hey this is how I expect you to run it please run it like this nothing less and they're going to be okay and they're going to do it right um so yeah guys essentially the point here is that you're going to be leveraging AI for the edits for the video edits as well as humans for the video edits you're going to combine those two and make an absolute fast productive and efficient and beautiful money printing machine with these video edits now uh I know like you might be thinking like oh I got to do a bunch of the steps myself in terms of visla and uploading the audio file and making in this video but guys it really doesn't take that that long and the extra steps that I told you with you replacing the actual Clips yourself using things like Runway or even searching the internet for other Clips you don't have to do that you can still have your video editor do that it just depends on the deal you work out with them and how you sell them the vision of how easy it truly is cuz truly if your video editor knew about this tool but he didn't tell you about it and he was just using it without your knowledge he'd be ripping you off he'd be charging you a very high premium but getting those videos done really fast but if you share this with them then I promise you you can work out deal that's going to be able to you know increase your video production speed and lower your video production cost thus just you know everybody wins all over so that's what I recommend doing and now of course there is the step of going to where is it let's go to Fiverr uh let's see if I have that tab open Okay so let's go to Fiverr so this is what I would do I would go to Fiverr and I would find uh uh YouTube video editor right and what you're going to want to do is use the prompt that's somewhere above this video below this video uh to message A bunch of video editors asking them to edit your videos based off what you've already had created using Visa so this base video that you created you're going to hand it over to them um or you're going to let them know that you have the base already made every single time and that you just want them to create the videos and uh or just spruce up the videos and that prompt the text prompt is going to be somewhere around this video but uh essentially we're going to you know click like a bunch of different editors and click contact me and copy and paste that message that is somewhere around this video right uh and then just send it to a bunch of them and try some people on the first page even what I've noticed about fivers is going deeper on like the sixth page the seventh page even the eighth page you can find a lot of cheap and very talented editors uh and the reason why they're so good but so cheap is because they just haven't built a name for themselves on Fiverr and Fiverr is so saturated for their Market that they're just going to have to result with doing work for cheaper so once again I would go very deep you know find people who were have edited things like your videos in the past and just contact all of them and then after you contact like 10 or 20 people which I know sounds like a lot but guys if you really want to succeed in this you're going to have to message 10 or 20 negotiate with them find out if they're capable of doing something and then give them a test video you know say like say like hey this is what I'm going to do I'm going to provide you the base video um here are the elements here the text overlays uh and I also want you to access your own Library whatever that text prompt is going to be somewhere around uh this video so send them that and then negotiate with them see what price you going to work out with them some people you can get as low as like $5 to $10 per Video Edit um which is crazy but I know you're probably thinking like that's impossible but I promise you it's very possible so try that negotiate with them and then give them a test video see how that video comes out if you like what they did so far but it still needs work but you still once again liked what they did so far then stick to that person because you can improve them right and then give them revisions say hey you did a good job but I want you to still do x y and z a little bit better and then have them revise it and then once that revision comes out to your liking then boom you're ready to go Full Throttle by providing them more and more videos now of course guys the goal is to have a ton of video editors like four to five to six to 7even to eight right just all constantly producing content you know several videos a day allowing you to upload several videos a day and then eventually you're going to have a money printing machine where you're uploading hundreds of videos every single week every single month to the point that you're just feeding the YouTube algorithm with so many seeds eventually you know out of a 100 videos it costs so little right but then out of 100 videos if only five of them hit and do really well you're already doing so good and the reality is those other 95 that didn't hit right away don't worry because the way YouTube's algorithm works is once you upload a video to the YouTube's algorithm it's going to be there forever it's going to simmer forever and as soon as the algorithm is like all right I feel like this video is now relevant or I feel confident in it it's going to start sharing it and that's the reality of YouTube that's happened to so many of my videos where over time after 1 2 3 4 all the way up to 7 8 months they don't go viral or they don't even get traction that's okay because they just randomly start going viral and that's the reality of YouTube's algorithm so once again guys uh just to recap on how this works is you're going to want to go to visla and I recommend guys just getting the pro version of it and I promise you these apps are going to get much better so stay tuned but use visla if you want use Runway Runway is an extra step you don't have to uh but you know use Visa uh have it make the base of the video and then even go to YouTube and all over the Internet and gather clips that you feel like might be relevant to each one of these blocks right here replace that video and then once you've done that send it to your video editor and then give them of course the text uh the text overlays or even the video overlays right and then once you send it to them one time you don't have to send it again right they have the text overlays saved on their own computer so every time you send them a new Visa edit they're able to go ahead and actually create keep on creating the edits yourself and even guys if you want to cut out the step of you having to create the videos on Visa yourself you can even add your uh editor as one of the users users on Visa which I think would become more expensive or you can just give them the login yourself and then they can just use Visa as leverage to create their own uh or create the videos themselves and then uh move it over to like an editing app like Premiere Pro or even other video editing apps and just Spruce it up a little bit spice it up a little bit and just make it look like an AB absolute true production right so guys at the end of the day like you don't want to just use Visa without using another video upload the videos like guys honestly this video is boring without being spiced up so once again like these Clips like people recognize stock footage and you don't want that so it's okay to use some stock footage if it makes sense to the actual clip being talked about or like what's being talked about by the narrator but as soon as you start using too many stock footage like for example this one right here this this stock footage clip right here is not good enough it looks honestly just too stocky right it sounds weird but too stocky so go to YouTube go all over the N find clips that match more what the narrator's talking about replace them or even have your n or your video editor do that so that's also the video editor's job is to to replace the clips as they see fit too uh and you know if they send you the completed video and it just looks too stock fo the G and you're like yo editor I I told you like you know make sure it's not stock footage you have it send send it back you know have it send it back just to the point where they understand that you're not going to deal with their so if they end up sending you footage or sorry completed videos that don't look appetizing or don't look engaging or just use too much stock footage or feel too fake keep revising with them so that they'll be able to fix it right then and there and won't repeat cuz think about it no editor wants to deal with somebody who's constantly asking for revision so it's in their best interest it's in the editor's best interest to make sure that they are nailing what you're looking for every time so they will have consistent work without so much back and forth it it'll save them time it'll make them more money it'll save you time it'll also make you more money right so that's really it guys once again use Visa uh use Runway if you want but you don't have to use Visa and then use uh other Clips on the internet combine them send them to your video editor to make them even better and then boom you have a completed video and then you would upload it to YouTube and then that's really it guys it sounds like I know this video is kind of like uh like it sounds like I mean I don't know if it's in depth or how deep it really got cuz you know I'm just recording this right but the reality is you need to get started and I think this is a really cheap fast and effective way to get started with YouTube automation edits so go ahead let me know what you think and by the way guys as always if you need any sort of mentorship if if you need any sort of guidance there should be a calendar link somewhere on this video where you can book a mentorship call with me I'll go through your channel I'll go through your videos I'll go through your thumbnails I'll go through your tags your SEO anything that it is that your channel is not doing right whether it's the niche you have wrong whether it's the editors you have whether it's the team that's just not doing the right the part correctly right I will go through and I'll fix these things for you I'll talk to you about how to fix them and then boom you'll be on an even better path than you were by just doing this by yourself so I I definitely recommend anybody like if you have the money to spend on mentorship definitely do so it's going to set you way past everybody else and um it will really change your life so I hope you guys enjoyed this video uh if you have any questions about this once again just go and ask we'll we'll solve these for you so we'll see you on the next one",

actually breaks down the entire video into something that's actually entertaining like check this out I'm going to play this so this is what the video looks like and right now there's a watermark on it because the account that I'm using isn't a premium version but as soon as you get the premium version these watermarks will be removed and you'll be able to access a lot of different features but for the sake of this video and the reason why I'm not showing my actual visista account is because there's a ton of uh confidential stuff on there I I just can't share it but check this out ignore this beginning ignore the beginning 15 space technologies that will change everything welcome back to fact nominal today we are exploring 15 space technologies that will change everything number 15 3D printing in space 3D printing is a process of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital file this proc so I know you're thinking this video is kind of boring and the background music sucks and that is true it does uh so this is the point here you the the beauty of this is you have already created the base of the video so I'm going to fast forward you see the base of the video is already created which means this is the next step so what you can do is first of all you can click edit and you can come through and actually edit each individual scene to match up exactly what what you wanted you can actually completely replace that video right you can click adjust footage or even you can replace your own footage to put it there or what you can do is like let's say you know you did this all yourself and you completely replac the footage with what you wanted and then you you wanted to make it even spicier what I would recommend you doing is finding video editors on Fiverr which uh I actually have a video talking about that exactly but you find video editors on Fiverr and you message them using the text prompt somewhere above or like text uh message you can Mass send it to them and then let them know that you have essentially the video ready for them and then you want a very low price for them to make that video even better and when I say make that video even better is have them use another platform like Runway and what Runway does is it's essentially a text to image or sorry it's a text to video or even an image to video for example look at this photo right here this could essentially be a thumbnail for one of my videos but sometimes what pisses people off is they make they have a thumbnail but they actually the viewers don't end up seeing that thumbnail in the actual video so what this app actually allows you to do is turn photos into actual Clips so this right here this is the photo right I ended up putting it in Runway and actually turned it into into a video check this out so now it's like it seems real it seems like actually part of the video so now you can include this in the video and people aren going to think that oh like they're going to be less mad about you click baiting them right and that's kind of the idea of the whole thing and then look at this right here I used a prompt right here uh and I said show a high a Hightech looking spaceship frying through space past planet Earth and this is the result it gave me it gave me this video right here let's see if we can load and although it's so the prompt I give was so simple and if I get more and more complex I give it more complicated things and I make the scene more specific it will actually give me such a better clip now the point here is that you can use Runway combined with visista to give you a very entertaining video right and then you can end up replacing some of the clips that you don't like that seem too GIC and seem too stock footage like with better Clips right and the thing is this edit that you see visista creating for me is just because I'm using the free version with this account right but as soon as you get the premium version it'll actually give you access to a bunch of bigger libraries and give you just much better options to work with I actually have the pricing right here by the way guys I'm not sponsored by Visa I'm not sponsored by Runway this is just things that I think are really good tools and as you can see if you pay $19 a month you get unlimited everything right which is insane like this is really good stuff uh this is really cheap compare that to an actual video editor so now the reality is an actual video editor is going to cost you $35 to $100 per edit but if you give them the base of the video using Visa and then a combination of Runway or you can have them use these tools themselves and make it even cheaper but use Visa yourself use Runway yourself combine and make it a good video and then send it to your editors you know negotiate with a bunch of editors and find out who can actually spruce up the video or make the video Even Better by just adding things or changing some clips themselves so what I would recommend next doing next is going to story blocks or invado elements or motion array all serve the same function and these websites are essentially places where you can find uh video elements or text elements for example let's go to invado and let's go to uh let's see graphic templates right uh let's actually type in um text overlays right so you're going to want to do is you're going to or if you look at the Visa video right here there's not really any text overlays on any of these clips right it's just straight up stock footage um so it actually looks like Visa grabs this from story blocks which is cool this is one of the sites I showed you so essentially what you're going to is you're going to want want to go over here and find a text overlay that floats your boat you know something that looks very animated and stylish and something that's really going to add some flavor to the video and then you're going to want to download these elements and send them to your video editor that you choose and then your video editor just let them know like hey I want you to go to this video and add stock footage where you or sorry text overlays where you see fit other overlays where you see fit by the way there's there's so many overlays you can add not just text but other things that could add just add a sense of quality to the video uh for example like a glitch overlay like this is something simple that overlays on the video that adds a glitch effect or overlay broken particles or something that just adds a little bit of um a deeper Essence to the video right so find the overlays that you think would work for you and you can send them like 30 overlays um and then send them like one or two text overlays and just have them use those um and then over time your you and your editor will get a better relationship and they'll be able to pump out videos so fast because not only are you sending them the videos using Visa because you can pump out really quickly right but you're also having them you know spice up the video using elements that you send them so um not only is this going to make your video production super super fast but it's also going to allow you to actually upload decent quality videos like good quality videos to the point where you're not going to have a low average view duration right and then so normally like when it cost like $30 to $100 right something like that for a video editor to start a video from beginning to end now it's going to cost you roughly like $10 to $15 Max per Video Edit because all they're doing is grabbing the base of the video going and editing even deeper to make it a lot better and then boom that's really it from there there really isn't much and they'll send you the video back and then you would upload the video now of course if you had a channel manager they would be running all this themselves right but I I do once again recommend that you run the channel yourself you do the beginning initial steps yourself and see how you can actually learn it fully and then find a manager and then teach them fully if they don't know already and then say hey this is how I expect you to run it please run it like this nothing less and they're going to be okay and they're going to do it right um so yeah guys essentially the point here is that you're going to be leveraging AI for the edits for the video edits as well as humans for the video edits you're going to combine those two and make an absolute fast productive and efficient and beautiful money printing machine with these video edits now uh I know like you might be thinking like oh I got to do a bunch of the steps myself in terms of visla and uploading the audio file and making in this video but guys it really doesn't take that that long and the extra steps that I told you with you replacing the actual Clips yourself using things like Runway or even searching the internet for other Clips you don't have to do that you can still have your video editor do that it just depends on the deal you work out with them and how you sell them the vision of how easy it truly is cuz truly if your video editor knew about this tool but he didn't tell you about it and he was just using it without your knowledge he'd be ripping you off he'd be charging you a very high premium but getting those videos done really fast but if you share this with them then I promise you you can work out deal that's going to be able to you know increase your video production speed and lower your video production cost thus just you know everybody wins all over so that's what I recommend doing and now of course there is the step of going to where is it let's go to Fiverr uh let's see if I have that tab open Okay so let's go to Fiverr so this is what I would do I would go to Fiverr and I would find uh uh YouTube video editor right and what you're going to want to do is use the prompt that's somewhere above this video below this video uh to message A bunch of video editors asking them to edit your videos based off what you've already had created using Visa so this base video that you created you're going to hand it over to them um or you're going to let them know that you have the base already made every single time and that you just want them to create the videos and uh or just spruce up the videos and that prompt the text prompt is going to be somewhere around this video but uh essentially we're going to you know click like a bunch of different editors and click contact me and copy and paste that message that is somewhere around this video right uh and then just send it to a bunch of them and try some people on the first page even what I've noticed about fivers is going deeper on like the sixth page the seventh page even the eighth page you can find a lot of cheap and very talented editors uh and the reason why they're so good but so cheap is because they just haven't built a name for themselves on Fiverr and Fiverr is so saturated for their Market that they're just going to have to result with doing work for cheaper so once again I would go very deep you know find people who were have edited things like your videos in the past and just contact all of them and then after you contact like 10 or 20 people which I know sounds like a lot but guys if you really want to succeed in this you're going to have to message 10 or 20 negotiate with them find out if they're capable of doing something and then give them a test video you know say like say like hey this is what I'm going to do I'm going to provide you the base video um here are the elements here the text overlays uh and I also want you to access your own Library whatever that text prompt is going to be somewhere around uh this video so send them that and then negotiate with them see what price you going to work out with them some people you can get as low as like $5 to $10 per Video Edit um which is crazy but I know you're probably thinking like that's impossible but I promise you it's very possible so try that negotiate with them and then give them a test video see how that video comes out if you like what they did so far but it still needs work but you still once again liked what they did so far then stick to that person because you can improve them right and then give them revisions say hey you did a good job but I want you to still do x y and z a little bit better and then have them revise it and then once that revision comes out to your liking then boom you're ready to go Full Throttle by providing them more and more videos now of course guys the goal is to have a ton of video editors like four to five to six to 7even to eight right just all constantly producing content you know several videos a day allowing you to upload several videos a day and then eventually you're going to have a money printing machine where you're uploading hundreds of videos every single week every single month to the point that you're just feeding the YouTube algorithm with so many seeds eventually you know out of a 100 videos it costs so little right but then out of 100 videos if only five of them hit and do really well you're already doing so good and the reality is those other 95 that didn't hit right away don't worry because the way YouTube's algorithm works is once you upload a video to the YouTube's algorithm it's going to be there forever it's going to simmer forever and as soon as the algorithm is like all right I feel like this video is now relevant or I feel confident in it it's going to start sharing it and that's the reality of YouTube that's happened to so many of my videos where over time after 1 2 3 4 all the way up to 7 8 months they don't go viral or they don't even get traction that's okay because they just randomly start going viral and that's the reality of YouTube's algorithm so once again guys uh just to recap on how this works is you're going to want to go to visla and I recommend guys just getting the pro version of it and I promise you these apps are going to get much better so stay tuned but use visla if you want use Runway Runway is an extra step you don't have to uh but you know use Visa uh have it make the base of the video and then even go to YouTube and all over the Internet and gather clips that you feel like might be relevant to each one of these blocks right here replace that video and then once you've done that send it to your video editor and then give them of course the text uh the text overlays or even the video overlays right and then once you send it to them one time you don't have to send it again right they have the text overlays saved on their own computer so every time you send them a new Visa edit they're able to go ahead and actually create keep on creating the edits yourself and even guys if you want to cut out the step of you having to create the videos on Visa yourself you can even add your uh editor as one of the users users on Visa which I think would become more expensive or you can just give them the login yourself and then they can just use Visa as leverage to create their own uh or create the videos themselves and then uh move it over to like an editing app like Premiere Pro or even other video editing apps and just Spruce it up a little bit spice it up a little bit and just make it look like an AB absolute true production right so guys at the end of the day like you don't want to just use Visa without using another video upload the videos like guys honestly this video is boring without being spiced up so once again like these Clips like people recognize stock footage and you don't want that so it's okay to use some stock footage if it makes sense to the actual clip being talked about or like what's being talked about by the narrator but as soon as you start using too many stock footage like for example this one right here this this stock footage clip right here is not good enough it looks honestly just too stocky right it sounds weird but too stocky so go to YouTube go all over the N find clips that match more what the narrator's talking about replace them or even have your n or your video editor do that so that's also the video editor's job is to to replace the clips as they see fit too uh and you know if they send you the completed video and it just looks too stock fo the G and you're like yo editor I I told you like you know make sure it's not stock footage you have it send send it back you know have it send it back just to the point where they understand that you're not going to deal with their so if they end up sending you footage or sorry completed videos that don't look appetizing or don't look engaging or just use too much stock footage or feel too fake keep revising with them so that they'll be able to fix it right then and there and won't repeat cuz think about it no editor wants to deal with somebody who's constantly asking for revision so it's in their best interest it's in the editor's best interest to make sure that they are nailing what you're looking for every time so they will have consistent work without so much back and forth it it'll save them time it'll make them more money it'll save you time it'll also make you more money right so that's really it guys once again use Visa uh use Runway if you want but you don't have to use Visa and then use uh other Clips on the internet combine them send them to your video editor to make them even better and then boom you have a completed video and then you would upload it to YouTube and then that's really it guys it sounds like I know this video is kind of like uh like it sounds like I mean I don't know if it's in depth or how deep it really got cuz you know I'm just recording this right but the reality is you need to get started and I think this is a really cheap fast and effective way to get started with YouTube automation edits so go ahead let me know what you think and by the way guys as always if you need any sort of mentorship if if you need any sort of guidance there should be a calendar link somewhere on this video where you can book a mentorship call with me I'll go through your channel I'll go through your videos I'll go through your thumbnails I'll go through your tags your SEO anything that it is that your channel is not doing right whether it's the niche you have wrong whether it's the editors you have whether it's the team that's just not doing the right the part correctly right I will go through and I'll fix these things for you I'll talk to you about how to fix them and then boom you'll be on an even better path than you were by just doing this by yourself so I I definitely recommend anybody like if you have the money to spend on mentorship definitely do so it's going to set you way past everybody else and um it will really change your life so I hope you guys enjoyed this video uh if you have any questions about this once again just go and ask we'll we'll solve these for you so we'll see you on the next one"

As a 2016 Knight-Mozilla fellow with Open News, I’ve been working with Vox Media’s product team and Storytelling Studio on tools for video producers. After spending a month doing internal user research, I decided to build an application that enables more efficient and accessible video editing of interviews. This new Mac OS X desktop app, autoEdit, creates automatic transcription from a video or audio file. The user can then make text selections and export those selections as a video sequence, in the editing software of their choice. With autoEdit, a process that once took days or weeks of work now takes just a few hours. Hello, autoEdit Overview of a typical use case. Here’s a basic example of how to use autoEdit. Step 1: Add video. Step 2: Wait five minutes for an automated transcription. Step 3: Explore the transcription and make some selections. Step 4: Export the selections. Step 5: Create a video sequence from the selections in the video editing software of your choice, such as Premiere. See the user manual or this video demo for more details. No Scissors or Tape Required The core function of autoEdit is based on the time-honored concept of the paper edit, something that video editors have done for decades. To make a paper edit, you select lines of text from the transcriptions of your documentary’s interviews—which means you need full transcriptions beforehand. Then you arrange these, putting them in an order that you’d like to see on film. It works well, but is very time time consuming. I was initially introduced to the idea of paper editing while doing an MA in Documentary Films at LCC in London. We learned to do an \"analog paper edit” using paper, scissors, and tape (similar to the one I taught in this workshop). The idea stuck with me, and I tried a bunch of workflows and prototypes, which worked for me but weren’t as useful as a paper edit at accomplishing a few core things. With autoEdit, users can replicate much of what’s useful about a paper edit, but in much less time. And like a paper edit, autoEdit positions itself right at the collaboration point between an edit/video producer and a video editor, and can smooth the communication/collaboration process. So why use autoEdit? Three reasons. It’s a Tool Everyone Can Use When talking to journalists in newsrooms, one recurring need kept coming up: they need tools that require less training and are easier to use. With autoEdit, we’re not trying to replace video editing software. Instead autoEdit allows editorial staff without knowledge of video editing software to produce a “rough cut” video sequence by selecting the text of the transcriptions. Then the video can be refined later in traditional editing software. Why take this approach? Video editing software has a steep learning curve. Furthermore, video editing software is not designed to help with story crafting. Instead it’s made to aid the cutting of video and audio as segments, with no semantic insight into the content. However, editorial staff has great insight into the crafting of the story they are going to tell. This tool allows them to take that further—into the editing of the video—by creating a rough cut without having to open complicated editing software. (Depending on the use case, though, this rough cut might actually end up being the final output, if you are just looking for a few sound bites or quotes for Twitter or Facebook.) It Encourages Better, Faster Collaboration Normally, an edit producer provides a paper edit to a video editor to assemble as a video sequence, and a video editor collaborates with an edit producer on strengthening the story structure by providing feedback on the paper edit. With autoEdit, you can export an Edit Decision List, or EDL, therefore removing the tedious part of reconnecting the sequence manually for the video producer. The current version of autoEdit also allows us to export the corresponding time-coded text of the paper cuts/paper edit. Because this is such a quick and seamless operation, it’s easier to get feedback and iterate on changes. (Future versions of the tool could see a web-based app that would allow multi-user collaboration, Google Doc-style.) All of this allows for better story crafting, both at the dialogue level and the level of the overarching story structure. It’s also great for getting better, more actionable feedback. If you are working for an executive or an external client, getting feedback at an early stage saves time and money. Showing the paper edit text and a video sequence side-by-side generally means you won’t be asked to change as much at the end of the project. Showing a rough cut made in autoEdit accomplishes the same thing. It Puts the Focus on Crafting a Great Story Paper editing—and now, autoEdit—allows you to concentrate on the crafting of your story. This follows screenwriting teacher Robert McKee’s idea of writing “from the inside out” as opposed to the outside in. Writing from “the outside in” looks like this, according to McKee: The struggling writer tends to have a way of working that goes something like this: He dreams up an idea, noodles on it for a while, then rushes straight to the keyboard. But writing from “the inside out” looks like this: Successful writers tend to use the reverse process…. writing on stacks of three-by-five cards: a stack for each act—three, four, perhaps more…. Using one- or two-sentence statements, the writer simply and clearly describes what happens in each scene, how it builds and turns…. With its ability to export selections in a particular order, and move them around, autoEdit helps editors achieve an “inside out” level of storytelling. Future versions of autoEdit will go even further. autoEdit vs. Other Tools In the tools section of my website, you can see other projects that take a different approach to a similar problem of getting an insight into video through transcriptions. Most of these apps focus on slightly different use cases, although some are in the same or similar problem domain of using the text of transcription to get a way into the video. Our use case focuses on factual documentary video production. Building autoEdit at Vox When I first started prototyping the concept for autoEdit, I was working on a series of short documentaries for the BBC Academy. First I started to experiment with a “digital workflow” using Excel. By optimizing the post-production stage of making a rough cut, or what professionals sometimes refer to as a \"radio edit,” it took down the post-production time from three weeks to three hours. That’s when I knew I was onto something. Later as a Knight-Mozilla Fellow at Vox, I was able to build on everything I’d learned and already tried. Vox Media’s brands (The Verge, Vox.com, SB Nation, Eater, Polygon, Racked, Curbed, Recode) provided a great variety of use cases when it comes to video production. Some brands have experienced video teams with documentary filmmaking backgrounds, while others are more focused on YouTube explainers. Teams have a variety of different experience levels and configurations. For example, sometimes journalists and a studio team work together to make videos until a more dedicated video team can be recruited. What appealed to me the most about Vox, coming from a TV documentary background, is everyone’s flexibility and curiosity about trying new things during the production process. And being supported by its storytelling studio team for code reviews, design, project management, user testing and general feedback helped me to refine my product development process. How I Worked I started with user research, keeping an open mind to identify pain points in their video production. I decided to use a lean approach that was hypothesis-driven and relied on frequent iteration. I worked hard on modeling the problem domain because, as Russel Winder says: “If you are able to capture the problem domain as the core of the design of your program, then the program code is likely to be more stable, more reusable and more easily adaptable to specific problems as they come and go.” (Developing Java Software, 3rd Edition, 2006) I also followed a component-based design approach to build the backend of the application. That meant working on key components in isolation and making sure they worked with the provided input and returned the expected output before combining them. Then the paper prototype of the front end came first, aiming to get across features and the user journey, without being concerned about UI. Next, a Vox designer got involved in the process to refine the UX/UI. About the Text-to-Speech API Manual transcription is a time-intensive process that takes three to four times the length of the media. Third-party services that provide manual transcription generally require a 24-hour turnaround time and are often costly. In comparison, autoEdit generates a transcript in five minutes regardless of media length. This frees up time and resources for video producers and ensures they can focus on what story to tell out of the transcription. I considered several text-to-speech APIs including Google Speech, Rev.com, and Spoken Data, but I decided to use IBM Watson, as I found the documentation and API reference very easy to get up and running with a clear price structure, while I couldn’t get my head around the documentation of the Google one. Microsoft’s speech API is claiming close to human accuracy, but I could not find an up-to-date API that supported transcribing more than two minutes of audio to try it out. I did want to make sure that IBM Watson met the minimum acceptability threshold by the editorial staff before building a tool on top of that service. So I built and user-tested a small “Transcriber” app that, when given a video or audio file, would return the text of the transcription from IBM STT Service. Although journalists turned out to prefer manual transcription, rather than editing the generated transcripts, video producers were more than happy with it. One piece of feedback received at this stage from the video producer was to add timecodes to the text to make it easier to find corresponding video and to use it for paper editing within Google Docs. I added the timecode feature and forgot about it while I started working on the second iteration. The editorial product team then received the following feedback from one of the video producers. “… I just wanted to say thank you so much. It’s great. It will measurably improve our workflow and general well-being. You all are brilliant.” Joss Fong, Senior Editorial Producer, Vox.com This feedback showed we were onto something, and it further confirmed my hypothesis: that they accepted the quality of the automated STT, and it was good timing to introduce the next iteration of the tool. It was also great to get more buy in from the editorial products team/storytelling studio. More autoEdit Features Multi-Language Capabilities As reaching global audiences becomes increasingly important, media outlets are beginning to produce content in languages other than English. However, as with transcription, translation services can create a bottleneck. With that in mind, the following languages are currently supported using IBM Watson: English US and UK; French; Spanish; Japanese; Modern Standard Arabic; Brazilian Portuguese; and Mandarin Chinese. Offline Options Using autoEdit, a transcription can be generated locally on a computer without the need for an internet connection. I prioritized this feature because I believe the most interesting documentaries are those at the edge case of video production. Maybe the material you are working with is so sensitive that you don’t want to upload it to a third-party server. You might be in a remote location with slow (or no) internet connection. Or you are on a long flight back from a reporting trip and want to get started while everything is still top of mind. Captioning and Export Support In the era of autoplay social media videos, empirical tests show that captioned videos increase the number of views. Captions are also critical to ensure accessibility. Through autoEdit, users can export a caption SRT file of the video in addition to transcriptions. Once you have proofed your captions for accuracy, it is also possible to use another tool I made to burn them onto a video file without having to use video editing software. This was originally a prototype hypothesis to speed up the captioning workflow. What’s Next for autoEdit The third release will allow users to bring selections from multiple transcriptions into a story outline. Eventually a video preview of the story selection will also be possible in order to shorten the feedback loop. The project is open source as well as freely available. Check out the project page, or download the latest stable release, and see the user manual to find out how to set up the speech-to-text system before getting started. Dive into the documentation to learn more. The project is relatively stable and has been through QA by Vox’s internal team, but if you see an issue or find a bug feel free to raise it here. If you’d like to get involved in the development, this is also where you can find some interesting issues to tackle. We are also using the “Trello style” waffle.io board to keep the GitHub issues organized. Some folks have also shown interest in refactoring the open source forced aligner Gentle into a standalone module that could be self contained and return the transcriptions it creates as a byproduct of the alignment. More info and a proposed solution are in this Google Doc.

Sign up to be kept in the loop. Last but not least Last but not least, I’d like to thank the folks at the Vox product and storytelling studio team, without whom this project would have not been possible. I’d also like to thank the video producers across the various Vox Media brands who have been eager to try and get involved in field testing early releases of the software, providing invaluable feedback.

As a 2016 Knight-Mozilla fellow with Open News, I’ve been working with Vox Media’s product team and Storytelling Studio on tools for video producers. After spending a month doing internal user research, I decided to build an application that enables more efficient and accessible video editing of interviews. This new Mac OS X desktop app, autoEdit, creates automatic transcription from a video or audio file. The user can then make text selections and export those selections as a video sequence, in the editing software of their choice. With autoEdit, a process that once took days or weeks of work now takes just a few hours. Hello, autoEdit Overview of a typical use case. Here’s a basic example of how to use autoEdit. Step 1: Add video. Step 2: Wait five minutes for an automated transcription. Step 3: Explore the transcription and make some selections. Step 4: Export the selections. Step 5: Create a video sequence from the selections in the video editing software of your choice, such as Premiere. See the user manual or this video demo for more details. No Scissors or Tape Required The core function of autoEdit is based on the time-honored concept of the paper edit, something that video editors have done for decades. To make a paper edit, you select lines of text from the transcriptions of your documentary’s interviews—which means you need full transcriptions beforehand. Then you arrange these, putting them in an order that you’d like to see on film. It works well, but is very time time consuming. I was initially introduced to the idea of paper editing while doing an MA in Documentary Films at LCC in London. We learned to do an \"analog paper edit” using paper, scissors, and tape (similar to the one I taught in this workshop). The idea stuck with me, and I tried a bunch of workflows and prototypes, which worked for me but weren’t as useful as a paper edit at accomplishing a few core things. With autoEdit, users can replicate much of what’s useful about a paper edit, but in much less time. And like a paper edit, autoEdit positions itself right at the collaboration point between an edit/video producer and a video editor, and can smooth the communication/collaboration process. So why use autoEdit? Three reasons. It’s a Tool Everyone Can Use When talking to journalists in newsrooms, one recurring need kept coming up: they need tools that require less training and are easier to use. With autoEdit, we’re not trying to replace video editing software. Instead autoEdit allows editorial staff without knowledge of video editing software to produce a “rough cut” video sequence by selecting the text of the transcriptions. Then the video can be refined later in traditional editing software. Why take this approach? Video editing software has a steep learning curve. Furthermore, video editing software is not designed to help with story crafting. Instead it’s made to aid the cutting of video and audio as segments, with no semantic insight into the content. However, editorial staff has great insight into the crafting of the story they are going to tell. This tool allows them to take that further—into the editing of the video—by creating a rough cut without having to open complicated editing software. (Depending on the use case, though, this rough cut might actually end up being the final output, if you are just looking for a few sound bites or quotes for Twitter or Facebook.) It Encourages Better, Faster Collaboration Normally, an edit producer provides a paper edit to a video editor to assemble as a video sequence, and a video editor collaborates with an edit producer on strengthening the story structure by providing feedback on the paper edit. With autoEdit, you can export an Edit Decision List, or EDL, therefore removing the tedious part of reconnecting the sequence manually for the video producer. The current version of autoEdit also allows us to export the corresponding time-coded text of the paper cuts/paper edit. Because this is such a quick and seamless operation, it’s easier to get feedback and iterate on changes. (Future versions of the tool could see a web-based app that would allow multi-user collaboration, Google Doc-style.) All of this allows for better story crafting, both at the dialogue level and the level of the overarching story structure. It’s also great for getting better, more actionable feedback. If you are working for an executive or an external client, getting feedback at an early stage saves time and money. Showing the paper edit text and a video sequence side-by-side generally means you won’t be asked to change as much at the end of the project. Showing a rough cut made in autoEdit accomplishes the same thing. It Puts the Focus on Crafting a Great Story Paper editing—and now, autoEdit—allows you to concentrate on the crafting of your story. This follows screenwriting teacher Robert McKee’s idea of writing “from the inside out” as opposed to the outside in. Writing from “the outside in” looks like this, according to McKee: The struggling writer tends to have a way of working that goes something like this: He dreams up an idea, noodles on it for a while, then rushes straight to the keyboard. But writing from “the inside out” looks like this: Successful writers tend to use the reverse process…. writing on stacks of three-by-five cards: a stack for each act—three, four, perhaps more…. Using one- or two-sentence statements, the writer simply and clearly describes what happens in each scene, how it builds and turns…. With its ability to export selections in a particular order, and move them around, autoEdit helps editors achieve an “inside out” level of storytelling. Future versions of autoEdit will go even further. autoEdit vs. Other Tools In the tools section of my website, you can see other projects that take a different approach to a similar problem of getting an insight into video through transcriptions. Most of these apps focus on slightly different use cases, although some are in the same or similar problem domain of using the text of transcription to get a way into the video. Our use case focuses on factual documentary video production. Building autoEdit at Vox When I first started prototyping the concept for autoEdit, I was working on a series of short documentaries for the BBC Academy. First I started to experiment with a “digital workflow” using Excel. By optimizing the post-production stage of making a rough cut, or what professionals sometimes refer to as a \"radio edit,” it took down the post-production time from three weeks to three hours. That’s when I knew I was onto something. Later as a Knight-Mozilla Fellow at Vox, I was able to build on everything I’d learned and already tried. Vox Media’s brands (The Verge, Vox.com, SB Nation, Eater, Polygon, Racked, Curbed, Recode) provided a great variety of use cases when it comes to video production. Some brands have experienced video teams with documentary filmmaking backgrounds, while others are more focused on YouTube explainers. Teams have a variety of different experience levels and configurations. For example, sometimes journalists and a studio team work together to make videos until a more dedicated video team can be recruited. What appealed to me the most about Vox, coming from a TV documentary background, is everyone’s flexibility and curiosity about trying new things during the production process. And being supported by its storytelling studio team for code reviews, design, project management, user testing and general feedback helped me to refine my product development process. How I Worked I started with user research, keeping an open mind to identify pain points in their video production. I decided to use a lean approach that was hypothesis-driven and relied on frequent iteration. I worked hard on modeling the problem domain because, as Russel Winder says: “If you are able to capture the problem domain as the core of the design of your program, then the program code is likely to be more stable, more reusable and more easily adaptable to specific problems as they come and go.” (Developing Java Software, 3rd Edition, 2006) I also followed a component-based design approach to build the backend of the application. That meant working on key components in isolation and making sure they worked with the provided input and returned the expected output before combining them. Then the paper prototype of the front end came first, aiming to get across features and the user journey, without being concerned about UI. Next, a Vox designer got involved in the process to refine the UX/UI. About the Text-to-Speech API Manual transcription is a time-intensive process that takes three to four times the length of the media. Third-party services that provide manual transcription generally require a 24-hour turnaround time and are often costly. In comparison, autoEdit generates a transcript in five minutes regardless of media length. This frees up time and resources for video producers and ensures they can focus on what story to tell out of the transcription. I considered several text-to-speech APIs including Google Speech, Rev.com, and Spoken Data, but I decided to use IBM Watson, as I found the documentation and API reference very easy to get up and running with a clear price structure, while I couldn’t get my head around the documentation of the Google one. Microsoft’s speech API is claiming close to human accuracy, but I could not find an up-to-date API that supported transcribing more than two minutes of audio to try it out.

Don’t know your experience with programming but you can automate things a lot, for example: Have a text file that specifies which part of each video you want, and join it all together. Like so: family 00:00 - 00:15 etc etc With this you can also add images in between, add a section for music etc. It seems like your needs are very specific so only you can create the perfect tool for your use case. ​ ​ priortTodd Prior tete Sep 2022 I just found that if I recall in a google search… I don’t do much video.

What I do now is: do regular edits → keeps me in the loop of editing have a table with my keyboard shortcuts use simple start and end credits (as a kind of template) use the clip editor with punch in and punch out function for a basic edit ​ ​ 8 months later tete priort Sep 2022 Hey Todd I’m also looking for a tool like Kamua. Actually Kamua would be perfect for my needs!! I’m looking for a software that automatically picks highlights from long videos or/and automatically converts horizontal videos to vertical format and tracks the objects. Subtitle automation would also we amazing. Is there anything like Kamua out there? A reply would be much appreciated!!! Best, Tete trashtete(a)gmail.com 1 Reply ​ ​ hatsnpNuno PaulinoSupporter Sep 2022 If your editing needs are simple(simple cuts, fades etc), you could look into ffmpeg scripting. Don’t know your experience with programming but you can automate things a lot, for example: Have a text file that specifies which part of each video you want, and join it all together. Like so: family 00:00 - 00:15 etc etc With this you can also add images in between, add a section for music etc. It seems like your needs are very specific so only you can create the perfect tool for your use case. ​ ​ priortTodd Prior tete Sep 2022 I just found that if I recall in a google search… I don’t do much video. I don’t have the time it takes… Maybe one day. I will take note of your post and if I land on anything I will get back to you…hopefully some others can help… ​ ​ aadmAlessandro Amato del Monte (aadm)Supporter Sep 2022 This is not exactly what you’re looking for but it is a fascinating adventure into scripting (and very well documented): GitHub GitHub - ltratt/aeschylus: Auto-Editing ScreenCast system Auto-Editing ScreenCast system. Contribute to ltratt/aeschylus development by creating an account on GitHub. It’s more to automate vlog editing I’d say and maybe you don’t want to play with scripting, but check it out. ​ ​ chaimav Sep 2022 I don’t really do video so I don’t know if it meets your needs, but a popular FOSS one is Openshot openshot.org OpenShot Video Editor | Free, Open, and Award-Winning Video Editor for Linux,...
