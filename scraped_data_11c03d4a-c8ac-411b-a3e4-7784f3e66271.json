December 31, 2024 Open Sports: A Gateway to Fitness and the 2025 Games Open Sports: A Gateway to Fitness and the 2025 Games by Andrew Walker / Thursday, 12 December 2024 / Published in Health & Well-Being By Andrew Walker, MPH; NSGA Director of Health & Well-Being Cornhole at the 2023 National Senior Games presented by Humana. If you’d like to be more active or build your fitness in 2025, trying a sport could be the path to take. Do any of these descriptions resonate with you? You want to be more physically active. You were inspired watching your favorite athletes in the Olympics this summer and feel the urge to compete. You recently heard about the National Senior Games (maybe on NPR’s All Things Considered?) for the first time and want to get involved. You already participate in Senior Games but are considering adding another sport for a new challenge. You did not have an opportunity to qualify in 2024 for the 2025 National Senior Games presented by Humana but still want to compete. If you identify with any of the above, follow your motivation and register for an Open Sport at the National Senior Games in 2025. Anyone who is at least 50 years old by Dec. 31, 2024, is eligible to compete in an Open Sport. This is different from Qualifying Sports, which require athletes to qualify at a State Senior Games in the year before Nationals. Open Sports and events for 2025 include Basketball Skills, Billiards, Beach Volleyball, Cornhole (including non-ambulatory divisions), Recumbent Cycling Time Trials, Disc Golf, Golf Scramble, 1-Mile Road Race, Powerlifting, Power Walk, Soccer, Tai Chi, Non-Ambulatory Pickleball (singles), and Triathlon Relay. How to Choose a Sport With seven months until The Games, there are a few things to consider when choosing a sport and sustaining motivation. Get cleared by your doctor to participate. Consider the fun factor. Which Open Sport sounds most enjoyable to you? You’re more likely to stick with something you like doing! Assess your current health and fitness level and what the sport requires. Find a coach and/or club to help you learn the sport and stay consistent in your training. Build a support system to encourage you on your journey. Set realistic goals. Knowing you have enough time and a plan to prepare allows you to feel comfortable challenging yourself to try a new activity. Keep in mind the level of skill and physicality required for a sport when making your plan. Tai Chi, for example, requires a high level of skill. A sport like Beach Volleyball also demands strong fitness. Some additional factors when choosing a sport include: Preference for individual or team sports. Time available to develop a new skill. Cost and type of equipment needed. Access to practice facilities. Once you pick your sport, make it official and register for the 2025 National Senior Games presented by Humana! Registration closes May 15, 2025. Celebrating All Physical Activity Even if you are not inclined to participate in the National Senior Games, you can join the active aging movement. Like the American College of Sports Medicine, NSGA believes that Exercise Is Medicine (EIM) and advocates for older adults to have access to age friendly physical activities of all types. The NSGA’s mission is to promote the benefits of competitive sports, physical fitness and active aging to people ages 50+. If friendly competition is not your cup of tea, that’s ok! We embrace all older adults in their quest to be active and encourage everyone to move more, wherever you are.

Throughout the entire year, there is almost always a game that you can attend. Don’t miss the opportunity to enjoy the sporting performances. It is the perfect opportunity to soak up the authentic American atmosphere that is present at every sports game in New York. Fall and Winter Season in NYC Sports From October to April you can go see the two NBA basketball teams, the New York Knicks and the Brooklyn Nets. The NHL ice hockey season also runs during the same period. Ice hockey is also well represented in New York and surrounding areas, with the 3 NHL teams, the New York Rangers, New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils. From September to January, the American football fans can visit the two NFL teams in New York, the New York Giants and New York Jets. Spring and Summer Season in NYC Sports From April to October, you have the option to attend a game of one of the MLB baseball teams, the New York Yankees and New York Mets. Around the same time, the Red Bulls and New York City FC represent football for the MLS Soccer league in New York. Depending on how the local teams do there might also be some NHL and NBA playoffs games in New York. You actually have the chance to watch professional basketball all year round in the Big Apple, because when the NBA season ends, the WNBA season begins (May – September). In August, New York also hosts the US Open Tennis tournament. Eric’s Tip: “I recommend everyone to attend a sports game. It is a nice way to spend an evening during your trip to New York, especially when you have the chance to sample some of the traditional snacks on offer in the stadiums. Don’t worry if you are not too knowledgeable about the games on offer, because you are guaranteed to have a great time with all the entertainment and atmosphere surrounding the game. Buy tickets for an American sports game in, for example, Madison Square Garden or Yankee Stadium and enjoy the atmosphere!” About Eric Hey there, I'm Eric!

See the sports 2025 schedule here Eric's Index [show] 1 New York Sports Teams Schedule 1.1 Fall and Winter Season in NYC Sports 1.2 Spring and Summer Season in NYC Sports 2 Calendar Sports Games in New York 2.1 Ticket prices New York Sports Teams Schedule New York is home to many talented sports teams. Throughout the entire year, there is almost always a game that you can attend. Don’t miss the opportunity to enjoy the sporting performances. It is the perfect opportunity to soak up the authentic American atmosphere that is present at every sports game in New York. Fall and Winter Season in NYC Sports From October to April you can go see the two NBA basketball teams, the New York Knicks and the Brooklyn Nets. The NHL ice hockey season also runs during the same period. Ice hockey is also well represented in New York and surrounding areas, with the 3 NHL teams, the New York Rangers, New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils. From September to January, the American football fans can visit the two NFL teams in New York, the New York Giants and New York Jets. Spring and Summer Season in NYC Sports From April to October, you have the option to attend a game of one of the MLB baseball teams, the New York Yankees and New York Mets. Around the same time, the Red Bulls and New York City FC represent football for the MLS Soccer league in New York. Depending on how the local teams do there might also be some NHL and NBA playoffs games in New York. You actually have the chance to watch professional basketball all year round in the Big Apple, because when the NBA season ends, the WNBA season begins (May – September). In August, New York also hosts the US Open Tennis tournament. Eric’s Tip: “I recommend everyone to attend a sports game. It is a nice way to spend an evening during your trip to New York, especially when you have the chance to sample some of the traditional snacks on offer in the stadiums. Don’t worry if you are not too knowledgeable about the games on offer, because you are guaranteed to have a great time with all the entertainment and atmosphere surrounding the game. Buy tickets for an American sports game in, for example, Madison Square Garden or Yankee Stadium and enjoy the atmosphere!” About Eric Hey there, I'm Eric!

Throughout the year there are basketball, baseball, ice hockey and American football games in New York, for example, the NBA, NFL, MLB and NHL. You can also visit a US Open tennis match or see two boxing champions compete against each other in Madison Square Garden. In the calendar below you will find games for all the famous leagues and tournaments that take place in New York. Check out the many games taking place during your stay and buy your tickets right away! See the 2025 sports schedule here Eric's Index 1 New York Sports Teams Schedule 1.1 Autumn and Winter Season in NYC Sports 1.2 Spring and Summer Season in NYC Sports 2 Sports Games Calendar in New York 2.1 Ticket prices New York Sports Teams Schedule New York is home to many talented sports teams. Throughout the entire year, there is almost always a game that you can attend. Don’t miss the opportunity to enjoy the sporting performances. It is the perfect opportunity to soak up the authentic American atmosphere that is present at every sports game in New York. Autumn and Winter Season in NYC Sports From October to April, you can go see the two NBA basketball teams, the New York Knicks and the Brooklyn Nets. The NHL ice hockey season also runs during the same period. Ice hockey is also well represented in New York and surrounding areas, with the 3 NHL teams, the New York Rangers, New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils. From September to January, American football fans can visit the two NFL teams in New York, the New York Giants and New York Jets. Spring and Summer Season in NYC Sports From April to October, you have the option to attend a game of one of the MLB baseball teams, the New York Yankees and New York Mets. Around the same time, the Red Bulls and New York City FC represent football for the MLS Soccer league in New York. Depending on how the local teams do, there might also be some NHL and NBA playoffs games in New York until June. You actually have the chance to watch professional basketball all year round in the Big Apple, because when the NBA season ends, the WNBA season begins (May – September). In August, New York also hosts the US Open Tennis tournament. Eric’s Tip: “I recommend everyone to attend a sports game. It is a nice way to spend an evening during your trip to New York, especially when you have the chance to sample some of the traditional snacks on offer in the stadiums. Don’t worry if you are not too knowledgeable about the games on offer, because you are guaranteed to have a great time with all the entertainment and atmosphere surrounding the game. Buy tickets for an American sports game in, for example, Madison Square Garden or Yankee Stadium, and enjoy the atmosphere!” About Eric Hey there, I'm Eric!
