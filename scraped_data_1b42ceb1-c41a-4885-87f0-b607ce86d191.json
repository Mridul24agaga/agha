Here are five other hot trends you should watch out for this year. By James O'Donnellarchive page Will Douglas Heavenarchive page Melissa Heikkiläarchive page January 8, 2025 Stephanie Arnett/MIT Technology Review | Lummi MIT Technology Review_’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here._ For the last couple of years we’ve had a go at predicting what’s coming next in AI. A fool’s game given how fast this industry moves. But we’re on a roll, and we’re doing it again. How did we score last time round? Our four hot trends to watch out for in 2024 included what we called customized chatbots—interactive helper apps powered by multimodal large language models (check: we didn’t know it yet, but we were talking about what everyone now calls agents, the hottest thing in AI right now); generative video (check: few technologies have improved so fast in the last 12 months, with OpenAI and Google DeepMind releasing their flagship video generation models, Sora and Veo, within a week of each other this December); and more general-purpose robots that can do a wider range of tasks (check: the payoffs from large language models continue to trickle down to other parts of the tech industry, and robotics is top of the list). We also said that AI-generated election disinformation would be everywhere, but here—happily—we got it wrong. There were many things to wring our hands over this year, but political deepfakes were thin on the ground. So what’s coming in 2025? We’re going to ignore the obvious here: You can bet that agents and smaller, more efficient, language models will continue to shape the industry. Instead, here are five alternative picks from our AI team. 1. Generative virtual playgrounds If 2023 was the year of generative images and 2024 was the year of generative video—what comes next? If you guessed generative virtual worlds (a.k.a. video games), high fives all round. We got a tiny glimpse of this technology in February, when Google DeepMind revealed a generative model called Genie that could take a still image and turn it into a side-scrolling 2D platform game that players could interact with. In December, the firm revealed Genie 2, a model that can spin a starter image into an entire virtual world. Other companies are building similar tech. In October, the AI startups Decart and Etched revealed an unofficial Minecraft hack in which every frame of the game gets generated on the fly as you play. And World Labs, a startup cofounded by Fei-Fei Li—creator of ImageNet, the vast data set of photos that kick-started the deep-learning boom—is building what it calls large world models, or LWMs. One obvious application is video games. There’s a playful tone to these early experiments, and generative 3D simulations could be used to explore design concepts for new games, turning a sketch into a playable environment on the fly. This could lead to entirely new types of games. But they could also be used to train robots. World Labs wants to develop so-called spatial intelligence—the ability for machines to interpret and interact with the everyday world. But robotics researchers lack good data about real-world scenarios with which to train such technology. Spinning up countless virtual worlds and dropping virtual robots into them to learn by trial and error could help make up for that. —Will Douglas Heaven 2. Large language models that “reason” The buzz was justified. When OpenAI revealed o1 in September, it introduced a new paradigm in how large language models work. Two months later, the firm pushed that paradigm forward in almost every way with o3—a model that just might reshape this technology for good. Most models, including OpenAI’s flagship GPT-4, spit out the first response they come up with. Sometimes it’s correct; sometimes it’s not. But the firm's new models are trained to work through their answers step by step, breaking down tricky problems into a series of simpler ones. When one approach isn’t working, they try another. This technique, known as “reasoning” (yes—we know exactly how loaded that term is), can make this technology more accurate, especially for math, physics, and logic problems. Related Story What are AI agents? The next big thing is AI tools that can do more complex tasks. Here’s how they will work. It’s also crucial for agents. In December, Google DeepMind revealed an experimental new web-browsing agent called Mariner. In the middle of a preview demo that the company gave to MIT Technology Review, Mariner seemed to get stuck. Megha Goel, a product manager at the company, had asked the agent to find her a recipe for Christmas cookies that looked like the ones in a photo she’d given it. Mariner found a recipe on the web and started adding the ingredients to Goel’s online grocery basket. Then it stalled; it couldn’t figure out what type of flour to pick. Goel watched as Mariner explained its steps in a chat window: “It says, ‘I will use the browser’s Back button to return to the recipe.’” It was a remarkable moment. Instead of hitting a wall, the agent had broken the task down into separate actions and picked one that might resolve the problem. Figuring out you need to click the Back button may sound basic, but for a mindless bot it’s akin to rocket science. And it worked: Mariner went back to the recipe, confirmed the type of flour, and carried on filling Goel’s basket. Google DeepMind is also building an experimental version of Gemini 2.0, its latest large language model, that uses this step-by-step approach to problem solving, called Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking. But OpenAI and Google are just the tip of the iceberg. Many companies are building large language models that use similar techniques, making them better at a whole range of tasks, from cooking to coding. Expect a lot more buzz about reasoning (we know, we know) this year. —Will Douglas Heaven 3. It’s boom time for AI in science One of the most exciting uses for AI is speeding up discovery in the natural sciences. Perhaps the greatest vindication of AI’s potential on this front came last October, when the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry to Demis Hassabis and John M. Jumper from Google DeepMind for building the AlphaFold tool, which can solve protein folding, and to David Baker for building tools to help design new proteins. Expect this trend to continue next year, and to see more data sets and models that are aimed specifically at scientific discovery. Proteins were the perfect target for AI, because the field had excellent existing data sets that AI models could be trained on. The hunt is on to find the next big thing. One potential area is materials science. Meta has released massive data sets and models that could help scientists use AI to discover new materials much faster, and in December, Hugging Face, together with the startup Entalpic, launched LeMaterial, an open-source project that aims to simplify and accelerate materials research. Their first project is a data set that unifies, cleans, and standardizes the most prominent material data sets. AI model makers are also keen to pitch their generative products as research tools for scientists. OpenAI let scientists test its latest o1 model and see how it might support them in research. The results were encouraging. Having an AI tool that can operate in a similar way to a scientist is one of the fantasies of the tech sector. In a manifesto published in October last year, Anthropic founder Dario Amodei highlighted science, especially biology, as one of the key areas where powerful AI could help. Amodei speculates that in the future, AI could be not only a method of data analysis but a “virtual biologist who performs all the tasks biologists do.” We’re still a long way away from this scenario. But next year, we might see important steps toward it. —Melissa Heikkilä 4. AI companies get cozier with national security There is a lot of money to be made by AI companies willing to lend their tools to border surveillance, intelligence gathering, and other national security tasks. The US military has launched a number of initiatives that show it’s eager to adopt AI, from the Replicator program—which, inspired by the war in Ukraine, promises to spend $1 billion on small drones—to the Artificial Intelligence Rapid Capabilities Cell, a unit bringing AI into everything from battlefield decision-making to logistics. European militaries are under pressure to up their tech investment, triggered by concerns that Donald Trump’s administration will cut spending to Ukraine. Rising tensions between Taiwan and China weigh heavily on the minds of military planners, too. Related Story What’s next for our privacy? The US still has no federal privacy law. But recent enforcement actions against data brokers may offer some new protections for Americans’ personal information. In 2025, these trends will continue to be a boon for defense-tech companies like Palantir, Anduril, and others, which are now capitalizing on classified military data to train AI models. The defense industry’s deep pockets will tempt mainstream AI companies into the fold too. OpenAI in December announced it is partnering with Anduril on a program to take down drones, completing a year-long pivot away from its policy of not working with the military. It joins the ranks of Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, which have worked with the Pentagon for years. Other AI competitors, which are spending billions to train and develop new models, will face more pressure in 2025 to think seriously about revenue. It’s possible that they’ll find enough non-defense customers who will pay handsomely for AI agents that can handle complex tasks, or creative industries willing to spend on image and video generators. But they’ll also be increasingly tempted to throw their hats in the ring for lucrative Pentagon contracts. Expect to see companies wrestle with whether working on defense projects will be seen as a contradiction to their values. OpenAI’s rationale for changing its stance was that “democracies should continue to take the lead in AI development,” the company wrote, reasoning that lending its models to the military would advance that goal. In 2025, we’ll be watching others follow its lead. —James O’Donnell 5. Nvidia sees legitimate competition For much of the current AI boom, if you were a tech startup looking to try your hand at making an AI model, Jensen Huang was your man. As CEO of Nvidia, the world’s most valuable corporation, Huang helped the company become the undisputed leader of chips used both to train AI models and to ping a model when anyone uses it, called “inferencing.” A number of forces could change that in 2025. For one, behemoth competitors like Amazon, Broadcom, AMD, and others have been investing heavily in new chips, and there are early indications that these could compete closely with Nvidia’s—particularly for inference, where Nvidia’s lead is less solid. A growing number of startups are also attacking Nvidia from a different angle. Rather than trying to marginally improve on Nvidia’s designs, startups like Groq are making riskier bets on entirely new chip architectures that, with enough time, promise to provide more efficient or effective training. In 2025 these experiments will still be in their early stages, but it’s possible that a standout competitor will change the assumption that top AI models rely exclusively on Nvidia chips. Underpinning this competition, the geopolitical chip war will continue. That war thus far has relied on two strategies. On one hand, the West seeks to limit exports to China of top chips and the technologies to make them. On the other, efforts like the US CHIPS Act aim to boost domestic production of semiconductors. Donald Trump may escalate those export controls and has promised massive tariffs on any goods imported from China. In 2025, such tariffs would put Taiwan—on which the US relies heavily because of the chip manufacturer TSMC—at the center of the trade wars. That’s because Taiwan has said it will help Taiwanese firms operating in China relocate back to the island to help them avoid the proposed tariffs. That could draw further criticism from Trump, who has expressed frustration with US spending to defend Taiwan from China. It’s unclear how these forces will play out, but it will only further incentivize chipmakers to reduce reliance on Taiwan, which is the entire purpose of the CHIPS Act. As spending from the bill begins to circulate, next year could bring the first evidence of whether it’s materially boosting domestic chip production. —James O’Donnell Correction: we have clarified that Taiwan's Economy Minister was talking about Taiwanese firms being relocated back to Taiwan. hide by James O'Donnell, Will Douglas Heaven, & Melissa Heikkilä Share Share story on linkedin Share story on facebook Share story on email Popular 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2025Amy Nordrum AI means the end of internet search as we’ve known itMat Honan How a top Chinese AI model overcame US sanctionsCaiwei Chen OpenAI has created an AI model for longevity scienceAntonio Regalado Deep Dive Artificial intelligence ### AI means the end of internet search as we’ve known it Despite fewer clicks, copyright fights, and sometimes iffy answers, AI could unlock new ways to summon all the world’s knowledge.

Here are five other hot trends you should watch out for this year. By James O'Donnellarchive page Will Douglas Heavenarchive page Melissa Heikkiläarchive page January 8, 2025 Stephanie Arnett/MIT Technology Review | Lummi MIT Technology Review_’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here._ For the last couple of years we’ve had a go at predicting what’s coming next in AI. A fool’s game given how fast this industry moves. But we’re on a roll, and we’re doing it again. How did we score last time round? Our four hot trends to watch out for in 2024 included what we called customized chatbots—interactive helper apps powered by multimodal large language models (check: we didn’t know it yet, but we were talking about what everyone now calls agents, the hottest thing in AI right now); generative video (check: few technologies have improved so fast in the last 12 months, with OpenAI and Google DeepMind releasing their flagship video generation models, Sora and Veo, within a week of each other this December); and more general-purpose robots that can do a wider range of tasks (check: the payoffs from large language models continue to trickle down to other parts of the tech industry, and robotics is top of the list). We also said that AI-generated election disinformation would be everywhere, but here—happily—we got it wrong. There were many things to wring our hands over this year, but political deepfakes were thin on the ground. So what’s coming in 2025? We’re going to ignore the obvious here: You can bet that agents and smaller, more efficient, language models will continue to shape the industry. Instead, here are five alternative picks from our AI team. 1. Generative virtual playgrounds If 2023 was the year of generative images and 2024 was the year of generative video—what comes next? If you guessed generative virtual worlds (a.k.a. video games), high fives all round. We got a tiny glimpse of this technology in February, when Google DeepMind revealed a generative model called Genie that could take a still image and turn it into a side-scrolling 2D platform game that players could interact with. In December, the firm revealed Genie 2, a model that can spin a starter image into an entire virtual world. Other companies are building similar tech. In October, the AI startups Decart and Etched revealed an unofficial Minecraft hack in which every frame of the game gets generated on the fly as you play. And World Labs, a startup cofounded by Fei-Fei Li—creator of ImageNet, the vast data set of photos that kick-started the deep-learning boom—is building what it calls large world models, or LWMs. One obvious application is video games. There’s a playful tone to these early experiments, and generative 3D simulations could be used to explore design concepts for new games, turning a sketch into a playable environment on the fly. This could lead to entirely new types of games. But they could also be used to train robots. World Labs wants to develop so-called spatial intelligence—the ability for machines to interpret and interact with the everyday world. But robotics researchers lack good data about real-world scenarios with which to train such technology. Spinning up countless virtual worlds and dropping virtual robots into them to learn by trial and error could help make up for that. —Will Douglas Heaven 2. Large language models that “reason” The buzz was justified. When OpenAI revealed o1 in September, it introduced a new paradigm in how large language models work. Two months later, the firm pushed that paradigm forward in almost every way with o3—a model that just might reshape this technology for good. Most models, including OpenAI’s flagship GPT-4, spit out the first response they come up with. Sometimes it’s correct; sometimes it’s not. But the firm's new models are trained to work through their answers step by step, breaking down tricky problems into a series of simpler ones. When one approach isn’t working, they try another. This technique, known as “reasoning” (yes—we know exactly how loaded that term is), can make this technology more accurate, especially for math, physics, and logic problems.

See how AI enhances efficiency, solves problems, and transforms industries. Join the AI revolution! Generate Free AI Documents! Table of Contents Types of AI Examples of real-life Artificial Intelligence in our everyday life The potential of AI to transform our daily routines How AI is making our lives easier The future of AI is now Introduction The recent ChatGPT buzz has become a key example of what Artificial intelligence (AI) can do in our everyday lives. AI can perform tasks that have traditionally depended on human intelligence, like: Speech recognition. Language translation. Decision-making. Fraud detection. ... and many more. Today, AI has come to the forefront of many industries. Just to name a few: Using ChatGPT for writing. Web development. Coding. Healthcare. Entertainment. Robotics. General engineering. Artificial intelligence has become so pervasive that we encounter it daily, anywhere. In this article, we'll explore real-life AI examples that are changing how we operate, live and work. Before diving into examples of AI in everyday life, let's define what AI is. What is Artificial Intelligence? Artificial intelligence (AI) includes smart machines and computer systems that use simulation to perform tasks and activities which typically require human intelligence. Specific applications of AI in technology include: Natural language processing (NLP). Expert systems. Speech recognition. Machine vision. AI machines and systems can remember behavior patterns and adapt their activities or responses to conform to those behaviors, change or improve them. Here’s an example of AI at work. How does AI work? AI systems work by: Consuming large amounts of data (labeled training data). Analyzing it for correlations and patterns. Using the patterns to predict future states. When we talk about AI, we're talking about: Machine Learning (ML). Machines can learn to respond better based on structured and historical data sets. They also learn from algorithms and humans. Deep Learning (DPL). A more advanced type of ML that learns through representation but with unstructured data sets. Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is a linguistic tool that enables machines to learn, read, interpret and respond to human language. Computer Vision (CV). This technology enables computerized machines to interpret visual information like images or videos. These technologies allow computer machines to model or sometimes improve upon human capabilities. The smart way to create and manage documentation Try Scribe free Types of AI There are four categories or types of artificial intelligence: Reactive machines AI Limited memory AI Theory of mind Self-awareness Reactive machines AI designed to complete a limited number of specialized duties. Limited memory AI systems have memory and can store information/data. They can use past data or experiences to inform future decisions. Theory of mind... well, this is still just a theory. Theory of mind will be when the AI system can grasp the concept of \"mind\" and how it works. We're not there yet. Once AI can achieve or establish theory of mind, AI will theoretically become self-aware. Movies like The Terminator brought this category of AI into the public eye (Skynet became self-aware on August 29, 1997!). But it means that AI would understand its existence in the world. Examples of real-life Artificial Intelligence in our everyday life While we're still some years away from Skynet (we hope!), AI is already a part of our lives. Current AI technology has many forms, from chatbots to wearables and navigation apps. Here are a few examples of how AI applications are used daily. 1. Screen recorders & documentation automation Screen recorders and documentation automation tools are AI-powered technologies that capture and record computer screens. They help automate documentation, standard operating procedures (SOPS) and testing processes to improve staff and customer experience. Screen capture tools like Scribe can create tutorials, training materials and presentations. Scribe AI is a generative AI platform that helps your team automatically document any process—SOPs, new user guides, help centers and more—for any application. AI-powered process documentation = How-to magic! See how Scribe builds beautiful step-by-step guides in seconds — not hours. Get Scribe Free Just tell Scribe AI what you need (\"Help me create a SOP for how to analyze data with Google Sheets\"), select which Scribes you want to include, and kick back while AI does the rest. 2. Smart Assistants (& Home assistants) One of the most recognizable AI examples is the smart assistant (or smart assistants), such as Siri, Alexa, Cortana and Google Home Assistant. (Source: geeksfl.com) ‎They use natural language processing (NLP), ML, statistical analysis and algorithmic execution to understand verbal commands and respond appropriately. Smart assistants can help with tasks like setting reminders, playing music, making calls or ordering products online. They do all of this based on user voice commands, inputs or experiences. Here are a few examples of how smart assistants are making our lives easier: Alexa for Business can help with note-taking, to-do lists and setting up alarms in advance of meetings. Cortana can manage an employee’s calendar, take notes and give you reminders with alarms for important meetings. Siri can type texts and emails for you, run internet searches and call contacts among others. Many people use home assistants for other parts of their lives: Thermostat devices powered by AI (like Nest). Digital lighting systems that conserve energy. Smart speakers. Apps and smart light bulbs that change light colors (like Phillips or Wiz). 3. Chatbots Chatbots like Apple's iMessage, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and website chatbots are AI-powered programs that simulate human conversations using text or voice. They use NLP to understand and respond to user queries in voice or text. Chatbots are used in customer service, tech support or even as virtual assistants for a variety of tasks, including: Answering customer queries. Providing recommendations. Performing transactions. Resolving issues without human intervention. ) 4. Prompt writing chatbots Prompt writing is a type of AI that can generate text based on a prompt or set of instructions. This technology is being used in a variety of applications, such as generating creative content, writing emails and even writing code. AI-powered prompt writing can suggest sentences, phrases or complete document creation to users as they type. Today, the most talked about AI prompt writing chatbots are ChatGPT and now Google Bard. They can produce written content in various formats: essays, code and answers to questions. ChatGPT and Google Bard are powered by a NLP that allows them to emulate human writing closely. Other AI writing software include Jasper.ai, Copy.ai, WordAi, Grammarly and Notion AI. You can also use Scribe AI Text Generator for improved productivity. 📌 Featured resource: The Top 7 Best AI Software to Fast Track Your Team’s Growth in 2023 5. GoogleMaps & Apple Maps (travel & navigation) Google and Apple Maps use location data from smartphones to give directions. They also use user-reported data on things like construction and car accidents to monitor the web and flow of traffic and assess optimal routes. These maps are widely used in the hiking industry as well. Experienced managers from reputable hiking agencies often have and recommend their tourists to apply for Google and Apple Maps. For instance, if a traveler climbs the highest peak in Africa, he needs to have a detailed notion of all the path conditions. The use of the above maps technology will provide both parties with all the accurate Kilimanjaro routes and trails that will make the hike safe and clear. 6. Search & personalized recommendation algorithms Search engines and e-commerce platforms use AI-based search and personalized recommendation algorithms to offer personalized results and recommendations. Using AI and ML, they learn about our interests and preferences to suggest content that we are likely to be interested in. Here are a few examples of how search algorithms simplify our lives: Google's AI search algorithm analyzes user queries and provides search results that best fit what we're searching for. Amazon's AI recommendation algorithm suggests products based on purchase history. Netflix uses watch or search history to recommend what to watch based on the user's viewing history. 7. Music & video streaming Spotify, Netflix, YouTube, and other streaming sites provide recommendations and suggest playlists on music apps. AI uses a personalized recommendation algorithm to track the music and videos you watch or listen to most. The recommendations become more relevant to your likes over time. 8. E-payments This AI technology enables us to make transactions electronically. We use e-payments like bank transfers, Apple Pay, Google Wallet, and PayPal, every day. E-payments are a convenient and secure way to make payments online. 9. Social media feeds Social media feeds use AI-powered systems to monitor content, suggest connections and personalize users' feeds and ads based on their interests and preferences. Whether it's the algorithmic timeline on Twitter, friend suggestions on Facebook, Instagram's explore page, or tracking TikTok views, AI plays a pivotal role in shaping the content users encounter and the connections they make, creating a more personalized and dynamic social media experience. 10. Wearables Wearables, like smartwatches and fitness trackers, use sensors and apply deep learning to assess the patient's physical activity rate or health condition.

And of course there's auto-complete, grammatical error correctors, language translators, social media feeds and more. What's different with ChatGPT/Dall.e is that now AI is the value proposition and what you can do with is very open. I saw demos of generative AI being used to power a SaaS which creates online courses automatically based on content you feed it, gather intelligence from many different sources (like the dark web) and enable security analysts to monitor threats and analyze academic research papers.

According to one survey of 6,000 consumers, while only 33% of people think that they use AI, over 77% use an AI-powered service or device. It’s not surprising that people are unaware of all the ways AI touches their lives. After all, the development of AI surged over recent years as researchers made strides they didn’t expect to make for another several decades. So what are some common uses and applications of AI? You may be surprised to learn that it can be anything from advanced robotics to the voice search function on your smartphone. We’ll dive into more specific examples below. In this article, we’ll cover: What is artificial intelligence? Examples and applications of AI Digital Assistants Search engines Social media Online shopping Robots Transportation and navigation Text editing and autocorrect Fraud prevention Predictions Gaming Healthcare Advertising Analytics Business and AI What is artificial intelligence? Artificial intelligence is a specific branch of computer science concerned with replicating the thought process and decision-making ability of humans through computer algorithms. There are many different branches of AI that can create and do different things. Some types complete simple tasks, while others are much more complex. Some AI programs adjust their own algorithms, and some specialized algorithms are so advanced they can beat human experts in their given fields. Learn more about artificial intelligence. Examples and applications of AI So what are some examples of AI? Well, it can be almost anything. Your smartphone uses AI, as do services like digital assistants, chatbots, social media websites, and much more. Many home electronics also use AI, such as robot vacuum cleaners or security systems. And, of course, there are classic examples of auto-navigation and robotics. Below, we’ve outlined applications in greater detail so you can understand how AI impacts everyday life. Digital assistants Perhaps the application used by most people would be the digital assistants on our various pieces of technology. If you have a smartphone or laptop, you probably have and use digital assistant software to some degree. Some of the most popular digital assistants include: Siri (Apple) Alexa (Amazon) Cortana (Microsoft) Google Assistant (Google) Bixby (Samsung) Search engines Another common application of AI is search engines. Search engine algorithms utilize AI to refine and show better results without the intervention of programmers. You can see this in action on Google if you search a question. You’ll see a section called “People also ask” and if you open one of those questions, it will spawn two more related questions below. An even simpler example is Google’s auto-complete answers when you type in the search bar. An AI algorithm gathers data on what people search most often and uses that to populate predictions you can use to navigate. Popular search engines include: Google Yahoo Bing DuckDuckGo Social media Social media platforms are another common way people interact with AI. All major social media platforms run off AI-powered algorithms which are designed to serve specific purposes. Most use algorithms to determine what their users like and serve more of that content, to keep the user engaged. Many also run AI algorithms to gather and store user data to use for advertising purposes. You can train your social media algorithms to show the content you like by creating filters, or searching carefully for what you like, and purposefully interacting (liking, commenting, sharing, etc.) with things you enjoy. Popular social media platforms include: Facebook (Meta) Instagram (Meta) YouTube TikTok Online shopping This is probably one of the least obvious ways people interact with AI in their daily lives. Many online shopping and ecommerce platforms use AI to streamline their customer experience in a variety of ways. As a customer, you may experience AI through: Personalized product recommendations based on previous shopping activity or customer profile. Pricing optimization based on supply, demand, or previous shopping activity. Chatbots to provide instant responses to customer service or technical issues. Shipping and delay estimates. As a business owner, you may consider implementing AI in the following additional ways: Sales and demand forecasting to help you manage your inventory in the face of increased or decreased demand. Creating customer profiles and segmentation to boost sales. Smart analytics to show in real-time how your business is performing. Robots The word “robot” probably makes many people think of sci-fi movies like Star Wars or shows like Star Trek with their humanoid, intelligent robots. Though those may seem futuristic or even far-fetched, in reality, many robots already exist in our world. You may even own some, or something produced by one. Robots are used in a myriad of fields to streamline production or keep workers safe. They handle repetitive tasks or anything deemed too dangerous for a human worker. Some examples of industrial robots include: Aerospace: You may be familiar with the Mars rovers NASA has landed over the years. These are programmed to explore, gather samples and send transmissions back to Earth to provide data from Mars that an astronaut would be unable to obtain. Most recently, NASA sent the rover Perseverance to Mars to gather samples and search for signs of ancient life. Manufacturing: The use of robots in assembly lines dates back to 1961, when General Motors introduced a robot to assist with welding and transporting die casings (jobs deemed too dangerous for humans). It continues to this day, streamlining production and providing safer working conditions for humans. Hospitality: Particularly in recent years, the hospitality industry has adopted robots to help complete simple tasks and fill in for worker shortages. These can do things like check-in guests at hotels, mix drinks at cafes, deliver meals to tables in restaurants, and more. Create beautiful visualizations with your data. Try Tableau for free Transportation and Navigation You’ve probably heard of self-driving cars, whether in a sci-fi show or in the news from recent attempts by various companies. But there are more ways that AI is utilized in transportation. Most major map software uses some kind of AI to interpret real-time traffic data and provide routes and ETAs. Additionally, many aircraft use an AI-powered autopilot that takes in weather conditions and flight data to set the course. In fact, studies show that the application of AI in transportation has made it safer, more efficient, and more reliable. Other examples of AI in transportation and navigation include: Traffic management systems take in real-time data about the road, weather, and traffic conditions to predict heavier traffic flows and congestion. Direction apps such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze all use location data collected from users to determine traffic, ETAs, and more. Rideshare apps, much like direction apps, use AI that takes in location and environmental data to give ETAs, predict road conditions, and set fare rates. Text editing and autocorrect Another example of AI in the palm of your hand (if you have a smartphone, anyway) is autocorrect and other text editing software. This software takes input from generalized dictionaries and common use but also learns from your specific patterns to pick up the words you use most frequently and help you spell them. Other online text editors like Grammarly or Hemingway App take standards of style, length, and grammar, and compare them to your texts, generating reports on errors and readability stats. Some of them also analyze other online content in real-time to compare for originality. Fraud prevention If you have an account with any major bank, chances are they use AI in their fraud detection and prevention systems. These work by analyzing thousands of transactions, and recognizing normal patterns so they can flag suspicious activity. These programs can auto-decline anything suspicious and flag an investigation, as well as notify the individual for verification. Predictions Since AI can process large amounts of data all at once, it’s useful in identifying patterns and using those to make predictions. Businesses can then use these predictions to make informed decisions or prevent possible future issues. Common uses of predictive AI include: Maintenance: Tracking previous repairs and general wear and tear on parts in equipment allows AI to predict when maintenance needs to happen, preventing inconvenient breakdowns or possible accidents. Modeling: Predictive modeling uses data mining and probability forecasting to predict and estimate future outcomes. Gaming Perhaps surprisingly, AI has been in the field of gaming for years. Over the years, many AI systems were designed to play various games as the developers worked on building software that would learn. AIs have beaten human champions in Chess, Go, StarCraft 2, and also on the game show Jeopardy. Of course, many games also utilize AI in their development to continually increase interest and incentives for users to keep playing. Some games that use AI include: Minecraft: uses AI to generate unending virtual environments and adapt to the player’s style. F.E.A.R: uses enemy AI to allow characters to learn and adapt to the player’s movements in game. The Last of Us: has a dynamic AI for each non-player character allowing them to react differently to the player character depending on their specific choices. Healthcare From robotics in hospitals and clinics to predictive software used to diagnose rare diseases, AI has many uses in the field of healthcare. Doctors and medical staff work with AI-powered software to provide better care to patients of all types. Some uses of AI in healthcare: Early diagnosis: AI can analyze patient and disease data to predict the likelihood of a patient developing a disease and either diagnose it early or help to prevent it entirely. Disease tracking: Using predictive analytics, AI can model how a contagious disease could spread over the course of time or across a specific area. Drug discovery: AI models can discover new applications or potentially harmful interactions between different drugs. Advertising Like many of the above examples, AI has numerous applications in the field of advertising. From offering dynamic ads based on demographics or location to AI that can write the copy itself, AI drives the field of advertising and marketing forward. Examples of AI in advertising: Ad creation: AI software can be trained to write copy or even make images based on interaction and purchase data. Dynamic presentation: Many ad platforms allow you to create ads that present different images or text based on customer demographics or location, personalizing the ad experience. Budget optimization: Some ad platforms use AI to help determine where an advertiser’s budget goes, focusing budget spending on the best-performing ad on the most cost-effective days and times it to the best-performing ad, day, and time. Analytics Finally, another common use for AI is in the field of data science and analytics. One of the most common uses is in predictive analytics, but AI can also be useful in data analysis. Most crucially, using AI analytics helps companies to scale their analytics and allows them to have accurate data at a much quicker rate than before. Some common uses for AI in analytics are: Forecasting: Taking in historical data and creating a reasonable forecast of what you can expect to see in the future. Predictive analytics: Predicting trends and future results based on historical data. Business monitoring: Real-time analytics on all key data points, from revenue to cost to customer experience. Business and AI While that list of examples may seem extensive, it’s certainly not all-encompassing. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of other ways AI touches everyday life for consumers. For businesses, the application possibilities of AI may seem overwhelming. But it’s important to consider how to adopt AI to grow your business, or risk being left behind as the technology evolves. One easy way to do so is with AI analytics. Learn more about how Tableau helps our customers succeed with AI analytics today.

According to one survey of 6,000 consumers, while only 33% of people think that they use AI, over 77% use an AI-powered service or device. It’s not surprising that people are unaware of all the ways AI touches their lives. After all, the development of AI surged over recent years as researchers made strides they didn’t expect to make for another several decades. So what are some common uses and applications of AI? You may be surprised to learn that it can be anything from advanced robotics to the voice search function on your smartphone. We’ll dive into more specific examples below. In this article, we’ll cover: What is artificial intelligence? Examples and applications of AI Digital Assistants Search engines Social media Online shopping Robots Transportation and navigation Text editing and autocorrect Fraud prevention Predictions Gaming Healthcare Advertising Analytics Business and AI What is artificial intelligence? Artificial intelligence is a specific branch of computer science concerned with replicating the thought process and decision-making ability of humans through computer algorithms. There are many different branches of AI that can create and do different things. Some types complete simple tasks, while others are much more complex. Some AI programs adjust their own algorithms, and some specialized algorithms are so advanced they can beat human experts in their given fields. Learn more about artificial intelligence. Examples and applications of AI So what are some examples of AI? Well, it can be almost anything. Your smartphone uses AI, as do services like digital assistants, chatbots, social media websites, and much more. Many home electronics also use AI, such as robot vacuum cleaners or security systems. And, of course, there are classic examples of auto-navigation and robotics. Below, we’ve outlined applications in greater detail so you can understand how AI impacts everyday life. Digital assistants Perhaps the application used by most people would be the digital assistants on our various pieces of technology. If you have a smartphone or laptop, you probably have and use digital assistant software to some degree. Some of the most popular digital assistants include: Siri (Apple) Alexa (Amazon) Cortana (Microsoft) Google Assistant (Google) Bixby (Samsung) Search engines Another common application of AI is search engines. Search engine algorithms utilize AI to refine and show better results without the intervention of programmers. You can see this in action on Google if you search a question. You’ll see a section called “People also ask” and if you open one of those questions, it will spawn two more related questions below. An even simpler example is Google’s auto-complete answers when you type in the search bar. An AI algorithm gathers data on what people search most often and uses that to populate predictions you can use to navigate. Popular search engines include: Google Yahoo Bing DuckDuckGo Social media Social media platforms are another common way people interact with AI. All major social media platforms run off AI-powered algorithms which are designed to serve specific purposes. Most use algorithms to determine what their users like and serve more of that content, to keep the user engaged. Many also run AI algorithms to gather and store user data to use for advertising purposes. You can train your social media algorithms to show the content you like by creating filters, or searching carefully for what you like, and purposefully interacting (liking, commenting, sharing, etc.) with things you enjoy. Popular social media platforms include: Facebook (Meta) Instagram (Meta) YouTube TikTok Online shopping This is probably one of the least obvious ways people interact with AI in their daily lives. Many online shopping and ecommerce platforms use AI to streamline their customer experience in a variety of ways. As a customer, you may experience AI through: Personalized product recommendations based on previous shopping activity or customer profile. Pricing optimization based on supply, demand, or previous shopping activity. Chatbots to provide instant responses to customer service or technical issues. Shipping and delay estimates. As a business owner, you may consider implementing AI in the following additional ways: Sales and demand forecasting to help you manage your inventory in the face of increased or decreased demand. Creating customer profiles and segmentation to boost sales. Smart analytics to show in real-time how your business is performing. Robots The word “robot” probably makes many people think of sci-fi movies like Star Wars or shows like Star Trek with their humanoid, intelligent robots. Though those may seem futuristic or even far-fetched, in reality, many robots already exist in our world. You may even own some, or something produced by one. Robots are used in a myriad of fields to streamline production or keep workers safe. They handle repetitive tasks or anything deemed too dangerous for a human worker. Some examples of industrial robots include: Aerospace: You may be familiar with the Mars rovers NASA has landed over the years. These are programmed to explore, gather samples and send transmissions back to Earth to provide data from Mars that an astronaut would be unable to obtain. Most recently, NASA sent the rover Perseverance to Mars to gather samples and search for signs of ancient life. Manufacturing: The use of robots in assembly lines dates back to 1961, when General Motors introduced a robot to assist with welding and transporting die casings (jobs deemed too dangerous for humans). It continues to this day, streamlining production and providing safer working conditions for humans. Hospitality: Particularly in recent years, the hospitality industry has adopted robots to help complete simple tasks and fill in for worker shortages. These can do things like check-in guests at hotels, mix drinks at cafes, deliver meals to tables in restaurants, and more. Create beautiful visualizations with your data. Try Tableau for free Transportation and Navigation You’ve probably heard of self-driving cars, whether in a sci-fi show or in the news from recent attempts by various companies. But there are more ways that AI is utilized in transportation. Most major map software uses some kind of AI to interpret real-time traffic data and provide routes and ETAs. Additionally, many aircraft use an AI-powered autopilot that takes in weather conditions and flight data to set the course. In fact, studies show that the application of AI in transportation has made it safer, more efficient, and more reliable. Other examples of AI in transportation and navigation include: Traffic management systems take in real-time data about the road, weather, and traffic conditions to predict heavier traffic flows and congestion. Direction apps such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze all use location data collected from users to determine traffic, ETAs, and more. Rideshare apps, much like direction apps, use AI that takes in location and environmental data to give ETAs, predict road conditions, and set fare rates. Text editing and autocorrect Another example of AI in the palm of your hand (if you have a smartphone, anyway) is autocorrect and other text editing software. This software takes input from generalized dictionaries and common use but also learns from your specific patterns to pick up the words you use most frequently and help you spell them. Other online text editors like Grammarly or Hemingway App take standards of style, length, and grammar, and compare them to your texts, generating reports on errors and readability stats. Some of them also analyze other online content in real-time to compare for originality. Fraud prevention If you have an account with any major bank, chances are they use AI in their fraud detection and prevention systems. These work by analyzing thousands of transactions, and recognizing normal patterns so they can flag suspicious activity. These programs can auto-decline anything suspicious and flag an investigation, as well as notify the individual for verification.
