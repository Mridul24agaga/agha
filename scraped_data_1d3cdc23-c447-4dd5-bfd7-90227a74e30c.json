The idea being crosslisting is to increase your exposure and target a niche audience when you might not otherwise have access to it. But there are some pitfalls, so here’s what you need to know before trying this approach for yourself. What exactly is crosslisting? Crosslisting (also known as crossposting) refers to selling the same products through different channels or venues to reach more potential customers who may not be able to find out about your business any other way. You can do this by copying all your listings from one marketplace over to another or using a tool like Crosslister that automatically lists to several marketplaces, including Depop, Etsy, and eBay OR You can do this manually. You’ll see many sellers in the e-Commerce space turn to crosslisting tools when they first start out because it’s easier than listing from scratch. In many cases, all you have to do is enter your product title and description into a template copy-paste images from one site onto another. Why should you crosslist/crosspost? Selling on multiple platforms is almost always a good idea. If your sales from one platform decrease, you can rely more heavily on revenue made through other outlets to make up for it. So here are 5 really good reasons why you should crosslist on various marketplaces to maximize your exposure. These are common questions raised when beginning a discussion about crossposting – how does it benefit me, should I do it? 1. Crosslisting can introduce you to new audiences Sellers who use only one platform might not be tapping into all the potential buyers there are. By crossposting your listings to multiple platforms, you can reach a wider audience than would otherwise be difficult. 2. Crosslisting presents the opportunity for more targeted selling! Let’s say you have different products or services in each marketplace that cater to different markets. Listing to different marketplaces allows you to put the right item in front of the right people, which leads to more sales in the long term. Each reselling app is different, and buyers on different apps want and expect different things. You can read our comparison on some reselling apps: Etsy vs Depop Poshmark vs Depop Vinted vs Depop 3. Crosslisting can increase your SEO performance & Brand Recognition Each marketplace has its own search algorithm, for example the etsy algorithm is quite different from the depop algorithm. How ever there is one unifying search engine! We’re sure you’ve heard of it’s a small startup that rhymes with poodle 😉 GOOGLE! Crossposting across multiple platforms helps create many listings available to be indexed by the search engines. The more listings you have being indexed by google the higher the chances are that someone will search for something on google (or bing, duckduckgo etc.) will end up on one of your listings. Using a well-designed crosslisting strategy will help you rank on the first page for popular keywords and phrases that are used by potential customers while searching the Internet. Additionally, when someone searches up your brand name instead of the search results being a ghost town you have lots of search results that are relevant to your business, this helps a customer trust that they are dealing with a genuine business! 4. Crosslisting can make your reseller life easier in the long term If you want to ensure success for your business, building a strong reputation is essential. By crossposting on multiple marketplaces, you will have increased exposure while helping to improve the overall perception of your brand. A strong reputation can lead to higher conversions and more positive reviews. Crosslisting allows you to have more peace of mind, knowing that slow sales on one marketplace will not kill 100% your income is a great feeling. 5. Crosslisting is free This means you have nothing to lose except for your time, which could help you build a solid foundation to grow your reselling business. Which platform should you crosslist to? The first thing to ask yourself is which platforms you want to be on. There are many different options available, and they’re all going to have different potential audiences. You can decide based on what type of product you’re selling. If it’s a fashion item, you might want to target Depop or Poshmark, but if it focuses on handmade or vintage items and craft supplies, you may want to look into Etsy. Figuring out the audience your product will most appeal to can make choosing the best platform much more effortless. Depop Depop is an app that allows users to buy and sell their goods – like discount designer clothing, jewelry, vintage – through curated photo feeds similar to Instagram’s feed of posts by people you follow. Shoppers can find anything from discounted designer clothes to cute handmade trinkets on Depop. Users post photos and descriptions of what they’re selling, along with a price. You might come across some hidden treasures in your search for the perfect birthday gift or unique decor items. Poshmark Poshmark is a go-to app for buying and selling all fashion needs. Users can buy, sell, or just give a second life to their clothes with Poshmark’s social commerce marketplace in three countries: the US, Canada, and Australia. Get a dose of Poshmark tips for your business here. Etsy Etsy is an eCommerce company that allows you to sell handmade or vintage items as well as craft supplies and tools from their online website. On Etsy, people can find a wide array of products such as jewelry, bags, clothing, home décor, and furniture toys art, among other things! If you’re already on Etsy, discover how to increase your Etsy traffic (and sales). eBay eBay is one of the oldest and most successful e-commerce websites on the Internet and king of second-hand goods. It doesn’t sell any items but instead allows users to list their own used goods for sale in online auctions, which other bidders can bid against them until one of them wins with a better offer than anyone else’s first price. Vinted One of the newest ways to make a buck is by selling your unworn clothes. Vinted enables people from all over the world, and in every walk of life, an easy platform to sell (or resell) clothing items with others. Vinted is geared towards people selling their own clothes, large businesses running commercial operations may have a hard time as vinted opposes commercial selling. Mercari Mercari is an app that lets you quickly sell your clothes, electronics, and other items. Sellers can create a listing with photos of the item in question, along with its description and price. Other factors should be considered when deciding which platforms to crosslist on, such as: The type of site/service you want to use – Some sites only accept listings based on certain criteria, so it’s important that you understand how each one operates before deciding where to send your product. Who owns the site/service – Sometimes, it can be more beneficial to crosslink with sites owned by larger companies, making them more likely to send traffic your way. How much traffic the site gets – Knowing how many visitors a platform has can give you an idea of whether or not it will be worthwhile to crosslink there, and if so, for how long. For example, ebay.com is one of the most popular sites on the Internet, with thousands of people visiting every day. However, smaller platforms may not be quite there yet when it comes to traffic. The platform’s reputation – Some sites have good reputations, but others have less than favourable ones!. If you’re unsure about how reputable a site is, then it’s best to steer clear. Even large marketplaces have had and can have lapses in communication with their sellers. There are countless examples of sites having false positives when it comes to moderating content on their platform, leading to lots of sellers being locked out/pushed away Recommendations before crosslisting Before you get started with crosslisting, it’s important to make sure that your product is set up properly so that you can submit it to various platforms. Here are some things you should look at: Your sales page If possible, you should have an optimized sales page in place before sending your product to another marketplace. This will make it much easier to rank for various keywords and get more views in the long run. Your item title Make sure that the item title correctly describes your product and doesn’t contain any extra information such as your business name or website address, which can confuse customers and lead them astray. Your product pictures It’s also a good idea to have multiple high-quality photos of your product so that people can see what they’re buying, along with images on your sales page that show off its features and benefits. Your specifications If you have any details about the weight or dimensions of the item, then it’s best to note them on your sales page. This can be useful for customers looking for more specific details about a product before purchasing. Your prices When putting up the price of your item, it must be as accurate as possible, and you should avoid listing any incorrect information such as discounts or coupons that can confuse your customers. Your shipping times If you’re going to be crosslisting on multiple sites, then it’s best to have awareness about the shipping times in place for all of them so that people are not left hanging if they order something from a particular marketplace. It takes longer than expected to arrive. How do you crosslist to other marketplaces? All right, we already know that crosslisting is a way to increase your visibility, reach, and sales on other marketplaces. There are different ways to do this. If you were to try and copy-paste all of the information from your current marketplace listings into another one, it could take several minutes per listing. If you want to list on Etsy, Mercari, or similar platforms, that would add up at least a half-hour for each listing. The problem with manually copying items to different marketplaces is that you always miss steps and have to correct them later in the process.

Research says that it costs between six to seven times more to get a new customer vs. keep the existing customers. Sellers and buyers are asked to review each other on several marketplaces. As you continue acquiring and selling, you can establish more credibility for your company based on honest consumer feedback. This could imply that you are: Top rated eBay seller Poshmark ambassador Mercari pro seller These certifications will demonstrate to potential consumers that you are a trustworthy seller. The easiest way to cross list on the world’s largest online marketplaces is by using cross listing software. Direct cross listing allows you to cross list a listing between marketplaces with just one mouse click. 2. Saves precious time Listing may appear to be a time-consuming operation, but it is far quicker than you think if you use a cross listing app. With Crosslist you can quickly list on marketplaces such as eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, Depop, and others. Crosslist is a web application that is accessible from any device. You just need to register an account to get started. Then select the marketplaces on which you want to list your product. This will dynamically generate the required product information relevant to those marketplaces. You can even use your mobile phone to take pictures of your products directly! Keep in mind that posting only works on your computer using Google Chrome with Crosslist extension installed and mobile devices can only be used to create listings. Crosslist will then automatically complete the required product information on these marketplaces, saving you precious time. Crossposting apps allow you to import existing listings from multiple marketplaces, and you can quickly crosspost your inventory to other marketplaces. Crosslist allows you to cross list your inventory between marketplaces using three different approaches: Direct cross listing Import in bulk Import one by one Direct cross listing Direct cross listing allows you to cross list multiple listings between marketplaces with just one mouse click. This is especially useful for when you want to copy your listings to other marketplaces without making any modifications to your listings. To direct cross listing, you simply need to navigate to a specific or your listing overview. From the listing overview, simply select the listings you want to cross list and click the Cross list button to begin the copying process to other marketplaces! Import in bulk When you import in bulk, first you have to import your listings into Crosslist. This can be useful if you want to make some modifications to your listings before cross listing them. After selecting the marketplace from which you want to import your listings, you will be redirected to a page that will automatically fetch all currently published listings that you previously posted on that marketplace. Here, you can select up to 10 listings to import at the same time. Crosslist will automatically sort the listings by date. For eBay, the limit has been increased to 20. One by one One by one listing is useful in case you have a very large inventory and only wish to make modifications to a few listings before cross listing them. In that case, it may be easier to navigate to the product detail page directly rather than searching for your listing in bulk import tool. 3. Helps small-to-medium resellers to diversify and go niche Selling your items on multiple channels means that you are not putting all of your eggs in one basket. That can cut the risks of not selling your items. If you don’t sell them on one marketplace – there is a good chance you will on another! Bear in mind that approximately 35% of consumers shop on niche marketplaces! This is why you need to research which items you can sell on specific marketplaces and familiarize yourself with the whole process. Learn what sells best in each marketplace and use cross listing software to list best-selling products. Here are some examples of top-selling items on eBay: Automotive: parts and accessories, air and fuel delivery, starters, alternators, ECUs and wiring, lighting and bulbs, motorcycle parts Clothing, shoes, and accessories Collectibles: military equipment, decorative collectibles, matchboxes… … You can check Poshmark trend reports to check trending categories, brands, and items. Usually, the best-selling items are clothes and accessories. Depop is a platform for selling unique fashion items, while Kidizen is a marketplace for secondhand children’s apparel. While some of the niche marketplaces have a smaller audience, they are often specifically geared to what you’re selling! 4. Allows you to have live customer support Cross listing apps are usually coming with great customer support. Crosslist prides itself on excellent customer support and if you check reviews on Trustpilot that seems to add up. Really happy with my experience so far. Makes cross listing to other platforms easy. Still some bugs in it but they are easy to overcome. Customer service is 2nd to none, I requested a feature and they implemented it within 24 hours!! Looking forward to using it with Etsy when that is integrated.”, is said in the last review. 5. Can help you to improve ROI Cross listing apps like Crosslist assist you in keeping track of all the available and sold products, the price they sold for, the platforms they sold on, and the date they get sold. By using this feature you will be sure you won’t sell one product twice. This will save your precious time with inventory management and ou will be able to focus on exclusively on the growth of your reselling business. Before cross listing, make sure you set up your products right! Before you begin cross listing, make sure you configure products properly so they may be submitted across multiple platforms. Here are some things to consider: 1. Optimizing item titles Although each marketplace’s requirements for item titles may differ slightly, such as the character count threshold, best practices are consistent across all marketplaces. Most marketplaces recommend including the brand, make, and model, and any relevant size, color, and material information, in the title. Your product titles must be compatible and also provide helpful information in a non-spammy manner. Including product nouns that customers frequently inquire about can be beneficial. For shoppers searching for “Nike Air Precision III basketball shoe,” for example, “Nike Air Precision III basketball shoe” may be a more relevant search title than “Nike Air Precision III.” 2. Optimizing product pages Your product pages must be optimized for better SEO rankings. Here are a few tips for optimization: Incorporate long-tail keywords into item titles and listing descriptions due to their specificity and higher click-through rates Pay attention to details when describing items. Include all necessary information and be specific. Optimize images for quick loading and alt-text containing your target keywords. Moreover, you can add video product descriptions and customer reviews. 3. Uploading multiple higher-quality images Product images have a significant impact on purchase decisions when it comes to shopping online. According to Justuno, visual appearance is a key factor for 93% of consumers when buying online. Make sure you include images of sufficient quality to capture the attention of your potential customers. To ensure you can list products, familiarize yourself with the marketplace’s image requirements. Most marketplaces require a high-resolution primary product image on a white background. Larger images offer greater detail, which can increase conversions leading to more sales. The Crosslist application helps you enhance images using their built-in photo editing tool. So, you can add captions or filters to pictures. 4. Setting fair prices Your price rates should be exact and accurate to avoid any misunderstanding. Price is a crucial factor influencing 74% of consumers, as per Shopify’s 2022 Future of Commerce Report. Behind every purchasing decision is a behavioral pattern. Customers are bound by internalized reference prices from previous experiences. When determining the fairness of a price, they compare it to the internal reference pricing points. Perception of price fairness is influenced by the customer-business relationship. This relationship is influenced by four factors: Transparency in pricing your products Conforming to competitive industry standards Being able to provide an explanation for price differences Maintaining price consistency while making price changes 5. Staying organized Organizing your inventory across several channels can save you time and money. Inventory management is an essential component of every reselling business, regardless of how much stock you have. If a company is not organized, it will not be scalable. Resellers manage their physical inventory in a variety of ways. Many people use garment hanging racks, sometimes organized by size or color. Other merchants employ shelf units, with some mechanism of determining what goes where. Most resellers use an [SKU system](https://fitsmallbusiness.com/sku-numbers/#:~:text=A%20stock%20keeping%20unit%20(SKU,%2Dsale%20(POS)%20software.) with corresponding bins. It goes without saying that assigning Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) to the products is vital. SKUs are one-of-a-kind identifiers assigned to each product to streamline the fulfillment and shipping processes. SKUs can be set in any way you see fit. However, they are typically classified based on the product line, brand, etc. Building an effective inventory management technique entails maintaining an orderly and straightforward structure. Organizing and streamlining inventory management can assist sellers in keeping track of inventory, avoiding overselling, and controlling product performance. 6. Managing shipping fees and times Keep any additional fees in mind when deciding which marketplaces to cross list on. Listing charges and transaction fees vary by platform, so bear that in mind while listing your items. Shipping fees are frequently included when listing items online. Be transparent on the shipping costs and who has to pay for it – the seller or the buyer. Prepare for additional costs by researching and adjusting the listing price to ensure a profit. Local pickup is now available as a delivery option on more reselling platforms, including OfferUp and Facebook Marketplace. Mercari Local offers a convenient way to buy and sell items locally without the meetup. This saves both buyers as well as resellers money on shipping fees. Always be cautious and adhere to the platform’s safety protocols when conducting in-person transactions. Your shipment times should be explicit and easily available to customers. It helps to minimize dissatisfaction with perceptions of late delivery. Pro tip: Always use one central platform and cross post to have all products in one place. It will make it much easier to automatically duplicate your product listings across multiple marketplaces. Using too many platforms without cross posting software will only cause headaches and a long line of dissatisfied customers. To avoid this, each reseller should have a single central platform where all inventory is listed first and then cross list to other places.

In this featured article, we will delve into how the best crosslisting app can significantly boost your sales. Let’s explore and uncover how this valuable tool can elevate your business to new levels. 1. Connect with a Vibrant Online Community An advantage of utilizing cross-listing applications is their ability to assist sellers in engaging with a dynamic online community. By expanding your presence on e-commerce platforms and specialized marketplaces, you can tap into an audience that might have previously been unaware of your products. This broader visibility allows potential customers to come across your listings while browsing through their marketplace, increasing the likelihood of making a sale. 2. Enhance Sales through Multichannel Selling Crosslisting applications empower sellers by streamlining the management of sales channels. With these applications at your disposal, you can easily link online marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, Etsy, and more through a centralized dashboard. This integration streamlines your efforts by eliminating tasks and minimizing the chances of selling too much or too little on different platforms. By managing inventory levels with real-time synchronization, listing apps ensure that customers always see up-to-date product availability regardless of where they are shopping. This fosters a sense of security in their shopping experience, building trust and ultimately boosting sales. 3. Save Time with Automated Listing Management Cross-listing apps excel at automating the tasks involved in selling across platforms, freeing up your time and reducing workload stress. Through API connections or third-party software integrations with marketplaces, these apps make it easy to import product data, images, and descriptions, quickly populating your listings on platforms with just a few clicks.

Platform listing applications allow you to easily establish pricing and apply pricing strategies consistently across various platforms, ensuring uniformity and competitiveness. These applications enable you to create pricing models tailored to each platform’s fee setup, accommodating different fees and charges associated with each marketplace. Additionally, certain cross-listing apps provide capabilities that simplify the management of special offers and discounts across multiple channels simultaneously. These promotions can be scheduled in advance and activated immediately, supporting pricing strategies that attract buyers across diverse platforms. 5.

The Card Collector’s Conundrum Pricing Blog Help Center FAQ Docs Contact Login Sign Up Tips, Tricks and Guides Your Go-To Guide On How To List And Sell Items On Multiple Platforms UpdatedOctober 2, 2023 Reading Time: 12 minutes According to Global Ecommerce Forecast conducted by Insider Intelligence, global e-commerce retail sales will pass $7 trillion by 2025. If you are in the reselling business this is the time to seize the opportunity and make a profit by reselling on various online marketplaces. Reselling platforms like Poshmark, Mercari, Depop, and others are broadening the playing field to compete with eBay’s market dominance. As a reseller, you can choose one platform for your business – but truly successful retailers are selling their items on various online marketplaces. This can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, so experienced resellers are using Crosslist’s multi-channel listing software to save time cross listing on the world’s largest online marketplaces. Keep reading and find all the information you need to take advantage of modern cross listing software and stay ahead of the reselling game. Do you need software to list on multiple platforms? Cross listing means posting the same item on various online selling platforms. A solid cross listing tool will allow you to concentrate on your online business while managing the inventory specifics of the multi-channel sales behind the scenes. With quality multi channel listing software, sellers can seamlessly list across different platforms. Moreover, they can track products effortlessly, establish credibility with cross-channel reviews, increase listing visibility and engagement, and save time. Ultimately, a good cross listing app will help you sell more items in less time. 5 reasons to use a cross listing app to sell items on multiple sites With many new marketplaces emerging, it is impossible to maintain a presence on multiple platforms without a cross listing app. Here are five compelling reasons why you should use cross listing software to level up your reselling business: 1. Helps build credibility Cross listing apps ensure that your products are seen by many customers. A bigger number of eyes on your merchandise might lead to more sales for your online company. Also, you can grow brand awareness if you cross post on multiple platforms. Of course, you have to describe your items using long tail and relevant keywords – so the search engines can recognize your listings. The more search queries your brand shows up – the more potential customers will get to know about your brand. If you manage to keep then you are on the right track. Research says that it costs between six to seven times more to get a new customer vs. keep the existing customers. Sellers and buyers are asked to review each other on several marketplaces. As you continue acquiring and selling, you can establish more credibility for your company based on honest consumer feedback. This could imply that you are: Top rated eBay seller Poshmark ambassador Mercari pro seller These certifications will demonstrate to potential consumers that you are a trustworthy seller. The easiest way to cross list on the world’s largest online marketplaces is by using cross listing software. Direct cross listing allows you to cross list a listing between marketplaces with just one mouse click. 2. Saves precious time Listing may appear to be a time-consuming operation, but it is far quicker than you think if you use a cross listing app. With Crosslist you can quickly list on marketplaces such as eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, Depop, and others. Crosslist is a web application that is accessible from any device. You just need to register an account to get started. Then select the marketplaces on which you want to list your product. This will dynamically generate the required product information relevant to those marketplaces. You can even use your mobile phone to take pictures of your products directly! Keep in mind that posting only works on your computer using Google Chrome with Crosslist extension installed and mobile devices can only be used to create listings. Crosslist will then automatically complete the required product information on these marketplaces, saving you precious time. Crossposting apps allow you to import existing listings from multiple marketplaces, and you can quickly crosspost your inventory to other marketplaces. Crosslist allows you to cross list your inventory between marketplaces using three different approaches: Direct cross listing Import in bulk Import one by one Direct cross listing Direct cross listing allows you to cross list multiple listings between marketplaces with just one mouse click. This is especially useful for when you want to copy your listings to other marketplaces without making any modifications to your listings. To direct cross listing, you simply need to navigate to a specific or your listing overview. From the listing overview, simply select the listings you want to cross list and click the Cross list button to begin the copying process to other marketplaces! Import in bulk When you import in bulk, first you have to import your listings into Crosslist. This can be useful if you want to make some modifications to your listings before cross listing them. After selecting the marketplace from which you want to import your listings, you will be redirected to a page that will automatically fetch all currently published listings that you previously posted on that marketplace. Here, you can select up to 10 listings to import at the same time. Crosslist will automatically sort the listings by date. For eBay, the limit has been increased to 20. One by one One by one listing is useful in case you have a very large inventory and only wish to make modifications to a few listings before cross listing them. In that case, it may be easier to navigate to the product detail page directly rather than searching for your listing in bulk import tool. 3. Helps small-to-medium resellers to diversify and go niche Selling your items on multiple channels means that you are not putting all of your eggs in one basket. That can cut the risks of not selling your items. If you don’t sell them on one marketplace – there is a good chance you will on another! Bear in mind that approximately 35% of consumers shop on niche marketplaces! This is why you need to research which items you can sell on specific marketplaces and familiarize yourself with the whole process. Learn what sells best in each marketplace and use cross listing software to list best-selling products. Here are some examples of top-selling items on eBay: Automotive: parts and accessories, air and fuel delivery, starters, alternators, ECUs and wiring, lighting and bulbs, motorcycle parts Clothing, shoes, and accessories Collectibles: military equipment, decorative collectibles, matchboxes… … You can check Poshmark trend reports to check trending categories, brands, and items. Usually, the best-selling items are clothes and accessories. Depop is a platform for selling unique fashion items, while Kidizen is a marketplace for secondhand children’s apparel. While some of the niche marketplaces have a smaller audience, they are often specifically geared to what you’re selling! 4. Allows you to have live customer support Cross listing apps are usually coming with great customer support. Crosslist prides itself on excellent customer support and if you check reviews on Trustpilot that seems to add up. Really happy with my experience so far. Makes cross listing to other platforms easy. Still some bugs in it but they are easy to overcome. Customer service is 2nd to none, I requested a feature and they implemented it within 24 hours!! Looking forward to using it with Etsy when that is integrated.”, is said in the last review. 5. Can help you to improve ROI Cross listing apps like Crosslist assist you in keeping track of all the available and sold products, the price they sold for, the platforms they sold on, and the date they get sold. By using this feature you will be sure you won’t sell one product twice. This will save your precious time with inventory management and ou will be able to focus on exclusively on the growth of your reselling business. Before cross listing, make sure you set up your products right! Before you begin cross listing, make sure you configure products properly so they may be submitted across multiple platforms. Here are some things to consider: 1. Optimizing item titles Although each marketplace’s requirements for item titles may differ slightly, such as the character count threshold, best practices are consistent across all marketplaces. Most marketplaces recommend including the brand, make, and model, and any relevant size, color, and material information, in the title. Your product titles must be compatible and also provide helpful information in a non-spammy manner. Including product nouns that customers frequently inquire about can be beneficial. For shoppers searching for “Nike Air Precision III basketball shoe,” for example, “Nike Air Precision III basketball shoe” may be a more relevant search title than “Nike Air Precision III.” 2. Optimizing product pages Your product pages must be optimized for better SEO rankings. Here are a few tips for optimization: Incorporate long-tail keywords into item titles and listing descriptions due to their specificity and higher click-through rates Pay attention to details when describing items. Include all necessary information and be specific. Optimize images for quick loading and alt-text containing your target keywords. Moreover, you can add video product descriptions and customer reviews. 3. Uploading multiple higher-quality images Product images have a significant impact on purchase decisions when it comes to shopping online. According to Justuno, visual appearance is a key factor for 93% of consumers when buying online. Make sure you include images of sufficient quality to capture the attention of your potential customers. To ensure you can list products, familiarize yourself with the marketplace’s image requirements. Most marketplaces require a high-resolution primary product image on a white background. Larger images offer greater detail, which can increase conversions leading to more sales. The Crosslist application helps you enhance images using their built-in photo editing tool. So, you can add captions or filters to pictures. 4. Setting fair prices Your price rates should be exact and accurate to avoid any misunderstanding. Price is a crucial factor influencing 74% of consumers, as per Shopify’s 2022 Future of Commerce Report. Behind every purchasing decision is a behavioral pattern. Customers are bound by internalized reference prices from previous experiences. When determining the fairness of a price, they compare it to the internal reference pricing points. Perception of price fairness is influenced by the customer-business relationship. This relationship is influenced by four factors: Transparency in pricing your products Conforming to competitive industry standards Being able to provide an explanation for price differences Maintaining price consistency while making price changes 5. Staying organized Organizing your inventory across several channels can save you time and money. Inventory management is an essential component of every reselling business, regardless of how much stock you have. If a company is not organized, it will not be scalable. Resellers manage their physical inventory in a variety of ways. Many people use garment hanging racks, sometimes organized by size or color. Other merchants employ shelf units, with some mechanism of determining what goes where. Most resellers use an [SKU system](https://fitsmallbusiness.com/sku-numbers/#:~:text=A%20stock%20keeping%20unit%20(SKU,%2Dsale%20(POS)%20software.) with corresponding bins. It goes without saying that assigning Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) to the products is vital. SKUs are one-of-a-kind identifiers assigned to each product to streamline the fulfillment and shipping processes. SKUs can be set in any way you see fit. However, they are typically classified based on the product line, brand, etc. Building an effective inventory management technique entails maintaining an orderly and straightforward structure. Organizing and streamlining inventory management can assist sellers in keeping track of inventory, avoiding overselling, and controlling product performance. 6. Managing shipping fees and times Keep any additional fees in mind when deciding which marketplaces to cross list on. Listing charges and transaction fees vary by platform, so bear that in mind while listing your items. Shipping fees are frequently included when listing items online. Be transparent on the shipping costs and who has to pay for it – the seller or the buyer. Prepare for additional costs by researching and adjusting the listing price to ensure a profit. Local pickup is now available as a delivery option on more reselling platforms, including OfferUp and Facebook Marketplace. Mercari Local offers a convenient way to buy and sell items locally without the meetup. This saves both buyers as well as resellers money on shipping fees. Always be cautious and adhere to the platform’s safety protocols when conducting in-person transactions. Your shipment times should be explicit and easily available to customers. It helps to minimize dissatisfaction with perceptions of late delivery. Pro tip: Always use one central platform and cross post to have all products in one place. It will make it much easier to automatically duplicate your product listings across multiple marketplaces. Using too many platforms without cross posting software will only cause headaches and a long line of dissatisfied customers. To avoid this, each reseller should have a single central platform where all inventory is listed first and then cross list to other places.

How often should I cross post? Knowing how many visits a platform receives might help you determine whether it is worthwhile to crosslink to, and if so, for how long. EBay.com, for example, is the second most popular website only behind Amazon, with a 13.43% share of visits and 1.7 billion monthly visits. Smaller platforms may not be quite there yet in terms of traffic, but they have a very engaged niche audience. Every online platform has its unique posting frequency. Let’s take the example of Poshmark. Most top sellers advise listing at least three items per day – or more. But the main secret for success on all marketplaces is fast crossposting.

Most cross-reference tools are compatible with accessibility software. They function similarly to your browser’s auto-completion feature. The software is not intended to be used to spam and disrupt any marketplace. Ensure that the selected tool does not request any of your marketplace login details. Crosslist, for example, will never ask for your password but simply control your browser through its browser extension! 4. What is the best cross listing app?

If you are in the reselling business this is the time to seize the opportunity and make a profit by reselling on various online marketplaces. Reselling platforms like Poshmark, Mercari, Depop, and others are broadening the playing field to compete with eBay’s market dominance. As a reseller, you can choose one platform for your business – but truly successful retailers are selling their items on various online marketplaces. This can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, so experienced resellers are using Crosslist’s multi-channel listing software to save time cross listing on the world’s largest online marketplaces. Keep reading and find all the information you need to take advantage of modern cross listing software and stay ahead of the reselling game. Do you need software to list on multiple platforms? Cross listing means posting the same item on various online selling platforms. A solid cross listing tool will allow you to concentrate on your online business while managing the inventory specifics of the multi-channel sales behind the scenes. With quality multi channel listing software, sellers can seamlessly list across different platforms. Moreover, they can track products effortlessly, establish credibility with cross-channel reviews, increase listing visibility and engagement, and save time. Ultimately, a good cross listing app will help you sell more items in less time. 5 reasons to use a cross listing app to sell items on multiple sites With many new marketplaces emerging, it is impossible to maintain a presence on multiple platforms without a cross listing app. Here are five compelling reasons why you should use cross listing software to level up your reselling business: 1. Helps build credibility Cross listing apps ensure that your products are seen by many customers. A bigger number of eyes on your merchandise might lead to more sales for your online company. Also, you can grow brand awareness if you cross post on multiple platforms. Of course, you have to describe your items using long tail and relevant keywords – so the search engines can recognize your listings. The more search queries your brand shows up – the more potential customers will get to know about your brand. If you manage to keep then you are on the right track. Research says that it costs between six to seven times more to get a new customer vs. keep the existing customers. Sellers and buyers are asked to review each other on several marketplaces. As you continue acquiring and selling, you can establish more credibility for your company based on honest consumer feedback. This could imply that you are: Top rated eBay seller Poshmark ambassador Mercari pro seller These certifications will demonstrate to potential consumers that you are a trustworthy seller. The easiest way to cross list on the world’s largest online marketplaces is by using cross listing software. Direct cross listing allows you to cross list a listing between marketplaces with just one mouse click. 2. Saves precious time Listing may appear to be a time-consuming operation, but it is far quicker than you think if you use a cross listing app. With Crosslist you can quickly list on marketplaces such as eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, Depop, and others. Crosslist is a web application that is accessible from any device. You just need to register an account to get started. Then select the marketplaces on which you want to list your product. This will dynamically generate the required product information relevant to those marketplaces. You can even use your mobile phone to take pictures of your products directly! Keep in mind that posting only works on your computer using Google Chrome with Crosslist extension installed and mobile devices can only be used to create listings. Crosslist will then automatically complete the required product information on these marketplaces, saving you precious time. Crossposting apps allow you to import existing listings from multiple marketplaces, and you can quickly crosspost your inventory to other marketplaces. Crosslist allows you to cross list your inventory between marketplaces using three different approaches: Direct cross listing Import in bulk Import one by one Direct cross listing Direct cross listing allows you to cross list multiple listings between marketplaces with just one mouse click. This is especially useful for when you want to copy your listings to other marketplaces without making any modifications to your listings. To direct cross listing, you simply need to navigate to a specific or your listing overview. From the listing overview, simply select the listings you want to cross list and click the Cross list button to begin the copying process to other marketplaces! Import in bulk When you import in bulk, first you have to import your listings into Crosslist. This can be useful if you want to make some modifications to your listings before cross listing them. After selecting the marketplace from which you want to import your listings, you will be redirected to a page that will automatically fetch all currently published listings that you previously posted on that marketplace. Here, you can select up to 10 listings to import at the same time. Crosslist will automatically sort the listings by date. For eBay, the limit has been increased to 20. One by one One by one listing is useful in case you have a very large inventory and only wish to make modifications to a few listings before cross listing them. In that case, it may be easier to navigate to the product detail page directly rather than searching for your listing in bulk import tool. 3. Helps small-to-medium resellers to diversify and go niche Selling your items on multiple channels means that you are not putting all of your eggs in one basket. That can cut the risks of not selling your items. If you don’t sell them on one marketplace – there is a good chance you will on another! Bear in mind that approximately 35% of consumers shop on niche marketplaces! This is why you need to research which items you can sell on specific marketplaces and familiarize yourself with the whole process. Learn what sells best in each marketplace and use cross listing software to list best-selling products. Here are some examples of top-selling items on eBay: Automotive: parts and accessories, air and fuel delivery, starters, alternators, ECUs and wiring, lighting and bulbs, motorcycle parts Clothing, shoes, and accessories Collectibles: military equipment, decorative collectibles, matchboxes… … You can check Poshmark trend reports to check trending categories, brands, and items. Usually, the best-selling items are clothes and accessories. Depop is a platform for selling unique fashion items, while Kidizen is a marketplace for secondhand children’s apparel. While some of the niche marketplaces have a smaller audience, they are often specifically geared to what you’re selling! 4. Allows you to have live customer support Cross listing apps are usually coming with great customer support. Crosslist prides itself on excellent customer support and if you check reviews on Trustpilot that seems to add up. Really happy with my experience so far. Makes cross listing to other platforms easy. Still some bugs in it but they are easy to overcome. Customer service is 2nd to none, I requested a feature and they implemented it within 24 hours!! Looking forward to using it with Etsy when that is integrated.”, is said in the last review. 5. Can help you to improve ROI Cross listing apps like Crosslist assist you in keeping track of all the available and sold products, the price they sold for, the platforms they sold on, and the date they get sold. By using this feature you will be sure you won’t sell one product twice. This will save your precious time with inventory management and ou will be able to focus on exclusively on the growth of your reselling business. Before cross listing, make sure you set up your products right! Before you begin cross listing, make sure you configure products properly so they may be submitted across multiple platforms. Here are some things to consider: 1.

Many resellers use cross-listing to list the same products on several marketplaces, like eBay or Facebook Marketplace. However, the process can become time-consuming if you’re doing it manually.

Below, we’ll talk about some of the best cross-listing tools and how they help your business run more smoothly. These tools can raise efficiency and make your reselling experience much easier.
