Help for buyers and sellers. Please read the rules - https://old.reddit.com/r/Ebay/about/rules/ Members Online • MaxiePriest Sellers : Are you allowed to note \"cross-listed\" / \"multi-channel-listed\" on eBay ? Whether it's officially allowed, I've seen listings on eBay, Poshmark, DePop, Grailed, etc., noting that the item is \"cross-listed\" but doesn't include specifics about which other site (or their user name on other sites). As a buyer, I appreciate this. It tells me that the item is listed elsewhere and may sell (so if I'm interested, I will purchase soon vs. later). Not to mention the fact that I may not want to deal with a particular site (Mercari, I'm looking at you). If an item is listed on eBay and Mercari, I'll go with eBay. If you cross-list items, do you always mention it in the listing and do you use the same user name on all sites? Thx.

Help for buyers and sellers. Please read the rules - https://old.reddit.com/r/Ebay/about/rules/ Members Online • MaxiePriest Sellers : Are you allowed to note \"cross-listed\" / \"multi-channel-listed\" on eBay ? Whether it's officially allowed, I've seen listings on eBay, Poshmark, DePop, Grailed, etc., noting that the item is \"cross-listed\" but doesn't include specifics about which other site (or their user name on other sites). As a buyer, I appreciate this. It tells me that the item is listed elsewhere and may sell (so if I'm interested, I will purchase soon vs. later). Not to mention the fact that I may not want to deal with a particular site (Mercari, I'm looking at you). If an item is listed on eBay and Mercari, I'll go with eBay. If you cross-list items, do you always mention it in the listing and do you use the same user name on all sites? Thx.
