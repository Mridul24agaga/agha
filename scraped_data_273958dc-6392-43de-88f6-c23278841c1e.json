      "content": "Why Sports Trends in 2025 Are Not What Coaches Expected Artificial intelligence and wearable technology lead today's sports trends. The NFL's Digital Athlete collects massive amounts of performance information, yet the way these state-of-the-art solutions revolutionize the field isn't what we expected. The technology trends in sports haven't developed as anyone thought they would. AI-driven platforms now analyze countless data points. Wearable devices track everything from heart rates to sleep patterns. Yet sports' future is heading in an unexpected direction. The sort of thing I love is the stark difference between our expectations and what's actually happening in 2025. This piece will show why these changes surprised many coaches. We'll get into the unexpected ways training methods have changed and reveal what truly works in today's sports world. The Shift from Pure Tech to Human Connection \"I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost more than 300 games. Twenty-six times I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot – and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life, and that is why I succeed.\" — Michael Jordan, Legendary basketball player Why AI coaching failed to replace human coaches AI coaching platforms were expected to transform sports training but fell short in several critical areas. These systems cannot manage emotions, interpersonal closeness, and social connections in the digital coaching environment [2]. AI lacks the intuition and critical thinking that experienced coaches use to make live decisions about athlete development [3]. The most important shortcoming appeared in AI's failure to build genuine relationships or adapt to unpredictable coaching conversations [3]. Organizations found that AI coaching became just a box-ticking exercise rather than a meaningful development tool [3]. Rise of emotional intelligence in sports Emotional intelligence (EI) is a vital factor in athletic success. Research shows that both athletes' and coaches' EI directly predicts performance satisfaction through improved coach-athlete relationships [4]. Knowing how to recognize, understand, and manage emotions provides a great way to get resources to cope with competitive sports demands [4]. Coaches with strong emotional intelligence excel in five key areas: Self-awareness and confidence Self-regulation and integrity Motivation beyond winning Empathy in athlete relationships Social skill in team management [5] Return to basics movement A major change toward fundamental movement skills has taken root in sports training. Coaches notice that many young athletes lack simple coordination and movement skills that were common when children spent more time in outdoor play and multiple sports [6]. Training programs now emphasize proper general movement training to boost overall athleticism [6]. This return to basics develops coordination and mobility in a free-flowing, creative environment [6]. The movement recognizes that proper coordination and fundamental skills are the foundations to learn more complex sports techniques later on [6]. Unexpected Changes in Training Methods Sports organizations now step back from collecting too much data and analyzing everything. They see what it all means and the drawbacks of relying only on data-driven approaches. Athletes' data privacy and security in sports analytics has become a major worry [7]. Decline of data-driven decisions Too much focus on analytics creates unexpected problems in evaluating sports performance. Athletes often change how they play just to get better numbers instead of actually performing better [8]. To cite an instance, players run aimlessly during game breaks just to boost their GPS-tracked distance stats [8]. The rush to make use of information has made complex athletic performance too simple. Coaches now find that focusing on specific metrics can hurt overall athletic growth and team dynamics [9]. New focus on mental wellness These challenges have led sports organizations to make mental health a top priority. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has rolled out the most detailed mental health programs in Olympic history [10]. Their program has: Prevention and general wellbeing programs Immediate monitoring of athlete mental health Dedicated spaces to relax and practice mindfulness On-site support teams ready to help Mental health services are now more available to athletes. Research shows anxiety disorders and stress affect nearly 32% of U.S. teens and more than 22% of college-age students [11]. Sports organizations create safe spaces psychologically where athletes feel comfortable asking for help [12]. The IOC's Mental Health Action Plan states that athletes need good mental health just as much as physical health to perform their best [12]. This shows how sports organizations have transformed their approach to athlete development and training. Sports professionals now know mental wellness goes beyond traditional performance numbers. They see sleep quality, emotional resilience, and stress management as key parts of athletic success [13]. This integrated view marks a big change from old sports trends that focused heavily on performance data. The Surprising Role of Traditional Sports \"Coach's voice will never leave my head as long as I live.\" — Allen Iverson, Former professional basketball player Revival of local leagues Local leagues are growing at an unprecedented rate through community-driven initiatives. A remarkable story unfolded in Staffordshire as former members of Alton FC reclaimed an overgrown village pitch. They attracted new talent and brought their club back to life for the 2024/25 season [14]. The team's efforts to revolutionize caught international attention with support messages coming from Africa, Asia, and South America [14]. Traditional games are a great way to get tools for social development. Barbados has reintroduced historic games like Warri and Patta to curb social challenges and strengthen community bonds [15]. These traditional activities provide alternatives to screen-based entertainment and encourage face-to-face interactions and cultural preservation. Decrease in virtual training adoption Yes, it is true that virtual training, once celebrated as the future of sports, has faced unexpected challenges. VR training showed promise with 28% improvement in scan rates over nine weeks [16], but the technology's limitations have become clear. The lack of tactile feedback remains a major obstacle to widespread adoption [16]. Financial factors have influenced this trend. Virtual training costs £260.31 per person compared to £182.49 for traditional methods [16]. Many organizations have returned to conventional training approaches that offer better value and proven results since financial accessibility remains a concern. Community-based coaching success Community sports coaches have emerged as key drivers of positive change. These coaches build valuable community assets by providing: Physical activity opportunities Social development platforms Emotional growth environments [17] The transformation of traditional sport services into active wellbeing services has accelerated since COVID-19 [18]. Community coaches now create safe, motivational climates where athletes develop life skills and experience meaningful participation [19]. Community-based coaching success comes from its comprehensive approach. Local coaches understand their communities' unique needs and work on athletic development and social integration simultaneously [17]. This customized attention and community connection work better than standardized, technology-driven approaches to encourage long-term athlete development. How Social Media Changed Coach-Athlete Relations Social media platforms have changed how coaches and athletes interact, bringing new possibilities and hurdles in sports communication. Studies show social media's growing popularity gives sports organizations instant connections at little cost [2]. Impact on team dynamics Social media affects team relationships in complex ways. Research reveals that teammates who stay connected show fewer disordered exercise behaviors [20]. All the same, digital platforms can be a double-edged sword. One marketing team reported a 30% increase in conflicts after they created a private Facebook group [21]. Coaches notice that social media substantially shapes their athletes' behaviors and how young athletes build their public image [22]. Team social networks affect everything in performance, such as: Stress management and coping abilities Academic achievement levels Group conformity patterns Overall team cohesion [20] Communication challenges Computer-based communication brings new challenges to keep proper coach-athlete boundaries. Coaches struggle with decisions about friend requests and private messages from athletes [23]. Hyper-personal communication makes people share more personal details online than they would face-to-face [23]. Sports organizations now enforce stricter rules for digital communication. Research suggests coaches should skip one-on-one messages with minor athletes and keep all communication in public or group settings [2]. Experts advise coaches to avoid interacting with minor athletes on social media platforms [24]. Many sports programs restrict athletes' social media use, especially about team-related comments [4]. But avoiding social media completely isn't the answer since these platforms are vital for team coordination and communication [25]. The biggest problem is finding the right balance between being accessible and setting proper boundaries. Social media can build stronger community bonds through tactical activities like polls, surveys, and dedicated hashtags [5]. Coaches must stay alert about keeping professional relationships because digital platforms blur the lines between personal and professional communication [23]. What Actually Worked in 2025 Sports programs in 2025 have found that blending traditional coaching methods with modern technology produces the best results. Research shows that 80% of athletes want both in-person and digital training support [26]. Hybrid coaching approaches Sophisticated devices combined with individual coaching has proven to be the most effective training method. Athletes who receive hybrid coaching show significant improvements in both performance metrics and overall satisfaction [26]. This approach combines: Up-to-the-minute physiological monitoring Individual-specific training insights Regular in-person technique assessment Digital progress tracking Continuous feedback loops Hybrid coaching costs 40% less than traditional full-time personal training [27]. This makes quality coaching available to more athletes. The model lets coaches build close relationships with athletes through key in-person sessions while providing remote support [28]. Successful adaptation stories The NFL's partnership with AWS to develop Digital Athlete stands as a pioneering success story [1]. This groundbreaking system uses sensors in protective gear that predict potential injuries while you retain control of the coach-athlete relationship. The NBA's collaboration with GE HealthCare shows how organizations can effectively mix technology with traditional coaching methods [1]. These success stories share common elements that blend human connection while exploiting technology. BeOne Sports' partnership with Rice University has set new standards in athlete care by combining AI-powered motion capture with traditional rehabilitation programs [1]. Lessons learned The most important lesson from 2025 shows that technology should improve, not replace, human coaching. Research shows that effective coaches now focus on five key areas [6]: Building genuine relationships Providing up-to-the-minute feedback Adapting to individual needs Maintaining clear communication Promoting team dynamics Sports organizations have learned that success comes from balancing analytical insights with emotional intelligence. Coaches who excel in 2025 demonstrate strong abilities in both technical analysis and interpersonal communication [6]. The focus has moved toward creating sustainable coaching models that prioritize long-term athlete development. Organizations using hybrid approaches report improved athlete retention rates and better performance outcomes [26]. Success depends on staying flexible and adapting coaching styles to meet each athlete's needs. Conclusion Sports technology hasn't grown as expected. This surprise shift taught us a lot about how athletes develop. Our analysis of the 2025 sports world shows that real human connections still matter more than tech advances. Coaches get the best results when they mix old-school methods with smart tech. The most successful programs now focus on mental health and emotional smarts. They teach basic movement skills while using data as a helpful tool, not the main focus. Community sports and local leagues have achieved amazing results. These grassroots programs work because they strike the right balance. They blend new training techniques with time-tested methods that create strong bonds between athletes and coaches. The sports organizations of tomorrow will thrive by keeping this balance. They'll use tech to boost human coaching, not replace it. They know athletes excel when coaches nurture both their physical skills and mental strength through real relationships. Sports' future doesn't force us to pick between tech and tradition. We need both working together smartly. This approach will create better athletes and keep the human touch that makes sports truly special. FAQs Q1.

Successful coaching now combines data-driven insights with emotional intelligence, emphasizing the irreplaceable value of personal relationships in athlete development. Q2.

Sports organizations are implementing stricter guidelines to navigate these digital interactions effectively. Q5. What coaching approaches have proven most effective in 2025? Hybrid coaching approaches, combining traditional methods with modern technology, have yielded the best results. This model integrates real-time physiological monitoring and digital progress tracking with personalized, in-person coaching, providing a cost-effective and highly effective training solution.

While thrilling fixtures and star athletes may occasionally grab the spotlight, the true strength of a successful sports brand lies in a deeper, more meaningful connection with its local communities and stakeholders. It is through these relationships that teams can grow loyal fanbases, secure essential support, and establish themselves as pillars within their regions. The Importance of Local Connections Successful sports teams recognize that their fans are far more than mere spectators; they are ambassadors who fill stadiums and share their passion within their communities. But this connection isn’t automatic—it requires ongoing, meaningful engagement. When a sports organization actively supports and connects with its community, it demonstrates to fans that their loyalty and contributions are truly valued. The mutual respect and trust that stem from these interactions create a bond that’s both unique and enduring. This approach moves beyond traditional marketing. Today’s sports enthusiasts seek a sense of belonging, and by directly involving fans, teams can create experiences that make supporters feel part of something greater. Teams that embrace this philosophy foster loyalty that transcends wins and losses, transforming fans into lifelong advocates. Supporting Local Communities through Engagement One of the best ways for sports teams to build connections with local communities is by hosting events, workshops, and clinics. These programs offer fans—especially young ones—the chance to meet their role models, engage with them personally, and learn skills that might one day turn them into stars themselves. Community-focused events allow local players and fans to feel like part of the team’s journey, creating a positive cycle of support and aspiration. Youth programs and clinics are especially impactful. By supporting youth leagues, sports clinics, and school partnerships, teams and federations can engage the next generation while giving back to the community. These programs do more than develop talent; they instill values of sportsmanship, teamwork, and resilience. Additionally, they promote positive habits and healthy lifestyles, reinforcing sports organizations as advocates for community well-being. Working with Key Partners Community engagement thrives with the support of local businesses, government bodies, and even other sports organizations. Strategic partnerships with local companies provide financial stability for sports teams while expanding their brand reach. By connecting with these stakeholders, sports organizations gain insight into community priorities and can leverage resources to fund local initiatives, enhance facilities, and support fans in need. Recommended by LinkedIn Revenue Generation Strategies for Sports Organizations Britts Imperial University College 6 months ago Going Beyond Boundaries Affleck & Co. 3 months ago How to Get Your Youth Sports Team Sponsored LeagueApps 1 year ago For example, partnerships with local government enable teams to address regional challenges, improve facilities, increase attendance, and enhance fan experiences. Collaboration with media outlets extends the team’s reach, helping fans feel connected to the action, even from afar. These alliances empower teams and federations to make a meaningful impact, demonstrating their commitment to the community beyond game day. Using Social Media and Digital Engagement While in-person engagement is crucial, the digital landscape plays a vital role in amplifying fan bases. A robust online presence across social media platforms, websites, and apps ensures that the team's voice reaches every part of the community. Through engaging and informative content, sports organizations can keep fans informed about news, provide behind-the-scenes insights, and create a sense of belonging in the team’s journey. When executed effectively, social media engagement fosters online loyalty, increases visibility, and attracts new fans. Content should encompass more than just game scores and updates; it should also highlight the team’s values, culture, and unique character. By sharing compelling stories that resonate with fans—such as player journeys or charitable initiatives—sports teams can cultivate emotional connections that lead to lasting support. Staying Consistent and Authentic Community engagement is an ongoing commitment that demands consistent effort and genuine dedication. Fans, businesses, and stakeholders need assurance that the team’s involvement in the community is not just a fleeting strategy, but an integral part of its identity. Maintaining consistent engagement fosters trust, which is essential for building a loyal fanbase. Authenticity is equally important; people can easily recognize and value genuine efforts, and the sincerity of an organization often becomes its strongest asset. The Lasting Benefits of Community-Focused Strategies The benefits of community engagement reach far beyond the scoreboard. Teams and federations that prioritize these relationships are often regarded as symbols of pride and identity within their regions, achieving a status that transcends sports. When a team genuinely invests in its community, it cultivates a sense of shared identity, pride, and connection, leading to lasting popularity. Sports federations and teams aiming to grow and succeed must recognize the importance of engaging with their local communities and stakeholders. By understanding their role in the community, empowering youth, collaborating with partners, leveraging digital media, and staying authentic, sports organizations can build legacies that resonate well beyond the playing arena.

In this blog post, we’ll explore how local teams and clubs connect athletes from different backgrounds. From making friends to promoting inclusivity and personal growth, amateur sports provide a platform for athletes to form lasting bonds and create tight-knit communities. Making Friends and Building Relationships: Local teams and clubs are the perfect place to meet new people and make lifelong friends. When you join a team or club, you get to train, practice, and compete with like-minded individuals who share your love for sports. The camaraderie that grows from these shared experiences goes beyond the field or court and creates strong bonds that last a lifetime. Embracing Inclusivity and Diversity: Amateur sports welcome everyone, regardless of age, gender, race, or background. They offer a space where people from diverse cultures and abilities can come together and enjoy sports as a community. The focus is on celebrating differences, learning from one another, and fostering respect among teammates. In this way, amateur sports break down barriers and promote inclusivity. Personal Growth and Achievements: Being part of a local team or club allows athletes to grow and improve both on and off the field. Through training and coaching, athletes can refine their skills and reach their full potential. The supportive environment of amateur sports encourages individuals to set goals, work hard, and push themselves to new levels. Along the journey, athletes develop important life skills such as teamwork, leadership, discipline, and resilience. Strengthening Community Ties: Local teams and clubs bring communities closer together. They organize events, tournaments, and fundraisers that not only unite athletes but also attract supporters and spectators from the neighborhood. Such events create a sense of pride and unity, as residents rally around their local teams. Amateur sports have the power to transform communities by fostering a shared identity and encouraging active engagement. Inspiring the Next Generation: Amateur sports are a source of inspiration for young aspiring athletes. Seeing local athletes dedicated to their craft, working as a team, and displaying sportsmanship motivates children to pursue their own athletic dreams. Local teams and clubs become role models, teaching valuable values like perseverance, fairness, and determination. Local teams and clubs have a significant impact on community building through amateur sports. By fostering friendships, promoting inclusivity, and encouraging personal growth, they create connections that go beyond the game. These grassroots initiatives instill a sense of belonging, inspire future generations, and contribute positively to society. Athletes, parents, and community members should celebrate and support these local teams and clubs for the connections they create, the communities they strengthen, and the lives they shape.

In this blog post, we’ll explore how local teams and clubs connect athletes from different backgrounds. From making friends to promoting inclusivity and personal growth, amateur sports provide a platform for athletes to form lasting bonds and create tight-knit communities. Making Friends and Building Relationships: Local teams and clubs are the perfect place to meet new people and make lifelong friends. When you join a team or club, you get to train, practice, and compete with like-minded individuals who share your love for sports. The camaraderie that grows from these shared experiences goes beyond the field or court and creates strong bonds that last a lifetime. Embracing Inclusivity and Diversity: Amateur sports welcome everyone, regardless of age, gender, race, or background. They offer a space where people from diverse cultures and abilities can come together and enjoy sports as a community. The focus is on celebrating differences, learning from one another, and fostering respect among teammates. In this way, amateur sports break down barriers and promote inclusivity. Personal Growth and Achievements: Being part of a local team or club allows athletes to grow and improve both on and off the field. Through training and coaching, athletes can refine their skills and reach their full potential. The supportive environment of amateur sports encourages individuals to set goals, work hard, and push themselves to new levels. Along the journey, athletes develop important life skills such as teamwork, leadership, discipline, and resilience. Strengthening Community Ties: Local teams and clubs bring communities closer together. They organize events, tournaments, and fundraisers that not only unite athletes but also attract supporters and spectators from the neighborhood. Such events create a sense of pride and unity, as residents rally around their local teams. Amateur sports have the power to transform communities by fostering a shared identity and encouraging active engagement. Inspiring the Next Generation: Amateur sports are a source of inspiration for young aspiring athletes. Seeing local athletes dedicated to their craft, working as a team, and displaying sportsmanship motivates children to pursue their own athletic dreams. Local teams and clubs become role models, teaching valuable values like perseverance, fairness, and determination. Local teams and clubs have a significant impact on community building through amateur sports. By fostering friendships, promoting inclusivity, and encouraging personal growth, they create connections that go beyond the game. These grassroots initiatives instill a sense of belonging, inspire future generations, and contribute positively to society. Athletes, parents, and community members should celebrate and support these local teams and clubs for the connections they create, the communities they strengthen, and the lives they shape.

In this case, predicting community engagement trends for 2025. Our role allows us to attend industry events and speak with current customers to learn more about community engagement. But, once a year, we take a bold step and try to predict the upcoming trends in community engagement. So, as we move into 2025, here are five community engagement trends that we think will make a huge impact for the next 12 months. Five Community Engagement Trends for 2025 Here are our five predictions for community engagement trends for 2025: Rebuilding Trust Through Community Engagement More Compensation for Participation Involvement An Increased Level of Diversity in Community Engagement Immersive and Hybrid Virtual Experiences Watch Out for Pickleball 1. Rebuilding Trust Through Community Engagement Rebuilding trust between governments and their communities will be a central theme in 2025. Governments can foster trust by prioritizing inclusivity and demonstrating a commitment to addressing community needs through transparency, accountability, and ongoing dialogue. For instance, governments can build trust by following some of these approaches: Actively listen to residents’ concerns Involve them in decision-making Demonstrate a commitment to addressing their needs Conduct regular town halls, participatory budgeting, and problem-solving sessions to help citizens shape policies that affect their lives This builds a sense of shared responsibility and creates a stronger united community for building long term relationships. Through these efforts, governments will restore trust in public institutions. They will also create a stronger and more active civic culture. This culture will truly reflect the values and needs of the people it serves. In most cases, this also includes using community engagement to go beyond decision-making. This is by using community engagement skills and tools to build connections around collective goals and outcomes that actually empower citizens. Strathbogie Shire’s Initiative | Port Adelaide of Enfield’s Initiative This includes projects like Strathbogie Shire’s initiative, which involves community members to spend public money on public art. Or, another example – Port Adelaide of Enfield’s ‘Get Shady‘ initiative, which involves creating shade canopies across the city to help reduce heat and support the climate. This also matches the theme for next year’s Global Community Engagement Day, on January 28. It highlights the importance of trust-building in community development. In addition, demonstrates how genuine and transparent engagement can lay the foundation for stronger, more cohesive societies. 2. More Compensation for Participation Involvement In recent years, compensating participants for their involvement in community engagement has gained traction. This is by moving beyond a voluntary civic duty towards a more equitable and professional approach. Programs like deliberative panels in Victoria and Citizens Juries in South Australia have successfully provided compensation, covering costs for time, travel, and other expenses. These programs help to boost face-to-face public participation. Local governments in Australia are seeking innovative ways to use compensation methods to enhance community participation. Their goal is to increase inclusivity and to gather more diverse input for projects that often see less engagement. Compensation offers several key benefits, including: Promotes inclusivity by reducing financial barriers to participation Ensures equitable representation from marginalised communities Acknowledges time and effort that residents contribute as experts by experience Helps boost engagement, especially among individuals who may be unable to participate because of work or personal commitments. Professionalizes community engagement by setting a standard for valuing public input and ensuring that people view engagement practices as legitimate and respected. However, there are challenges to consider, including resource constraints, equity issues, and sustainability concerns. Striking the right balance in incentives is essential to prevent dependency or biased participation. This is while also ensuring that compensation structures remain fair and transparent. When thoughtfully implemented, compensation can be a powerful tool for fostering deeper, more meaningful community involvement. This makes the engagement process more inclusive, and ultimately building stronger, more resilient communities. An example of this is the South Metropolitan Health Service in WA. They set up an Advisory Panel, where they paid $40 per hour for meetings. This initiative aimed to involve individuals from diverse backgrounds. It underscores the importance of compensating for time in fostering engagement with key objectives and projects. 3. An Increased Level of Diversity in Community Engagement In 2025, increasing diversity in community engagement will be a key focus for local and state governments across Australia. This will be as they work to make decision-making processes more inclusive and representative of their communities. Certain groups have often led engagement efforts. These groups are usually more affluent, well-educated, or have the time and resources to take part. However, governments are now prioritising the inclusion of diverse voices, including: Indigenous communities Culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) groups People with disabilities Other underrepresented populations This change is happening because more people are seeing that inclusive engagement creates fairer results and improves decision-making. Local councils and state agencies are increasingly using targeted outreach, accessible digital engagement platforms, and culturally appropriate methods to reach underrepresented groups. This ensures that their concerns and ideas are being acknowledged and incorporated into policies. This trend is being reinforced by the broader push for equity and social justice, as well as the recognition that diverse communities often face systemic barriers to participation, such as language, accessibility, or economic challenges. By 2025, governments are expecting to continue developing strategies to remove these barriers. This includes offering financial compensation for participation, providing translation services, and holding events in more accessible locations or times. Digital tools, such as engagement platforms and even social media, is being used to reach a wider audience. This is apparent especially for those who may face mobility or transportation challenges. With these initiatives, Australian governments aim to not only meet legal and ethical obligations but to create more vibrant, cohesive communities where all citizens have a say in the decisions that shape their lives. In July 2024, we conducted an Engaging for Equity survey with community engagement practitioners that garnered over 600 responses. The results showed that two groups are underrepresented in global engagement. These groups are people with limited English (32%) and those who identify as Aboriginal or Indigenous (32%). The primary barriers were a lack of trust, alongside feeling uninformed or unaware due to language and cultural differences, which ranked highly as significant challenges. Given the significant political shifts in the UK, USA, and Europe, alongside the fallout from the Indigenous Voice to Parliament vote in Australia over the past year, we believe that diversity in community engagement will increasingly become a key focus for achieving equitable outcomes. 4. Immersive and Hybrid Virtual Experiences With the rise of virtual and augmented reality, organisations will increasingly leverage these technologies to create immersive, hybrid environments for connection. Whether for virtual town halls, online events, or educational programs, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) will bridge the gap between online and offline spaces. This is because it will allow people to connect more naturally in virtual environments. For instance, this could include helping people visualise projects that includes urban planning and new playgrounds. Integrating these tools creates hybrid engagement experiences. By combining digital and online community spaces, people can join meetings, planning exercises, workshops, or local events from home. This approach helps maintain a sense of real-world connection. The Department of Infrastructure and Transport in South Australia has added a VR experience to its events. This is a recent development for future transport projects in the State. After completing a survey and receiving the results, people can immerse themselves in a VR experience. Individuals can explore future transport concepts using interactive maps, by zooming in and rotating to examine details more closely. 5. Watch Out for Pickleball Pickleball is a sport played both indoors and outdoors, where players use paddles to hit a hollow plastic ball over a net. The game continues until one side either fails to return the ball or breaks a rule. Invented in 1965 as a backyard game for children in the United States, pickleball was designated the official state sport of Washington in 2022. It’s been recognized as the fastest-growing sport in the U.S. for 2021, 2022, and 2023, and now boasts national leagues, including in Australia. So why is it a trend in community engagement? In some consultations across North America, many municipalities are asking for feedback on new recreation spaces. It just so happens that pickleball fans have flooded these discussions about play areas and sports facilities. Organized groups of pickleball enthusiasts have “hijacked” consultations by encouraging their members to repeatedly request that pickleball should be included in the development plans. This is often done by providing members with consultation links, suggested wording for submissions, and encouraging up-votes on other pickleball-related public submissions. In 2024, we learned of an instance where a council in Victoria was overwhelmed by over 140 submissions on a Gather wall from pickleball enthusiasts, accounting for nearly half of all submissions. This trend highlights not just the involvement of pickleball players, but the growing influence of organized groups in community consultations. As digital engagement has evolved in recent years, we anticipate that more organized campaigns and community groups will emerge around specific projects and potentially leveraging artificial intelligence (AI). This will likely lead to projects becoming targets for coordinated responses and submissions from determined groups that are seeking to influence or alter the decision-making process. With AI’s assistance, this process will become significantly easier. AI can generate multiple similar responses and even automate their distribution. Users of digital engagement platforms should be more aware of the tools and processes they can use. Community engagement practitioners must improve their skills in finding key stakeholders and potential disruptors. They must also incorporate strategies into community engagement plans to either engage these groups upfront or as part of the standard process. Whether it’s bird watchers, cat enthusiasts, or pickleball players, 2025 will be the year of organized groups shaping community engagement consultations. Learning how to provide the right prompts and inputs for these tools can be a challenging process. That’s why we’ve created our ‘ChatGPT Cheat Sheet for Community Engagement’ – a handy guide to help you kickstart your journey in leveraging AI for streamlined content creation. As we move toward 2025, community engagement will continue to evolve with a focus on inclusivity, innovation, and transparency. To stay ahead, practitioners must embrace these trends and adapt to the changing landscape, fostering stronger, more resilient relationships between governments and the communities they serve. Additionally, the rise of organised groups in consultations, driven by digital tools and AI, will require practitioners to adapt their strategies to ensure authentic, balanced input. As the practice evolves, these trends will shape the future of community engagement, fostering stronger, more resilient relationships between governments and the communities they serve.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread Grassroots sports clubs give children belonging and strengthen communities, according to new report by University of Bath Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain A University of Bath study of 12 grassroots sports clubs in Bristol, Manchester and London has found that almost all children who attend them feel a sense of belonging and emotional connection. The new report, led by Dr. Haydn Morgan from the Department for Health at the University of Bath, commissioned by Access Sport, involved 270 children completing an online survey about their sense of belonging and emotional connection to their sports clubs. When asked if they felt a sense of belonging, 74% strongly agreed, 23% agreed, and only 3% disagreed. Similarly, when asked if they felt an emotional connection to their sports clubs, 68% strongly agreed, 27% agreed, and just 5% disagreed. As well as unlocking improvements in physical and mental well-being, respondents highlighted in qualitative interviews, how their local clubs help improve educational attainment, reduce feelings of social isolation and divert attention away from antisocial behavior. Access Sport is a national charity that helps community sports clubs and volunteers run inclusive programs. This study highlights the transformational impact of community sport and suggests it has been undervalued. Going forward, the research calls on the sports sector to reevaluate community clubs' role in providing young people with a sense of belonging and creating stronger communities. Dr. Morgan said, \"It is well documented that children are experiencing a wide range of issues concerning social isolation, which is having a direct impact on their mental health. This was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, so it's more important than ever for all young people to build connections with their local communities. \"Having access to community sports clubs, that can provide essential opportunities for young people to have positive and safe social interactions; address feelings of social isolation; and foster a sense of belonging and community, is something that our research highlights as being critical in many young people's lives.\" Dr. Morgan thinks building a sense of belonging is a significantly overlooked aspect of sports and community intervention work. \"Whenever we talk of the benefits of sport participation, we tend to focus on the physical, mental, social and emotional benefits. However, what we typically overlook is that achieving these benefits can take time, and only really happen when children feel fully included in their sports club. \"We see a lot of children dropping out of sport because they don't feel that they are 'part' of their club, so enabling a sense of belonging needs to be a central pillar of club development to enable these wider outcomes to be achieved through sport and physical activity.\" Discover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Aleeya began attending Newham and Essex Beagles, a community club in the London Borough of Newham, when she was 12 years old and still trains. She said, \"The club was a second home. It was a way to socialize and build friendships and role models that influenced us all outside of sport. What you might not get at school or at home, you get from the club. It gave us all discipline that we could apply inside the sport and outside the sport.\" Daniel Bethell is a Paralympic GB badminton player who took home a Silver in Tokyo 2020. Daniel was born with cerebral palsy but he's never let that stand in his way. From the age of 4 he joined many community sports clubs in Bath playing rugby, tennis, football and cricket. \"Community sports clubs are really inclusive. They bring together people from all different backgrounds to play one thing: sports. All the coaches did a good job of integrating me into the sessions by providing me with specialist ankle supports and shoes, which enabled me to keep up with my friends without getting injured. \"Sport clubs also introduced me to other people with disabilities. I learned a lot of life skills about living with a disability, like tying my shoelaces with one hand. I met a community of people who had been through the same experiences as me, growing up with a disability and facing that adversity. This was massive for me.\" Stephen Baddeley Director of Sport at Team Bath and a former professional badminton player (Commonwealth, European, national) said, \"Community clubs are at the heart of sport in this country and are vital, underappreciated cultural assets that bring people together, enhance community cohesion and give many a sense of purpose and belonging. \"The social and mental benefits of community sports clubs are probably much greater than the obvious physical benefits of involvement in a sport. Driven by volunteers, they are vital for enabling children and young people to enjoy sport in a supportive environment which can lead to a lifelong engagement in a sport.\" By embedding the recommendations from this report, Access Sport believes that the sport for development sector can collaboratively address societal inequalities and make a real difference in communities across the country.

This collaboration aligns two organizations that share a deep commitment to excellence, community engagement, and a culture of inclusivity. “We are thrilled to have Jabian Consulting join us for the climb,” stated Team COO Tim Schuldt. “Jabian values align so well with what we are building for our community, and we look forward to introducing them to our growing list of corporate partners while helping them solidify existing customer relationships at the iconic American Legion Memorial Stadium.” Founded in 2006, Jabian Consulting has rapidly risen to prominence as a leading management consulting firm. Their value-focused solutions help companies become more competitive and profitable when they want to expand, enhance, or evolve their business. This partnership continues Jabian’s long-term commitment to female athletes and initiatives. ”Partnering with the Carolina Ascent FC was an easy choice as their principles and ideals align so closely with our own,” said Will Funderburg, Jabian’s executive director in Charlotte. “We look forward to supporting the team and bringing more awareness to Charlotte women’s professional sports.” As part of this multi-faceted partnership, Jabian Consulting will become a presenting sponsor of select community soccer clinics hosted by Carolina Ascent FC. One such event, the Client Kids Clinic on May 17, will bring local kids to the American Legion Memorial Stadium for an unforgettable day of soccer and fun. In addition to this clinic, Carolina Ascent FC will host two additional Community Clinics with Jabian as a presenting partner. A member of the Jabian team will also be featured as a panelist in an upcoming Women’s Leadership Speaker Series event. The Women’s Leadership Speaker Series is an initiative designed to connect, develop, and inspire women leaders across the Charlotte Community.

This collaboration aligns two organizations that share a deep commitment to excellence, community engagement, and a culture of inclusivity. “We are thrilled to have Jabian Consulting join us for the climb,” stated Team COO Tim Schuldt. “Jabian values align so well with what we are building for our community, and we look forward to introducing them to our growing list of corporate partners while helping them solidify existing customer relationships at the iconic American Legion Memorial Stadium.” Founded in 2006, Jabian Consulting has rapidly risen to prominence as a leading management consulting firm. Their value-focused solutions help companies become more competitive and profitable when they want to expand, enhance, or evolve their business.

Donate Now 02/05/201910/09/2019 How does sport connect people and communities? Sport isn’t just a game. It’s a useful tool to break down social and cultural barriers off the field. No matter the sport, players from all walks of life are tasked to work together in pursuit of a common goal: victory over the opposing team. Players must put aside their differences to achieve the win, and what we have found is the lessons learned in the game, will over time, be practised in the players’ communities, changing the livelihoods of all who live there. With this in mind, we have reached out to some of your favourite rugby players and our ambassadors to get their take on the power of sport to create meaningful change. We asked: How does sport connect people and communities? “Sport creates conversations…” – Chris Mastaglio, Director of ChildFund Pass It Back Sport is a great convening tool. From the discussions I’ve heard in Fiji after a World 7s Series rugby event, to Monday morning blues in Laos as someone’s favourite soccer team in Europe has lost, sport creates conversations and gets people together around a common platform. However, it is not only these top-level events that connect people. Seeing parents cheering their children from the sidelines in Vietnam, or listening to young Lao rugby players talking about how their national team idols played, demonstrates the power of sport as a tool to connect young people to their own communities. ChildFund Pass It Back has been designed to support equitable participation of girls and women, but the program has also excelled at engaging people from ethnic communities, often disadvantaged in term of access to opportunities. In these communities, the power of culturally and linguistically relevant role models in sport can be used as an important development tool. Strong, connected role models can mobilise, inspire and positively impact their communities. Sport is one of the fabrics that connect people and their communities to create positive social change. “Sport helps to connect people and communities through the creation of heroes…” – Ada Milby, First female member of the World Rugby Council, Secretary General of the Philippines Rugby Football Union, and former captain of the Philippine’s National Women’s Team The ability of sport to connect people to communities is strong across all contexts. From the professional level down, sport has a way of creating a sense of community with those connected to it. As an example, if you follow American Football, you can see how fans have the ability to immediately bond with someone they’ve just met supporting the same team. In Asia, where sport isn’t as accessible or valued, there seems to be a level of respect and support for those who are able to overcome the challenges to participate and excel in sport despite limited resources. Sport helps to connect people and communities through the creation of heroes and, the more relatable the hero, the stronger the connection. In the Philippines, Manny Pacquio is revered because he’s a great boxing champion, but also because he is someone who came from a small provincial area with a similar family background to many Filipinos. It’s part of what makes sport for development programs like ChildFund Pass It Back so successful; when I ask one of the players from a community “who is your favourite rugby hero” they don’t reply with legends like Charlotte Caslick or Sonny Bill Williams, they often refer to their coach or someone else from their community. These local coaches are better equipped to become leaders in their community and inspire others to do the same, lifting the community up together. “Our love of rugby is what brings us together…” – Charlotte Caslick, Australian gold medallist, rugby Sevens star and ChildFund Ambassador One of the things I love most about my involvement in rugby is the incredible opportunities I have been given to meet and connect with people through sport – in the many regions of Australia, and throughout the world. Our love of rugby is what brings us together, and this passion that we share is what creates that sense of community. The power of sport to create a sense of kinship was powerfully demonstrated to me when I visited Laos with ChildFund, and met young players from some of the most remote communities in the country. Despite having no language in common, and the enormous geographical distance between us, once we were out of the field any barriers between us seemed to fall away. Rugby has a way of creating its own communities, and I am proud to be a part of that. “That sense of working together and feeling supported…” – Emily Chancellor, Wallaroos player and ChildFund Ambassador Being involved in sport has made a huge difference to my life – to have a group of friends around you, who can support you both on and off the field, is something really special. You might be opponents on the field but, when the game is over, you are connected by your love of the sport. I know I can always a laugh with players from other teams and we support each other despite the competitive nature of what we do. I saw how important this sense of community is when I visited Laos with ChildFund. When you watch the kids on the field and they make a mistake, they still smile because someone’s tapped them on the back and said “that’s ok”. That strong sense of connection between the players and coaches, that sense of working together and feeling supported, creates such a strong environment in which young people can learn. That is the power of sport. “Rugby can be a great equaliser and creates communities that are inclusive.” – Stephen Larkham, former Wallabies player, World Rugby Hall of Fame and ChildFund Ambassador I started playing rugby when I was nine years old, having grown up watching my father play. For me, it was the camaraderie and the sense of being part of a team that really attracted me to the game. For me personally, being involved with rugby for over two decades has given me so much – the learning that comes with rugby’s values, a group of lifelong friends, and the opportunities to travel and connect to people in different parts of the globe. I also think rugby can be a great equaliser and creates communities that are inclusive. You can be any shape or size and still play the game and contribute to the end result. During my visit to Laos with ChildFund, I met players from small villages who are now playing for the national team. I saw rural teams where at least half of all players are girls and young women. I met coaches who are building the resilience of the children they train. Sport, particularly those that are team-based, has a unique ability to create communities that are safe, supportive and break down barriers between people. For me, this is one of its great strengths, and what makes me proud to be part of the rugby community. “Sport gave me the opportunity to make friends, learn real life skills and create everlasting memories.” – Darcy Swain, Brumbies Player For me personally sport gave me the opportunity to make friends, learn real life skills and create everlasting memories. I still remember playing in my first grand final at the age of 11 in Cairns. That’s the real beauty of it, everyone gets their own story that makes them feel unique and a part of something bigger. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have to be playing, the support staff that work behind the scenes to the day one supporters and parents that take their kids to early Saturday morning sport. Everyone’s touched by it in one way or another, it’s depth and ability is truly endless and is the reason for me personally why I love all sports and the people and communities that form them. “Sport is a language in itself and one shared by many.” – Kiri Lingman, Reds Player The beauty of sport is how universal it is. Regardless of ethnicity, language or culture, its power lies in its ability to connect people and communities. Relationships newly formed or relationships that last a lifetime, sport is a language in itself and one shared by many. In a personal sense, I’ve had the ability to see corners of the world and understand the diversity of people simply because of sport. Whether it be 50,000 strangers in a stadium, or the intricate relationship of a coach and athlete, the connection sport has the ability to bring is unlike any other. “Our small community comes together and supports each other…” – Andy Muirhead, Brumbies Player I think sport plays a huge part in connecting and meeting so many new people and also the community. In my time at the Brumbies I have learnt how much our small community comes together and supports each other and having something like rugby and sport make that possible. Help us connect children with sport and change communities As we’ve heard, team sports like rugby teach invaluable lessons on and off the field. Our contributors, players and ambassadors have left us with five ways sport connects people and communities: Sport creates conversations by providing a common ground, and a unified sense of purpose. A love of the game and the passion brought to the field forges bonds between players. Heroes are created in sport and can become positive role models for the team and wider community. Sports facilitate a collaborative and supportive environment where players can thrive and reach their potential. Sport is one of the world’s great equalisers, and is a powerful way to overcome barriers and promote inclusion. ChildFund believes every child has the right to play, learn and grow, which is why ChildFund Pass it Back was originally established for children in developing communities who face significant challenges around poverty and inequality. Not only does this innovative program promote the right to play in communities where children have little or no access to organised sport, but it provides important learning opportunities around leadership, problem-solving, gender equity, conflict-resolution and planning for the future. Over half of all players and coaches are girls and young women. To help us expand the program, and reach more children in disadvantaged communities, donate now and break down the barriers of exclusion.

The NFL's Digital Athlete collects massive amounts of performance information, yet the way these state-of-the-art solutions revolutionize the field isn't what we expected. The technology trends in sports haven't developed as anyone thought they would. AI-driven platforms now analyze countless data points. Wearable devices track everything from heart rates to sleep patterns. Yet sports' future is heading in an unexpected direction. The sort of thing I love is the stark difference between our expectations and what's actually happening in 2025. This piece will show why these changes surprised many coaches. We'll get into the unexpected ways training methods have changed and reveal what truly works in today's sports world. The Shift from Pure Tech to Human Connection \"I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost more than 300 games. Twenty-six times I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot – and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life, and that is why I succeed.\" — Michael Jordan, Legendary basketball player Why AI coaching failed to replace human coaches AI coaching platforms were expected to transform sports training but fell short in several critical areas. These systems cannot manage emotions, interpersonal closeness, and social connections in the digital coaching environment [2]. AI lacks the intuition and critical thinking that experienced coaches use to make live decisions about athlete development [3]. The most important shortcoming appeared in AI's failure to build genuine relationships or adapt to unpredictable coaching conversations [3]. Organizations found that AI coaching became just a box-ticking exercise rather than a meaningful development tool [3].
