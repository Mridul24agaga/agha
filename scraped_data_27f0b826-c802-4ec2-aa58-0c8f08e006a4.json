  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, so let‚Äôs break this down. You‚Äôve got this URL, https://www.moodytunes.io/. The name itself is a give-away, right? \"Moody Tunes\" sounds like a place where you can vibe out to some music that hits you right in the feels. It‚Äôs got that cool, laid-back energy‚Äîlike a cozy coffee shop where everyone‚Äôs sipping on lattes and nodding their heads to a smooth playlist. I‚Äôm imagining that this site is all about curating soundtracks for different moods. You know how sometimes you need a specific vibe? Like when you‚Äôre feeling happy and want some upbeat tracks, or maybe you‚Äôre diving into a deep work session and need something chill to keep you focused. Moody Tunes probably has a collection of playlists tailored to those feelings. It could be a mix of genres, maybe some indie jams, lo-fi beats, a sprinkle of jazz, or even some electronic tunes to get you moving. You might even find some cool features‚Äîlike an algorithm that suggests playlists based on your current mood. I can totally see it, like they ask you how you‚Äôre feeling, and boom! They generate a killer playlist that matches your vibe. They could even have themed playlists for different occasions, like a Friday night get-together or a Sunday morning coffee chill. Plus, if they‚Äôre riding that modern wave, they might include some sort of community aspect. Picture this: users can share their own favorite mixes or moods, maybe even rate playlists or leave little comments about how a song made them feel. That would be sick! Music is such a personal experience, and sharing it could lead to discovering some hidden gems you wouldn‚Äôt have found on your own. And let‚Äôs not forget about the visual side of things. A site called Moody Tunes is probably not just about the audio; it‚Äôs likely got a visually appealing design with artsy graphics, maybe even some cool animations that capture the essence of different moods. I‚Äôm picturing soft colors and smooth transitions that make browsing feel effortless, almost like flipping through a vinyl collection. On the tech side, they might also have some clever integrations‚Äîlike linking to streaming services so you can jump from the site straight to your favorite platform. Or, maybe they‚Äôre even partnering with artists to showcase new music, giving us the chance to discover fresh sounds before everyone else gets on board. In a nutshell, Moody Tunes seems like a digital getaway for music lovers who want to connect with their emotions through sound. It‚Äôs that perfect spot to escape, unwind, and let the music take you wherever you need to go. Whether you‚Äôre looking for tracks that match your current vibe or just wanna explore something new, I‚Äôd bet the farm that this site‚Äôs got you covered. So, grab your headphones and hit up Moody Tunes for a chill experience that‚Äôs all about finding your groove. Cheers to good music and good vibes!",

Certain songs have a way of connecting us with our memories and can serve as a reminder about them through the Christmas season. ‚ÄúMy favorite Christmas song is Jingle Bells,‚Äù junior Bri Barnett said. ‚ÄúAround Christmas time my grandpa and I would do something special and sing this song. He ended up passing away last year but it was always my favorite thing to do.‚Äù Songs that capture the Christmas spirit and bring out the holiday fun are perfect to have for a playlist. ‚ÄúI like Christmas Tree Farm by Taylor Swift,‚Äù sophomore Violet Hayter said. ‚ÄúI add this song to my playlist every year because it really captures the Christmas spirit and makes me happy.‚Äù The transition from Christmas time and celebrating the season, to the end of the year can be a sweeter with songs to capture it. ‚ÄúHappy Xmas (War is Over) by John Lennon,‚Äù junior Lena King said. ‚ÄúBecause I feel like it truly encapsulates the feeling of the year finally being over and the choir is really beautiful.‚Äù Christmas songs make the listeners feel excited in their own ways and ready for the holiday season. ‚ÄúJingle bells is the best song for Christmas,‚Äù junior Charley Landers said. ‚ÄúBecause it makes me feel like I‚Äôm in ‚ÄòPolar Express‚Äô or something. Its giving calmness.‚Äù The art of Christmas songs truly bring great memories to the listeners, letting them associate Christmas with a particular song. ‚Äú‚ÄôHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas‚Äô by Frank Sinatra is my pick,‚Äù sophomore Mayra Ayarely said. ‚ÄúMy best friend‚Äôs mom always puts this song on when we‚Äôre doing any sort of Christmas activity so now I associate this song with those memories.

It's that time again! I'm close to starting my fourth novel, and that means composing a playlist with metafilter's help. This book is a dark contemporary young adult book, set in the sort of central/southern California setting where I grew up. Not in summer, but in fall or winter, with overcast skies and oaks and eucalyptus trees and strawberry fields and shivering at beach bonfires and grimy coffee shops. I listen to the same long playlist every time I sit down to write a book. For this book, I'm looking for songs that convey a sense of high school nostalgia. Songs that re-evoke that excitement, fear, wistfulness, longing, confusion from your teenage years. Maybe they're songs from a pivotal time in your life. Maybe they were just hugely popular back then. Ideally, music you love; \"Hit Me Baby One More Time\" takes me back but it's not exactly conducive to writing. (Or listening.) I prefer rock of any kind, from indie to folk to punk to grunge -- I'm sure the subgenre depends on when you were in high school. But I'm also looking for newer songs that evoke that thrill/terror of being a teenager. The lyrics don't necessarily have to fit, but of course it's extra cool if they do. For me, some of them are \"1979\" by The Smashing Pumpkins (and the video!), \"Glycerine\" by Bush, \"High and Dry\" by Radiohead, etc.; songs not from my high school years, but that still evoke that feeling are \"Don't Change\" by INXS, \"Re: Stacks\" by Bon Iver, \"The Last Word\" by Chris Flew, \"Slow Show\" by The National (but that song makes me nostalgic for all times, including now). There's a definite genre theme there, but really I'd love to know your choices whatever the genre. Thanks!!! You have no idea how much this helps me write -- Metafilter's definitely going in the acknowledgments of my next book(s). posted by changeling to Media & Arts (56 answers total) 28 users marked this as a favorite The pixies doolittle got me through high school. posted by TheBones at 10:54 AM on October 20, 2010 As someone who went to hs in SoCal in the 90's, I'd have to say Ska. Lots and lots of Ska. And some surfer punk stuff. Reel big fish, No Doubt, Squirrel Nut Zippers, The Ziggens, Sublime, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The Aquabats, etc. posted by Arbac at 10:55 AM on October 20, 2010 Simple Minds - Don't You Forget About Me for the 80's posted by Sukey Says at 10:57 AM on October 20, 2010 [4 favorites] I think the Violent Femmes' eponymous first album is the sound of being sixteen, but then, I grew up in the late 80s and early 90s. Their songs' being vulgar and somewhat transgressive is what I think contributes that feel...it just fits with the sense of teenagers always wanting to be older than they are. posted by jocelmeow at 10:57 AM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Popular by Nada Surf Freshman by The Verve Pipe posted by zoomorphic at 10:57 AM on October 20, 2010 the freshmen -- the verve pipe spiderwebs -- no doubt banditos -- the refreshments just -- radiohead & anything from the clueless soundtrack posted by crawfo at 10:58 AM on October 20, 2010 Dropout by Urge Overkill posted by kimdog at 11:00 AM on October 20, 2010 And now, with more link! Dropout by Urge Overkill posted by kimdog at 11:01 AM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] I went to high school in the 90s too. Some of my old favorites that evoke that high school feeling: - The Verve: The Freshmen (on preview, nthing this one) - Red Hot Chili Peppers: Under the Bridge - No Doubt: Don't Speak - Pearl Jam: Black - Candlebox: Far Behind - Violent Femmes: Kiss Off posted by spinto at 11:01 AM on October 20, 2010 The Fun Boy Three version of Our Lips Are Sealed has always had a really school/teenage sort of feeling for me. oh my god look at terry hall's hair Also Blur's Boys And Girls and Pulp's Mis-Shapes from my teenage Britpop years. And more recently, The Long Blondes' Once And Never Again. posted by permafrost at 11:02 AM on October 20, 2010 Also went to high school in Southern California. 2nding Sublime, although it reminds me of summer, not fall. Definitely Weezer, I'd say anything on The Blue Album. 3rd eye blind and Matchbox 20 always remind me of high school (but I don't think I'd want them on a playlist, ever). Neko Case \"That Teenage Feeling\" gives me a good nostalgic feeling. Also: The Violent Femmes, Elliot Smith, Jeff Buckley, Fiona Apple, 311, Incubus... The Romeo and Juliet Soundtrack. Bands from my older brother's ipod (who still listens to all the same music we listened to in high school): Radiohead, Nada Surf, Everclear, Hey Stroker, MxPx... I'll try to come back with more. And please post your playlist when you're done!!! On preview: Yes to Red Hot Chili Peppers posted by thankyouforyourconsideration at 11:05 AM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Some songs at the nostalgic and/or wistful end of the spectrum that have that effect on me (was a teenager during the mid-1990s in the UK): David's Last Summer by Pulp; The Summer House by the Divine Comedy; Wake Up Boo by the Boo Radleys; Lost Myself by the Longpigs; Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm by the Crash Test Dummies; Today by the Smashing Pumpkins. posted by greycap at 11:06 AM on October 20, 2010 Pop A Top by Jim Ed Brown I am OLD posted by raildr at 11:07 AM on October 20, 2010 For me it would be U2's first album, Boy. Lots of songs about growing up, being a teenager, being confused about the world. Classic Edge guitar. Very 80s. Also the song Boy/Girl, off their first EP. I wore out a cassette I made with every B-Side up through the Joshua Tree. Along those lines The Alarm had a lot of songs about believing in yourself and other crap like that. 68 Guns, Knife Edge, Where Were You Hiding (When the storm broke), Strength. More great 80s guitar. posted by bondcliff at 11:09 AM on October 20, 2010 Psychedelic Furs, Love My Way posted by Cool Papa Bell at 11:19 AM on October 20, 2010 Seconding Weezer - Pinkerton and the Green Album in particular posted by aintthattheway at 11:22 AM on October 20, 2010 It came out twenty years before I graduated high school (and that was almost twenty years ago), but there might not be a song more evocative of high school in general than Big Star's \"Thirteen\". The first time I heard it I was just blown away by how perfect it felt, and despite its vintage it couldn't sound fresher if it were written yesterday and recorded this morning. For me personally--the Cure's \"Disintegration\" album. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". Metallica's black album, which reminds me of dirty dark desert parties. posted by padraigin at 11:23 AM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Green Day - Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) Eve 6 - Here's to the Night posted by morganannie at 11:23 AM on October 20, 2010 November Rain by Guns 'N Roses. posted by Sassyfras at 11:24 AM on October 20, 2010 Catch 22 - Kristina She Don't Know I Exist posted by namewithoutwords at 11:40 AM on October 20, 2010 New Radicals - You Get What You Give posted by Mr Mister at 11:41 AM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Led Zeppelin, pretty much anything by them. I remember watching The Song Remains The Same and that was the soundtrack for my high school years. KISS was big then too. This was prior to 1982. posted by JJ86 at 11:47 AM on October 20, 2010 Guster's \"One Man Wrecking Machine\" and \"Homecoming King\" are on the looking-back-on-high-school end of things, but I'd say very appropriate. A lot of Jimmy Eat World songs capture all the high school emotions for me. \"The Middle\" was big just before I entered high school, and \"Your House,\" \"Authority Song,\" and \"Kill\" are very good at evoking the self-conscious uncertainty of having a crush on someone and worrying about every single thing you do around them because what if you look like an idiot, and what if they don't like you back, is everyone looking at me, and all that drama. Finally, this may just be because these guys are from the same town as I am, but \"Madeline\" by Tickle Me Pink vividly conjures up memories from my high school days. posted by lilac girl at 11:48 AM on October 20, 2010 Pearl Jam - Jeremy and Daughter both remind me of high school posted by yawper at 11:49 AM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Songs that re-evoke that...wistfulness, longing These aren't necessarily songs that you would strongly associate with high school, but they definitely evoke wistfulness and longing for something that has passed. The Moody Blues - Your Wildest Dreams Lou Reed - Perfect Day posted by jedicus at 11:50 AM on October 20, 2010 For me that song is San Dimas High School Football Rules, by The Ataris. posted by just_ducky at 11:51 AM on October 20, 2010 American Music - Violent Femmes Story of My Life - Social Distortion Surf Wax America - Weezer Waiting Room - Fugazi 3 Days - Jane's Addiction Pepper - Butthole Surfers What's Up? - 4 Non Blondes Bad Town - Operation Ivy Punk Rock Girl - Dead Milkmen 1 Crush - Garbage Everybody Knows - Leonard Cohen Jerry Was a Racecar Driver - Primus Here Comes Your Man - Pixies Tuesday Morning - the Pogues posted by iamkimiam at 11:55 AM on October 20, 2010 [3 favorites] Concrete Blonde - Tomorrow Wendy, Joey Ben Folds Five - Brick Sinead O'Connor - Nothing Compares 2 U U2 - With or Without You And not rap, but the lyrics are all about high school: John Mayer - No Such Thing. I am a Mayer fan, but I hate this song. However, for wistful and longing, try Something's Missing. It's much better. posted by yawper at 12:00 PM on October 20, 2010 \"Linger\" by The Cranberries. posted by Lucinda at 12:00 PM on October 20, 2010 You want Losing My Religion by REM. I would want the first Counting Crows album, maybe some Gin Blossoms. If you were cooler than that in high school (and it sounds it), I think you want the Smiths. posted by clavicle at 12:03 PM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Anything by Rush or Boston immediately brings me back to an old van filled with hockey players. (On the way back from practice, you dirty birds.) My boyfriend (both basketball player and card-carrying member of the AV club) was super into Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin, too. Which is funny because this was the mid-'90s in Wisconsin, and I couldn't tell you why they were all about the classic rock. I remember this one time at orchestra camp (even better than band camp!) one of my friends was just hanging out in the courtyard playing \"Basketcase\" by Green Day on the guitar. (He's a member of about eight popular bands now, including a cover band.) It was one of those perfect moments, when you see someone playing a song that's not too new and not too old and he knows it by heart and you are thisclose to singing along. I think everybody has a phase when SOMEONE around them discovers The Cure. posted by Madamina at 12:11 PM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Night Swimming by REM posted by WeekendJen at 12:11 PM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Broken Social Scene \"Anthems for a Seventeen Year Old Girl\" Brand New \"Soco Amaretto Lime\" The Dandy Warhols \"We Used to Be Friends\" (association with being the Veronica Mars theme song) Beck \"Loser\" posted by haveanicesummer at 12:14 PM on October 20, 2010 Matt Kresling's Seventeen Not from the time period, but a newer song and great video that brought a ton of memories swelling right up. posted by oldefortran at 12:20 PM on October 20, 2010 \"Knights in White Satin,\" by the Moody Blues was played at every high school dance I ever attended. That and \"Stairway to Heaven\" by Zep. And there'd be a long line of boys leaning against back of the gym wall, watching and listening, but too shy to ask a girl to dance to a slow song. posted by Marie Mon Dieu at 12:25 PM on October 20, 2010 Not sure if this is quite what you're looking for, but Bruce Springsteen's \"Glory Days\" is pretty much the quintessential song ABOUT high school nostalgia. posted by sparrow89 at 12:55 PM on October 20, 2010 Bittersweet Symphony - The Verve. It gets bonus points because it's featured in a film about high school. posted by tryniti at 12:56 PM on October 20, 2010 Travis - \"20\". I can only find live versions because it was a hidden bonus track on their album. Pretty great version of it though. posted by cali59 at 1:20 PM on October 20, 2010 Maybe it says something about my high school experience, but Greetings in Braille by the Elected nails high school for me like no other song. posted by PhoBWanKenobi at 1:23 PM on October 20, 2010 Oh, also, a few years ago I was on one of those Birthright trips to Israel, and everyone from my group was sitting around a campfire in the middle of the desert, singing \"Wonderwall\" by Oasis, with camels watching us. I had the weird experience of walking off to use the bathroom, and passing another group playing the exact same song, even though they were out of earshot. I've decided that if there's one song that defines people my age (26ish) and that everyone from my generation knows from adolescence, it's \"Wonderwall.\" posted by PhoBWanKenobi at 1:39 PM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Bittersweet autumn wouldn't be complete without Bob Seger's \"Night Moves.\" It's someone else's youth--the recycled memories of another generation that crowded the airwaves of my own teenage years--but the longing and the nostalgia speak to me, remind me of how I felt with my high school boyfriend. It moves me still, despite watching him marry and age and parent on Facebook. \"I awoke last night to the sound of thunder How far off I sat and wondered Started humming a song from 1962 Ain't it funny how the night moves When you just don't seem to have as much to lose Strange how the night moves With autumn closing in...\" posted by MonkeyToes at 1:57 PM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] I grew up in L.A. in the 80's and would also vote for: *Anything by the Go-Go's *Anything by the Beastie Boys *Anything by the Cure *Anything by Siouxie and the Banshees/The Creatures *Don't you forget about me - Simple Minds *Obsession - Animotion *Nemesis - Shriekback posted by Sophie1 at 2:24 PM on October 20, 2010 The Smiths, of course. posted by bluedaisy at 2:57 PM on October 20, 2010 I can't believe I'm seriously recommending anything by Berry Manilow, but his The Kid Inside fits your theme. posted by zachlipton at 4:04 PM on October 20, 2010 Hayden- Everything I Long For Eric's Trip- Love Tara Portishead- Dummy posted by to recite so charmingly at 4:47 PM on October 20, 2010 The Odelay album by Beck was great to listen to in high school. As was Weezer's Blue album. And I think the Beach Boys just have an overall nostalgic feel--not necessarily high school, but a longing for the past. \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\" may be brilliantly suited for you right now. posted by shortyJBot at 4:54 PM on October 20, 2010 KMFDM - The Problem posted by Godwin Interjection at 7:48 PM on October 20, 2010 Oh my god, this thread. It's got me right back there, going to awkward parties, hanging out in coffeeshop parking lots, and thinking, yeah, I should try out for the school play! I'm not sure I can add anything new, but I'll try. Albums: No Doubt - Tragic Kingdom Poe - Hello Tori Amos - Any of her first three Green Day - Dookie They Might Be Giants - Flood Soul Coughing - Ruby Vroom or Irresistible Bliss Squirrel Nut Zippers - Hot Sunny Day Real Estate - Their first two records, I forget the names Violent Femmes - Violent Femmes Beck - Odelay Weezer - Blue Album Ben Folds Five - Their first two records Eels - Beautiful Freak or Electro-Shock Blues Smashing Pumpkins - Mellon Collie or earlier Eric's Trip - Anything by them Fountains of Wayne - their debut album, maybe Utopia Parkway as well Nirvana - Nevermind and later Alanis Morisette - Jagged Little Pill (seriously!) You've got Bush and Radiohead covered, but don't forget Stone Temple Pilots, Live, or any of those other similar groups. (Also, the suggestion upthread about ska is spot on.) I'd also try and brainstorm the music that arty high schoolers get into because they see it as a step more literary than their usual tastes, like stuff by Leonard Cohen, \"The Butcher's Tale\" by The Zombies, or, jesus, anything using a string quartet, really. (Also, hey, your debut is out in March? Good luck!) posted by greenland at 10:43 PM on October 20, 2010 I graduated from high school in 2000 and have strong musical associations with 1998-1999. Blink-182 - Dammit Blink-182 - All The Small Things Garbage - When I Grow Up Nerf Herder - New Jersey Girl Dashboard Confessional - Again I Go Unnoticed Lit - My Own Worst Enemy DMX - Party Up Blessid Union of Souls - Hey Leonardo(She Likes Me) Backstreet Boys - anything (I didn't say I LIKED these...) Green Day - Good Riddance Fatboy Slim - The Rockafeller Skank Beastie Boys - Intergalactic Barenaked Ladies - One Week posted by knile at 6:09 AM on October 21, 2010 Response by poster: oh my goodness, this thread is fantastic. thank you so, so much for all the fantastic recs, everyone! to be clear, the book doesn't actually take place WHEN I grew up, so much as WHERE -- teens are typically uninterested in YA novels set past decades, unless they're far back enough to be considered historical (which nowadays includes the 60s!). but music from my high school era (97-01) totally takes me back, and that's the feeling I'll be seeking as I write this, so, awesome! though I love the other eras represented in the thread, too. and seriously, some of these songs... time to stare off into the middle distance misty-eyed or something. (and thanks, greenland -- yes, March! eek!) posted by changeling at 7:47 AM on October 21, 2010 Thurston Moore's (or Cat Power's cover of) \"Psychic Hearts\" (starts at 0:45). posted by ifjuly at 10:12 AM on October 21, 2010 Ohoh, and Sleater-Kinney's \"Surf Song\" which includes Carrie reciting a letter she wrote Corin in high school. \"You Ain't It\" comes to mind too, for that feeling you get as a teenage girl in HS/college when all the too-cool musician guys you hang with kind of make you want to roll your eyes (Liz Phair has songs about that too). And for my money, no song encapsulates better the kind of flipped out claustophobia that happens when you're a teenager struggling with not fitting in because of unorthodox gender performance, feminism, queer identity, etc. than \"Call the Doctor\". \"Taking Me Home\" and \"I'm Not Waiting\" evokes a certain confused-and-upset era of girl-to-ladyhood too. And there's always \"Youth Decay\". posted by ifjuly at 10:22 AM on October 21, 2010 Thought of more this evening. (In part, you can totally tell I had an angsty girlysounds-type adolescence...) Team Dresch - \"Growing Up in Springfield\", \"D.A. Don't Care\" the Butchies - \"Mandy\" Bikini Kill - \"I Hate Danger\" Heavens to Betsy - \"My Red Self\" Sleater-Kinney (yet again!) - \"Lora's Song\" mostly 'cause there's something about the singing style that reminds me of being a 14 year old girl so well... posted by ifjuly at 5:04 PM on October 21, 2010 The Mountain Goats - Palmcorder Yajna & This Year Placebo - Every You Every Me The Verve - Bittersweet Symphony Third Eye Blind - Motorcycle Drive By and why the hell not... Harvey Danger - Flagpole Sitta posted by clearly at 6:36 AM on October 22, 2010 I didn't go to school in California, but if I had to pick 3 works to describe The Shins' Oh, Inverted World, I would pick California, High School and Autumn/Fall. posted by Jon Mitchell at 1:06 PM on October 29, 2010 A friend reminded me of this, uh, gem: Vertical Horizon - Everything You Want Some angst: Poe - Hey Pretty (Drive-By 2001 Mix) Tracy Bonham - Mother Mother Marcy Playground - Sex and Candy Billboard charts from the 90s will ruin my productivity this morning. posted by knile at 1:43 AM on December 3, 2010 ¬´ Older What do I need to learn in library school before I... | Suffering movie amnesia torture Newer ¬ª This thread is closed to new comments.

It's that time again! I'm close to starting my fourth novel, and that means composing a playlist with metafilter's help. This book is a dark contemporary young adult book, set in the sort of central/southern California setting where I grew up. Not in summer, but in fall or winter, with overcast skies and oaks and eucalyptus trees and strawberry fields and shivering at beach bonfires and grimy coffee shops. I listen to the same long playlist every time I sit down to write a book. For this book, I'm looking for songs that convey a sense of high school nostalgia. Songs that re-evoke that excitement, fear, wistfulness, longing, confusion from your teenage years. Maybe they're songs from a pivotal time in your life. Maybe they were just hugely popular back then. Ideally, music you love; \"Hit Me Baby One More Time\" takes me back but it's not exactly conducive to writing. (Or listening.) I prefer rock of any kind, from indie to folk to punk to grunge -- I'm sure the subgenre depends on when you were in high school. But I'm also looking for newer songs that evoke that thrill/terror of being a teenager. The lyrics don't necessarily have to fit, but of course it's extra cool if they do. For me, some of them are \"1979\" by The Smashing Pumpkins (and the video!), \"Glycerine\" by Bush, \"High and Dry\" by Radiohead, etc.; songs not from my high school years, but that still evoke that feeling are \"Don't Change\" by INXS, \"Re: Stacks\" by Bon Iver, \"The Last Word\" by Chris Flew, \"Slow Show\" by The National (but that song makes me nostalgic for all times, including now). There's a definite genre theme there, but really I'd love to know your choices whatever the genre. Thanks!!! You have no idea how much this helps me write -- Metafilter's definitely going in the acknowledgments of my next book(s). posted by changeling to Media & Arts (56 answers total) 28 users marked this as a favorite The pixies doolittle got me through high school. posted by TheBones at 10:54 AM on October 20, 2010 As someone who went to hs in SoCal in the 90's, I'd have to say Ska. Lots and lots of Ska. And some surfer punk stuff. Reel big fish, No Doubt, Squirrel Nut Zippers, The Ziggens, Sublime, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The Aquabats, etc. posted by Arbac at 10:55 AM on October 20, 2010 Simple Minds - Don't You Forget About Me for the 80's posted by Sukey Says at 10:57 AM on October 20, 2010 [4 favorites] I think the Violent Femmes' eponymous first album is the sound of being sixteen, but then, I grew up in the late 80s and early 90s. Their songs' being vulgar and somewhat transgressive is what I think contributes that feel...it just fits with the sense of teenagers always wanting to be older than they are. posted by jocelmeow at 10:57 AM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Popular by Nada Surf Freshman by The Verve Pipe posted by zoomorphic at 10:57 AM on October 20, 2010 the freshmen -- the verve pipe spiderwebs -- no doubt banditos -- the refreshments just -- radiohead & anything from the clueless soundtrack posted by crawfo at 10:58 AM on October 20, 2010 Dropout by Urge Overkill posted by kimdog at 11:00 AM on October 20, 2010 And now, with more link! Dropout by Urge Overkill posted by kimdog at 11:01 AM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] I went to high school in the 90s too. Some of my old favorites that evoke that high school feeling: - The Verve: The Freshmen (on preview, nthing this one) - Red Hot Chili Peppers: Under the Bridge - No Doubt: Don't Speak - Pearl Jam: Black - Candlebox: Far Behind - Violent Femmes: Kiss Off posted by spinto at 11:01 AM on October 20, 2010 The Fun Boy Three version of Our Lips Are Sealed has always had a really school/teenage sort of feeling for me. oh my god look at terry hall's hair Also Blur's Boys And Girls and Pulp's Mis-Shapes from my teenage Britpop years. And more recently, The Long Blondes' Once And Never Again. posted by permafrost at 11:02 AM on October 20, 2010 Also went to high school in Southern California. 2nding Sublime, although it reminds me of summer, not fall. Definitely Weezer, I'd say anything on The Blue Album. 3rd eye blind and Matchbox 20 always remind me of high school (but I don't think I'd want them on a playlist, ever). Neko Case \"That Teenage Feeling\" gives me a good nostalgic feeling. Also: The Violent Femmes, Elliot Smith, Jeff Buckley, Fiona Apple, 311, Incubus... The Romeo and Juliet Soundtrack. Bands from my older brother's ipod (who still listens to all the same music we listened to in high school): Radiohead, Nada Surf, Everclear, Hey Stroker, MxPx... I'll try to come back with more. And please post your playlist when you're done!!! On preview: Yes to Red Hot Chili Peppers posted by thankyouforyourconsideration at 11:05 AM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Some songs at the nostalgic and/or wistful end of the spectrum that have that effect on me (was a teenager during the mid-1990s in the UK): David's Last Summer by Pulp; The Summer House by the Divine Comedy; Wake Up Boo by the Boo Radleys; Lost Myself by the Longpigs; Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm by the Crash Test Dummies; Today by the Smashing Pumpkins. posted by greycap at 11:06 AM on October 20, 2010 Pop A Top by Jim Ed Brown I am OLD posted by raildr at 11:07 AM on October 20, 2010 For me it would be U2's first album, Boy. Lots of songs about growing up, being a teenager, being confused about the world. Classic Edge guitar. Very 80s. Also the song Boy/Girl, off their first EP. I wore out a cassette I made with every B-Side up through the Joshua Tree. Along those lines The Alarm had a lot of songs about believing in yourself and other crap like that. 68 Guns, Knife Edge, Where Were You Hiding (When the storm broke), Strength. More great 80s guitar. posted by bondcliff at 11:09 AM on October 20, 2010 Psychedelic Furs, Love My Way posted by Cool Papa Bell at 11:19 AM on October 20, 2010 Seconding Weezer - Pinkerton and the Green Album in particular posted by aintthattheway at 11:22 AM on October 20, 2010 It came out twenty years before I graduated high school (and that was almost twenty years ago), but there might not be a song more evocative of high school in general than Big Star's \"Thirteen\". The first time I heard it I was just blown away by how perfect it felt, and despite its vintage it couldn't sound fresher if it were written yesterday and recorded this morning. For me personally--the Cure's \"Disintegration\" album. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". Metallica's black album, which reminds me of dirty dark desert parties. posted by padraigin at 11:23 AM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Green Day - Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) Eve 6 - Here's to the Night posted by morganannie at 11:23 AM on October 20, 2010 November Rain by Guns 'N Roses. posted by Sassyfras at 11:24 AM on October 20, 2010 Catch 22 - Kristina She Don't Know I Exist posted by namewithoutwords at 11:40 AM on October 20, 2010 New Radicals - You Get What You Give posted by Mr Mister at 11:41 AM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Led Zeppelin, pretty much anything by them. I remember watching The Song Remains The Same and that was the soundtrack for my high school years. KISS was big then too. This was prior to 1982. posted by JJ86 at 11:47 AM on October 20, 2010 Guster's \"One Man Wrecking Machine\" and \"Homecoming King\" are on the looking-back-on-high-school end of things, but I'd say very appropriate. A lot of Jimmy Eat World songs capture all the high school emotions for me. \"The Middle\" was big just before I entered high school, and \"Your House,\" \"Authority Song,\" and \"Kill\" are very good at evoking the self-conscious uncertainty of having a crush on someone and worrying about every single thing you do around them because what if you look like an idiot, and what if they don't like you back, is everyone looking at me, and all that drama. Finally, this may just be because these guys are from the same town as I am, but \"Madeline\" by Tickle Me Pink vividly conjures up memories from my high school days. posted by lilac girl at 11:48 AM on October 20, 2010 Pearl Jam - Jeremy and Daughter both remind me of high school posted by yawper at 11:49 AM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Songs that re-evoke that...wistfulness, longing These aren't necessarily songs that you would strongly associate with high school, but they definitely evoke wistfulness and longing for something that has passed. The Moody Blues - Your Wildest Dreams Lou Reed - Perfect Day posted by jedicus at 11:50 AM on October 20, 2010 For me that song is San Dimas High School Football Rules, by The Ataris. posted by just_ducky at 11:51 AM on October 20, 2010 American Music - Violent Femmes Story of My Life - Social Distortion Surf Wax America - Weezer Waiting Room - Fugazi 3 Days - Jane's Addiction Pepper - Butthole Surfers What's Up? - 4 Non Blondes Bad Town - Operation Ivy Punk Rock Girl - Dead Milkmen 1 Crush - Garbage Everybody Knows - Leonard Cohen Jerry Was a Racecar Driver - Primus Here Comes Your Man - Pixies Tuesday Morning - the Pogues posted by iamkimiam at 11:55 AM on October 20, 2010 [3 favorites] Concrete Blonde - Tomorrow Wendy, Joey Ben Folds Five - Brick Sinead O'Connor - Nothing Compares 2 U U2 - With or Without You And not rap, but the lyrics are all about high school: John Mayer - No Such Thing. I am a Mayer fan, but I hate this song. However, for wistful and longing, try Something's Missing. It's much better. posted by yawper at 12:00 PM on October 20, 2010 \"Linger\" by The Cranberries. posted by Lucinda at 12:00 PM on October 20, 2010 You want Losing My Religion by REM. I would want the first Counting Crows album, maybe some Gin Blossoms. If you were cooler than that in high school (and it sounds it), I think you want the Smiths. posted by clavicle at 12:03 PM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Anything by Rush or Boston immediately brings me back to an old van filled with hockey players. (On the way back from practice, you dirty birds.) My boyfriend (both basketball player and card-carrying member of the AV club) was super into Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin, too. Which is funny because this was the mid-'90s in Wisconsin, and I couldn't tell you why they were all about the classic rock. I remember this one time at orchestra camp (even better than band camp!) one of my friends was just hanging out in the courtyard playing \"Basketcase\" by Green Day on the guitar. (He's a member of about eight popular bands now, including a cover band.) It was one of those perfect moments, when you see someone playing a song that's not too new and not too old and he knows it by heart and you are thisclose to singing along. I think everybody has a phase when SOMEONE around them discovers The Cure. posted by Madamina at 12:11 PM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Night Swimming by REM posted by WeekendJen at 12:11 PM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Broken Social Scene \"Anthems for a Seventeen Year Old Girl\" Brand New \"Soco Amaretto Lime\" The Dandy Warhols \"We Used to Be Friends\" (association with being the Veronica Mars theme song) Beck \"Loser\" posted by haveanicesummer at 12:14 PM on October 20, 2010 Matt Kresling's Seventeen Not from the time period, but a newer song and great video that brought a ton of memories swelling right up. posted by oldefortran at 12:20 PM on October 20, 2010 \"Knights in White Satin,\" by the Moody Blues was played at every high school dance I ever attended. That and \"Stairway to Heaven\" by Zep. And there'd be a long line of boys leaning against back of the gym wall, watching and listening, but too shy to ask a girl to dance to a slow song. posted by Marie Mon Dieu at 12:25 PM on October 20, 2010 Not sure if this is quite what you're looking for, but Bruce Springsteen's \"Glory Days\" is pretty much the quintessential song ABOUT high school nostalgia. posted by sparrow89 at 12:55 PM on October 20, 2010 Bittersweet Symphony - The Verve. It gets bonus points because it's featured in a film about high school. posted by tryniti at 12:56 PM on October 20, 2010 Travis - \"20\". I can only find live versions because it was a hidden bonus track on their album. Pretty great version of it though. posted by cali59 at 1:20 PM on October 20, 2010 Maybe it says something about my high school experience, but Greetings in Braille by the Elected nails high school for me like no other song. posted by PhoBWanKenobi at 1:23 PM on October 20, 2010 Oh, also, a few years ago I was on one of those Birthright trips to Israel, and everyone from my group was sitting around a campfire in the middle of the desert, singing \"Wonderwall\" by Oasis, with camels watching us. I had the weird experience of walking off to use the bathroom, and passing another group playing the exact same song, even though they were out of earshot. I've decided that if there's one song that defines people my age (26ish) and that everyone from my generation knows from adolescence, it's \"Wonderwall.\" posted by PhoBWanKenobi at 1:39 PM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] Bittersweet autumn wouldn't be complete without Bob Seger's \"Night Moves.\" It's someone else's youth--the recycled memories of another generation that crowded the airwaves of my own teenage years--but the longing and the nostalgia speak to me, remind me of how I felt with my high school boyfriend. It moves me still, despite watching him marry and age and parent on Facebook. \"I awoke last night to the sound of thunder How far off I sat and wondered Started humming a song from 1962 Ain't it funny how the night moves When you just don't seem to have as much to lose Strange how the night moves With autumn closing in...\" posted by MonkeyToes at 1:57 PM on October 20, 2010 [1 favorite] I grew up in L.A. in the 80's and would also vote for: *Anything by the Go-Go's *Anything by the Beastie Boys *Anything by the Cure *Anything by Siouxie and the Banshees/The Creatures *Don't you forget about me - Simple Minds *Obsession - Animotion *Nemesis - Shriekback posted by Sophie1 at 2:24 PM on October 20, 2010 The Smiths, of course. posted by bluedaisy at 2:57 PM on October 20, 2010 I can't believe I'm seriously recommending anything by Berry Manilow, but his The Kid Inside fits your theme. posted by zachlipton at 4:04 PM on October 20, 2010 Hayden- Everything I Long For Eric's Trip- Love Tara Portishead- Dummy posted by to recite so charmingly at 4:47 PM on October 20, 2010 The Odelay album by Beck was great to listen to in high school. As was Weezer's Blue album. And I think the Beach Boys just have an overall nostalgic feel--not necessarily high school, but a longing for the past. \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\" may be brilliantly suited for you right now. posted by shortyJBot at 4:54 PM on October 20, 2010 KMFDM - The Problem posted by Godwin Interjection at 7:48 PM on October 20, 2010 Oh my god, this thread. It's got me right back there, going to awkward parties, hanging out in coffeeshop parking lots, and thinking, yeah, I should try out for the school play! I'm not sure I can add anything new, but I'll try. Albums: No Doubt - Tragic Kingdom Poe - Hello Tori Amos - Any of her first three Green Day - Dookie They Might Be Giants - Flood Soul Coughing - Ruby Vroom or Irresistible Bliss Squirrel Nut Zippers - Hot Sunny Day Real Estate - Their first two records, I forget the names Violent Femmes - Violent Femmes Beck - Odelay Weezer - Blue Album Ben Folds Five - Their first two records Eels - Beautiful Freak or Electro-Shock Blues Smashing Pumpkins - Mellon Collie or earlier Eric's Trip - Anything by them Fountains of Wayne - their debut album, maybe Utopia Parkway as well Nirvana - Nevermind and later Alanis Morisette - Jagged Little Pill (seriously!) You've got Bush and Radiohead covered, but don't forget Stone Temple Pilots, Live, or any of those other similar groups. (Also, the suggestion upthread about ska is spot on.) I'd also try and brainstorm the music that arty high schoolers get into because they see it as a step more literary than their usual tastes, like stuff by Leonard Cohen, \"The Butcher's Tale\" by The Zombies, or, jesus, anything using a string quartet, really. (Also, hey, your debut is out in March? Good luck!) posted by greenland at 10:43 PM on October 20, 2010 I graduated from high school in 2000 and have strong musical associations with 1998-1999.

And for my money, no song encapsulates better the kind of flipped out claustophobia that happens when you're a teenager struggling with not fitting in because of unorthodox gender performance, feminism, queer identity, etc. than \"Call the Doctor\". \"Taking Me Home\" and \"I'm Not Waiting\" evokes a certain confused-and-upset era of girl-to-ladyhood too. And there's always \"Youth Decay\". posted by ifjuly at 10:22 AM on October 21, 2010 Thought of more this evening. (In part, you can totally tell I had an angsty girlysounds-type adolescence...)

These songs are about nostalgic memories and reminiscing about the good old days when you were young. Here is a list of 29 songs about nostalgia: 1 ‚ÄúSummer of ‚Äô69‚Äù by Bryan Adams Bryan Adams‚Äô ‚ÄúSummer of ‚Äô69‚Äù is a quintessential song about youthful nostalgia, capturing the carefree days of adolescence. Through the lens of the summer of ‚Äô69, Adams reminisces about love, friendship, and playing in a rock band, all wrapped in the innocence and recklessness of youth. The imagery of buying his first real six-string and playing until his fingers bled evokes a time when everything felt limitless, and dreams seemed within reach. The song speaks to the universal longing to relive the simpler, happier moments of youth. It‚Äôs not just about the specific year but the universal feeling of looking back with fondness on a time when life felt pure and unburdened. 2 ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äù by The Beatles ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äù by The Beatles is a melancholic anthem for lost time and regret, making it one of the most iconic nostalgia songs ever written. Paul McCartney‚Äôs yearning lyrics reflect on a time when things were simpler, before life‚Äôs complications and heartaches took over. The softness of the melody, paired with the emotional weight of McCartney‚Äôs vocals, creates a powerful reflection on how everything can change in the blink of an eye. The song conveys a longing for a return to a time when troubles were distant, and life seemed whole. It‚Äôs a poignant reminder of how fleeting moments of happiness can be, making us treasure our yesterdays all the more. 3 ‚ÄúGlory Days‚Äù by Bruce Springsteen Bruce Springsteen‚Äôs ‚ÄúGlory Days‚Äù dives headfirst into the bittersweet experience of recalling the past. Through the stories of a baseball player and a woman who once had it all, Springsteen paints a picture of people who are well past their prime but can‚Äôt let go of their ‚Äòglory days.‚Äô His raw vocals and the upbeat melody contrast with the underlying sadness of the song, capturing the blend of joy and sorrow that comes with remembering what once was. The song reminds us that while it‚Äôs wonderful to remember the high points of life, those moments are behind us. Its message is clear: nostalgia can be both a comforting friend and a harsh reminder of time‚Äôs relentless march forward. 4 ‚Äú1979‚Äù by Smashing Pumpkins Smashing Pumpkins‚Äô ‚Äú1979‚Äù captures the essence of suburban teenage life and the hazy, carefree days of youth. With lyrics that weave together memories of cruising around aimlessly and the aimlessness of adolescence, the song reflects a time before adulthood‚Äôs responsibilities set in. The shimmering guitar work and Billy Corgan‚Äôs ethereal vocals help convey a dreamy sense of nostalgia, where memories blur into one endless summer. The song perfectly encapsulates the feeling of looking back on teenage years, not with a sense of regret but with a sense of wonder at how innocent and spontaneous life felt at that age. It‚Äôs a tribute to a fleeting time when the world seemed wide open. 5 ‚ÄúIn My Life‚Äù by The Beatles ‚ÄúIn My Life‚Äù by The Beatles is a tender reflection on the people, places, and moments that have shaped a person‚Äôs existence. John Lennon‚Äôs heartfelt lyrics, paired with the gentle melody, create a reflective tone that touches on both the joy and sadness of looking back. The song is about cherishing memories of the past while also recognizing that the present and future hold equal importance. With its timeless melody and universal theme, ‚ÄúIn My Life‚Äù resonates with listeners across generations, reminding us that while we hold onto our past, we continue to evolve, and life goes on, shaped by our memories and experiences. 6 ‚ÄúJack and Diane‚Äù by John Mellencamp John Mellencamp‚Äôs ‚ÄúJack and Diane‚Äù is a nostalgic look at small-town America and the fleeting nature of youth. Through the story of a young couple, Mellencamp captures the innocence and simplicity of teenage love, set against the backdrop of a life full of potential. The catchy chorus, ‚ÄúOh yeah, life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone,‚Äù sums up the song‚Äôs message about how quickly those youthful moments pass by. The song evokes a sense of longing for the carefree days of youth, reminding listeners that no matter how much we try to hold onto those memories, time inevitably moves on, and we have to grow up. 7 ‚ÄúThe Boys of Summer‚Äù by Don Henley Don Henley‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Boys of Summer‚Äù is a nostalgic anthem that captures the feeling of longing for lost youth and love. The song reflects on the fleeting nature of summer and how time moves forward, leaving behind those golden moments that once felt eternal.
