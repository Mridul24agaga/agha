Skip to content Menu About SEO Training Results Apply Today Backlinks: The Last Guide You’ll Ever Need By: Nathan Gotch January 19, 2025 Fact Checked What are backlinks, and how do you get more in 2025? This website you’re on right now has 150,000 backlinks from 3,960 unique domains. And in this guide, I’ll show you 7 ways to get more backlinks like a link building pro. In fact, you’re going to learn: What are Backlinks? 7 Characteristics of Quality Backlinks 3 Types of Backlinks to AVOID! What’s a Good Number of Backlinks? How to Get Backlinks (Like an SEO Pro) FAQs About Backlinks Let’s dive in. What Are Backlinks? Backlinks are created when one website links to another website. Google (and other search engines) consider backlinks to be “votes” for a page. In fact, Google’s original PageRank algorithm used backlinks to signal content quality. Many studies have found a correlation between backlinks and organic search engine rankings. Here’s an example of a backlink: Related: Are Backlinks Still Important? What Do Quality Backlinks Look Like? High-quality backlinks have 7 characteristics: relevance, traffic, authority, link profile quality, editorial standards, outbound link quality, and indexation. Let’s start with: 1. Relevance John Mueller recently said that relevance is more important than how many backlinks a website has. In fact, here’s exactly what he said: In short, most of your link building efforts should focus on relevant opportunities. That’s why I created The Relevancy Pyramid. It’s the single best way to prioritize your link opportunities. The model is simple: There are fewer link building opportunities that are 100% relevant to your website. You should focus on these first. Then, once you’ve tapped those out, move down the pyramid where there will be fewer prospects. Now, there are two exceptions to this link prioritization strategy: Getting links from super authority sites like the New York Times, Washington Post, or .edu/.gov sites is always okay. The Relevancy Pyramid changes if you’re working in local SERPs. I recommend focusing on geo-targeted opportunities first. Then, move on to topically relevant prospects on the national level. This will create the most natural and relevant link profile. Now, of course, it’s not all about relevance. If that were the case, you could create hundreds of relevant websites yourself and link to your site. That doesn’t work because it would miss all the other factors that make a backlink powerful. Bringing me to standard #2: 2. Traffic You need to get links to your site from relevant websites with organic traffic. Think about it: What does that say if Google sends organic search traffic to a site? It means that it’s likely a trustworthy website. In general, sites that are popular in organic search are valuable link building opportunities. You can use Semrush (Semrush review) to see if a website is getting organic search traffic (and to see the “value” of that traffic): Now, a website can be relevant and have traffic, but it still needs the following: 3. Authority If a website is getting organic traffic, it likely has authority. You can use Ahrefs’ DR (Ahrefs review) to prioritize link building prospects based on their site authority. The stronger a website is, the harder it will be to get the link. That makes those links even more valuable, so it’s worth the effort. 4. Link Quality It is possible to manipulate third-party metrics like Ahrefs’ DR or Moz’s DA. So, that’s why you need to analyze the backlink profile of all your opportunities manually. I like to run the website through Ahrefs and filter their links by “DoFollow.” I then sort them so that the strongest links with the highest DR are at the top. In short, you want to see the site getting links from high-quality sources. Use the same criteria from above. 5. Editorial Standards Why are diamonds valuable? Because they’re difficult to get! That’s why you should focus on getting links on websites with high editorial standards. The harder it is to land a backlink, the more valuable it is. The opposite is true, as well: The easier a backlink is to get, the less valuable it is. 6. Outbound Link Quality Websites with strong editorial guidelines will likely only link out to quality resources. You want your link to “live” around other trustworthy outbound links. Enter your domain into Ahrefs Site Explorer and go to “Linked domains” under “Outgoing links”: Examine every prospective website and ask: How are they linking out? Are the outbound links relevant? Are the outbound links going to respected, trusted sites? Do the outbound links look natural, or do they look like paid links? 7. Indexation Nothing is more important than making sure you get links on indexed websites. If the site isn’t indexed in Google, then your links will be worthless. Go to Google and search “site:example.com”. If they don’t show up, avoid the website. Now that you know what a quality backlink looks like, let’s talk about what links you should AVOID. 3 Types of Backlinks to Avoid in 2025 If you review the 7 characteristics of quality backlinks above, you’ll see that the following types of backlinks don’t qualify. Most websites aren’t relevant, have no traffic, have no editorial guidelines, and have horrific outbound links. Here’s the first example: 1. Public Blog Networks You’ve probably heard of Private Blog Networks (PBNs), but public blog networks differ. Both are risky because they involve artificial link building. However, private blog networks are slightly less risky because they can be disguised better. On the other hand, public blog networks are nothing more than link farms that are easily detectable. Look at this website that uses public blog network links: Most public networks don’t even bother to block third-party crawlers like Ahrefs. If it takes me two seconds to see that you’re using public network links, what do you think Google can do? Here’s what an actual public blog network looks like: Stay away from these links if you want to avoid getting penalized. 2. DoFollow Blog Comments Here’s what they look like: These links hit the “authority” quality criteria for links. However, they greatly miss the mark with everything else. Plus, you don’t want your website in the same neighborhood as some of the outbound links you’ll see. 3. Web 2.0s The thought process for using web 2.0s is similar to DoFollow blog comments. You’re trying to leverage the existing site’s authority like Wix: However, web 2.0s adds another level because they attempt to add artificial relevance. So what’s the problem? Well, they aren’t editorial links, the content is low-quality, and you don’t benefit much from the authority because it’s on a subdomain. Plus, the only way web 2.0 backlinks can have any benefit is if they’re indexed. And guess what? They’re notoriously hard to index on Google unless you build tier-two links. Now you know what backlinks to avoid like the plague. But now an important question arises: What’s a Good Number of Backlinks? Examining your competitors is key to knowing how many backlinks you need. This process is called a backlink gap analysis. Here’s how to do it: 1. Identify a qualified keyword target Related: Best Keyword Research Services (According to 11 Tests) 2. Create SEO content that’s better than the competitors “SEO content” applies to both informational and transactional pages. 3. Identify how many backlinks you need through a link gap analysis A link gap analysis is broken down into two parts. First, you need to analyze how many backlinks your competitors have to their domain as a whole. Run your target keyword through Ahrefs Keyword Explorer, then scroll down to see the competitors. Go to “More” and open “Domain Comparison” in another tab. Enter the top 4 competitors for your target keyword and enter your domain as well. Now, you’ll see the gap between you and the competitors if there isn’t much of a gap (or you’re ahead), then awesome! You likely won’t need many backlinks to rank the page. This leads to the next part of the link gap analysis. You now need to analyze how many backlinks you’ll need to your target keyword-driven page to rank. You can use the Ahrefs KD metric to get a rough estimate. However, this is flawed for one big reason. You don’t know what authority of links you’ll need to rank. So what we do is categorize each competitor’s backlinks into authority ranges like this: Then, you’ll know exactly how many backlinks you’ll need at each authority level. This is super useful because you can estimate the budget you’ll need for backlinks. How to Get Backlinks (Like an SEO Pro) Here are 7 link building techniques you can use to land more high-quality backlinks. 1. Authority Transfer Technique The Authority Transfer Technique isn’t technically a “link building” tactic, but it’s a powerful way to distribute link authority (PageRank) to your most important SEO-driven pages. Here’s how it works: Step #1 – Identify what pages on your site have existing backlinks The easiest way to find these pages is to use Ahrefs. Just open up Ahrefs → Enter your domain → Start analysis. Then click on “Best by Links” under “Pages” → Sort by “Referring Domains”: Step #2 – Add internal links on those pages to relevant SEO-driven pages Now, all you need to do now is add internal links. Your internal should target pages that are A) topically relevant and B) you’re trying to rank. I recommend using exact match anchor text with your internal links (it’s safe to do so as long as they aren’t site-wide). I recommend using this technique every time you publish a new SEO-driven page. It’s one of the best ways to boost your page out of the gate (by leveraging existing authority). Your goal should be to push your pages up the SERPs as far as possible before acquiring links. The Authority Transfer Technique is one of the best ways to accomplish that goal (fast). 2. LIS Technique What qualities make people want to link to your website? There are many qualities, but there’s one that helps enormously and is called “Length Implies Strength” or LIS. Have you ever seen one of those super-long sales letters that seem to scroll for decades? Well, that’s not an accident. Long sales letters leverage “Heuristics.” In short, we (humans) are lazy and hate thinking. So, we use mental shortcuts to make decisions, solve problems, pass judgments, etc. So, what does this have to do with link building? According to Backlinko’s study: “Long-form content gets an average of 77.2% more links than short articles.” That means if you want more backlinks, then create long-form content. For example, if you examine what pages have attracted the most backlinks on GotchSEO.com, you will see that they are all my longest pieces of content: The average word count for my top 4 most linked-to content assets is 7,223 words. Pretty insane, right? Here’s the main takeaway: If you want more links, write longer, in-depth content. Don’t take this out of context, though! It needs to be well-thought-out and add massive amounts of UNIQUE value. 3. Predictive Links Technique What if you could create pages on your site that attracted backlinks like clockwork? That’s possible when you use the Predictive Links Technique. The best part is that it’s super simple. Here’s what you do: Step #1 – Examine your competitor’s most linked-to pages Just open up Ahrefs → Enter a competitor’s domain → Click on “Best by Links.” You’ll immediately see what topics have attracted the most backlinks in your niche. You can also use this same technique for creating “predictive” viral content on social media. Just go to Buzzsumo → Enter a topic: Then, you’ll have access to proven ideas to attract social shares (and links). You can also do the same thing with YouTube. Go to a popular channel in your niche → sort their videos by most popular And BOOM! You see the ideas that the niche is most interested in. Step #2 – Create a page around the same topic, but make it 10x different and better Whether you’re using this method to attract links, get more social traction, or dominate YouTube, the principle is the same. You will create a content asset that’s 10x different and better than your competitors. Step #3 – Reach out to the people that linked to your competitor’s content This is a concept I teach in my advanced SEO training program (check out this Gotch SEO Academy review): I recommend “testing the waters” before pitching your content when you use this strategy. Send a simple outreach email like this: Hey [NAME], My name is [YOUR NAME], and I’m the [YOUR POSITION] at [YOUR COMPANY]. I researched [TOPIC] and saw that you linked to [COMPETITOR’S URL] – that makes sense because it’s awesome. I just published a new guide on [TOPIC] it [VALUE PROPOSITION]. Would you be interested in seeing it (and maybe give some feedback)? Let me know, and I’ll shoot the link over. Thanks again! [NAME] If the prospect complies, then send them this: Hey [NAME], That’s great! Here’s a link: Let me know what you think. Also: If you think it adds value to your readers, would you mind linking to it? I can [INSERT SOME VALUE YOU CAN GIVE THEM]. Thanks again! I recommend testing many different templates for the second email until you hit a sweet spot. Just make sure you’re giving something valuable when asking for a link. 3. Relationship Accelerator Technique The Relationship Accelerator Technique serves a dual purpose: It can help you build relationships with key “linkerati” (people who are capable and willing to link to you). It can help you score links with minimal effort. There are a few different ways to go about this. You can host expert roundups and interviews or ask for expert contributions to your content. For example, I had Miles Beckler on my SEO podcast, and he linked to the page where it was hosted: This technique works because there’s a clear exchange of value. The experts get exposure, and you get to build a non-transactional relationship with them. You’ll be exposed yourself because they likely share or link to the content. 4. Oprah Technique I created a cool name for this technique, but it’s super simple. You’re going to get interviewed and land links. Go to Google → Enter “interview + niche” or “interview with + [YOUR COMPETITOR]” Add all these prospects to your link building database. Then, just reach out and pitch yourself for the interview. Use a simple template like this: Hey [NAME], My name is [YOUR NAME] and I’m the [YOUR POSITION] at [YOUR COMPANY]. First, just wanted to thank you for all the amazing interviews you’ve been doing. I’ve listened to your interview with [INSERT ONE YOU LIKED] multiple times because it’s so incredibly valuable. Quick question: are you accepting new interviewees at this time? If you are, I would love to chat because of I [COOL RESULT]. Let me know. Thanks! 5. Use The Merger Technique The Merger Technique is simple: Find websites with high-quality link profiles, acquire them, and 301 redirect them to your website. For example, Neil Patel acquired UberSuggest and merged it with NeilPatel.com. As a result, he gained an additional 17,500 backlinks from 5,610 referring domains: And Backlinko did the same thing when we acquired PointblankSEO.com. Brian scored 24,500 additional backlinks from 2,000 referring domains: They both acquired active websites or tools, which is the best strategy. You can also use expired domains. I recommend using Spamzilla to find them (watch this free tutorial). 6. Leverage The Phantom Technique You may reach your target backlink volume for a specific page at a certain point. But what should you do if you’re still not ranking where you want to be? That’s when the Phantom Technique enters. Instead of building more backlinks on tier one (links directly hitting your website), you can strengthen your existing backlinks. This process is known as tier two link building. It’s extremely powerful, and your competitors likely won’t know you’re doing it. 7. The Switch-Up Technique The Switch Up Technique is my favorite way to build relationships fast. As you may or may not know, building relationships is critical to getting more backlinks. Most people fail at link outreach because they’re metaphorically trying to hit a home run on the first date. Like in sales, you must take baby steps along the journey. You have to build relationships with the websites (and people who are capable of linking to you) BEFORE you ask for something. There needs to be an exchange of value. “Value” comes in many forms, including money, help, and content. Here’s a perfect example of a student of Gotch SEO Academy (our SEO training program) exchanging value with me (I had no choice but to link to this tool because it solved a REAL problem and added REAL value): Money works well, but you can acquire links without having to pay people. But that will only be possible through building real relationships. The first step to accomplishing that is to use the Switch Up Technique. Here’s how you do it: Go through your blog content and examine all your external links. See if you’re linking out to general websites like Wikipedia, CNN, or any authority website with many authors. Go to Google and look for a replacement from a lower authority blog. Change the link Reach out to the person Use a non-threatening template like this: Hey [NAME], My name is [YOUR NAME] and I’m the [YOUR POSITION] at [YOUR COMPANY]. I was doing some research on [TOPIC] and discovered your guide about [TOPIC]. I really enjoyed it. I never realized that [SOMETHING YOU LEARNED FROM THEIR CONTENT]. Super cool. Anyway, I won’t take up any more of your time. Just wanted to thank you for putting the article together and wanted to let you know that I linked to it from my article: [INSERT NAKED URL] – it’s about [TOPIC]. Thanks again! [NAME] 8. Leverage Existing Relationships Think about your family, friends, clients, and industry colleagues. Make a list of everyone with a website relevant to your vertical. Then, see if they’d be willing to place a link on a relevant page. 9. Go Back to School Leverage the fact that you’re an alumnus of your high school or college. Schools are always looking to promote successful alumni. You can also reach out to colleges and universities in your local area and volunteer to help the students. Some options are guest speaking, guest posts, etc. Leverage your expertise and add value to get links. 10. Offer Internships Need help running your company? Create an internship program. Then, create a dedicated page for it and look for link opportunities. If it’s a local internship, you can target local opportunities by searching “CITY + internships.” You can get listed on the internship directory websites if it’s national. 11. Write Content for Other Websites Guest posting is a tried and true method for getting free backlinks. There is a clear exchange of value. You write great content for their website, so they don’t have to. Then, you get a backlink for your efforts. There are unlimited opportunities for guest posting in every vertical. Go to Google and enter search queries like: “write for us + ” (example: “write for us + fitness”). Then, use the Data Miner plugin to export the results and add them to your link prospecting database. Repeat this process a few times until you have a large database. Then, copy 200 of the prospects and open up SEMRush. Go to “Gap Analysis” and then “Bulk Analysis.” Paste the prospects and run the analysis. Now you’ll know the total organic search traffic for each website. Prioritize opportunities that have traffic because these are likely the highest quality opportunities. Now you just need to have contact information. I use Hunter.io. Once you’ve found the correct contact information, send a simple outreach email like this: Hey [NAME], My name is [YOUR NAME], and I write over at [YOUR BLOG]. I was wondering if you guys are accepting guest contributors right now? I have a few ideas for your blog that I think you’ll like. Let me know, and I’ll send them over. Thanks! I always like sending an initial email to warm the prospect up. Notice how I didn’t hit the prospect with a pitch right away. My only goal in the first email is to get the prospect to respond. Once the prospect responds, I send a second email with three ideas: That’s great to hear! Here are three ideas: Let me know which one you like, and we’ll jump on creating the first draft. Thank you 12. Reverse Guest Posting Reverse guest posting is the process of getting other experts to write for your website. The key is to make sure they have an audience and website themselves. There’s no guarantee that they’ll link back to your site. However, it’s likely because it acts as a form of ego bait. Example from my about page. In other words, people like to promote themselves, especially in the business world. Now, there is one caveat with this method. Your website needs a solid base of traffic and a decent audience. No one is going to write content for your website if they aren’t benefiting from it. Remember the exchange of value. 13. Interview Experts Interviewing experts (with audiences) is the oldest trick in the book, but it will continue to work. That’s because interviews are the ultimate ego bait. Plus, the interviewee benefits from promoting the interview (on your website). Take a look at Smart Passive Income’s link profile on Ahrefs. You’ll notice that interviewees have linked to the page hosting their interviews. But that’s not all. Since many interviewees are well-known, their interviews generally attract links. For example, Entrepreneur.com linked to an interview featuring Ramit Sethi. That alone shows you the power of interviews. 14. Recreate Dead Content I call this the White Hat Alternative to PBNs. It’s simple. Use a tool like SpamZilla to find qualified expired domains. Go here to start your free trial of SpamZilla. Then open up Ahrefs and go to the Site Explorer. Paste the prospective expired domain and export all of its Followed links. Now, examine what pages have backlinks. Copy a URL and paste it into the Way Back Machine. The first question is whether or not the content is relevant to your website. If it isn’t, keep searching. If it is, the next question is, can you create something better? If so, create the asset. Then, reach out to all of the websites linking to the dead page. Here’s a simple outreach email to test: Hey [NAME], My name is [YOUR NAME] and I’m [YOUR POSITION] at [YOUR COMPANY]. I was doing some research and found your awesome guide about [TOPIC]. I noticed you are linking to a dead website in the section about [TOPIC]. I actually just created an article about the [TOPIC] which might be a good replacement. Let me know, thanks! 15. Fix SSL Certificates One of the most significant points of leverage is helping websites that don’t have SSL certificates installed. This method is effective if you’re also trying to land new SEO clients. Fixing the SSL certificate can act as a front-end offer. Then, you can pitch them on SEO services. 16. Create Data-Driven Link Bait People love linking to data. The cool part is that you don’t need to create the data from scratch. You can leverage existing data and create a curated resource. Now, it is even better if you can create original data. Compiling original data is more complicated, but it does pay off. For example, I have a few data-driven posts on Gotch SEO like: Top 3 Best Link Building Services (We Spent $140,424 to Find Out) Is Google Biased? We Analyzed 50 Key Politically-Driven Topics to Find Out We Analyzed 438 SEO Companies (Here’s the Top 10) What’s the Best CMS for SEO? (10,000 Keywords Analyzed) 17. Host an Expert Roundup Most expert roundups are pretty bad. But if you dedicate yourself to creating one that adds value and invites real experts, then it can succeed. It falls under the ego bait category. In short, there’s a possibility that the experts will link back to the roundup in which they participated. 18. Reverse Expert Roundups You can also find existing expert roundups and pitch your contribution. Go to Google and enter search queries like “YOUR NICHE + expert roundup.” Then just send a simple outreach email like so: Hey [NAME], My name is [YOUR NAME], and I’m the founder of [YOUR COMPANY OR BLOG]. I saw that you put together an awesome expert roundup and wondered if I could contribute to it? I have some unique insights to share about [THE TOPIC OF THE ROUNDUP] because of my experience working [in|with] [ENTER SOCIAL PROOF/QUALIFICATIONS]. Please let me know if there’s any way to make this happen. Thanks for your time. 19. Use HARO Using HARO for link building isn’t new, but it is still super effective. The key is to understand that most of your submissions will get ghosted. That’s why you need to go into it with the mindset that your submission may not get approved. It’s an odd experience overall. However, you can score some awesome links IF your contribution does get approved. 20. Volunteer in Your Local Market There are so many untapped link opportunities on the local level—one of the simplest ways to score links to volunteer in your local area. Go to Google and search “YOUR CITY + our sponsors” or “YOUR CITY + our volunteers.” Then, look for pages that link out to sponsors or volunteers. These should be your targets. Now, think of a way that you can add value to the charity. Sometimes, that’s in the form of physical labor or in-person participation. But other times, you can offer technical support online as well. 21. Create Profiles in Your Vertical Notice how I said in “your” vertical? Don’t create a bunch of random profiles just because you can. There is no point. Only create profiles on websites that are relevant in your industry. For example, it makes sense for me to have a profile on Moz or a profile on an SEO forum. Most of these websites will give you a link back to your website in the profile section. Some are followed, while others are nofollow. It doesn’t matter because they’re still relevant. 22. Create Business Listings If you have a local business, creating business listings is the easiest way to score free backlinks. These listings can help you local pack performance in Google. As long as you keep your Name, Address, Phone, and Website (NAP-W) information consistent. You can use Fat Joe’s citation building service to save time. FAQs About Backlinks My backlinks are decreasing. What now? It’s natural and normal to lose some links over time. That’s why it’s critical to remember that link acquisition isn’t a one-time event. It needs to be an ongoing activity. You should always be taking action to acquire new backlinks to compensate for those you lose. My backlinks are not showing in Google Search Console, Ahrefs, etc. Why? Google Search Console only shows a sample of your total link profile. While third-party tools like Ahrefs are amazing at finding backlinks, they aren’t perfect or comprehensive. Assume that these tools only show a percentage of your entire link profile. Are Fiverr backlinks good? In my experience, 99% of link opportunities on Fiverr are bad. In general, I would avoid buying backlinks from Fiverr. Remember… you usually get what you pay for. Are NoFollow backlinks good? NoFollow backlinks are not good or effective because they don’t pass PageRank. They’re only useful if you’re getting referral traffic or sales. But from an SEO perspective, they have no value. How many backlinks per day are safe? You only need to worry about link velocity when you’re building artificial backlinks.

      "title": "Published Time: 2025-01-19T00:37:00+00:00 What Are Backlinks and Why Are They Important for SEO? Skip to content Menu About SEO Training Results Apply Today Backlinks: The Last Guide You’ll Ever Need By: Nathan Gotch January 19, 2025 Fact Checked What are backlinks, and how do you get more in 2025? This website you’re on right now has 150,000 backlinks from 3,960 unique domains. And in this guide, I’ll show you 7 ways to get more backlinks like a link building pro. In fact, you’re going to learn: What are Backlinks? 7 Characteristics of Quality Backlinks 3 Types of Backlinks to AVOID! What’s a Good Number of Backlinks? How to Get Backlinks (Like an SEO Pro) FAQs About Backlinks Let’s dive in. What Are Backlinks? Backlinks are created when one website links to another website. Google (and other search engines) consider backlinks to be “votes” for a page. In fact, Google’s original PageRank algorithm used backlinks to signal content quality. Many studies have found a correlation between backlinks and organic search engine rankings. Here’s an example of a backlink: Related: Are Backlinks Still Important? What Do Quality Backlinks Look Like? High-quality backlinks have 7 characteristics: relevance, traffic, authority, link profile quality, editorial standards, outbound link quality, and indexation. Let’s start with: 1. Relevance John Mueller recently said that relevance is more important than how many backlinks a website has. In fact, here’s exactly what he said: In short, most of your link building efforts should focus on relevant opportunities. That’s why I created The Relevancy Pyramid. It’s the single best way to prioritize your link opportunities. The model is simple: There are fewer link building opportunities that are 100% relevant to your website. You should focus on these first. Then, once you’ve tapped those out, move down the pyramid where there will be fewer prospects. Now, there are two exceptions to this link prioritization strategy: Getting links from super authority sites like the New York Times, Washington Post, or .edu/.gov sites is always okay. The Relevancy Pyramid changes if you’re working in local SERPs. I recommend focusing on geo-targeted opportunities first. Then, move on to topically relevant prospects on the national level. This will create the most natural and relevant link profile. Now, of course, it’s not all about relevance. If that were the case, you could create hundreds of relevant websites yourself and link to your site. That doesn’t work because it would miss all the other factors that make a backlink powerful. Bringing me to standard #2: 2. Traffic You need to get links to your site from relevant websites with organic traffic. Think about it: What does that say if Google sends organic search traffic to a site? It means that it’s likely a trustworthy website. In general, sites that are popular in organic search are valuable link building opportunities. You can use Semrush (Semrush review) to see if a website is getting organic search traffic (and to see the “value” of that traffic): Now, a website can be relevant and have traffic, but it still needs the following: 3. Authority If a website is getting organic traffic, it likely has authority. You can use Ahrefs’ DR (Ahrefs review) to prioritize link building prospects based on their site authority. The stronger a website is, the harder it will be to get the link. That makes those links even more valuable, so it’s worth the effort. 4. Link Quality It is possible to manipulate third-party metrics like Ahrefs’ DR or Moz’s DA. So, that’s why you need to analyze the backlink profile of all your opportunities manually. I like to run the website through Ahrefs and filter their links by “DoFollow.” I then sort them so that the strongest links with the highest DR are at the top. In short, you want to see the site getting links from high-quality sources. Use the same criteria from above. 5. Editorial Standards Why are diamonds valuable? Because they’re difficult to get! That’s why you should focus on getting links on websites with high editorial standards. The harder it is to land a backlink, the more valuable it is. The opposite is true, as well: The easier a backlink is to get, the less valuable it is. 6. Outbound Link Quality Websites with strong editorial guidelines will likely only link out to quality resources. You want your link to “live” around other trustworthy outbound links. Enter your domain into Ahrefs Site Explorer and go to “Linked domains” under “Outgoing links”: Examine every prospective website and ask: How are they linking out? Are the outbound links relevant? Are the outbound links going to respected, trusted sites? Do the outbound links look natural, or do they look like paid links? 7. Indexation Nothing is more important than making sure you get links on indexed websites. If the site isn’t indexed in Google, then your links will be worthless. Go to Google and search “site:example.com”. If they don’t show up, avoid the website. Now that you know what a quality backlink looks like, let’s talk about what links you should AVOID. 3 Types of Backlinks to Avoid in 2025 If you review the 7 characteristics of quality backlinks above, you’ll see that the following types of backlinks don’t qualify. Most websites aren’t relevant, have no traffic, have no editorial guidelines, and have horrific outbound links. Here’s the first example: 1. Public Blog Networks You’ve probably heard of Private Blog Networks (PBNs), but public blog networks differ. Both are risky because they involve artificial link building. However, private blog networks are slightly less risky because they can be disguised better. On the other hand, public blog networks are nothing more than link farms that are easily detectable. Look at this website that uses public blog network links: Most public networks don’t even bother to block third-party crawlers like Ahrefs. If it takes me two seconds to see that you’re using public network links, what do you think Google can do? Here’s what an actual public blog network looks like: Stay away from these links if you want to avoid getting penalized. 2. DoFollow Blog Comments Here’s what they look like: These links hit the “authority” quality criteria for links. However, they greatly miss the mark with everything else. Plus, you don’t want your website in the same neighborhood as some of the outbound links you’ll see. 3. Web 2.0s The thought process for using web 2.0s is similar to DoFollow blog comments. You’re trying to leverage the existing site’s authority like Wix: However, web 2.0s adds another level because they attempt to add artificial relevance. So what’s the problem? Well, they aren’t editorial links, the content is low-quality, and you don’t benefit much from the authority because it’s on a subdomain. Plus, the only way web 2.0 backlinks can have any benefit is if they’re indexed. And guess what? They’re notoriously hard to index on Google unless you build tier-two links. Now you know what backlinks to avoid like the plague. But now an important question arises: What’s a Good Number of Backlinks? Examining your competitors is key to knowing how many backlinks you need. This process is called a backlink gap analysis. Here’s how to do it: 1. Identify a qualified keyword target Related: Best Keyword Research Services (According to 11 Tests) 2. Create SEO content that’s better than the competitors “SEO content” applies to both informational and transactional pages. 3. Identify how many backlinks you need through a link gap analysis A link gap analysis is broken down into two parts. First, you need to analyze how many backlinks your competitors have to their domain as a whole. Run your target keyword through Ahrefs Keyword Explorer, then scroll down to see the competitors. Go to “More” and open “Domain Comparison” in another tab. Enter the top 4 competitors for your target keyword and enter your domain as well. Now, you’ll see the gap between you and the competitors if there isn’t much of a gap (or you’re ahead), then awesome! You likely won’t need many backlinks to rank the page. This leads to the next part of the link gap analysis. You now need to analyze how many backlinks you’ll need to your target keyword-driven page to rank. You can use the Ahrefs KD metric to get a rough estimate. However, this is flawed for one big reason. You don’t know what authority of links you’ll need to rank. So what we do is categorize each competitor’s backlinks into authority ranges like this: Then, you’ll know exactly how many backlinks you’ll need at each authority level. This is super useful because you can estimate the budget you’ll need for backlinks. How to Get Backlinks (Like an SEO Pro) Here are 7 link building techniques you can use to land more high-quality backlinks. 1. Authority Transfer Technique The Authority Transfer Technique isn’t technically a “link building” tactic, but it’s a powerful way to distribute link authority (PageRank) to your most important SEO-driven pages. Here’s how it works: Step #1 – Identify what pages on your site have existing backlinks The easiest way to find these pages is to use Ahrefs. Just open up Ahrefs → Enter your domain → Start analysis. Then click on “Best by Links” under “Pages” → Sort by “Referring Domains”: Step #2 – Add internal links on those pages to relevant SEO-driven pages Now, all you need to do now is add internal links. Your internal should target pages that are A) topically relevant and B) you’re trying to rank. I recommend using exact match anchor text with your internal links (it’s safe to do so as long as they aren’t site-wide). I recommend using this technique every time you publish a new SEO-driven page. It’s one of the best ways to boost your page out of the gate (by leveraging existing authority). Your goal should be to push your pages up the SERPs as far as possible before acquiring links. The Authority Transfer Technique is one of the best ways to accomplish that goal (fast). 2. LIS Technique What qualities make people want to link to your website? There are many qualities, but there’s one that helps enormously and is called “Length Implies Strength” or LIS. Have you ever seen one of those super-long sales letters that seem to scroll for decades? Well, that’s not an accident. Long sales letters leverage “Heuristics.” In short, we (humans) are lazy and hate thinking. So, we use mental shortcuts to make decisions, solve problems, pass judgments, etc. So, what does this have to do with link building? According to Backlinko’s study: “Long-form content gets an average of 77.2% more links than short articles.” That means if you want more backlinks, then create long-form content. For example, if you examine what pages have attracted the most backlinks on GotchSEO.com, you will see that they are all my longest pieces of content: The average word count for my top 4 most linked-to content assets is 7,223 words. Pretty insane, right? Here’s the main takeaway: If you want more links, write longer, in-depth content. Don’t take this out of context, though! It needs to be well-thought-out and add massive amounts of UNIQUE value. 3. Predictive Links Technique What if you could create pages on your site that attracted backlinks like clockwork? That’s possible when you use the Predictive Links Technique. The best part is that it’s super simple. Here’s what you do: Step #1 – Examine your competitor’s most linked-to pages Just open up Ahrefs → Enter a competitor’s domain → Click on “Best by Links.” You’ll immediately see what topics have attracted the most backlinks in your niche. You can also use this same technique for creating “predictive” viral content on social media. Just go to Buzzsumo → Enter a topic: Then, you’ll have access to proven ideas to attract social shares (and links). You can also do the same thing with YouTube. Go to a popular channel in your niche → sort their videos by most popular And BOOM! You see the ideas that the niche is most interested in. Step #2 – Create a page around the same topic, but make it 10x different and better Whether you’re using this method to attract links, get more social traction, or dominate YouTube, the principle is the same. You will create a content asset that’s 10x different and better than your competitors. Step #3 – Reach out to the people that linked to your competitor’s content This is a concept I teach in my advanced SEO training program (check out this Gotch SEO Academy review): I recommend “testing the waters” before pitching your content when you use this strategy. Send a simple outreach email like this: Hey [NAME], My name is [YOUR NAME], and I’m the [YOUR POSITION] at [YOUR COMPANY]. I researched [TOPIC] and saw that you linked to [COMPETITOR’S URL] – that makes sense because it’s awesome. I just published a new guide on [TOPIC] it [VALUE PROPOSITION]. Would you be interested in seeing it (and maybe give some feedback)? Let me know, and I’ll shoot the link over. Thanks again! [NAME] If the prospect complies, then send them this: Hey [NAME], That’s great! Here’s a link: Let me know what you think. Also: If you think it adds value to your readers, would you mind linking to it? I can [INSERT SOME VALUE YOU CAN GIVE THEM]. Thanks again! I recommend testing many different templates for the second email until you hit a sweet spot. Just make sure you’re giving something valuable when asking for a link. 3. Relationship Accelerator Technique The Relationship Accelerator Technique serves a dual purpose: It can help you build relationships with key “linkerati” (people who are capable and willing to link to you). It can help you score links with minimal effort. There are a few different ways to go about this. You can host expert roundups and interviews or ask for expert contributions to your content. For example, I had Miles Beckler on my SEO podcast, and he linked to the page where it was hosted: This technique works because there’s a clear exchange of value. The experts get exposure, and you get to build a non-transactional relationship with them. You’ll be exposed yourself because they likely share or link to the content. 4. Oprah Technique I created a cool name for this technique, but it’s super simple. You’re going to get interviewed and land links. Go to Google → Enter “interview + niche” or “interview with + [YOUR COMPETITOR]” Add all these prospects to your link building database. Then, just reach out and pitch yourself for the interview. Use a simple template like this: Hey [NAME], My name is [YOUR NAME] and I’m the [YOUR POSITION] at [YOUR COMPANY]. First, just wanted to thank you for all the amazing interviews you’ve been doing. I’ve listened to your interview with [INSERT ONE YOU LIKED] multiple times because it’s so incredibly valuable. Quick question: are you accepting new interviewees at this time? If you are, I would love to chat because of I [COOL RESULT]. Let me know. Thanks! 5. Use The Merger Technique The Merger Technique is simple: Find websites with high-quality link profiles, acquire them, and 301 redirect them to your website. For example, Neil Patel acquired UberSuggest and merged it with NeilPatel.com. As a result, he gained an additional 17,500 backlinks from 5,610 referring domains: And Backlinko did the same thing when we acquired PointblankSEO.com. Brian scored 24,500 additional backlinks from 2,000 referring domains: They both acquired active websites or tools, which is the best strategy. You can also use expired domains. I recommend using Spamzilla to find them (watch this free tutorial). 6. Leverage The Phantom Technique You may reach your target backlink volume for a specific page at a certain point. But what should you do if you’re still not ranking where you want to be? That’s when the Phantom Technique enters. Instead of building more backlinks on tier one (links directly hitting your website), you can strengthen your existing backlinks. This process is known as tier two link building. It’s extremely powerful, and your competitors likely won’t know you’re doing it. 7. The Switch-Up Technique The Switch Up Technique is my favorite way to build relationships fast. As you may or may not know, building relationships is critical to getting more backlinks. Most people fail at link outreach because they’re metaphorically trying to hit a home run on the first date. Like in sales, you must take baby steps along the journey. You have to build relationships with the websites (and people who are capable of linking to you) BEFORE you ask for something. There needs to be an exchange of value. “Value” comes in many forms, including money, help, and content. Here’s a perfect example of a student of Gotch SEO Academy (our SEO training program) exchanging value with me (I had no choice but to link to this tool because it solved a REAL problem and added REAL value): Money works well, but you can acquire links without having to pay people. But that will only be possible through building real relationships. The first step to accomplishing that is to use the Switch Up Technique. Here’s how you do it: Go through your blog content and examine all your external links. See if you’re linking out to general websites like Wikipedia, CNN, or any authority website with many authors. Go to Google and look for a replacement from a lower authority blog. Change the link Reach out to the person Use a non-threatening template like this: Hey [NAME], My name is [YOUR NAME] and I’m the [YOUR POSITION] at [YOUR COMPANY]. I was doing some research on [TOPIC] and discovered your guide about [TOPIC]. I really enjoyed it. I never realized that [SOMETHING YOU LEARNED FROM THEIR CONTENT]. Super cool. Anyway, I won’t take up any more of your time. Just wanted to thank you for putting the article together and wanted to let you know that I linked to it from my article: [INSERT NAKED URL] – it’s about [TOPIC]. Thanks again! [NAME] 8. Leverage Existing Relationships Think about your family, friends, clients, and industry colleagues. Make a list of everyone with a website relevant to your vertical. Then, see if they’d be willing to place a link on a relevant page. 9. Go Back to School Leverage the fact that you’re an alumnus of your high school or college. Schools are always looking to promote successful alumni. You can also reach out to colleges and universities in your local area and volunteer to help the students. Some options are guest speaking, guest posts, etc. Leverage your expertise and add value to get links. 10. Offer Internships Need help running your company? Create an internship program. Then, create a dedicated page for it and look for link opportunities. If it’s a local internship, you can target local opportunities by searching “CITY + internships.” You can get listed on the internship directory websites if it’s national. 11. Write Content for Other Websites Guest posting is a tried and true method for getting free backlinks. There is a clear exchange of value. You write great content for their website, so they don’t have to. Then, you get a backlink for your efforts. There are unlimited opportunities for guest posting in every vertical. Go to Google and enter search queries like: “write for us + ” (example: “write for us + fitness”). Then, use the Data Miner plugin to export the results and add them to your link prospecting database. Repeat this process a few times until you have a large database. Then, copy 200 of the prospects and open up SEMRush. Go to “Gap Analysis” and then “Bulk Analysis.” Paste the prospects and run the analysis. Now you’ll know the total organic search traffic for each website. Prioritize opportunities that have traffic because these are likely the highest quality opportunities. Now you just need to have contact information. I use Hunter.io. Once you’ve found the correct contact information, send a simple outreach email like this: Hey [NAME], My name is [YOUR NAME], and I write over at [YOUR BLOG]. I was wondering if you guys are accepting guest contributors right now? I have a few ideas for your blog that I think you’ll like. Let me know, and I’ll send them over. Thanks! I always like sending an initial email to warm the prospect up. Notice how I didn’t hit the prospect with a pitch right away. My only goal in the first email is to get the prospect to respond. Once the prospect responds, I send a second email with three ideas: That’s great to hear! Here are three ideas: Let me know which one you like, and we’ll jump on creating the first draft. Thank you 12. Reverse Guest Posting Reverse guest posting is the process of getting other experts to write for your website. The key is to make sure they have an audience and website themselves. There’s no guarantee that they’ll link back to your site. However, it’s likely because it acts as a form of ego bait. Example from my about page. In other words, people like to promote themselves, especially in the business world. Now, there is one caveat with this method. Your website needs a solid base of traffic and a decent audience. No one is going to write content for your website if they aren’t benefiting from it. Remember the exchange of value. 13. Interview Experts Interviewing experts (with audiences) is the oldest trick in the book, but it will continue to work. That’s because interviews are the ultimate ego bait. Plus, the interviewee benefits from promoting the interview (on your website). Take a look at Smart Passive Income’s link profile on Ahrefs. You’ll notice that interviewees have linked to the page hosting their interviews. But that’s not all. Since many interviewees are well-known, their interviews generally attract links. For example, Entrepreneur.com linked to an interview featuring Ramit Sethi. That alone shows you the power of interviews. 14. Recreate Dead Content I call this the White Hat Alternative to PBNs. It’s simple. Use a tool like SpamZilla to find qualified expired domains. Go here to start your free trial of SpamZilla. Then open up Ahrefs and go to the Site Explorer. Paste the prospective expired domain and export all of its Followed links. Now, examine what pages have backlinks. Copy a URL and paste it into the Way Back Machine. The first question is whether or not the content is relevant to your website. If it isn’t, keep searching. If it is, the next question is, can you create something better? If so, create the asset. Then, reach out to all of the websites linking to the dead page. Here’s a simple outreach email to test: Hey [NAME], My name is [YOUR NAME] and I’m [YOUR POSITION] at [YOUR COMPANY]. I was doing some research and found your awesome guide about [TOPIC]. I noticed you are linking to a dead website in the section about [TOPIC]. I actually just created an article about the [TOPIC] which might be a good replacement. Let me know, thanks! 15. Fix SSL Certificates One of the most significant points of leverage is helping websites that don’t have SSL certificates installed. This method is effective if you’re also trying to land new SEO clients. Fixing the SSL certificate can act as a front-end offer. Then, you can pitch them on SEO services. 16. Create Data-Driven Link Bait People love linking to data. The cool part is that you don’t need to create the data from scratch. You can leverage existing data and create a curated resource. Now, it is even better if you can create original data. Compiling original data is more complicated, but it does pay off. For example, I have a few data-driven posts on Gotch SEO like: Top 3 Best Link Building Services (We Spent $140,424 to Find Out) Is Google Biased? We Analyzed 50 Key Politically-Driven Topics to Find Out We Analyzed 438 SEO Companies (Here’s the Top 10) What’s the Best CMS for SEO? (10,000 Keywords Analyzed) 17. Host an Expert Roundup Most expert roundups are pretty bad. But if you dedicate yourself to creating one that adds value and invites real experts, then it can succeed. It falls under the ego bait category. In short, there’s a possibility that the experts will link back to the roundup in which they participated. 18. Reverse Expert Roundups You can also find existing expert roundups and pitch your contribution. Go to Google and enter search queries like “YOUR NICHE + expert roundup.” Then just send a simple outreach email like so: Hey [NAME], My name is [YOUR NAME], and I’m the founder of [YOUR COMPANY OR BLOG]. I saw that you put together an awesome expert roundup and wondered if I could contribute to it? I have some unique insights to share about [THE TOPIC OF THE ROUNDUP] because of my experience working [in|with] [ENTER SOCIAL PROOF/QUALIFICATIONS]. Please let me know if there’s any way to make this happen. Thanks for your time. 19. Use HARO Using HARO for link building isn’t new, but it is still super effective. The key is to understand that most of your submissions will get ghosted. That’s why you need to go into it with the mindset that your submission may not get approved. It’s an odd experience overall. However, you can score some awesome links IF your contribution does get approved. 20. Volunteer in Your Local Market There are so many untapped link opportunities on the local level—one of the simplest ways to score links to volunteer in your local area. Go to Google and search “YOUR CITY + our sponsors” or “YOUR CITY + our volunteers.” Then, look for pages that link out to sponsors or volunteers. These should be your targets. Now, think of a way that you can add value to the charity. Sometimes, that’s in the form of physical labor or in-person participation. But other times, you can offer technical support online as well. 21. Create Profiles in Your Vertical Notice how I said in “your” vertical? Don’t create a bunch of random profiles just because you can. There is no point. Only create profiles on websites that are relevant in your industry. For example, it makes sense for me to have a profile on Moz or a profile on an SEO forum. Most of these websites will give you a link back to your website in the profile section. Some are followed, while others are nofollow. It doesn’t matter because they’re still relevant. 22. Create Business Listings If you have a local business, creating business listings is the easiest way to score free backlinks. These listings can help you local pack performance in Google. As long as you keep your Name, Address, Phone, and Website (NAP-W) information consistent. You can use Fat Joe’s citation building service to save time. FAQs About Backlinks My backlinks are decreasing. What now? It’s natural and normal to lose some links over time. That’s why it’s critical to remember that link acquisition isn’t a one-time event. It needs to be an ongoing activity. You should always be taking action to acquire new backlinks to compensate for those you lose. My backlinks are not showing in Google Search Console, Ahrefs, etc. Why? Google Search Console only shows a sample of your total link profile. While third-party tools like Ahrefs are amazing at finding backlinks, they aren’t perfect or comprehensive. Assume that these tools only show a percentage of your entire link profile. Are Fiverr backlinks good? In my experience, 99% of link opportunities on Fiverr are bad. In general, I would avoid buying backlinks from Fiverr. Remember… you usually get what you pay for. Are NoFollow backlinks good? NoFollow backlinks are not good or effective because they don’t pass PageRank. They’re only useful if you’re getting referral traffic or sales. But from an SEO perspective, they have no value. How many backlinks per day are safe? You only need to worry about link velocity when you’re building artificial backlinks. If you’re acquiring backlinks through outreach and content promotion, then you don’t need to worry about this. That’s a Wrap!

Nov 27,2024 SEO Daniel Hamilton If you’re in the SEO game, you’ve probably heard it before: “backlinks are everything.” For years, they’ve been the secret sauce behind successful search rankings, helping websites build credibility and authority. But as Google keeps changing its algorithms, some folks are starting to wonder — are backlinks still worth the effort? Or have they become just another outdated SEO tactic? Let’s dig into what backlinks really bring to the table, how they affect your rankings, and why (spoiler alert) they’re still a crucial part of any SEO strategy. Plus, we’ll share tips on building a backlink profile that actually helps you stand out in search results. What Are Backlinks and Why Are They Important? Think of backlinks as endorsements from other websites. In SEO, they’re like “votes of confidence” that signal to search engines, “Hey, this site is legit.” When a high-quality, reputable site links to your page, it tells Google that your content is trustworthy and relevant, which can boost your rankings. Backlinks have been one of the top off-page SEO factors that determine where a website lands in search results. But here’s the key: it’s not about racking up hundreds of random links. Today, search engines care more about quality over quantity — meaning a handful of high-quality backlinks from credible sources can be far more valuable than a long list of low-quality links. A smart backlink strategy focuses on getting those high-value links that truly move the needle for your site’s authority and visibility. The Role of Backlinks in Search Engine Rankings Search engines use backlinks to measure a website’s credibility and relevance within its niche. When reputable sites link to your content, it signals to Google that your content is useful, trustworthy, and worth ranking. However, not all backlinks are created equal. A single link from a well-regarded site in your industry can carry far more weight than dozens of links from low-quality or unrelated sites. High-quality backlinks can boost your organic rankings, drive more traffic, and improve your domain authority. But acquiring these links requires more than just link-building tactics — it requires creating valuable content that other sites genuinely want to reference. Types of Backlinks To build a solid backlink profile, it’s essential to understand the different types of backlinks and how each contributes to your SEO goals. Natural Backlinks: These are links you earn without directly asking for them, typically because your content is so valuable or informative that other sites choose to link to it on their own. This is the gold standard in backlinks, as they’re often the most trusted by search engines. Want more natural backlinks? Focus on creating high-quality, shareable content that resonates with your audience. Guest Blogging and Link-Building Strategies: Guest blogging remains a viable strategy for earning backlinks when done correctly. By contributing valuable content to reputable sites in your niche, you can secure relevant backlinks while building relationships in your industry. Diverse Backlink Profiles: A healthy backlink profile includes a range of link types — from blog mentions to local citations to industry directories. Building diversity in your backlinks makes your profile look more natural to search engines and reduces the risk of penalties for over-optimization. Quality vs. Quantity: Why It Matters Gone are the days when sheer numbers could boost your SEO. Today, search engines prioritize quality backlinks over a large number of low-quality ones. But what does a high-quality backlink look like? Relevance: Links from sites related to your industry carry more weight. Authority: Links from reputable, high-authority sites (think major news sites, educational institutions, or well-regarded blogs) are more valuable than those from unknown or low-quality sources. Natural Placement: Search engines can tell if a link is placed in an organic, meaningful context. Random links or links stuffed with irrelevant content may be disregarded or even harm your rankings. Assessing the quality of backlinks requires a strategic marketing approach, and ZGM can help you evaluate your current profile to ensure it’s driving results. We focus on earning links that not only boost your rankings but also add value to your audience. The Future of Backlinks in SEO So, with the rise of other ranking factors, such as user experience metrics, content quality, and page speed, are backlinks still as important as they used to be? The short answer is yes, but their role is evolving. Backlinks are no longer the sole determining factor in rankings, but they’re still one of the most powerful factors for off-site SEO. Google and other search engines still view them as essential markers of a site’s authority. However, today’s algorithms are getting better at evaluating the quality and context of backlinks, not just the quantity. To future-proof your SEO strategy, it’s important to take a balanced approach: Focus on high-quality, relevant backlinks Maintain a diverse backlink profile Prioritize natural link acquisition over artificial link-building tactics This way, as search engines refine their algorithms, your backlink strategy will remain effective and compliant with best practices. Backlink Best Practices Building a strong backlink profile is more than just collecting links — it’s about creating genuine connections and valuable content that others want to share. High-quality SEO backlinks signal to search engines that your site is trustworthy, making them one of the most important off-site SEO factors. Here are some tried-and-true tips for making your backlink strategy work harder for you: Create Content People Want to Link To: High-quality, unique, and relevant content is the foundation of any good backlink profile. When you produce valuable resources — think in-depth guides, industry insights, or original research — other sites will want to reference and link to them. This is a natural way to earn backlinks for SEO and answer the question, \"what are backlinks in SEO?\" by building authority through content. Connect with Reputable Sites: Relationships matter. Reach out to trusted sites in your industry and explore opportunities for guest posting or content collaborations. The benefits of guest posting include gaining relevant backlinks from credible sources, which boosts your domain authority and helps you stand out among other off page ranking factors. Mix Up Your Link Sources: A diverse link profile looks natural to search engines and shows the importance of backlinks across different platforms. Aim to earn links from various sources, like industry blogs, business directories, reputable forums, and even social media. This variety signals to search engines that your site is well-regarded across multiple channels, helping you boost domain authority. Keep an Eye on Your Links: Regularly check your backlink profile using tools like Ahrefs or Moz. Monitoring lets you spot low-quality links that could harm your SEO and ensure you’re maintaining a strong, healthy profile. Regularly evaluating your backlinks can also help you decide if link building is still relevant to SEO for your specific strategy.

Introduction: Link Building Strategies in 2025 have changed significantly from the previous years. With so many Google updates and Google getting more and more focused on link spam policies, the future of link building in SEO has become more dynamic than ever! Although every now and then we do observe how black-hat link building techniques outdated ages ago lead to worse and worse outcomes, the question of how to build high-quality backlinks in 2025 is one only answered by SEOs with white hats. So, in this article, we’ll discuss the worst and best practices for link building in 2025. However, before we get down to discussing the Do’s for Link building in 2025, let’s start with the link building practices to avoid this year. What’s out for Link Building Strategies in 2025? Private Blog Networks (PBNs) Once upon a time, PBNs were all the rage and a reliable method for websites to get backlinks without fear of repercussions. However, that time has long gone. Today, PBNs are a strict no, especially since Google is getting better and better at identifying PBNs. In fact, until 2017, PBNs were often a part of a link builder’s strategy as it allowed them to procure links much faster than manually outreaching several websites. That is, when Google started targeting PBNs. However, link building for niche websites in 2025 is much more evolved, to the point that not only does Google ignore most of the backlinks coming from PBNs, but also manually deindexes sites on a private blog network. “Click-To-Get” Backlinks Whenever you see the option to place a link manually on another website without effort, remind yourself that it just might not even be worth it. An example of these types of links is the one you can place in the comment of a blog. Now, these backlinks will not only be no-follow but might be ignored by Google altogether. To get a better idea of what kind of “Click-to-get” backlinks we’re talking about, here is a list of them: Blog Comments. Web 2.0 Site Backlinks. Getting listed in Directories. Getting links placed in Article Directories. Another thing to avoid that often comes under these types of links is that of link building packages. These packages appear shady by design, with claims like “50+ Backlinks” or “100+ Backlinks”. Verifying the agency offering such packages is advised before you order them. Paid Guest Posting Google has always been adamant about purchasing backlinks. The case remains the same even if you’re paying and providing content to get a post published with your backlink embedded. But other than Google literally stating that it’s wrong to pay for backlinks, there is another major reason why you might consider avoiding Paid Guest Posting. The reason is simple, any webmaster asking you for money to put content on their website is likely a shady deal. Think of it like this, why would someone charge to get free content? Would the largest publishers do it? In fact, if it is good content you’re offering, then you should be the one getting paid. Online Gigs/ Strange Link Builders As a white-label link building agency, we often get contacted by random strangers on our socials asking us if we’re interested in getting links for a cheaper or the lowest price. These strangers contacting on socials or even having gigs on platforms like Fiverr are some of the most shady SEOs you’ll find. It is either their own website (PBN) or the links they bring don’t provide a good ROI. Link building, as any other professional will tell you, is one of the most difficult aspects of SEO. And if someone is promising you them in droves for mere cents or a few bucks, then it either won’t be a very good job or could be a scam. Now that you have an apt idea of what’s out of link building strategies for 2025, we can start checking out the best of what’s in this year! What’s in for Link Building in 2025? Press Links One of the best links you can score during 2025 is ones from PR that carry the precious do-follow tag. Although procuring these links can be extremely difficult especially if you’re going for websites with a high domain authority, the results are almost always worth the hassle. This is because press links not only bring more authority to your website but often directly bring traffic from your target audience. In other words, you get the most out of a backlink that’s possible. In fact, Digital PR links are a recent addition to our list of services. Multimedia Link Building Gone are the days when link building was just about link placement in written content. Multimedia link building has garnered a lot of attention in recent years, and they are being actively sought after this year. These backlinks often bring more traffic and authority because multimedia content already has a better reach and a higher consumption among users. However, keep in mind that relevance still reigns supreme, which brings us to our next point. Relevant Linking We believe this point is as evergreen as our blog on creating evergreen content. Google has always stressed the importance of using links to enhance context rather than simply placing links for its own sake. Relevant linking means adding backlinks in such a way that users are able to enhance their knowledge on a subject when they click on them. This not only leads to more traffic and higher authority but also minimizes the bounce rate for people coming to your website via backlinks. Getting Listed in Popular Directories Another strategy that will help build high-quality backlinks in 2025 is getting listed on popular and relevant directories. Getting your company profile set on comparison review sites, and garnering loads of reviews from customers on these platforms. The more and more positive reviews your website is able to gather, the more trust you gain with potential customers. Moreover, each review is an opportunity for a backlink, and even though these may be no–follow in more cases, you will be able to acquire more trust from relevant audiences. Bonus Tip: HARO is Out! HARO (Help a Reporter Out) earlier turned into Connectively. However, since then, the platform has pivoted again to CisionOne. Now there are multiple services that have sprung up to fill the vacuum.

With so many Google updates and Google getting more and more focused on link spam policies, the future of link building in SEO has become more dynamic than ever! Although every now and then we do observe how black-hat link building techniques outdated ages ago lead to worse and worse outcomes, the question of how to build high-quality backlinks in 2025 is one only answered by SEOs with white hats. So, in this article, we’ll discuss the worst and best practices for link building in 2025. However, before we get down to discussing the Do’s for Link building in 2025, let’s start with the link building practices to avoid this year. What’s out for Link Building Strategies in 2025? Private Blog Networks (PBNs) Once upon a time, PBNs were all the rage and a reliable method for websites to get backlinks without fear of repercussions. However, that time has long gone. Today, PBNs are a strict no, especially since Google is getting better and better at identifying PBNs. In fact, until 2017, PBNs were often a part of a link builder’s strategy as it allowed them to procure links much faster than manually outreaching several websites. That is, when Google started targeting PBNs. However, link building for niche websites in 2025 is much more evolved, to the point that not only does Google ignore most of the backlinks coming from PBNs, but also manually deindexes sites on a private blog network. “Click-To-Get” Backlinks Whenever you see the option to place a link manually on another website without effort, remind yourself that it just might not even be worth it. An example of these types of links is the one you can place in the comment of a blog. Now, these backlinks will not only be no-follow but might be ignored by Google altogether. To get a better idea of what kind of “Click-to-get” backlinks we’re talking about, here is a list of them: Blog Comments. Web 2.0 Site Backlinks. Getting listed in Directories. Getting links placed in Article Directories. Another thing to avoid that often comes under these types of links is that of link building packages. These packages appear shady by design, with claims like “50+ Backlinks” or “100+ Backlinks”. Verifying the agency offering such packages is advised before you order them. Paid Guest Posting Google has always been adamant about purchasing backlinks. The case remains the same even if you’re paying and providing content to get a post published with your backlink embedded. But other than Google literally stating that it’s wrong to pay for backlinks, there is another major reason why you might consider avoiding Paid Guest Posting. The reason is simple, any webmaster asking you for money to put content on their website is likely a shady deal. Think of it like this, why would someone charge to get free content? Would the largest publishers do it? In fact, if it is good content you’re offering, then you should be the one getting paid. Online Gigs/ Strange Link Builders As a white-label link building agency, we often get contacted by random strangers on our socials asking us if we’re interested in getting links for a cheaper or the lowest price. These strangers contacting on socials or even having gigs on platforms like Fiverr are some of the most shady SEOs you’ll find. It is either their own website (PBN) or the links they bring don’t provide a good ROI. Link building, as any other professional will tell you, is one of the most difficult aspects of SEO. And if someone is promising you them in droves for mere cents or a few bucks, then it either won’t be a very good job or could be a scam. Now that you have an apt idea of what’s out of link building strategies for 2025, we can start checking out the best of what’s in this year! What’s in for Link Building in 2025? Press Links One of the best links you can score during 2025 is ones from PR that carry the precious do-follow tag. Although procuring these links can be extremely difficult especially if you’re going for websites with a high domain authority, the results are almost always worth the hassle. This is because press links not only bring more authority to your website but often directly bring traffic from your target audience. In other words, you get the most out of a backlink that’s possible. In fact, Digital PR links are a recent addition to our list of services. Multimedia Link Building Gone are the days when link building was just about link placement in written content. Multimedia link building has garnered a lot of attention in recent years, and they are being actively sought after this year. These backlinks often bring more traffic and authority because multimedia content already has a better reach and a higher consumption among users. However, keep in mind that relevance still reigns supreme, which brings us to our next point. Relevant Linking We believe this point is as evergreen as our blog on creating evergreen content. Google has always stressed the importance of using links to enhance context rather than simply placing links for its own sake. Relevant linking means adding backlinks in such a way that users are able to enhance their knowledge on a subject when they click on them. This not only leads to more traffic and higher authority but also minimizes the bounce rate for people coming to your website via backlinks. Getting Listed in Popular Directories Another strategy that will help build high-quality backlinks in 2025 is getting listed on popular and relevant directories. Getting your company profile set on comparison review sites, and garnering loads of reviews from customers on these platforms. The more and more positive reviews your website is able to gather, the more trust you gain with potential customers. Moreover, each review is an opportunity for a backlink, and even though these may be no–follow in more cases, you will be able to acquire more trust from relevant audiences. Bonus Tip: HARO is Out! HARO (Help a Reporter Out) earlier turned into Connectively. However, since then, the platform has pivoted again to CisionOne. Now there are multiple services that have sprung up to fill the vacuum.

Using any experimental SEO comes with its own set of risks. 3 comments backlinks wonderful backlinks they're one of the main things that make the seo world go round but here's a little surprise for you did you know that loads of people fail with seo even when they build lots of backlinks you want to know why it's because they don't build high quality links you can build a bunch of links but if they aren't high quality you probably aren't going to see much in the way of results heck you might even harm your rankings look there's no getting around it high quality backlinks are important but how do you know if your backgrounds are high quality i mean you build a link and then what do you receive a letter in the post telling you you've built an amazing link sadly no such letter exists which is a shame because that would be nice however there are certain tools and tactics you can use to verify the quality of a link in this video we're going to cover these strategies and how this all works all of these strategies are important but not everyone uses every strategy we're going to cover here in fact the strategy we cover in section number three is actually something a lot of people forget about which is a shame because this is actually a very important way to verify the quality of a link anyway stick around make sure you watch this entire video once you've made it to the end you'll know how to judge the quality of each and every link that is associated with your site let's get started so tip number one is that the main rating tells you a lot okay dr stands for domain rating and it's one of the main metrics people like to use when judging the quality of a backlink basically if a link comes from a high dr site technically it's a high quality link now this metric basically comes from the seo tool ahrs whenever you plug a site into ahrefs you can get its dr now you can actually do this for free and you don't need to be a paid address user to get this data that's because if you just google something like ahrefs free website authority checker you can access a free tool that will tell you the dr of pretty much any site so for example this is what happens if i just pop my site into this tool 47 that's not too bad of a score i think even if i do say so myself anyway what's important to remember here is that lots of seo tools have a metric like this but they might just call it something else so like semrush another popular seo tool has something called domain authority all these top seo suites might have another name for this score and there are slight differences here and there when it comes to how this score is calculated for example we use ahrefs at our link building agency simply because it tends to have the most amount of data possible and they spend about a million dollars a month trying to keep their algorithm as up-to-date and as comprehensive as possible anyway if a website has a high score there's a good chance that it will provide you with a high quality link what's interesting here is that if you build lots of idr links to your site you can actually improve your own dr for example we built some high dr backlinks to this site and they went from just 3 to 19 in only four months the dr increases mean that google now thinks this website is more trustworthy this then means they get better rankings and as you can see the site doubled their traffic by the way if you'd like us to help you achieve similar results you can book a free consultation call with us at juliangoldi.com anyhow moving on dr and its impact on link quality is really just a small part of the story here that's because there are a few other things such as anchor text that you also need to look at when judging the quality of a link luckily for you we're going to cover the topic of anchor text as well as a bunch of other important factors in the rest of this video so make sure you watch to the end by the way if you're enjoying this video please take a moment to like and subscribe tip number two is to check for relevance relevance is also important when judging the quality of the link so all things being equal a link from a relevant site contextually or in your niche is going to be more high quality then versus a link that literally has nothing to do with your site okay but why are relevant links better than non-relevant ones well this can be a little bit tricky to explain and to really understand this you've got to look at things from google's point of view so imagine there is a website in the boating niche suppose this site has a lot of links from other websites in the voting niche if you were google you'd look at a site like this and then come to the conclusion that it's an authority in its industry because of this you'd be quite comfortable with ranking this website for keywords related to boating on the other hand if you have a website in the boating niche there's loads of links from websites in the dentistry industry well that looks a little bit odd i mean can google really trust a website like this after all how can they say that this website is an authority when nobody is linking to them from relevant articles like how would you feel about this site if you were google and you had to rank it would you say that everything checks out would you be able to be comfortable with ranking this website highly for terms that are associated with the boating niche no right i mean you'd probably be a little bit suspicious no at this point you'd probably recognize these high authority links from random other industries and you might give them a bit of weight but you wouldn't really let them have that much impact on your rankings all because the links are just not that relevant it's because of this that relevance can sometimes beat domain rating when it comes to the quality of a backlink after all a highly relevant dr-50 backlink can often be a dr-60 link that is totally irrelevant so relevance is important but how do you check the relevance of a link well there isn't really a tool that helps you do this with a ton of accuracy and in most cases it's really just something you have to judge for yourself but it is easy to judge as you can often just tell for link is from a relevant article if it's contextually relevant if it's related to what your site's about so who said that seo is hard right so tip number three is to check the link placement the placement of a link can also impact the quality of the link now i know this sounds a little bit of a pointless detail but it's actually very significant in most cases the highest quality backlinks are ones that fit naturally within the content on a page so if there's a paragraph and the link is a natural part of the text in the paragraph that's a high quality link if you're wondering these links are sometimes known as niche edits here's an example now the alternative here is a link that's just maybe in the footer or part of the office bio these alternative links aren't completely worthless actually they're still quite good especially if the website with the link has a high dr and is relevant to yours but if you're just looking for the best type of link aka the most high quality one natural editorially placed links are the ones you should aim for tip number four is to check out the anchor text the anchor text of a link can also have a massive impact on the quality of it too anchor text and its impact on seo is a really big topic and to be honest it's something that actually deserves its own video now fortunately for you i actually have a video on this topic and you can check it out here but anyhow let's just cover some of the brief things you need to keep in mind here right so if you didn't know anchor text is just a text people see when they're looking at a link here's a graphic that breaks the whole concept down so as you can see the bit on the left is the actual url and the anchor text is a bit on the right the anchor text can be pretty much anything and the only thing that remains the same is the actual url of the page this background profile report from interest highlights some common anchor text variations ideally you want the anchor text to be relevant to your niche or at least related to a keyword you're trying to rank for this goes back to the relevance thing we touched upon earlier so remember google is always trying to figure out how relevant a site is in relation to a certain search term or phrase now one way they do this is by looking at the backlinks of a website and going over the anchor text use of these links if the backlinks have anchor text that relates to a certain initial keyword google can figure out what a site is about and then this helps them rank the site properly so with that in mind a high quality link would essentially be a link that has anchor text that is relevant to your niche slash keyword that you want to rank for but you need to be careful here and you can't just take this idea and run with it that's because google cracks down on websites that abuse this anchor text system for example there's a certain kind of anchor text known as exact match anchor text this is basically a link with anchor text that matches an exact keyword you're trying to rank for so imagine you sell boats and you want to rank for the term by boats in this case an exact match anchor text here would be by boats now this form of anchor text can be very powerful but having links like this can be very dangerous too why because google started to crack down on sites that had lots of exact match anchor text when they released something called the penguin update when this update came out high traffic sites that lots of exact match anchor text basically lost rankings pretty much in an instant so because google doesn't like websites that have lots of exact match anchor text you should mix things up with it of course you might now think that you have to lower the quality of your links by using worse anchor text and you might not be happy about this this is fair and you might have a point here but look at the end of the day it's better to dampen the power of your links a little bit if it protects you from a penalty if you abuse the way anchor text works you might have nice results for a couple of months but then bam you're gonna be hit with a penalty and you'll be about to square one by the way if you have any questions about anchor text please drop a comment relating to your question and i'll try to answer it as soon as possible right so that's the end of this video you should now hopefully have a decent understanding of how you can judge the quality of a link there's a lot of information stake in here but once you get your head around everything this will all become second nature to you meaning you'll just be able to look at a backlink and judge its quality in a matter of seconds anyhow thanks for watching this video

need to be careful here and you can't just take this idea and run with it that's because google cracks down on websites that abuse this anchor text system for example there's a certain kind of anchor text known as exact match anchor text this is basically a link with anchor text that matches an exact keyword you're trying to rank for so imagine you sell boats and you want to rank for the term by boats in this case an exact match anchor text here would be by boats now this form of anchor text can be very powerful but having links like this can be very dangerous too why because google started to crack down on sites that had lots of exact match anchor text when they released something called the penguin update when this update came out high traffic sites that lots of exact match anchor text basically lost rankings pretty much in an instant so because google doesn't like websites that have lots of exact match anchor text you should mix things up with it of course you might now think that you have to lower the quality of your links by using worse anchor text and you might not be happy about this this is fair and you might have a point here but look at the end of the day it's better to dampen the power of your links a little bit if it protects you from a penalty if you abuse the way anchor text works you might have nice results for a couple of months but then bam you're gonna be hit with a penalty and you'll be about to square one by the way if you have any questions about anchor text please drop a comment relating to your question and i'll try to answer it as soon as possible right so that's the end of this video you should now hopefully have a decent understanding of how you can judge the quality of a link there's a lot of information stake in here but once you get your head around everything this will all become second nature to you meaning you'll just be able to look at a backlink and judge its quality in a matter of seconds anyhow thanks for watching this video

great thing"

What makes a high-quality backlink? Find out about the 5 factors that make a high-quality backlink. Written by May Updated over a month ago Table of contents There are some common indicators of a backlink being high quality. Please note that no one can tell you exactly how search engines measure the quality of backlinks. The following information is based on our research and experience. There are five general concepts of evaluating links that the SEO community believes to be true: 1. Authority You can estimate how much of “link juice” that any backlink gives by the authority of a particular page that links to you — its URL Rating (UR). As a general rule, a link from a high authority site will be more powerful than a link from a low authority one. At Ahrefs, we use the Domain Rating (DR) metric to measure an overall website authority. The number of outgoing links a referring page has, matters A backlink from a referring domain that also links to hundreds of other URLs will be sharing less \"link juice\" to your website compared to a website with just a few outgoing links. Do-follow links are preferable If a backlink has a rel=”nofollow” attribute attached to it, it most likely doesn’t cast a “vote” toward a website that it links to. ​ 2. Relevance Links from websites (and pages) on the same topic will have more weight in the eyes of Google than links from completely unrelated websites or pages. But this doesn’t mean that you should avoid getting links from websites that aren’t on exactly the topic as yours. For example, it would be perfectly natural for fitness websites to link to articles about food nutrition, or other self-improvement topics. However, while a link from a mildly relevant page does not hurt, it will not help to build a link from a page that has no reason to mention your page or website. 3. Anchor text In general, the anchor text, as well as the text that surrounds it, should be topic-relevant. Google uses the words in and around the anchor text to better understand what the referenced page is about and what keywords it deserves to rank for. Use all types of anchor text It is not recommended to force all your backlinks to explicitly only contain your brand name, or a specific topic. If you do so, there's a chance that Google will suspect manipulation and penalise you for that. Referring websites will naturally use a combination of anchor text types to backlink to you. You can find our full research about Anchor text here. 4. Placement The most valuable backlinks are those editorially placed somewhere within the content (i.e. not in the footer or sidebar). Basically, if website owners refer to your page in a highly visible position in the page, it signals to Google a more valuable vote of confidence. Plus, it can also improve chances that a visitor to that page sees the link, and clicks on it. 5. Destination When building links to your website, there are three general destinations where you can point them: Your homepage. Your \"linkable assets\". The actual pages that you want to rank well in Google (aka \"Money pages\") Usually, the actual pages you want to rank are not naturally the pages people want to link to. That’s because website owners generally prefer to link to pages that give informational or functional value to their readers, rather than pages that are directly pitching a product to them. So the strategy that experienced SEOs usually suggest is to make linkable assets that attract high quality links, and then have those pages link to the pages you want to rank. This transfers some of that “link authority” to your Money pages. 💡 The above information is an except from our beginner's guide on How to build backlinks.

Many studies have found a correlation between backlinks and organic search engine rankings. Here’s an example of a backlink: Related: Are Backlinks Still Important? What Do Quality Backlinks Look Like? High-quality backlinks have 7 characteristics: relevance, traffic, authority, link profile quality, editorial standards, outbound link quality, and indexation.

In fact, here’s exactly what he said: In short, most of your link building efforts should focus on relevant opportunities. That’s why I created The Relevancy Pyramid. It’s the single best way to prioritize your link opportunities. The model is simple: There are fewer link building opportunities that are 100% relevant to your website.

You ever heard about it? It’s the kind of thing that makes your head spin faster than a bar stool after a couple of drinks. Link building has always been a cornerstone of SEO, but with automation now throwing its hat in the ring, we’re looking at something that could change the game forever—or could it? Now, before we get rolling, let’s clear the air. I’m not saying automated link building is the golden ticket to SEO success.

You gotta know the ins and outs, or you might end up knee-deep in a mess of low-quality links. Ever tried this?

If you're relying solely on automation, you could inadvertently harm your SEO instead of helping it. Think of it like ordering a pizza and getting a salad—you’re not gonna be satisfied. And then there’s the ugly: Ever heard of Google’s algorithms? They’re like that bouncer at the bar who decides who gets in and who gets",
