  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, let’s kick back and take a guess at what Moody Tunes is all about, just from the vibe of that URL. So, moodytunes.io—first off, the name itself has a nice ring to it. \"Moody\" suggests there’s some emotion or vibe tied into the music experience, and \"Tunes\" pretty much lays it out that we’re diving into the world of sound. Now, if I had to venture a guess, I'd say this site is probably a music platform or an app that focuses on creating or curating playlists based on different moods. You know how sometimes you just want to chill out with some mellow beats, or maybe you’re looking for something upbeat to get the party going? Moody Tunes sounds like it’s got your back in finding the right soundtrack for whatever vibe you're in. Imagine rolling onto the site and being greeted with a slick, user-friendly interface where you can explore all kinds of playlists. Maybe there are categories like \"Rainy Day Chill,\" \"Epic Workout Jams,\" or \"Late Night Vibes.\" Like, you could seriously lose a couple of hours just scrolling through different moods and sounds, discovering new artists along the way. It’s also possible they’re tapping into some kind of algorithm or mood detection to suggest tunes. You know, like when you first get to the site and it asks how you’re feeling that day—“Are you happy? Anxious? Melancholic?” Then boom! It dishes out a perfectly curated playlist that matches your mood like your best bud knows what you need to hear. Another thought—maybe they’re hosting some indie artists or emerging talent, giving them a platform to share their sound. There could be features where you can listen to tracks, check out bios, and even support your favorite musicians directly. Plus, I could totally see them incorporating social features where you can share your favorite playlists with friends, or even collaborate on them. Just throw some tracks together that suit a friend's mood or a special occasion. And hey, let’s not forget about community vibes. There might be forums or spaces where music lovers can chat about their top picks, exchange recommendations, or even dive deep into discussions about what makes a track “moody” or how certain songs can pull at the heartstrings. It could be a great way for fans to connect over shared tastes and discover new genres they never knew they’d dig. Visually, I’d expect the site to be pretty immersive, probably with a sleek design that complements the music experience. Think moody lighting in the graphics—lots of gradients, maybe some dark themes mixed with vibrant splashes of color. It feels like a space that invites you to just relax and get lost in the music, right? And hey, knowing the current trends, I wouldn’t be shocked if they threw in some cool content like articles or blog posts about music trends, interviews with artists, or even playlists for different life moments—like road trips, study sessions, or even break-up recovery tunes. It's like they’re building a whole culture around music, not just a listening platform. All in all, I'd say Moody Tunes is probably a go-to hub for anyone looking to vibe out and discover tunes that hit them right in the feels. Whether you're chilling at home, gearing up for a workout, or just looking for something to enhance your day, this site seems like it’s the perfect place to find the soundtrack to your life. Cheers to that!",

Thunder rattles my bedroom window. Grey skies stretch over the houses far into the distance. Every so often God takes a photograph, the flash whites out the sky in a blinding shutterclick. I don’t want to get out of bed, it’s comfortable and cozy. The wife nuzzles my neck and I’m awake but just this side of it. Half in, half out. It’s days like these I open my music app and pull up my rainy day playlist. Music with a hint of light for gloomy days. Smiling. I’ll share a couple songs with you from my playlist. (Follow YouTube link below). I love stripped down music, pretty melodies, and songs that pull on my heart just a little. If you like that kind of music, take a listen. There’ll likely be artists you’ve never heard of, and songs that you’ve heard before but not quite like this. And there’ll be music that you’ve never heard before. But they all create a rainy day mood that makes me just chill (no Netflix required). Smiling. Hope you like them. Mitch. Create an account to read the full story.

Hello – I’m Min from Write of the Middle! Yes you read right! Hey, it’s my party and I can play too if I want to! 😄 I wanted to throw in a simple little ‘Gem of Zen’ that contributes to me feeling a sense of zen, and I’ll post some more down the track as well. This one relates to a rainy day, the Danish word ‘hygge’, a nice hot drink, blankets, a good book or maybe some crochet, and lying about on a cosy lounge or sofa. I hope you enjoy! If you’re joining us for ZTT Link-Up #019 – welcome and I look forward to reading your post! Please be aware that the last ZTT Link-Up will be #020 next week on Tuesday 18 June. It will then cease. More details on why I have decided to cease the link-up can be found in my introduction for ZTT #20 last week. Today I’m flying to Melbourne with my daughter. We’re going to be seeing the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child productions tomorrow which I’ve very much been looking forward to. Anyway, since I’m travelling and away from home, it might be a while before I can respond to comments and read and comment on any posts linked up, but I promise I will get to it as soon as I can! Give yourself permission to just be Sometimes we need to give ourselves permission to just be. Stop the striving. Stop the achieving. Stop the productivity & creativity, turn off the television, switch off from social media, get away from technology, and just be. We can plan activities and put aside time to try and achieve this but sometimes opportunities are presented to us. We need to recognise these opportunities and take advantage of them whenever we can. We deserve it! Rainy days One such opportunity for me, and maybe for you too, is a rainy day. A cold and rainy day is even better and if it happens to fall on a weekend or a day where there are no urgent or necessary plans, bingo! Maybe it’s an evening – perfect! Switch off that TV and read on. For some reason, I find a rainy day or evening much easier than other times to give myself that permission to relax. The sound of rain is relaxing to start with, add in some thunder and cold and the comforting feeling of being inside safe and warm, and there’s my cue to take this opportunity to enjoy and just be. Here’s the sound of rain to help set the scene for this post (note that this video goes for over 10 hrs so on this occasion maybe just listen for the duration of reading this post or until the next video 😂). White noise So we’ve established that the sound of rain is calming, soothing and relaxing. Many guided meditations have the sound of rain as background noise and many people seek the sound of rain in apps to help them fall asleep at night. This is because the sound of rain is a form of ‘white noise’. White noise is well known to help to relax you and also help you to sleep. Cosy and Hygge There’s something so beautifully relaxing, soothing, and calming about feeling safe and warm and cosy inside. The Danish call it ‘Hygge’. Hygge (pronounced Hue-Guh) is a Danish word used to acknowledge a special feeling or moment. It can be alone or with friends, at home or out, ordinary or extraordinary, but always cosy, charming or special. This is the feeling that I get when it’s cold, raining and/or storming outside and I am snug inside curled up with a hot drink, blankets, a good book, or maybe even crocheting. Here’s a quick video (3 mins 45 secs) that explains Hygge a little more. Warning … watching this will RELAX you! So it’s raining and cold outside. We have the beautiful white noise of rain to listen to. We’ve switched off our devices, including the television! We might light some candles and create a soothing and relaxing atmosphere. We have a lovely warm cup of tea or coffee or maybe a hot chocolate. We curl up somewhere comfy with a blanket and then we indulge in some reading or maybe some crocheting or knitting. Whatever you would like to do. Maybe you just lie back and close your eyes! Maybe you’re listening to music. The key is to consciously be kind to yourself, to fill yourself up with the things you love, have a sense of gratitude, and a feeling of safety and cosy relaxation. Hygge Benefits Obviously, by relaxing our mind, body and spirit there are many benefits to our wellbeing. There have been a variety of benefits tied to the practice of Hygge. Happiness researchers continually find Denmark to have some of the happiest people on Earth, which Danes attribute to the practice of Hygge. Feeling increased happiness could certainly be a perk of practicing Hygge, but there may be other emotional, physical and relationship benefits as well. Emotional benefits: Less depression and anxiety Increased feelings of self-worth Increased optimism Lowered stress Greater sense of mindfulness Improved self-compassion Increased practice of gratitude Physical benefits: Improved sleep Weight regulation Fewer cortisol (stress hormone) spikes Improved practice of self-care Reduced need for unhealthy coping behaviors like alcohol or drugs Social benefits: Focus on togetherness Feelings of comfort and safety Increased trust Increased intimacy New social connections Improved existing relationships Less reliance on social media Conclusion So, what better to bring you some zen but to disconnect from technology, enjoy some white noise in the form of rain, combined with some comfort and indulgences in a cosy indoor ‘hygge’ environment? I feel relaxed and more zen-like just by writing and putting together this post. There are other ways I achieve the sense of Hygge too, and I’ll share those over time as well. In the meantime, I hope that you recognise and take advantage of opportunities to just BE, and get yourself some Hygge – all the cool kids are doing it! Do you love a rainy day or evening? Do you take the opportunity to really savour it? What gives you the ‘Hygge’ feeling?

Lee June 11, 2019 at 7:54 amNice post. I tend to get distracted by the laptop – need to work on that. Getting much better with the phone…My youngest in primary school has taken to lighting candles when watching a movie (no idea where this came from) – so she has in built Hygge I suspect. They weren’t even out. She found them in a draw -all coloured tea light holders and a lantern…. Reply Min June 14, 2019 at 8:45 amMy phone is what distracts me far too much. Your daughter is on to a good thing! I adore lit candles – they tend to relax me. I love to lie in a bath (usually with epsom salts/magnesium) and have the bathroom lit only by candles and nice relaxing music. Sooooo good! 🙂 Reply Denyse Whelan June 11, 2019 at 8:39 amHave a wonderful time with your daughter in Melbourne. I am to Sydney to visit Dad and replenish his freezer with meals. I loved your post. Denyse x Reply Min June 14, 2019 at 8:47 amDenyse, it was fabulous! The HP productions were brilliant. Best thing I’ve ever seen! The trip to Melbourne went by far too quickly but it was fantastic. I’m so pleased you enjoyed the post. 🙂 xo Reply Vanessa June 11, 2019 at 9:16 amThere’s something about rain that feels like permission to stop. I was looking over facebook memories as yesterday was my 2 year tonsillectomy anniversary and it was a great time to have a rainy week, it made it easier to stay in bed like I was supposed to! It sounds over simplistic (I think) but getting a couch in my study has given me a hygge environment. It’s a great place to curl up with a book and a blanket. Reply Min June 14, 2019 at 8:50 amYou’re so right Vanessa! There’s something about rainy days that seems to make it easier for us to stop and relax. Perfect that it was rainy weather while you recovered from your surgery! Good for you for creating a hygge environment in your study! I think hygge is a simple thing but oh so good for us! 🙂 Reply Vanessa June 17, 2019 at 10:29 amI know people are always “don’t sweat the small stuff” but the small stuff can make such a difference in a day! If that’s a couch or a smile or whatever. Reply Min June 17, 2019 at 3:31 pmVery true! Reply Chelsey @ The Heartspace Connect June 12, 2019 at 8:29 amLove that cozy hygge feeling! Enjoy your trip to Melbourne together, how special xx Reply Min June 14, 2019 at 8:51 amI do too Chelsey! The trip to Melbourne was fabulous! Loved every moment! 🙂 xo Reply Joanne Tracey June 17, 2019 at 9:18 amI love the whole idea of Hygge – & the Scottish version which I think is called coorie and has me picturing crofts with roaring fires, plaid blankets, & a dram of peaty scotch… Reply Min June 17, 2019 at 3:29 pmOoo I hadn’t heard of the Scottish version ‘coorie’! YES to roaring fires, blankets and a warming drop to drink! Reply Deborah June 17, 2019 at 9:43 amI’m with you on the rainy days – particularly if you can be at home and have time to hibernate or ponder. They’re days I love, particularly in winter. I must think about white noise as an option. I can’t write / read with tv / music or anything but probably like reading in the bath because I have the exhaust fan on. When in bed at night I often have a meditation recording playing in the background. I wonder if white noise might also help when I’m writing or trying to concentrate…. not silence but not something I need to listen to. Reply Min June 17, 2019 at 3:31 pmI love rainy days in winter too Deb – love them! White noise is an interesting topic. I know people who have a particular white noise fan they put on at night that helps them sleep! Reply Leanne | www.crestingthehill.com.au June 17, 2019 at 11:32 amHi Min – I am a big fan of being inside on a cold day in my “comfy” pants with a coffee and a book (and a cat or two). I’m forever grateful for home heating and electric blankets. Lovely post and I’ll be following along to see where you go next if you’re finishing your ZTT series. xx Onward and upward! Reply Min June 17, 2019 at 3:32 pmYes to your cold rainy day description – just insert my ‘Ava’ instead of the cats! lol On another topic – I’m not finishing my ZTT series. I’m only ending the link-up aspect of it. The series will continue … but probably on a more ad hoc basis rather than weekly. xo Reply Debbie Harris June 17, 2019 at 3:40 pmHi Min, as a somewhat ‘regular’ visitor to Denmark and Sweden I love the term hygge and all it entails. Your tips are spot on and I love rainy days too! Great post for this time of year 🙂 #Lifethisweek Reply Min June 18, 2019 at 8:44 amLucky you having been to Denmark and Sweden, Deb! I would love to go to those places. I love the concept of Hygge and seek out any opportunity to benefit from it. Sure is a good time of year for a post like this! LOL xo Reply Denyse Whelan June 19, 2019 at 6:58 pmWhite noise is a great help to many. I haven’t had to use it much anymore but for a while I did. You can get apps with white noise but I know some people who leave a fan on for the ‘noise’ Thank you for linking up for #lifethisweek. Next week we are HALF-way in our #ltw prompts for 2019 and this one is Share Your Snaps. Hope to see you there! Denyse. Reply Min June 20, 2019 at 4:51 pmI know people who use a fan at night as white noise too Denyse. It’s good you don’t need it to sleep anymore!

We have a lovely warm cup of tea or coffee or maybe a hot chocolate. We curl up somewhere comfy with a blanket and then we indulge in some reading or maybe some crocheting or knitting. Whatever you would like to do. Maybe you just lie back and close your eyes! Maybe you’re listening to music. The key is to consciously be kind to yourself, to fill yourself up with the things you love, have a sense of gratitude, and a feeling of safety and cosy relaxation. Hygge Benefits Obviously, by relaxing our mind, body and spirit there are many benefits to our wellbeing. There have been a variety of benefits tied to the practice of Hygge. Happiness researchers continually find Denmark to have some of the happiest people on Earth, which Danes attribute to the practice of Hygge. Feeling increased happiness could certainly be a perk of practicing Hygge, but there may be other emotional, physical and relationship benefits as well. Emotional benefits: Less depression and anxiety Increased feelings of self-worth Increased optimism Lowered stress Greater sense of mindfulness Improved self-compassion Increased practice of gratitude Physical benefits: Improved sleep Weight regulation Fewer cortisol (stress hormone) spikes Improved practice of self-care Reduced need for unhealthy coping behaviors like alcohol or drugs Social benefits: Focus on togetherness Feelings of comfort and safety Increased trust Increased intimacy New social connections Improved existing relationships Less reliance on social media Conclusion So, what better to bring you some zen but to disconnect from technology, enjoy some white noise in the form of rain, combined with some comfort and indulgences in a cosy indoor ‘hygge’ environment? I feel relaxed and more zen-like just by writing and putting together this post. There are other ways I achieve the sense of Hygge too, and I’ll share those over time as well. In the meantime, I hope that you recognise and take advantage of opportunities to just BE, and get yourself some Hygge – all the cool kids are doing it! Do you love a rainy day or evening? Do you take the opportunity to really savour it? What gives you the ‘Hygge’ feeling?

Lee June 11, 2019 at 7:54 amNice post. I tend to get distracted by the laptop – need to work on that. Getting much better with the phone…My youngest in primary school has taken to lighting candles when watching a movie (no idea where this came from) – so she has in built Hygge I suspect. They weren’t even out. She found them in a draw -all coloured tea light holders and a lantern…. Reply Min June 14, 2019 at 8:45 amMy phone is what distracts me far too much. Your daughter is on to a good thing! I adore lit candles – they tend to relax me. I love to lie in a bath (usually with epsom salts/magnesium) and have the bathroom lit only by candles and nice relaxing music. Sooooo good! 🙂 Reply Denyse Whelan June 11, 2019 at 8:39 amHave a wonderful time with your daughter in Melbourne. I am to Sydney to visit Dad and replenish his freezer with meals. I loved your post. Denyse x Reply Min June 14, 2019 at 8:47 amDenyse, it was fabulous! The HP productions were brilliant. Best thing I’ve ever seen! The trip to Melbourne went by far too quickly but it was fantastic. I’m so pleased you enjoyed the post. 🙂 xo Reply Vanessa June 11, 2019 at 9:16 amThere’s something about rain that feels like permission to stop. I was looking over facebook memories as yesterday was my 2 year tonsillectomy anniversary and it was a great time to have a rainy week, it made it easier to stay in bed like I was supposed to! It sounds over simplistic (I think) but getting a couch in my study has given me a hygge environment. It’s a great place to curl up with a book and a blanket. Reply Min June 14, 2019 at 8:50 amYou’re so right Vanessa! There’s something about rainy days that seems to make it easier for us to stop and relax. Perfect that it was rainy weather while you recovered from your surgery! Good for you for creating a hygge environment in your study! I think hygge is a simple thing but oh so good for us! 🙂 Reply Vanessa June 17, 2019 at 10:29 amI know people are always “don’t sweat the small stuff” but the small stuff can make such a difference in a day! If that’s a couch or a smile or whatever. Reply Min June 17, 2019 at 3:31 pmVery true! Reply Chelsey @ The Heartspace Connect June 12, 2019 at 8:29 amLove that cozy hygge feeling! Enjoy your trip to Melbourne together, how special xx Reply Min June 14, 2019 at 8:51 amI do too Chelsey! The trip to Melbourne was fabulous! Loved every moment! 🙂 xo Reply Joanne Tracey June 17, 2019 at 9:18 amI love the whole idea of Hygge – & the Scottish version which I think is called coorie and has me picturing crofts with roaring fires, plaid blankets, & a dram of peaty scotch… Reply Min June 17, 2019 at 3:29 pmOoo I hadn’t heard of the Scottish version ‘coorie’! YES to roaring fires, blankets and a warming drop to drink! Reply Deborah June 17, 2019 at 9:43 amI’m with you on the rainy days – particularly if you can be at home and have time to hibernate or ponder. They’re days I love, particularly in winter. I must think about white noise as an option. I can’t write / read with tv / music or anything but probably like reading in the bath because I have the exhaust fan on. When in bed at night I often have a meditation recording playing in the background. I wonder if white noise might also help when I’m writing or trying to concentrate…. not silence but not something I need to listen to. Reply Min June 17, 2019 at 3:31 pmI love rainy days in winter too Deb – love them! White noise is an interesting topic. I know people who have a particular white noise fan they put on at night that helps them sleep! Reply Leanne | www.crestingthehill.com.au June 17, 2019 at 11:32 amHi Min – I am a big fan of being inside on a cold day in my “comfy” pants with a coffee and a book (and a cat or two). I’m forever grateful for home heating and electric blankets. Lovely post and I’ll be following along to see where you go next if you’re finishing your ZTT series. xx Onward and upward! Reply Min June 17, 2019 at 3:32 pmYes to your cold rainy day description – just insert my ‘Ava’ instead of the cats! lol On another topic – I’m not finishing my ZTT series. I’m only ending the link-up aspect of it. The series will continue … but probably on a more ad hoc basis rather than weekly. xo Reply Debbie Harris June 17, 2019 at 3:40 pmHi Min, as a somewhat ‘regular’ visitor to Denmark and Sweden I love the term hygge and all it entails. Your tips are spot on and I love rainy days too! Great post for this time of year 🙂 #Lifethisweek Reply Min June 18, 2019 at 8:44 amLucky you having been to Denmark and Sweden, Deb! I would love to go to those places. I love the concept of Hygge and seek out any opportunity to benefit from it. Sure is a good time of year for a post like this! LOL xo Reply Denyse Whelan June 19, 2019 at 6:58 pmWhite noise is a great help to many. I haven’t had to use it much anymore but for a while I did. You can get apps with white noise but I know some people who leave a fan on for the ‘noise’ Thank you for linking up for #lifethisweek. Next week we are HALF-way in our #ltw prompts for 2019 and this one is Share Your Snaps. Hope to see you there! Denyse. Reply Min June 20, 2019 at 4:51 pmI know people who use a fan at night as white noise too Denyse. It’s good you don’t need it to sleep anymore!
