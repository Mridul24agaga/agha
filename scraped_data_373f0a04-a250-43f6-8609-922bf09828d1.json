  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, let’s take a chill dive into what MoodyTunes might be all about. Just looking at the name, it gives off some good vibes, right? \"Moody\" suggests there’s a connection to emotions, and \"Tunes\" obviously points to music. So, I’m going to guess this site is likely a treasure trove for music lovers. Picture this: maybe MoodyTunes is one of those spots where you can find tracks that perfectly match whatever mood you’re in. You know, maybe you’re feeling a bit nostalgic, or you’re in the mood to chill out after a long day. The site might curate playlists that cater to those feels—like a musical mood ring that helps you vibe out to the right tunes. They could have something fancy going on with personalization, too. Imagine if you sign up, and it learns your tastes over time, kind of like your buddy who always knows what song to play at a party. And with “mood” being in the title, I wouldn’t be surprised if they had a system where you could select an emotion—happy, sad, energetic, or relaxed—and boom! Instant playlist bliss. Maybe they also feature some cool articles or blog posts about different genres, artists, or even the psychology behind how music affects our emotions. It could be a nice little combo of tunes and stories, giving you something to read while you’re jamming or just chilling. Picture it: you're sipping a drink, and next to your playlist, there’s a piece about how a certain song got made. That’s the kind of content that keeps you coming back, right? Then there’s the community angle. I can totally see MoodyTunes encouraging users to share their own playlists and discoveries. It might be like an underground music club online where people can vibe together over their shared love for tunes. You could have users commenting on each other’s playlists, creating a sense of camaraderie—like swapping mixtapes in the good old days, but way easier. And hey, let’s not forget about the discovery aspect! Maybe they’ve got some indie artists or hidden gems on there that you wouldn’t find on mainstream platforms. If you’re someone who loves to dig deep into the music scene, this site might be a gold mine for new favorites. Imagine stumbling upon a track that just clicks with you, and it’s from some artist who hasn’t hit the big time yet. If they’re really on the ball, they might even have features like song lyrics, concert info, or links to buy merch from your favorite indie bands. And you know how everyone loves a good playlist for different occasions—like road trips, workouts, or cozy nights in. MoodyTunes could be that go-to place where you find the perfect soundtrack for every moment in life. So there you have it: MoodyTunes sounds like a sweet spot for music lovers to explore their emotional relationships with music, discover new artists, and share their vibes with a community of like-minded folks. I mean, who doesn’t want a place that understands their mood and can throw some killer tunes their way? Cheers to that!",

Thumbnails by Infinity on Hannah Intro Song \"Swimming Pools\" by Rob Scallon #SevenOnSunday #MoodMusic #Playlist List of artists featured in today's episode (A-Z order) ALT-J CIGARETTES AFTER SEX JACK’S MANNEQUIN JOHN MAYER KID CUDI TRACY CHAPMAN WOLF ALICE 143 comments [Music] what's up everyone welcome back to AR TV my name is John and it's time for another episode of seven on Sunday and today I'm handing out the playlist because it's summertime at least it is in the United States the northern hemisphere over here I've got a playlist for you for the next time that you get rained out you were supposed to go to the pool you were supposed to go ride bikes with your friends or play for tonight outside or whatever the hell it is kids do these days and then you were forced to go inside and read a book or listen to music like a total loser I don't know why I said loser that actually sounds like a pretty awesome afternoon book music a rainy day that's an ideal afternoon that actually provides an escape so today I'm hoping to pass off seven songs at least in the official playlist that you'll see in the video but also a few more that'll be linked in a Spotify playlist down below my intentions here with this episode of seven on Sunday are not to give you the regurgitated pics that you've seen every publication ever do for the past thirty frickin years we're not talking about dreams by Fleetwood Mac or riders on the storm by the doors I do admit that they fit perfectly with that mood they'll be in the full playlist but today I'm trying to branch out a bit and give you songs that maybe don't necessarily always fit the mold but they think outside of the box for a rainy day this playlist is for anyone looking for something to listen to an a moody rainy atmosphere so take a chance and play it on the next rainy day or maybe on your next drizzled covered drive with your friends through the countryside or play it on the sunniest day possible if you really want to be a badass [Music] Jah the hazy feeling of staring out a rain and fog covered windowpane is brought to life by the ban cigarettes after sex on their song Opera House I think that a lot of their tracks probably could have fit the mood for a rainy day easily but I selected Opera House because I do feel that it goes underrated a lot of people know their tracks like Kate but this one always struck me because of yes it's slow pace this band is known for minimalism kind of like an art pop and indie band but here on Opera House we see someone that is very desperate so for all of you wide-eyed romantics out there whether you're yearning after someone or if you've already found them you can resonate with the line that says oh I was meant to love you that just it stings whether it's something that came after the relationship ended or maybe he's in it now it really doesn't matter let's your mind do the imagination but I guarantee you that this will fit the mood of that weather induced day see I told you that there wasn't just one mood that fits a rainy day we're picking up the tempo a bit with Jack's Mannequin a band that I discovered in my middle school early high school days this song is called the mixtape and I actually got to see this performed live shortly before the band broke up or went on hiatus or whatever the hell happened this is from their most widely recognizable album everything in transit and I selected this one simply because it does kind of have this ominous sensation that creeps up on you maybe it doesn't hit you right away but from the strum of the opening guitar there even the ringing bells on this one a nice little touch that almost makes it feel like a holiday type song except it's not it all I don't know but for me it kind of brings out this feeling and sensation of opening a screen door and walking out to a very cloudy summer sky and then he says so this is morning and it starts at all and it also kind of has a sarcastic edge to it almost a questioning meet sarcasm especially when he sings where are you now and the hook I love the pianos the guitars are definitely tuned to the way that it sounds a little bit more depressing and bleak it's not outright hopeless but still there's something in the mix then makes you question exactly what the song is about human creature thing can you bring do if you close your eyes and absorb those opening notes it stings like the last kiss of a fiery romantic passionate relationship that you're not exactly sure why it ended or maybe why it had to be put on pause I'm not entirely sure why the song gives off that aura but it totally does it's silk by the uk-based rock band wolf Alice you might know this song from appearing in t2 Trainspotting a sequel that came out long after the 80s film I've actually not seen the movie I could probably try to slip in some indie credit points there and say that I did but I'm not swiping that car today I cherished and loved this song long before the Trainspotting trailer it got its use and popularity there but the first time that I played through their album my love is cool my mind was just transported somewhere else silk in particular it was definitely a step away from a lot of what they have been doing on the record but this one it does feel like a thunderstorm as perhaps going on outside you've just walked in you're covered and rain and you see Ellie Roselle here talking about this descriptive very narrative driven song and I think it's almost like poetry that rolls off of her tongue and this Trek even transforms further in its second half because it opens up so bleak so melancholic but then the drums kick in and there's just a really catchy vocal refrain this song is something else I have to say it's next-level stuff and please go check it out if you only hear one song from the playlist this would probably be my top recommendation [Music] well let's hope that the sky doesn't fall but you never know Kid Cudi might have been onto something this kanye west co-produced and co-written track is from Kid Cudi's debut album the man on the moon the end of days most people's minds will go to the pursuit of happiness or maybe day and night if you think of that record but I always felt that this was kind of one of the best songs on there and it does kind of give you that summer thunderstorm type vibe especially with that album artwork I don't know why it just brings out some sort of summery feeling to it I love the kind of synth driven production here the fact that it feels like psychedelic leaning hip hop Cuddy is definitely on a different cloud when it comes to a lot of the stuff that he followed up with in years later that I wasn't as keen on maybe you could even look at this as being like the first kid see ghost track because it was I think officially Kanye and Kid Cudi's first ever collaboration I guess outside of makers say gonna have to dial in the emotions here because normally fast car by Tracy Chapman the singer-songwriter gets me every single time this is one of those songs that talks about freedom and also the lack thereof it's something that always feels like it's trying to elevate themselves and better themselves get to that next level for her and her partner but they're never quite able to get there because it always seems like something in life is getting in their way I threw this in this playlist one because obviously it definitely has some sort of emotional resonance to it that makes it connect especially on a rainy day when the tears are more likely to start pouring down and to because I needed a damn excuse to talk about this classic I've never gone on record for it before I don't know why but here you go she knocks it out of the damn park and slays my emotions in half [Music] twinkling synthesizers and a mention of tetris absolutely count me onboard this is something that I feel that you could like game to or even read a book to on one of these stormy afternoons in the summer the Gospel of John hurt by alt-j from their album this is all yours absolutely kind of really crawl it under my skin back in 2014 and in a very good way it implanted something in me and to this day I think this is my favorite alt-j track for the sheer fact that it combines a lot of kind of weird elements and they stack them on top of each other and you might think that towers gonna come crumbling down but it never does they add layers their different touches the bass the guitar the kind of weird drumming on this track as well everything propels it forward and even when it switches up the beat about halfway or 3/4 of the way through this track always remains impressive and absolutely for your rainy day afternoon this is ideal singing stabbed astray I wanna get [Music] the final song we're talking about today is from the album continuum by singer/songwriter John Mayer it's called stop this train and it's one that is so eloquent the way that it's spoken it's like a conversation in many ways at times it seems like John Mayer is talking directly to his father I love that he brings that to the table he lays it all in front of us and says don't wish for life to stop stop saying oh I'm getting so older maybe I wish that I could be older don't wish for the speed of the train of life to actually alter itself just start living in the moment start being content with what we have here and now he has this talk with his dad and it seems like he sits them down and says look after you've turned 68 you renegotiate don't stop this train John we're never gonna stop it so stop trying to pump the brakes yourself and actually embrace whatever it is going on in your life right now you can't alter the future or the past you can only make yourself or break yourself today so do that and the mood of this the acoustic guitar it's kind of a wreck in and of itself it tears straight through you and it makes you re-evaluate life those deep thinkers are definitely something that crop up in a very good way on a storm induced rainy afternoon so go throw on this playlist see what you think report back to me and let me know in the comment section down below which track do you feel actually fit the mood of a rainy day the best keep in mind that there is a full playlist linked in the description down below my username on Spotify is Compton 182 if you

Thumbnails by Infinity on Hannah Intro Song \"Swimming Pools\" by Rob Scallon #SevenOnSunday #MoodMusic #Playlist List of artists featured in today's episode (A-Z order) ALT-J CIGARETTES AFTER SEX JACK’S MANNEQUIN JOHN MAYER KID CUDI TRACY CHAPMAN WOLF ALICE 143 comments [Music] what's up everyone welcome back to AR TV my name is John and it's time for another episode of seven on Sunday and today I'm handing out the playlist because it's summertime at least it is in the United States the northern hemisphere over here I've got a playlist for you for the next time that you get rained out you were supposed to go to the pool you were supposed to go ride bikes with your friends or play for tonight outside or whatever the hell it is kids do these days and then you were forced to go inside and read a book or listen to music like a total loser I don't know why I said loser that actually sounds like a pretty awesome afternoon book music a rainy day that's an ideal afternoon that actually provides an escape so today I'm hoping to pass off seven songs at least in the official playlist that you'll see in the video but also a few more that'll be linked in a Spotify playlist down below my intentions here with this episode of seven on Sunday are not to give you the regurgitated pics that you've seen every publication ever do for the past thirty frickin years we're not talking about dreams by Fleetwood Mac or riders on the storm by the doors I do admit that they fit perfectly with that mood they'll be in the full playlist but today I'm trying to branch out a bit and give you songs that maybe don't necessarily always fit the mold but they think outside of the box for a rainy day this playlist is for anyone looking for something to listen to an a moody rainy atmosphere so take a chance and play it on the next rainy day or maybe on your next drizzled covered drive with your friends through the countryside or play it on the sunniest day possible if you really want to be a badass [Music] Jah the hazy feeling of staring out a rain and fog covered windowpane is brought to life by the ban cigarettes after sex on their song Opera House I think that a lot of their tracks probably could have fit the mood for a rainy day easily but I selected Opera House because I do feel that it goes underrated a lot of people know their tracks like Kate but this one always struck me because of yes it's slow pace this band is known for minimalism kind of like an art pop and indie band but here on Opera House we see someone that is very desperate so for all of you wide-eyed romantics out there whether you're yearning after someone or if you've already found them you can resonate with the line that says oh I was meant to love you that just it stings whether it's something that came after the relationship ended or maybe he's in it now it really doesn't matter let's your mind do the imagination but I guarantee you that this will fit the mood of that weather induced day see I told you that there wasn't just one mood that fits a rainy day we're picking up the tempo a bit with Jack's Mannequin a band that I discovered in my middle school early high school days this song is called the mixtape and I actually got to see this performed live shortly before the band broke up or went on hiatus or whatever the hell happened this is from their most widely recognizable album everything in transit and I selected this one simply because it does kind of have this ominous sensation that creeps up on you maybe it doesn't hit you right away but from the strum of the opening guitar there even the ringing bells on this one a nice little touch that almost makes it feel like a holiday type song except it's not it all I don't know but for me it kind of brings out this feeling and sensation of opening a screen door and walking out to a very cloudy summer sky and then he says so this is morning and it starts at all and it also kind of has a sarcastic edge to it almost a questioning meet sarcasm especially when he sings where are you now and the hook I love the pianos the guitars are definitely tuned to the way that it sounds a little bit more depressing and bleak it's not outright hopeless but still there's something in the mix then makes you question exactly what the song is about human creature thing can you bring do if you close your eyes and absorb those opening notes it stings like the last kiss of a fiery romantic passionate relationship that you're not exactly sure why it ended or maybe why it had to be put on pause I'm not entirely sure why the song gives off that aura but it totally does it's silk by the uk-based rock band wolf Alice you might know this song from appearing in t2 Trainspotting a sequel that came out long after the 80s film I've actually not seen the movie I could probably try to slip in some indie credit points there and say that I did but I'm not swiping that car today I cherished and loved this song long before the Trainspotting trailer it got its use and popularity there but the first time that I played through their album my love is cool my mind was just transported somewhere else silk in particular it was

When you’re hit with a case of April showers, this is the perfect time to curl up with a warm blanket, your coziest pair of sweatpants, and unwind with a soothing playlist. If you’ve got spring fever, the last thing you want to see are gloomy skies and dark clouds occupying the warm, invigorating rays of the sun. However, while the warm weather is temporarily M.I.A., this allows you to discover some new music while you relax and watch the rainfall. Whether you’re glued to the couch or spending the day in bed, we’ve curated a few playlists from Spotify that are sure to lift your spirit and capture the pure essence of a rainy day. Grab your headphones and get ready to press “play.” 1. Rainy Day Classics If you’re a fan of 60s, 70s, and 80s hits, then you couldn’t ask for a better playlist. With 52 songs in total and over three hours of pure nostalgia, this selection of tunes will help get you through the rainy day and automatically send you back in time. This playlist is not to be confused with “dad rock” (even though your dad probably had most of these songs on cassette). This is a playlist for all ages to enjoy. It’s full of timeless, feel-good music that can help pass the time and revitalize your otherwise lethargic rainy afternoon. Featuring artists such as Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Beatles, Tom Petty, Fleetwood Mac, and more, this rainy day playlist may just turn into your everyday playlist. 2. Rainy Day Kids If you’re stuck indoors during a storm, odds are your kids are stuck at home with you. As much as kids would prefer to be outside playing with their friends, a rainy day creates an opportunity to play some fun and educational songs to keep them energized throughout the day. Songs like “Mr. Sun,” “Rain, Rain Go Away,” and “Singing in the Rain” are some all-time favorites that your kids are sure to recognize and sing along to. And any playlist that features songs by Raffi is a no-brainer if you’re searching for children's music. 3. Songs About Rain Sometimes, the best way to get through a stormy day is to embrace and immerse yourself in the weather. If it’s still pouring and the old man is still snoring, how about dedicating your playlist to songs written about rain? It makes sense to us! Songs like “Make It Rain” by Ed Sheeran, “Set Fire to the Rain” by Adele, “No Rain” by Blind Melon, and “One Rainy Wish” by Jimi Hendrix are just a few of the songs featured as part of this 52-track playlist. Whether or not you’re a fan of rainy weather, music is always the best way to add a little warmth to a chilly day. 4. Rainy Day Jazz There’s just something about a rainy day that makes you feel like sitting at a coffee shop with a latte in hand enjoying some jazz music in the background. Whether you’re a fan of smooth jazz, freeform, or bebop, this rainy day jazz playlist mimics that feeling—all you need is a fresh cup of joe. You can close your eyes and listen to the trumpets, trombones, and saxophones hitting each note with incredible elegance and vigor—envisioning a time where Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, John Coltrane, and Duke Ellington were on top of the charts. Featuring 92 songs and over six hours of music, this playlist is sure to serve as your introductory lesson to one of the earliest and most profound genres of music. 5. Rainy Day Country If you’re not a fan of nursery rhymes, jazz, or rock music, there are plenty of other music genres out there for you to explore. Maybe you prefer country music? Well, in that case, throw on your 10-gallon hat and pair of overalls because we’ve got the ultimate rainy day country playlist, partner. With 463 songs and 24 hours of music, this playlist is long enough to outlast any storm. The artists include Carrie Underwood, Luke Bryan, Blake Shelton, Kacey Musgraves, Sam Hunt, and more. It might be raining, but no one can stop you from throwing your own Stagecoach Festival from home. 6. Rainy Days Music for Mellowing Out One of Spotify’s most listened to playlists on a rainy day, this collection of songs has over 62,000 likes and features 306 songs. It's a 19-hour collection of acoustic, alternative, indie, classic rock, and more. Wherever your musical preference lies, there are plenty of stellar tracks to get you through the wet and dreary day. Stormy weather is all about enjoying good music and warm beverages, so if you need a playlist to help set the vibe, this is the one for you. But beyond that, this is also a great playlist if you’re trying to study, take a nap, read, or enjoy some much-needed rest and relaxation. Turn Up the Volume Don’t let the rain get you down—instead, turn up the volume and explore a new world of musical enlightenment. And remember, you’ll need to download the Spotify app or use the Spotify web player to listen to this collection of playlists. Otherwise, you’ll be stuck looking out the window listening to the rain. And if you want to expand your musical horizons, we have an entire line of audio equipment and accessories to broaden your listening experience.

And any playlist that features songs by Raffi is a no-brainer if you’re searching for children's music. 3. Songs About Rain Sometimes, the best way to get through a stormy day is to embrace and immerse yourself in the weather. If it’s still pouring and the old man is still snoring, how about dedicating your playlist to songs written about rain? It makes sense to us! Songs like “Make It Rain” by Ed Sheeran, “Set Fire to the Rain” by Adele, “No Rain” by Blind Melon, and “One Rainy Wish” by Jimi Hendrix are just a few of the songs featured as part of this 52-track playlist. Whether or not you’re a fan of rainy weather, music is always the best way to add a little warmth to a chilly day. 4. Rainy Day Jazz There’s just something about a rainy day that makes you feel like sitting at a coffee shop with a latte in hand enjoying some jazz music in the background. Whether you’re a fan of smooth jazz, freeform, or bebop, this rainy day jazz playlist mimics that feeling—all you need is a fresh cup of joe. You can close your eyes and listen to the trumpets, trombones, and saxophones hitting each note with incredible elegance and vigor—envisioning a time where Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, John Coltrane, and Duke Ellington were on top of the charts. Featuring 92 songs and over six hours of music, this playlist is sure to serve as your introductory lesson to one of the earliest and most profound genres of music. 5. Rainy Day Country If you’re not a fan of nursery rhymes, jazz, or rock music, there are plenty of other music genres out there for you to explore. Maybe you prefer country music? Well, in that case, throw on your 10-gallon hat and pair of overalls because we’ve got the ultimate rainy day country playlist, partner. With 463 songs and 24 hours of music, this playlist is long enough to outlast any storm. The artists include Carrie Underwood, Luke Bryan, Blake Shelton, Kacey Musgraves, Sam Hunt, and more. It might be raining, but no one can stop you from throwing your own Stagecoach Festival from home. 6. Rainy Days Music for Mellowing Out One of Spotify’s most listened to playlists on a rainy day, this collection of songs has over 62,000 likes and features 306 songs. It's a 19-hour collection of acoustic, alternative, indie, classic rock, and more. Wherever your musical preference lies, there are plenty of stellar tracks to get you through the wet and dreary day. Stormy weather is all about enjoying good music and warm beverages, so if you need a playlist to help set the vibe, this is the one for you. But beyond that, this is also a great playlist if you’re trying to study, take a nap, read, or enjoy some much-needed rest and relaxation. Turn Up the Volume Don’t let the rain get you down—instead, turn up the volume and explore a new world of musical enlightenment. And remember, you’ll need to download the Spotify app or use the Spotify web player to listen to this collection of playlists. Otherwise, you’ll be stuck looking out the window listening to the rain. And if you want to expand your musical horizons, we have an entire line of audio equipment and accessories to broaden your listening experience.

It can symbolize a deeper meaning or simply sound cool. Think of those things you do every single day. Commuting, going to work or school, working out, running errands, making dinner, unwinding at home. What music do you want playing in the background? Put on your “Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist” hat and express yourself through the categorization of song. Here are some good playlist names to get you started.

Editorial Masthead Previous Editors Masthead APPLY SUBSCRIBE Playlist: Rainy Days Mellow in your melancholy with these bittersweet tunes to soundtrack a gloomy weather stroll or a cozy night in. Written by Charlotte Keene Photo courtesy of Jacque Foo Rain reminds us that it is okay to be sad sometimes. Even in periods of great happiness, emotions do not live in extremes. We cannot know happiness without sadness. We cannot appreciate the sun without rain. In gloom, there is beauty. It offers the perfect opportunity to reflect on the low points in life. Sitting in your sadness gives you the space to realize how an array of emotions enrich the feeling of happiness . Like rain, sadness can come in an instantaneous full force — like a torrential downpour — or a slow building constant — like persistent cloudy days. Allow yourself the space to be forlorn with these moody atmospheric tunes that complement the gloom of the weather. When the sun comes out again you just might feel a little bit brighter.
