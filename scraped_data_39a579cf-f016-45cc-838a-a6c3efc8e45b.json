I'm the founder of ListingToFreedom.com where I teach people just like you how to make money flipping used items on online platforms like eBay, Mercari, and Poshmark. 1 comments if you're trying to manage selling across multiple platforms trying to juggle all of your listings then this video is for you I'm going to be diving into what I believe to be the very best cross-listing tool for resellers in 2025 hey there my name is Lee Meyer I'm the founder of listing the freedom and the empowered reseller.com and I'm on a mission to help 1,000 resellers make $100,000 in the next 12 months if you're new here welcome to the channel my name is Lee Meer and I've made well over $100,000 flipping used Goods on sites like eBay Poshmark and merari and a big piece of My Success has been selling across multiple platforms with the help of a cross Lister now when I first started reselling there were not any cross listing tools on the market no help available you had to manually go and crosspost your items to multiple platforms if you wanted to be able to sell in multiple places it just was not feasible but shortly after after I got started with reselling cross-listing tools started coming on the market and there's several out there you might be looking into and in this video I'm going to share with you why I chose the one that I did and why I continue to believe that it is the best choice for resellers now the cross listing tool and app that I use and recommend is called vendue down here in the description below this video you'll find a link that will get you 25% off of your first month you're also able to get a free trial where you get five free listings each and every month to be able to try it out for yourself and see if it is right for you again you'll find a link down here with an affiliate code this is at no additional cost to you and helps me keep this channel running and helps me to be able to bring you more amazing reseller content and I'm going to let you in on a little secret if you're watching this video in the month of January 2025 you can actually get 40% off of your first month using the link below as well as the coupon code thrive in 25 now there are three broad reasons why I believe this to be the best cross Lister but I'm going to be also getting into specifics in this video first up this platform has updated features and integrates with all major reselling platforms secondly it has an easy to use interface as well as a responsive customer service and thirdly it's being Contin updated to stay ahead of Industry Trends and real quick before we get into the specifics let me explain what cross listing is and what a cross-listing tool can help you do cross-listing just means that you are listing your items out to multiple platforms and having a cross-listing tool means that you don't have to do it manually if you were to manually cross list which you can certainly do you're essentially going to be copying and pasting that same listing over and over again to the different marketplaces that you want to be selling on a cross listing tool can save you tons of time because it can give you one place to be able to create your listing and have that broadcast out to multiple platforms and it also gives you a way for those listings to actually be connected so that if it sells on one platform it's going to get delisted across those other platforms so that you don't end up with duplicate sales and a cross-listing tool is really all about saving you time so I spoiled things a little bit there but let's go ahead and jump on into the seven reasons why I believe that vendue is the best tool for you to be using in 2025 number one since I just touched on is that Auto Sales detect feature this is a GameChanger because it allows you to be able to go about your day without having to worry about ending up with duplicate sales vendue will actually take care of this for you in the back end where you don't have to be at your computer or on your phone constantly checking on your sales and then going in and delisting so what the auto sales detect feature will do you do need to actually have this toggle turned on for it to work but when you have that turned on what it's going to do is it's going to detect any sales that happen in real time and as soon as a sale comes in let's say you have a sale come in on merari and you have that item listed to depop eBay and Poshmark what vendu is actually going to do is remove those listings from those other platforms so that you don't end up with duplicate sales number two with the user interface you can actually get your items listed out to multiple Platforms in just a few clicks you'll create your listing right inside of vendue and then it takes just a couple of clicks to get it listed over to eBay couple clicks to get it listed to merari couple clicks to get it listed to Poshmark whatever platforms that you want to be selling on all of that information is going to be pulled into those specific platforms is going to take just a couple of things like maybe entering size maybe entering shipping and then you'll click to get that item listed and from experience this is infinitely faster than trying to manually do this yourself number three is Inventory management capabilities if you are not using a cross Lister and trying to sell in multiple places it's going to be very difficult to manage your inventory and track your sales coming in vendue gives you one place but it also gives you a way to be able to manage that inventory through things like tags that are specific to to the vendue platform there are also all other kinds of capabilities such as being able to sort and different filters that you can apply to be able to manage your inventory and speaking of sorting you can actually sort your items by how stale they are and that brings me to number four which vendue has the capability to actually delist and relist your sale items for you you're going to Simply sort your items by how stale they are you're going to select which items that you want to D list and relist and you're going to click for vendue to go ahead and complete this for you what this is going to do is it's actually going to remove your listings from the platforms where you want it removed from and then it's going to relist them as fresh brand new items and this is going to boost your sales because it's going to push your listings to the top of search results so that they actually get seen and sold and this is just one of the reasons why I believe vendue to be the best for 2025 because it is so much more more than just a cross listing tool number five vendue actually gives you the capability to have one place to send out offers from if you've tried to sell items across multiple places before it can be a nightmare pulling hair of trying to go to each and every platform manage your inventory along with sending out offers vendue gives you one place to be able to go to and actually get your offers sent out from just that one platform without having to log in to multiple places and this is just another example of how vendue not only saves you time but helps you make more sales number six is having custom templates you can actually go in and set these templates up I recommend setting templates up for each and every category that you're going to be listing into frequently and what these templates do is allow you to drastically speed up the listing process because it's going to prefill that information into all of your listing for you and this is a huge timesaver for you and number seven is the analytics dashboard this is the place where you can access all of your data so you can make informed decisions about your business I hope you found this video helpful and then it shows you just how easy it is to be able to sell across multiple platforms get more eyes on your items and make more sales if you tried vendue before or if you're looking to level up your reselling game let me know in the comments below and don't forget about that link down there to get you 25% off of your first month with vendue and if you're needing more help with getting started with vendue I will leave a link up here with the playlist that will walk you through step byep how to use bendu thanks for watching and I'll see you soon [Music] [Music]",

Hamel / September 28, 2023 E-commerce trends show that Q4 is the most wonderful time of the year for e-commerce. Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the holiday season are the perfect time to focus on maximizing sales. Everyone is shopping for everything on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but the focus is generally holiday shopping. Be sure to prioritize your NWT (new with tags) inventory that can be gifted. Here is how to make the most out of Black Friday by hosting sales and promotions. How to Host a Black Friday Sale Here is your ultimate guide to hosting a Black Friday or Cyber Monday Reseller Sale on Poshmark, eBay, Depop, Etsy, and more! 1. Name The Sale First, you will need to determine which type of sale you‚Äôre going to host. While your options vary by marketplace tools, you might also choose to create your own sale via messaging or advertisement. Generally, simpler is better. If your sale is too confusing, buyers will not understand. Here are a few different types of Black Friday sales I‚Äôve hosted over the years: 50% Off Everything. This is self-explanatory. It is a blanket discount on everything you have for sale. You can choose any percentage, but the higher it is, the more enticing it will be. BOGO: Buy One, Get One This is another very popular sale! Sellers often do ‚Äúbuy one, get one free‚Äù (equal or lesser value), or ‚Äúbuy one, get one half off.‚Äù These sales are great because they require the purchase of more than one item to participate. $10 Sale! Variations of this sale are simple: You slash the price of qualifying items, and you can advertise that you have ‚Äúhundreds of items marked at $10 while supplies last‚Äù üí°Tip: Make sure you can honor your sale. Be sure you don‚Äôt have special items or consignment items you cannot make eligible for these promotions. You can always raise the price before the sale. 2. Advertise Your Sale A good sale takes some careful planning and advertising. If you‚Äôre not yet on social media for your reselling business, here is your sign to create accounts today. Social media is amongst the most effective ways to advertise, using paid advertisement and just posting about your sale and showing your items! üí°Tip: Have you considered paid advertising on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and more? Most allow you to establish demographic goals and set a budget. This can be very effective for driving traffic to your stores. If you‚Äôre willing to familiarize yourself, Google Ads is also a valuable tool for paid advertising across the internet! Of course, there are also in-app tools and promotions. See below some things you can do on different marketplaces to notify shoppers of your sales! üí°Tip: Feel free to screenshot and use these graphics for your sale! They‚Äôre generic, so you can always add some text! You can also create and customize your own for free on Canva. How to Host a Black Friday Sale on eBay, Poshmark, Etsy, and more! Here is the step-by-step to hosting sales, promoting your items, and using the marketplace tools to promote sales on Black Friday! How to Run a Black Friday Sale on Poshmark Poshmark is booming during the holiday season. Here is how to host a sale on Poshmark! Note that there is no official ‚Äúsale‚Äù tool or feature on Poshmark. However, there are many Poshmark tools and features that you can use to strategically host a sale. üí°Tip: The new Poshmark Promoted Closet feature is a great way to promote your closet. You might choose to allocate a decent budget between Black Friday and Cyber Monday to get the most eyes on your listings Whichever type of sale you choose, here are the ways to promote it and inform potential buyers. Make Bulk Offers to Likers (OTL) Making bulk offers to likers is probably the simplest way to offer a discount to those who have already expressed interest in your items. You can make individual offers on each item, or use Poshmark‚Äôs Bulk Actions (or a tool like PosherVA) to make bulk offers. The bigger the offer, the more chance of sales. üí∞ üí°Tip: Don‚Äôt forget to comment in bundles to encourage multi-item sales! Create a Closet Sale Sign on Poshmark You can create a closet sale sign by creating a listing, the way you would for any other item. You‚Äôll use graphic images to promote your sales, and explain it in the description. You will want to select the ‚Äúbrand‚Äù for this listing to expand your reach; perhaps select one similar to the types of items you sell. You can use graphics like the ones above for the listing photos, and be sure to share the listing as often as possible! Use the My Shoppers Tool on Poshmark The My Shoppers tool enables sellers to interact with buyers in bulk. With the feature, you can do things like add likes to bundles, add bundle comments, and message former buyers. Thus, you can send a message to a mass number of users who have interacted with your closet to promote a sale or deal! Here is an example: Any combination of the ideas above can be used to run a sale on Poshmark. For more information, Check out this video about How To Host a Successful Sale on Poshmark. How to Host a Black Friday Sale on Mercari Frankly, you can‚Äôt. There is no sale or promotional feature on Mercari. There also aren‚Äôt too many tools on Mercari to use as work-arounds‚Ä¶ That said, you can do a few things that might increase your chances of making sale. üí°Tip: Don‚Äôt forget to also create a Mercari Shop sale sign! Promote Your Listings on Mercari To promote your listings, go to your profile, tap Selling, and select ‚ÄúPromote.‚Äù You‚Äôll be prompted to select whether you want to promote your listing to everyone or just send an Offer to Likers. Promoting your listings requires that you drop the price, boost them in the Mercari search feed results, and notify all likers about the price decrease. Making Offers to Likers (OTL) on Mercari requires that you make an offer of at least 10% off, and the platform then sends this special offer to all likers. Check out this chart to see how to promote your Mercari listings to make more sales. Image courtesy of the Mercari Help Center. Message Potential Buyers You might consider what I call ‚ÄúBuyer Outreach_.‚Äù_ This includes browsing your Mercari inbox, and reaching out to the buyers who have ghosted you after initial inquiry, to say something like: ‚ÄúHey! Are you still interested in this item? I‚Äôm running a 50% off sale today for Black Friday! Feel free to make the offer, and I‚Äôll accept.‚Äù Note that this method is a little spammy; use it sparingly. While there is no official way to run a sale, discount, or promotion on your entire Mercari shop, the steps above are the best ways to run an unofficial sale. How to Run a Black Friday Sale on eBay eBay provides sellers with so many tools, including promotions, offers to watchers, bulk price adjustments, coupons, and official tools for discounting store items with a sale event. Note that some of these features require that you have an eBay store. Tools to Make More Sales on eBay First, you can send offers to watchers from your eBay seller hub. You can also promote your items in various ways, through paid promotional tools (and you only pay the promotion fee when your item sells as a direct result of the promotion). You can also create promotional coupons, with your own terms and conditions, in the eBay promotion manager. In addition to these basic eBay selling features, you can have an official eBay Sale Event: How to Run An eBay Store Sale You can create sales in your eBay promotion manager dashboard. eBay allows you to customize your sale details, eligible items, and markdown price here. eBay also allows you to promote your sale via ads and mailing lists. There are so many advanced tools and opportunities for sales on eBay. Learn more about creating and managing an eBay sale here. eBay can seem intimidating, but those complexities are opportunities with advanced tools to make more money.

How to Run a Black Friday Sale on Depop Depop also does not have an official sale option, but it does have a discount feature. When you use the Depop discount tool, you can apply a discount to your entire shop (or select items) with just a few clicks. Note: To notify likers, you must discount your items by at least 30%. When you use Depop discounts, your items are tagged with yellow sale stickers. Click here to see how to use the Depop discount feature in the Depop app. In addition to the Depop discount feature, you can also try the ‚Äúshop sign‚Äù and ‚Äúbuyer outreach‚Äù ideas explained above! How to Host a Sale on Facebook Marketplace FBMP has many tools for resellers in lieu of an official sale feature including: offers, renewal, price drop, FBMP Ad Promotions, and Facebook Boosted Listings. While none of these are a simple sale option, collectively, you can promote your listings strategically to effectuate a sale. üí°Tip: Before you host a sale, check if any of your marketplace listings are eligible for renewal. If they are, you‚Äôll see a \" renew \" button below each on your listings screen. This feature essentially refreshes your listings to broaden your reach. Similarly, your older listings might be eligible for price drop, where you can reduce the price to notify likers and viewers. These tools only apply to the eligible listings, which will be indicated in your marketplace manager. You can send offers on Facebook (with a comment advertising your sale) from your marketplace manager. You can also choose to boost your listings and personally select your desired audience, listings, duration, and details of your promotional ad (this is a paid promo, but it‚Äôs worth it). Facebook Marketplace Ads work similarly, and you can personalize the sale type and language to reflect your sale! How to Run a Black Friday Sale on Grailed There is no official sale option or mass discount feature on Grailed. But, Grailed does provide a few promotional features that you can use strategically to host a sale event on Grailed including offers to likers, bumps, and price drops. How to Make More Sales on Grailed You can also make offers to likers on Grailed. You can make offers to likers by selecting the item, and creating an offer price (at least ten percent below the current price). In fact, you can make OTL on Grailed four times within a month, so long as you reduce your offer by ten percent each time. Sending mass offers with a steep discount is the best way to host a sale on Grailed. üí°Tip: On Grailed, you can bump your items after 7 days; when you look at your listings screen, the ‚Äúbump‚Äù button will appear under each eligible listing. Bumping your items will refresh them in your shop and the search. After one month, you‚Äôll have to price drop by at least 10% to boost your listing in the search feed. How to Run a Sale For Your Shopify Store Shopify is a unique selling marketplace; it is less of a peer-to-peer marketplace and more of a tool to power your very own e-commerce website. Shopify provides so many tools and resources for sellers, including running a sale and creating a discount code. On Shopify you can create discount codes, set up automatic discounts, or set sale prices for individual products. You can host a sale on Shopify easily by manually adjusting your prices, and opting to keep the original price present, to demonstrate the sale. This is called the compare price sale; learn more here. You can also apply an automatic discount to your entire store. Even better, is the ability to create a discount code in your Shopify store. You can create a discount code easily, and establish rules for when and how it can be used. Examples include a discount code for a dollar amount, a percentage discount, or a buy something and get something discount (Like BOGO style), or a shipping promotion discount. Visit the discount page to create your code and its terms. Remember that because Shopify is your own website, there is not necessarily a built-in audience. You will have to do your own marketing to drive traffic to your store. Shopify provides all of the tools and resources you need to make sales happen. üí°Tip: For a full guide to how to sell on Shopify, check out the article What You Need to Know to Start Selling on Shopify. How to Host a Black Friday Sale on Kidizen On Kidizen, there is a shop discount feature that works as a tool to run a sale in your Kidizen shop. üí°Tip: Many sellers don‚Äôt know you should share your items daily on Kidizen! You can set up a shop discount to automatically offer discounted shipping. This effectively creates a sale that applies to bundles. The best part is, it creates a banner at the top of your store! Check it out: This is how you establish a shop discount, and how it appears on your shop page. Image courtesy of the Kidizen Help Center. How to Host a Black Friday Sale on Etsy Etsy offers multiple official sale techniques, and the holidays are by far the busiest time of the year on the Etsy app! Etsy provides sellers with three methods to discount items: Sales, promo codes, and targeted offers. Running a Black Friday Sale on Etsy With the official sale feature on Etsy, you can offer a discount on (some or) all of the items in your shop for a set audience for a certain period of time.

Hamel / September 28, 2023 E-commerce trends show that Q4 is the most wonderful time of the year for e-commerce. Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the holiday season are the perfect time to focus on maximizing sales. Everyone is shopping for everything on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but the focus is generally holiday shopping. Be sure to prioritize your NWT (new with tags) inventory that can be gifted. Here is how to make the most out of Black Friday by hosting sales and promotions. How to Host a Black Friday Sale Here is your ultimate guide to hosting a Black Friday or Cyber Monday Reseller Sale on Poshmark, eBay, Depop, Etsy, and more! 1. Name The Sale First, you will need to determine which type of sale you‚Äôre going to host. While your options vary by marketplace tools, you might also choose to create your own sale via messaging or advertisement. Generally, simpler is better. If your sale is too confusing, buyers will not understand. Here are a few different types of Black Friday sales I‚Äôve hosted over the years: 50% Off Everything. This is self-explanatory. It is a blanket discount on everything you have for sale. You can choose any percentage, but the higher it is, the more enticing it will be. BOGO: Buy One, Get One This is another very popular sale! Sellers often do ‚Äúbuy one, get one free‚Äù (equal or lesser value), or ‚Äúbuy one, get one half off.‚Äù These sales are great because they require the purchase of more than one item to participate. $10 Sale! Variations of this sale are simple: You slash the price of qualifying items, and you can advertise that you have ‚Äúhundreds of items marked at $10 while supplies last‚Äù üí°Tip: Make sure you can honor your sale. Be sure you don‚Äôt have special items or consignment items you cannot make eligible for these promotions. You can always raise the price before the sale. 2. Advertise Your Sale A good sale takes some careful planning and advertising. If you‚Äôre not yet on social media for your reselling business, here is your sign to create accounts today. Social media is amongst the most effective ways to advertise, using paid advertisement and just posting about your sale and showing your items! üí°Tip: Have you considered paid advertising on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and more? Most allow you to establish demographic goals and set a budget. This can be very effective for driving traffic to your stores. If you‚Äôre willing to familiarize yourself, Google Ads is also a valuable tool for paid advertising across the internet! Of course, there are also in-app tools and promotions. See below some things you can do on different marketplaces to notify shoppers of your sales! üí°Tip: Feel free to screenshot and use these graphics for your sale! They‚Äôre generic, so you can always add some text! You can also create and customize your own for free on Canva. How to Host a Black Friday Sale on eBay, Poshmark, Etsy, and more! Here is the step-by-step to hosting sales, promoting your items, and using the marketplace tools to promote sales on Black Friday! How to Run a Black Friday Sale on Poshmark Poshmark is booming during the holiday season. Here is how to host a sale on Poshmark! Note that there is no official ‚Äúsale‚Äù tool or feature on Poshmark. However, there are many Poshmark tools and features that you can use to strategically host a sale. üí°Tip: The new Poshmark Promoted Closet feature is a great way to promote your closet. You might choose to allocate a decent budget between Black Friday and Cyber Monday to get the most eyes on your listings Whichever type of sale you choose, here are the ways to promote it and inform potential buyers. Make Bulk Offers to Likers (OTL) Making bulk offers to likers is probably the simplest way to offer a discount to those who have already expressed interest in your items. You can make individual offers on each item, or use Poshmark‚Äôs Bulk Actions (or a tool like PosherVA) to make bulk offers. The bigger the offer, the more chance of sales. üí∞ üí°Tip: Don‚Äôt forget to comment in bundles to encourage multi-item sales! Create a Closet Sale Sign on Poshmark You can create a closet sale sign by creating a listing, the way you would for any other item. You‚Äôll use graphic images to promote your sales, and explain it in the description. You will want to select the ‚Äúbrand‚Äù for this listing to expand your reach; perhaps select one similar to the types of items you sell. You can use graphics like the ones above for the listing photos, and be sure to share the listing as often as possible! Use the My Shoppers Tool on Poshmark The My Shoppers tool enables sellers to interact with buyers in bulk. With the feature, you can do things like add likes to bundles, add bundle comments, and message former buyers. Thus, you can send a message to a mass number of users who have interacted with your closet to promote a sale or deal! Here is an example: Any combination of the ideas above can be used to run a sale on Poshmark. For more information, Check out this video about How To Host a Successful Sale on Poshmark. How to Host a Black Friday Sale on Mercari Frankly, you can‚Äôt. There is no sale or promotional feature on Mercari. There also aren‚Äôt too many tools on Mercari to use as work-arounds‚Ä¶ That said, you can do a few things that might increase your chances of making sale. üí°Tip: Don‚Äôt forget to also create a Mercari Shop sale sign! Promote Your Listings on Mercari To promote your listings, go to your profile, tap Selling, and select ‚ÄúPromote.‚Äù You‚Äôll be prompted to select whether you want to promote your listing to everyone or just send an Offer to Likers. Promoting your listings requires that you drop the price, boost them in the Mercari search feed results, and notify all likers about the price decrease. Making Offers to Likers (OTL) on Mercari requires that you make an offer of at least 10% off, and the platform then sends this special offer to all likers. Check out this chart to see how to promote your Mercari listings to make more sales. Image courtesy of the Mercari Help Center. Message Potential Buyers You might consider what I call ‚ÄúBuyer Outreach_.‚Äù_ This includes browsing your Mercari inbox, and reaching out to the buyers who have ghosted you after initial inquiry, to say something like: ‚ÄúHey! Are you still interested in this item? I‚Äôm running a 50% off sale today for Black Friday! Feel free to make the offer, and I‚Äôll accept.‚Äù Note that this method is a little spammy; use it sparingly. While there is no official way to run a sale, discount, or promotion on your entire Mercari shop, the steps above are the best ways to run an unofficial sale. How to Run a Black Friday Sale on eBay eBay provides sellers with so many tools, including promotions, offers to watchers, bulk price adjustments, coupons, and official tools for discounting store items with a sale event. Note that some of these features require that you have an eBay store. Tools to Make More Sales on eBay First, you can send offers to watchers from your eBay seller hub. You can also promote your items in various ways, through paid promotional tools (and you only pay the promotion fee when your item sells as a direct result of the promotion). You can also create promotional coupons, with your own terms and conditions, in the eBay promotion manager. In addition to these basic eBay selling features, you can have an official eBay Sale Event: How to Run An eBay Store Sale You can create sales in your eBay promotion manager dashboard. eBay allows you to customize your sale details, eligible items, and markdown price here. eBay also allows you to promote your sale via ads and mailing lists. There are so many advanced tools and opportunities for sales on eBay. Learn more about creating and managing an eBay sale here. eBay can seem intimidating, but those complexities are opportunities with advanced tools to make more money. For a full guide to eBay, check out the blog How to Get Started Selling on eBay. How to Run a Black Friday Sale on Depop Depop also does not have an official sale option, but it does have a discount feature. When you use the Depop discount tool, you can apply a discount to your entire shop (or select items) with just a few clicks. Note: To notify likers, you must discount your items by at least 30%. When you use Depop discounts, your items are tagged with yellow sale stickers. Click here to see how to use the Depop discount feature in the Depop app. In addition to the Depop discount feature, you can also try the ‚Äúshop sign‚Äù and ‚Äúbuyer outreach‚Äù ideas explained above! How to Host a Sale on Facebook Marketplace FBMP has many tools for resellers in lieu of an official sale feature including: offers, renewal, price drop, FBMP Ad Promotions, and Facebook Boosted Listings. While none of these are a simple sale option, collectively, you can promote your listings strategically to effectuate a sale. üí°Tip: Before you host a sale, check if any of your marketplace listings are eligible for renewal. If they are, you‚Äôll see a \" renew \" button below each on your listings screen. This feature essentially refreshes your listings to broaden your reach. Similarly, your older listings might be eligible for price drop, where you can reduce the price to notify likers and viewers. These tools only apply to the eligible listings, which will be indicated in your marketplace manager. You can send offers on Facebook (with a comment advertising your sale) from your marketplace manager. You can also choose to boost your listings and personally select your desired audience, listings, duration, and details of your promotional ad (this is a paid promo, but it‚Äôs worth it). Facebook Marketplace Ads work similarly, and you can personalize the sale type and language to reflect your sale! How to Run a Black Friday Sale on Grailed There is no official sale option or mass discount feature on Grailed. But, Grailed does provide a few promotional features that you can use strategically to host a sale event on Grailed including offers to likers, bumps, and price drops. How to Make More Sales on Grailed You can also make offers to likers on Grailed. You can make offers to likers by selecting the item, and creating an offer price (at least ten percent below the current price). In fact, you can make OTL on Grailed four times within a month, so long as you reduce your offer by ten percent each time. Sending mass offers with a steep discount is the best way to host a sale on Grailed. üí°Tip: On Grailed, you can bump your items after 7 days; when you look at your listings screen, the ‚Äúbump‚Äù button will appear under each eligible listing. Bumping your items will refresh them in your shop and the search. After one month, you‚Äôll have to price drop by at least 10% to boost your listing in the search feed. How to Run a Sale For Your Shopify Store Shopify is a unique selling marketplace; it is less of a peer-to-peer marketplace and more of a tool to power your very own e-commerce website. Shopify provides so many tools and resources for sellers, including running a sale and creating a discount code. On Shopify you can create discount codes, set up automatic discounts, or set sale prices for individual products. You can host a sale on Shopify easily by manually adjusting your prices, and opting to keep the original price present, to demonstrate the sale. This is called the compare price sale; learn more here. You can also apply an automatic discount to your entire store. Even better, is the ability to create a discount code in your Shopify store. You can create a discount code easily, and establish rules for when and how it can be used. Examples include a discount code for a dollar amount, a percentage discount, or a buy something and get something discount (Like BOGO style), or a shipping promotion discount. Visit the discount page to create your code and its terms. Remember that because Shopify is your own website, there is not necessarily a built-in audience. You will have to do your own marketing to drive traffic to your store. Shopify provides all of the tools and resources you need to make sales happen. üí°Tip: For a full guide to how to sell on Shopify, check out the article What You Need to Know to Start Selling on Shopify. How to Host a Black Friday Sale on Kidizen On Kidizen, there is a shop discount feature that works as a tool to run a sale in your Kidizen shop. üí°Tip: Many sellers don‚Äôt know you should share your items daily on Kidizen! You can set up a shop discount to automatically offer discounted shipping. This effectively creates a sale that applies to bundles. The best part is, it creates a banner at the top of your store! Check it out: This is how you establish a shop discount, and how it appears on your shop page. Image courtesy of the Kidizen Help Center. How to Host a Black Friday Sale on Etsy Etsy offers multiple official sale techniques, and the holidays are by far the busiest time of the year on the Etsy app! Etsy provides sellers with three methods to discount items: Sales, promo codes, and targeted offers. Running a Black Friday Sale on Etsy With the official sale feature on Etsy, you can offer a discount on (some or) all of the items in your shop for a set audience for a certain period of time.

Maytee https://www.instagram.com/tayeescamilla/ 77 comments well today definitely did not go the way that I planned today was supposed to be just another Friday and yet we're on our way to the airport uh you know we are we were doing a deal and I was closing a deal with a huge client of ours we've done about three million dollars with him today and it's been less than a year at this point we've had several conversations but I've never put really a face to the name or to the voice uh he's bought some crazy pieces 5726 Paddock an rm30 rm67 platonas meteorite daytonas all sorts of stuff and you know we were finalizing this deal and we were figuring out shipping to his house you know with all the trades and on both ends and everything it's a high six-figure deal and you know the logistics on shipping stuff like that is not as easy as just shipping one watch or you know just you know delivering it to be a FedEx or something and it really takes uh specific companies with armored vehicles to send that and he just went wasn't comfortable comfortable with armored vehicles showing up to his house so you know we talked and I was like you know what at this point it's going to be done so much business I'd love to meet you and he said the same thing we'd actually talked about it before and so this was the perfect opportunity with such a high value deal for us to uh get that done so we put a couple things into action for our safety for insurance purposes and that was a lot easier than actually the logistics so we're on our way to the airport and uh I'm really excited to get this deal done I won't spoil it for you guys but there's a lot of sick watches that you guys can get to see and we're gonna bring back home to Texas so stay tuned I'm gonna make sure we have that one watch I'm just I just like to double check all the time always a good idea I'm not going to show you guys I'm gonna blow these out I'm gonna blow these out show the people oh it's there it's there and the bag is on the ground um this is in my hand that's all that matters you ready let's go man let's do it well we just landed in Detroit uh I'm gonna go check in at the hotel it's been a long day I want to get some rest and get ready for this deal looking forward to meeting with this client and uh wrapping this up because it's a good one so yeah a lot a lot of people from the previous channel will know a little bit about my story but uh I guess it just started with a love of watches my grandpa got me into it back in the day fun fact he used to work as a forklift driver at a harbor in El Salvador where he's from he would get seikos on one side of the harbor and then when he would go deliver on the other side of the harbor as a forklift driver some of the businessmen would see what he was wearing on his wrist and said hey where would you where'd you get that let me buy it off your wrist since he'd sell off his wrist and then he started going to the other back to the other side and he would buy like three or four and uh the executives or the businessmen would invite him to their offices and he would bring three or four pieces and and you know flip them for a little bit of profit it was uh you know back then he was is really impoverished and it was a way for him to make a couple bucks and so I remember him telling me those stories and that story just was like so I don't know just something about it was cool I thought my grandpa you know the fact that he was super I've always been entrepreneurial and so to see my grandpa doing that even in that small way and El Salvador was cool but then you know I would always since I was a kid I'd go to his house and the kitchen table just had like hundreds and hundreds of watches that he had collected and from timex's to seikos and who knows probably movados and you know he never really had money to spend on crazy stuff he just his passion for watches and having like NATO straps and different parts and putting things together and he would Frankenstein watches together was just really cool and so that's what got me into watches and so fast forward I would say six seven eight years ago I had wanted to buy my first Rolex because I started making some money with my previous business which I still have which is a construction company I remember I wanted buy one but I can never justify the price I mean I was making good money but still I just I didn't come from wealth and to spend at the time 6 500 bucks on a watch was just crazy so I remember I talked to my wife and I was like hey would you be okay if I saved for a year and bought my Rolex and she's always been supportive and she said of course and so I saved up for a year well there is this one particular one six six one three bluesy it was a five digit aluminum bezel bluesy that was at this pawn shop and at the time it had already been there for about a year year and a half I'd seen this watch I'd always go into that same pawn shop in Midlothian Texas out of all places and that same watch was there for such a long time and at the time it was really overpriced I remember I told them hey I'm Gonna Save for a year and I'll be back and they were kind of like okay at that point I had been at that store several times looking at the same watch asking to see it and I never bought it so I think they were kind of annoyed by me at the time and so anyways I saved up for a year and sure enough I had the money and I go back and these guys had raised the freaking price I was so freaking frustrated I had just saved up for a year I was so excited to go buy this watch and the price went up they're like hey dude we don't control the market the prices went up and it is what it is and so I went home pretty disappointed um but I didn't want to end it there so I just started researching and researching and I came across actually a listing from a retired veteran who had a reference 16570 Explorer with the black dial I ended up buying that for 4 500 bucks I fell immediately in love it was my first Rolex I felt so powerful I felt so special it was so cool to know that I had just bought my first Rolex just like anybody else who gets into a hobby I just got consumed into it I started researching everything all all the references you know all the different models and so I had to have them all so I remember I traded that in at a local jewelry store and got a 39 millimeter Explorer one and which is a more of a modern piece and I made 500 bucks on the trade and then I traded in actually I sold that one I made another 500 bucks so my first two deals all in all I made a hunt a thousand bucks in like two weeks and for me at the time that was a lot of money I was excited that I could wear this watch for free and make a thousand bucks so I just started doing the same thing over and over over and over over and over it just became a way for me to justify it but I remember I had to you know once I got the Explorer then I had to get a you know a datejust and once I got the datejust I had to get the GMT and once I got the GMT I had to get the Submariner and then I had to get to Daytona and then I wanted a gold piece and then I had to get an AP finally when I got the AP by that time I had already me and Andrew would actually during that time go to different jewelry stores in the area and we would just go find pieces we could buy and make a little bit of money on and that process had started uh wholesaling these pieces to other dealers we got into a few dealer chats and would start wholesaling the pieces and flipping them and so that's kind of how we got started and with doing that and posting on Instagram I would get some retail clients and that's really how we got started at the beginning it was mostly wholesale with a few retails it wasn't until about 2020 2021 especially when we started the YouTube channel that things really blew up on the retail side for us for sure uh I mean that's just how we got started just for the passion of watches and the excitement of being able to make some money on with wearing them and having them was super cool to me and so me and Andrew did that together and we just both killed it and researched watches until we were experts and that's just kind of how we did it so I don't want to spoil it because client's about to show up but this is really the reason why we're here in Detroit this is a pretty big hitter and you know we were going to ship this but he wanted it today on a Saturday and with shipping it and getting it on a Saturday in Detroit they have to get armored armored vehicle and he didn't really feel comfortable so anyways we're here delivering it I'm gonna wait till he gets here but it is a really special piece and you can tell by the size of this box ap's boxes are usually about this tall and about half the width so this thing is letting you know if there's something extremely special in here and there really is what's the watch is in here is something extremely special super super rare and I know he's really excited to have it and we're really excited to do the deal in exchange for this watch we're getting about six six to seven pieces now this is this watch is a part of a three watch deal that we did with him one of those watches for his wife and then a Smurf that he also purchased and so all in all we're trading he's trading in eight pieces and he's getting three in return and that's because this boy is just a big boy in that process so I'm excited to show you guys what we got uh I've got a full titanium 43 millimeter offshore so it's all titanium and then it's got that blue uh like navy blue dial the silver sub-dials and this really nice white strap perfect for the summer it is 110. we have to be at the airport at no later than 2 30. uh he's still not here he said he was going to be here in about 20 minutes 20 minutes ago so he's running a little late and so I'm a little nervous because it's eight watches and I have to authenticate and make sure they're all good before we leave now I'm not super concerned with him because we've done about three million dollars in deals he's never given me a reason to question him but in this business you can never ever be lacks about anything you always have to take things super serious and so I'm gonna have to sit there and make sure all the watches are authentic hopefully I'll get that all done before we need to leave on our flight and we I hope we don't miss this flight so stay tuned either I'm going to wake up in Detroit tomorrow or hopefully we'll be back in Dallas in bed tonight but what's up man how's it going good how are you this is crazy finally in the flesh I know hey I love this this is nice to meet you nice to meet you well he's not the one we sold the watch to is he no that's my cousin Ned you think oh yeah man man that's right that's awesome dude I love this spec of this car thank you thank you what's going on nothing much you guys want to come in nothing much man I love the back yeah yeah for sure got some good weight to it it's really heavy well yeah so we have the reference 26574 PT there's one of 50 in the world of this piece there's only 50 pieces it's uh they call this a limited edition icy blue dial uh and it's a perpetual calendar I mean this thing is as heavy hitter as it gets if you for people like Hassan that don't like having what everybody else has this is a piece beautiful it's really good it's smaller right than the than the 15-5 yeah oh yeah so those that was your main concern is that you wanted enough to be as bulky it sits way flatter on your wrist [Music] that's good but you gotta get it sized up yeah that can get your size up [Music] all right this is yours oh this is heavy okay so we have a white sky and talking to Hassan is a 2019 this is coming back home to Dallas all the boxing papers good to go and then we have the meteorite Daytona so this is the previous reference but it's still super rare meteorite this is a pretty sick piece in white gold so this will be coming back home I don't know if I should say too much about these watches nice right now because in Hassan might want to keep them and so I have to say that they're crap watches that are coming home to Dallas yeah he was like he goes you're really selling that did uh did you get your wife's piece yet no okay it should be there let me know then we got a Pepsi that we just sold him not too long ago so this is a 2023 this is coming back home another Rolex then we got ourselves a Hulk but this guy replaced with the Smurf so you can't complain and it's a 2020 Smurf and it wasn't in branding condition yeah so it was a good trade I know when you I was very like because I was surprised because I know you like unique like kind of different stuff like that so when you say you didn't like the blue dials like he's got to try it yeah so when we get new watches sometimes we Saran wrap them and so I had Saran Wrap This Smurf and I sent him a picture he didn't like it so then I was like you know what let's unwrap it take it in the sunlight send the pictures all right send it and then he got it and he's really stoked with it now so glad that happened then we got now an AP box so this one's coming home what did you like about this one I'm just curious just too big for you that's fair so it's not a terrible watch it's just too

Maytee https://www.instagram.com/tayeescamilla/ 77 comments well today definitely did not go the way that I planned today was supposed to be just another Friday and yet we're on our way to the airport uh you know we are we were doing a deal and I was closing a deal with a huge client of ours we've done about three million dollars with him today and it's been less than a year at this point we've had several conversations but I've never put really a face to the name or to the voice uh he's bought some crazy pieces 5726 Paddock an rm30 rm67 platonas meteorite daytonas all sorts of stuff and you know we were finalizing this deal and we were figuring out shipping to his house you know with all the trades and on both ends and everything it's a high six-figure deal and you know the logistics on shipping stuff like that is not as easy as just shipping one watch or you know just you know delivering it to be a FedEx or something and it really takes uh specific companies with armored vehicles to send that and he just went wasn't comfortable comfortable with armored vehicles showing up to his house so you know we talked and I was like you know what at this point it's going to be done so much business I'd love to meet you and he said the same thing we'd actually talked about it before and so this was the perfect opportunity with such a high value deal for us to uh get that done so we put a couple things into action for our safety for insurance purposes and that was a lot easier than actually the logistics so we're on our way to the airport and uh I'm really excited to get this deal done I won't spoil it for you guys but there's a lot of sick watches that you guys can get to see and we're gonna bring back home to Texas so stay tuned I'm gonna make sure we have that one watch I'm just I just like to double check all the time always a good idea I'm not going to show you guys I'm gonna blow these out I'm gonna blow these out show the people oh it's there it's there and the bag is on the ground um this is in my hand that's all that matters you ready let's go man let's do it well we just landed in Detroit uh I'm gonna go check in at the hotel it's been a long day I want to get some rest and get ready for this deal looking forward to meeting with this client and uh wrapping this up because it's a good one so yeah a lot a lot of people from the previous channel will know a little bit about my story but uh I guess it just started with a love of watches my grandpa got me into it back in the day fun fact he used to work as a forklift driver at a harbor in El Salvador where he's from he would get seikos on one side of the harbor and then when he would go deliver on the other side of the harbor as a forklift driver some of the businessmen would see what he was wearing on his wrist and said hey where would you where'd you get that let me buy it off your wrist since he'd sell off his wrist and then he started going to the other back to the other side and he would buy like three or four and uh the executives or the businessmen would invite him to their offices and he would bring three or four pieces and and you know flip them for a little bit of profit it was uh you know back then he was is really impoverished and it was a way for him to make a couple bucks and so I remember him telling me those stories and that story just was like so I don't know just something about it was cool I thought my grandpa you know the fact that he was super I've always been entrepreneurial and so to see my grandpa doing that even in that small way and El Salvador was cool but then you know I would always since I was a kid I'd go to his house and the kitchen table just had like hundreds and hundreds of watches that he had collected and from timex's to seikos and who knows probably movados and you know he never really had money to spend on crazy stuff he just his passion for watches and having like NATO straps and different parts and putting things together and he would Frankenstein watches together was just really cool and so that's what got me into watches and so fast forward I would say six seven eight years ago I had wanted to buy my first Rolex because I started making some money with my previous business which I still have which is a construction company I remember I wanted buy one but I can never justify the price I mean I was making good money but still I just I didn't come from wealth and to spend at the time 6 500 bucks on a watch was just crazy so I remember I talked to my wife and I was like hey would you be okay if I saved for a year and bought my Rolex and she's always been supportive and she said of course and so I saved up for a year well there is this one particular one six six one three bluesy it was a five digit aluminum bezel bluesy that was at this pawn shop and at the time it had already been there for about a year year and a half I'd seen this watch I'd always go into that same pawn shop in Midlothian Texas out of all places and that same watch was there for such a long time and at the time it was really overpriced I remember I told them hey I'm Gonna Save for a year and I'll be back and they were kind of like okay at that point I had been at that store several times looking at the same watch asking to see it and I never bought it so I think they were kind of annoyed by me at the time and so anyways I saved up for a year and sure enough I had the money and I go back and these guys had raised the freaking price I was so freaking frustrated I had just saved up for a year I was so excited to go buy this watch and the price went up they're like hey dude we don't control the market the prices went up and it is what it is and so I went home pretty disappointed um but I didn't want to end it there so I just started researching and researching and I came across actually a listing from a retired veteran who had a reference 16570 Explorer with the black dial I ended up buying that for 4 500 bucks I fell immediately in love it was my first Rolex I felt so powerful I felt so special it was so cool to know that I had just bought my first Rolex just like anybody else who gets into a hobby I just got consumed into it I started researching everything all all the references you know all the different models and so I had to have them all so I remember I traded that in at a local jewelry store and got a 39 millimeter Explorer one and which is a more of a modern piece and I made 500 bucks on the trade and then I traded in actually I sold that one I made another 500 bucks so my first two deals all in all I made a hunt a thousand bucks in like two weeks and for me at the time that was a lot of money I was excited that I could wear this watch for free and make a thousand bucks so I just started doing the same thing over and over over and over over and over it just became a way for me to justify it but I remember I had to you know once I got the Explorer then I had to get a you know a datejust and once I got the datejust I had to get the GMT and once I got the GMT I had to get the Submariner and then I had to get to Daytona and then I wanted a gold piece and then I had to get an AP finally when I got the AP by that time I had already me and Andrew would actually during that time go to different jewelry stores in the area and we would just go find pieces we could buy and make a little bit of money on and that process had started uh wholesaling these pieces to other dealers we got into a few dealer chats and would start wholesaling the pieces and flipping them and so that's kind of how we got started and with doing that and posting on Instagram I would get some retail clients and that's really how we got started at the beginning it was mostly wholesale with a few retails it wasn't until about 2020 2021 especially when we started the YouTube channel that things really blew up on the retail side for us for sure uh I mean that's just how we got started just for the passion of watches and the excitement of being able to make some money on with wearing them and having them was super cool to me and so me and Andrew did that together and we just both killed it and researched watches until we were experts and that's just kind of how we did it so I don't want to spoil it because client's about to show up but this is really the reason why we're here in Detroit this is a pretty big hitter and you know we were going to ship this but he wanted it today on a Saturday and with shipping it and getting it on a Saturday in Detroit they have to get armored armored vehicle and he didn't really feel comfortable so anyways we're here delivering it I'm gonna wait till he gets here but it is a really special piece and you can tell by the size of this box ap's boxes are usually about this tall and about half the width so this thing is letting you know if there's something extremely special in here and there really is what's the watch is in here is something extremely special super super rare and I know he's really excited to have it and we're really excited to do the deal in exchange for this watch we're getting about six six to seven pieces now this is this watch is a part of a three watch deal that we did with him one of those watches for his wife and then a Smurf that he also purchased and so all in all we're trading he's trading in eight pieces and he's getting three in return and that's because this boy is just a big boy in that process so I'm excited to show you guys what we got uh I've got a full titanium 43 millimeter offshore so it's all titanium and then it's got that blue uh like navy blue dial the silver sub-dials and this really nice white strap perfect for the summer it is 110. we have to be at the airport at no later than 2 30. uh he's still not here he said he was going to be here in about 20 minutes 20 minutes ago so he's running a little late and so I'm a little nervous because it's eight watches and I have to authenticate and make sure they're all good before we leave now I'm not super concerned with him because we've done about three million dollars in deals he's never given me a reason to question him but in this business you can never ever be lacks about anything you always have to take things super serious and so I'm gonna have to sit there and make sure all the watches are authentic hopefully I'll get that all done before we need to leave on our flight and we I hope we don't miss this flight so stay tuned either I'm going to wake up in Detroit tomorrow or hopefully we'll be back in Dallas in bed tonight but what's up man how's it going good how are you this is crazy finally in the flesh I know hey I love this this is nice to meet you nice to meet you well he's not the one we sold the watch to is he no that's my cousin Ned you think oh yeah man man that's right that's awesome dude I love this spec of this car thank you thank you what's going on nothing much you guys want to come in nothing much man I love the back yeah yeah for sure got some good weight to it it's really heavy well yeah so we have the reference 26574 PT there's one of 50 in the world of this piece there's only 50 pieces it's uh they call this a limited edition icy blue dial uh and it's a perpetual calendar I mean this thing is as heavy hitter as it gets if you for people like Hassan that don't like having what everybody else has this is a piece beautiful it's really good it's smaller right than the than the 15-5 yeah oh yeah so those that was your main concern is that you wanted enough to be as bulky it sits way flatter on your wrist [Music] that's good but you gotta get it sized up yeah that can get your size up [Music] all right this is yours oh this is heavy okay so we have a white sky and talking to Hassan is a 2019 this is coming back home to Dallas all the boxing papers good to go and then we have the meteorite Daytona so this is the previous reference but it's still super rare meteorite this is a pretty sick piece in white gold so this will be coming back home I don't know if I should say too much about these watches nice right now because in Hassan might want to keep them and so I have to say that they're crap watches that are coming home to Dallas yeah he was like he goes you're really selling that did uh did you get your wife's piece yet no okay it should be there let me know then we got a Pepsi that we just sold him not too long ago so this is a 2023 this is coming back home another Rolex then we got ourselves a Hulk but this guy replaced with the Smurf so you can't complain and it's a 2020 Smurf and it wasn't in branding condition yeah so it was a good trade I know when you I was very like because I was surprised because I know you like unique like kind of

Ive had this question for anwhile and don‚Äôt have anyone to ask. I‚Äôm glad to see there‚Äôs a community here that supports each other. I‚Äôm very new to selling and sincerely enjoy every aspect to it. Eventually, I am considering cross-listing at some point, but then how does sending ‚Äúwatchers‚Äù offers work? Or does it? My thought is you no longer send offers due to the item possibly selling on both platforms. Am I correct in thinking this or am I missing something that could enable me to both cross-list and still send offers? For those who currently cross-list, how has your experience been with this? Do you see noticeable increased sales, in cross listing ,that the offers you would have sent on one platform and ‚Äúhopefully‚Äù would have been accepted are tiny in comparison? In the end, from experience is it a game changer to cross- list? Please be easy with me, it took a lot for me to reach out and ask what may be a silly question. I appreciate you all sharing any valuable knowledge with me. Take care Message 1 of 11 latest reply 1 Helpful Reply All forum topics Previous Topic Next Topic 10 REPLIES 10 Cross-listing? wastingtime101 Superstar (0 feedbacks) View listings Options Mark as New Bookmark Subscribe Mute Subscribe to RSS Feed Permalink Print Report Inappropriate Content ‚Äé04-27-2023 07:30 PM - edited ‚Äé04-27-2023 07:31 PM Hey, welcome @shopmyfinderskeepers. Cross-listing across multiple platforms requires a lot of juggling if you have consistent sales. You have to always be \"on\" - like getting alerts on your phone so as soon as your item sells on one venue you can take down the listing on the other venue. One thing to keep in mind with eBay is the out of stock cancellation is basically the kiss of death. Any account can survive one, but if it's a habit then just a couple will bring your account below standard - higher fees and risk of permanent suspension. So if you decide to cross-list it's better to do so with slow movers and small volume you can manage. If you can't be \"on\" most of the time then it's better to not cross-list. Perhaps rotating inventory every 2-3 mos between venues is a better option to consider. As for offers - you can end a listing even if there's an active offer. Offers that have not yet been accepted by the other party are neither here nor there with regards to your question. GLORIOUS!

There are no 'rules' to handling listings on multiple platforms, just common sense and familiarity with your markets I use offers, sales, etc. when I want on all platforms, but never on more than one platform at once on the same item - it's just a bit of a failsafe I use. I do some tailoring of items platform to platform because they attract different markets, so I don't have everything running on all platforms but I do have a fair amount. One thing I will say - selling across multiple platforms means you have to stay on top of all of your listings at all times and keep them updated - there is no such thing as 'set it and forget it', so it's better if you're a seller who can engage with your listings on a consistent basis - I mean hourly. I've been on training runs and had to stop when I hear my phone go off to check what sold, and then double check it's off other platforms, then sprint to catch up with my friends. It's not something I would start all at once - cross list a few things. ‚ÄúThe illegal we do immediately, the unconstitutional takes a little longer.‚Äù - Henry Kissinger Fixing things is hard; destroying them is much easier.

What I list on the other sites are items that are restricted or prohibited by eBay, including the VERO companies or items where the scamming risk on eBay is simply too great. I.E. things like cell phones, electronic equipment, coins..... If you cross list as others mentioned it is a constant monitoring process to avoid issues.

Obviously certain types of items don‚Äôt bode well for cross listing, like unique items. It‚Äôs virtually impossible to always have correct inventory counts 24/7 with this method. So first off you need to welcome the chaos and accept that you will only be able to keep your inventory accurate to like the 90th percentile if your product consistently sells. You can see this will be a big problem with eBay because of the out of stock kiss of death. This means you should only cross list items that you know you can always restock at the drop of a hat. You need to also have a pretty good prediction of your sales. You can also significantly overstock the product so it won‚Äôt matter if your inventory is 90% correct because your stock will never hit the danger level thus never going out of stock. Of course this will tie up significant capital as well. That‚Äôs why I said only certain types of product should be cross listed. Ultimately if it becomes too much to handle you can always pull the plug on on platform and spend time to get your ducks in a row again to try to cross list again.

Ive had this question for anwhile and don‚Äôt have anyone to ask. I‚Äôm glad to see there‚Äôs a community here that supports each other. I‚Äôm very new to selling and sincerely enjoy every aspect to it. Eventually, I am considering cross-listing at some point, but then how does sending ‚Äúwatchers‚Äù offers work? Or does it? My thought is you no longer send offers due to the item possibly selling on both platforms. Am I correct in thinking this or am I missing something that could enable me to both cross-list and still send offers? For those who currently cross-list, how has your experience been with this? Do you see noticeable increased sales, in cross listing ,that the offers you would have sent on one platform and ‚Äúhopefully‚Äù would have been accepted are tiny in comparison? In the end, from experience is it a game changer to cross- list? Please be easy with me, it took a lot for me to reach out and ask what may be a silly question. I appreciate you all sharing any valuable knowledge with me. Take care Message 1 of 11 latest reply 1 Helpful Reply All forum topics Previous Topic Next Topic 10 REPLIES 10 Cross-listing? wastingtime101 Superstar (0 feedbacks) View listings Options Mark as New Bookmark Subscribe Mute Subscribe to RSS Feed Permalink Print Report Inappropriate Content ‚Äé04-27-2023 07:30 PM - edited ‚Äé04-27-2023 07:31 PM Hey, welcome @shopmyfinderskeepers. Cross-listing across multiple platforms requires a lot of juggling if you have consistent sales. You have to always be \"on\" - like getting alerts on your phone so as soon as your item sells on one venue you can take down the listing on the other venue. One thing to keep in mind with eBay is the out of stock cancellation is basically the kiss of death. Any account can survive one, but if it's a habit then just a couple will bring your account below standard - higher fees and risk of permanent suspension. So if you decide to cross-list it's better to do so with slow movers and small volume you can manage. If you can't be \"on\" most of the time then it's better to not cross-list. Perhaps rotating inventory every 2-3 mos between venues is a better option to consider. As for offers - you can end a listing even if there's an active offer. Offers that have not yet been accepted by the other party are neither here nor there with regards to your question. GLORIOUS!

There are no 'rules' to handling listings on multiple platforms, just common sense and familiarity with your markets I use offers, sales, etc. when I want on all platforms, but never on more than one platform at once on the same item - it's just a bit of a failsafe I use. I do some tailoring of items platform to platform because they attract different markets, so I don't have everything running on all platforms but I do have a fair amount. One thing I will say - selling across multiple platforms means you have to stay on top of all of your listings at all times and keep them updated - there is no such thing as 'set it and forget it', so it's better if you're a seller who can engage with your listings on a consistent basis - I mean hourly. I've been on training runs and had to stop when I hear my phone go off to check what sold, and then double check it's off other platforms, then sprint to catch up with my friends. It's not something I would start all at once - cross list a few things. ‚ÄúThe illegal we do immediately, the unconstitutional takes a little longer.‚Äù - Henry Kissinger Fixing things is hard; destroying them is much easier.

What I list on the other sites are items that are restricted or prohibited by eBay, including the VERO companies or items where the scamming risk on eBay is simply too great. I.E. things like cell phones, electronic equipment, coins..... If you cross list as others mentioned it is a constant monitoring process to avoid issues.
