  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, let's kick back and take a look at this URL you've got—https://softgen.ai/. Just from the name itself, \"softgen\" kinda gives off a vibe that it’s all about software generation, maybe some AI magic sprinkled in there. So, I’m picturing this site is likely focused on harnessing artificial intelligence to help folks create software more effortlessly. You know, the kind of place where developers or even non-techies can whip up apps or systems without having to dive deep into coding. Essentially, it's like giving a nudge to creativity by using AI to handle the heavy lifting. Now, they might have some tools or platforms that allow users to generate code or design software features in a super user-friendly way. Imagine a drag-and-drop interface where you can mold your ideas into a functional app without breaking a sweat. It’s like having a coding buddy but way cooler because this buddy is super fast and doesn’t get tired. Also, it wouldn’t be surprising if they offered some resources or tutorials for those looking to improve their skills or understand the tech behind the scenes. They could have a blog or a section dedicated to the latest trends in AI and software development—keeping everyone in the loop, you know? And hey, considering \"AI\" is in the domain name, they might also be showcasing some cutting-edge stuff, like machine learning models or algorithms that help optimize software processes. Maybe they have pre-built solutions that can match certain business needs, making it easier for startups and entrepreneurs to get their projects off the ground without needing a full tech team from day one. You could totally see them tailoring services for different industries—like healthcare, finance, or e-commerce—because let’s face it, every sector is looking for that sweet software solution to streamline their operations or connect better with customers. It’s just a hunch, but they might even have a community aspect to the site, encouraging users to share their experiences or projects. Forums or feedback sections could create a hub where ideas are exchanged, and you get to vibe with other creators. Collaboration is key in tech, right? And let’s not forget about the visuals! I bet they've got a slick, modern design going on—maybe some cool animations and graphics that make it feel fresh and engaging. You want users to feel inspired when they visit, not bogged down by a boring old interface. So, in a nutshell, I’d say softgen.ai is probably a chill spot for anyone looking to dive into the world of software with a bit of AI flair. Whether you're a seasoned coder or just a curious individual looking to explore how tech can spawn new creations, this site might just be the place to check out. Cheers to the future of coding and creativity, my friend!",

A weekly newsletter covering AI trends, ideas, business breakdowns and how companies are using it internally. Subscribe to PRO I spent many years of my life wanting to build stuff on the internet. I tried to learn to code several times and just kept hitting blockers. So I built stuff with what we now call ‘no-code tools’. I pushed the limits by building things like Airbnb without code, Instagram and other things. People asked how I was doing it, so that became my startup, Makerpad—a no-code tutorial platform. Those who can’t do, teach… I sold it to Zapier in March 2021 and now, AI has entered the chat. Anyone can use AI to generate code to build applications but there are still blockers. So I asked several folks how AI has enabled them to use code for real-life projects and use cases. Thank you to everyone for their contributions! Here is how I broke this down: The journey from not being able to code, starting coding with AI, and building more complex projects A mini-interview with Charlie, who built a Chrome extension in 45 mins with AI 3 steps on how to learn to code with AI Examples of others who’ve built projects with AI-generated code A potential curriculum to help you learn to code with AI Resources to help you How you can build an app with AI-generated code Tips for others looking to use AI to write code Trying to code before AI One of the issues of starting to code is learning and maintaining those skills in a timeframe where distractions won’t take over. Starting 100 days of Python to drop off on day 4 because I wasn’t moving quickly enough, I hadn’t learnt how to build a full project or other work got in the way, is just too common. It's happened a lot. Prioritisation of learning this new skill vs doing work I already know is tough. Leaning towards tools or workflows I already figured out takes away from time spent learning to code. It's like being a guitar player and deciding to learn the piano. You have a sense of music, rhythm, and melody, but you have to start with simple tunes and scales to master the new instrument. Sometimes the specific course, learning format or not even knowing which course is best is enough to put people off. And sometimes life just gets in the way. Having kids, going to college, a new job, a new house, a new relationship etc. It feels like there needed to be a bigger NEED to learn. You still need to learn to code,\" is a too linear way of thinking. For a lot of people, this isn't just the way to learn. My perspective: Coding with GPT-4 is actually a way of learning code itself. I've had the ambition to learn to code for years, but I struggled to commit to a course, remember info, and maintaining focus. Now I can come up with project ideas and take small steps to bring them to life! The process is slow, countless hours chatting, but it's a a way of learning itself. I make stuff to learn, instead of learning to make. -Melle I've always been more of a project builder and idea executor rather than a coder. Throughout my career, I've made several attempts to learn programming. Although I got basic knowledge in C++ and HTML during my studies, I never managed to maintain consistent learning progress. There was always something more pressing than achieving this personal goal. Perhaps I never prioritized it enough against other objectives. Fran I always wanted to make games, and started writing QuickBasic ones at age 11 or so. Then somehow decided I need to learn Assembly, which felt way too hard and made me feel stooopid :)...Teenage years kinda wiped out coding interest for music/romance/theater Fabian I'm non-technical, did a super-basic Python course and saw that it was extremely boring because you're not able to do anything interesting until you're advanced. So I try to follow this process: -Pick a topic -Discuss it wit ChatGPT -Ask ChatGPT to create a solution -Iterative process copy-pasting -See if I have gaps and ask it to explain how it works/what I need to know -Adrian I used to take \"how to code\" courses and shortly forget the details after finishing the course. With ai I feel super empowered - as long as I understand the core (loops, classes, functions and etc) I can go a long way without caring about the details. I now need to think more about high level system design and architecture vs lines of code. Adarsh i started my journey as a nocoder. my coding up until AI was limited to snippets here and there across various platforms. i built the prototype for http://mobiusplatform.com.au using nocode tools, validated, then built a customer facing tool using custom code (outsourced). Zachary Perhaps these feel familiar. Starting to code with AI That need still has to be there but it’s easier to pick up writing code, thanks to AI. Previously writing a script felt like a mammoth task which can now be done in seconds using ChatGPT. The problem is no longer writing code, but understanding what it does and what to do with it. And needs change when the way with which to get there becomes easier. Using a no-code tool to build something still requires you to build the thing and takes time to learn the platform, test it, tweak it, and so on. But there comes a time when off-the-shelf tools don’t cut it or don’t make sense. It’s not simple to build Chrome extensions or Google App Scripts with no-code tools. And sometimes you just need a script to do a job for you, or you want to work with an API. Personal projects often get so far that you want to take them further, adding features. It sparks your curiosity about what else you could build. Note: This is why I always pushed for learning no-code tools first, you figure out what it takes to build something, test and tweak it then launch it. You learn a lot about the process and oftentimes you want to go the extra mile, which often means, learning to code. My journey into coding with AI began out of necessity. I was intrigued by the challenge of developing a Google Chrome extension – something no-code couldn't help me with. I tried learning the basic programming stack required but didn't succeed. However, the advent of GPT-4 changed everything. I wanted to see if I could create my Chrome extension with its help. The moment I published it, clicked on it, and saw it working was nothing short of magical. Fran When GPT-3 davinci-002 became available in the very early beta, I realized it was actually incredible at writing code. I gave it the openAI API documentation and some random snippet of code for Google App script and asked it to write an integration of the API into Google Sheets - completion-style, aka \"Here's an example of how to integrate GPT-3 into a Google App Script so it becomes available within a Google Sheet\". [The twitter post] That worked and gave me a first no-code environment for chaining prompts inside of Google Sheets, which eventually became the earliest prototype of what I'm now building with glif.app Fabian Projects at work can be a great motivator to pick up coding. You come across a thousand problems that could ‘just be solved if I could code’. And collaborating with developers on your team becomes much easier. It could improve an internal process or something that benefits end users. I built a text-to-SQL product at Uber for 1 department initially. This went well. I first got familiar with basic concepts like loops, lists and etc. then i would prompt gpt on how i could solve a problem. by asking gpt and repeatedly asking questions i got to learn about various search algos. I would then ask it to write code for me and would implement it in my jupyter notebook. from there i would modify it and play around with it on my own. I would then handoff prototypes to the backend engineer to implement in production. this kept us moving fast and didnt require me to think too much about writing good, efficient elegant code. Adarsh Personal projects are another great motivator. Everyone thinks they have a $Bn app idea but starting small is much easier to stomach and you learn the process of building and shipping something. You could build something for your friends, partner, roommates or kids to generate bedtime stories, come up with meal plans or organise trips. A side project where I was getting bedtime stories written for my daughter. Cagri Story Generator in Any Style inside of Google Sheets: Fabian And you need to think of bringing in AI at the right moment, instead of expecting it to spit out the perfect app from one prompt. ChatGPT is a muse, not an article. The moment for chat to get involved is not when the app is fully formed. Instead of going to ChatGPT with the perfectly formed app idea and having it generate it in one go, bring it in early. Think of how you would bring in an engineer early to the process, the more context they build up and more they can contribute to the idea. Where ChatGPT isn’t as good yet is figuring out how difficult is the thing you’re trying to build—you often get stuck where a senior engineer would’ve told you it was too difficult. -Geoffrey Building more complex projects Once the lightbulb moment has happened, further iterating on what started as a simple project or embarking on new ones becomes less daunting. I am working on the same project now but focus is now on RAG since scaling it to the entire company depends on the quality of the search. This has led me to learn a lot about other search algos such as tf-idf. I also work on personal projects now which include both front end and back end coding. I am focusing on backend and using gpt as my frontend engineer. Adarsh Since then, AI has become a crucial component in my project development, working alongside no-code tools. I've been able to break down barriers that seemed insurmountable just a few months prior. Today, I use AI in almost every aspect of project creation. Thanks to AI, I can effortlessly create and link tools with various APIs, develop advanced formulas for Coda or Airtable, write JavaScript for Webflow, code for Pipedream nodes, and even design small graphical interfaces. The limits I faced before in creation have significantly diminished, turning 'low code' from a friction point into a powerful enabler. Fran On Glif itself, it's trivial to build virtually any of the solopreneur AI apps you're seeing on the web within a few minutes and without code. In terms of more complex stuff I now build all my prompt chains inside of glif and use our API to integrate across other apps I'm building and hosting via replit - building lots and lots of weekend apps, like this clicker game that turns random Wikipedia articles into dreamworlds you can explore:https://latentdream.replit.app/Also, I am actively contributing to glif features via a specific glif block that lets me integrate any API I need - the code for these is often run via val.town and I use GPT-4 to have it write the integration that I can then just use inside of glifs. Fabian A mini-interview: How Charlie Ward built a functioning Chrome Extension in 10 steps and 45 minutes, with no coding experience. Using ChatGPT + Replit - what's been your experience trying to code before AI? Before GPT-4 came out, I’d never shipped anything myself. I did have about 5 years experience working in product teams as a Product Manager and UX Researcher, so wasn’t totally unfamiliar with the process of making software, but I was absolutely not a developer, even as a hobbyist. - how did you start using code with AI? I noticed others (like Joe Perkins) tweeting about what they’d managed to create using ChatGPT and GPT-4. So I thought I’d give it a go myself. I was astonished to see I was able to actually make a couple of things myself — as not only could GPT-4 write the code, it could tell me the step by step process to get things live, and debut as I went. - what did you make early on?

A weekly newsletter covering AI trends, ideas, business breakdowns and how companies are using it internally. Subscribe to PRO I spent many years of my life wanting to build stuff on the internet. I tried to learn to code several times and just kept hitting blockers. So I built stuff with what we now call ‘no-code tools’. I pushed the limits by building things like Airbnb without code, Instagram and other things. People asked how I was doing it, so that became my startup, Makerpad—a no-code tutorial platform. Those who can’t do, teach… I sold it to Zapier in March 2021 and now, AI has entered the chat. Anyone can use AI to generate code to build applications but there are still blockers. So I asked several folks how AI has enabled them to use code for real-life projects and use cases. Thank you to everyone for their contributions! Here is how I broke this down: The journey from not being able to code, starting coding with AI, and building more complex projects A mini-interview with Charlie, who built a Chrome extension in 45 mins with AI 3 steps on how to learn to code with AI Examples of others who’ve built projects with AI-generated code A potential curriculum to help you learn to code with AI Resources to help you How you can build an app with AI-generated code Tips for others looking to use AI to write code Trying to code before AI One of the issues of starting to code is learning and maintaining those skills in a timeframe where distractions won’t take over. Starting 100 days of Python to drop off on day 4 because I wasn’t moving quickly enough, I hadn’t learnt how to build a full project or other work got in the way, is just too common. It's happened a lot. Prioritisation of learning this new skill vs doing work I already know is tough. Leaning towards tools or workflows I already figured out takes away from time spent learning to code. It's like being a guitar player and deciding to learn the piano. You have a sense of music, rhythm, and melody, but you have to start with simple tunes and scales to master the new instrument. Sometimes the specific course, learning format or not even knowing which course is best is enough to put people off. And sometimes life just gets in the way. Having kids, going to college, a new job, a new house, a new relationship etc. It feels like there needed to be a bigger NEED to learn. You still need to learn to code,\" is a too linear way of thinking. For a lot of people, this isn't just the way to learn. My perspective: Coding with GPT-4 is actually a way of learning code itself. I've had the ambition to learn to code for years, but I struggled to commit to a course, remember info, and maintaining focus. Now I can come up with project ideas and take small steps to bring them to life! The process is slow, countless hours chatting, but it's a a way of learning itself. I make stuff to learn, instead of learning to make. -Melle I've always been more of a project builder and idea executor rather than a coder. Throughout my career, I've made several attempts to learn programming. Although I got basic knowledge in C++ and HTML during my studies, I never managed to maintain consistent learning progress. There was always something more pressing than achieving this personal goal. Perhaps I never prioritized it enough against other objectives. Fran I always wanted to make games, and started writing QuickBasic ones at age 11 or so. Then somehow decided I need to learn Assembly, which felt way too hard and made me feel stooopid :)...Teenage years kinda wiped out coding interest for music/romance/theater Fabian I'm non-technical, did a super-basic Python course and saw that it was extremely boring because you're not able to do anything interesting until you're advanced. So I try to follow this process: -Pick a topic -Discuss it wit ChatGPT -Ask ChatGPT to create a solution -Iterative process copy-pasting -See if I have gaps and ask it to explain how it works/what I need to know -Adrian I used to take \"how to code\" courses and shortly forget the details after finishing the course. With ai I feel super empowered - as long as I understand the core (loops, classes, functions and etc) I can go a long way without caring about the details. I now need to think more about high level system design and architecture vs lines of code. Adarsh i started my journey as a nocoder. my coding up until AI was limited to snippets here and there across various platforms. i built the prototype for http://mobiusplatform.com.au using nocode tools, validated, then built a customer facing tool using custom code (outsourced). Zachary Perhaps these feel familiar. Starting to code with AI That need still has to be there but it’s easier to pick up writing code, thanks to AI. Previously writing a script felt like a mammoth task which can now be done in seconds using ChatGPT. The problem is no longer writing code, but understanding what it does and what to do with it. And needs change when the way with which to get there becomes easier. Using a no-code tool to build something still requires you to build the thing and takes time to learn the platform, test it, tweak it, and so on. But there comes a time when off-the-shelf tools don’t cut it or don’t make sense. It’s not simple to build Chrome extensions or Google App Scripts with no-code tools. And sometimes you just need a script to do a job for you, or you want to work with an API. Personal projects often get so far that you want to take them further, adding features. It sparks your curiosity about what else you could build. Note: This is why I always pushed for learning no-code tools first, you figure out what it takes to build something, test and tweak it then launch it. You learn a lot about the process and oftentimes you want to go the extra mile, which often means, learning to code. My journey into coding with AI began out of necessity. I was intrigued by the challenge of developing a Google Chrome extension – something no-code couldn't help me with. I tried learning the basic programming stack required but didn't succeed. However, the advent of GPT-4 changed everything. I wanted to see if I could create my Chrome extension with its help. The moment I published it, clicked on it, and saw it working was nothing short of magical. Fran When GPT-3 davinci-002 became available in the very early beta, I realized it was actually incredible at writing code. I gave it the openAI API documentation and some random snippet of code for Google App script and asked it to write an integration of the API into Google Sheets - completion-style, aka \"Here's an example of how to integrate GPT-3 into a Google App Script so it becomes available within a Google Sheet\". [The twitter post] That worked and gave me a first no-code environment for chaining prompts inside of Google Sheets, which eventually became the earliest prototype of what I'm now building with glif.app Fabian Projects at work can be a great motivator to pick up coding. You come across a thousand problems that could ‘just be solved if I could code’. And collaborating with developers on your team becomes much easier. It could improve an internal process or something that benefits end users. I built a text-to-SQL product at Uber for 1 department initially. This went well. I first got familiar with basic concepts like loops, lists and etc. then i would prompt gpt on how i could solve a problem. by asking gpt and repeatedly asking questions i got to learn about various search algos. I would then ask it to write code for me and would implement it in my jupyter notebook. from there i would modify it and play around with it on my own. I would then handoff prototypes to the backend engineer to implement in production. this kept us moving fast and didnt require me to think too much about writing good, efficient elegant code. Adarsh Personal projects are another great motivator. Everyone thinks they have a $Bn app idea but starting small is much easier to stomach and you learn the process of building and shipping something. You could build something for your friends, partner, roommates or kids to generate bedtime stories, come up with meal plans or organise trips. A side project where I was getting bedtime stories written for my daughter. Cagri Story Generator in Any Style inside of Google Sheets: Fabian And you need to think of bringing in AI at the right moment, instead of expecting it to spit out the perfect app from one prompt. ChatGPT is a muse, not an article. The moment for chat to get involved is not when the app is fully formed. Instead of going to ChatGPT with the perfectly formed app idea and having it generate it in one go, bring it in early. Think of how you would bring in an engineer early to the process, the more context they build up and more they can contribute to the idea. Where ChatGPT isn’t as good yet is figuring out how difficult is the thing you’re trying to build—you often get stuck where a senior engineer would’ve told you it was too difficult. -Geoffrey Building more complex projects Once the lightbulb moment has happened, further iterating on what started as a simple project or embarking on new ones becomes less daunting. I am working on the same project now but focus is now on RAG since scaling it to the entire company depends on the quality of the search. This has led me to learn a lot about other search algos such as tf-idf. I also work on personal projects now which include both front end and back end coding. I am focusing on backend and using gpt as my frontend engineer. Adarsh Since then, AI has become a crucial component in my project development, working alongside no-code tools. I've been able to break down barriers that seemed insurmountable just a few months prior. Today, I use AI in almost every aspect of project creation. Thanks to AI, I can effortlessly create and link tools with various APIs, develop advanced formulas for Coda or Airtable, write JavaScript for Webflow, code for Pipedream nodes, and even design small graphical interfaces. The limits I faced before in creation have significantly diminished, turning 'low code' from a friction point into a powerful enabler. Fran On Glif itself, it's trivial to build virtually any of the solopreneur AI apps you're seeing on the web within a few minutes and without code. In terms of more complex stuff I now build all my prompt chains inside of glif and use our API to integrate across other apps I'm building and hosting via replit - building lots and lots of weekend apps, like this clicker game that turns random Wikipedia articles into dreamworlds you can explore:https://latentdream.replit.app/Also, I am actively contributing to glif features via a specific glif block that lets me integrate any API I need - the code for these is often run via val.town and I use GPT-4 to have it write the integration that I can then just use inside of glifs. Fabian A mini-interview: How Charlie Ward built a functioning Chrome Extension in 10 steps and 45 minutes, with no coding experience. Using ChatGPT + Replit - what's been your experience trying to code before AI? Before GPT-4 came out, I’d never shipped anything myself. I did have about 5 years experience working in product teams as a Product Manager and UX Researcher, so wasn’t totally unfamiliar with the process of making software, but I was absolutely not a developer, even as a hobbyist. - how did you start using code with AI? I noticed others (like Joe Perkins) tweeting about what they’d managed to create using ChatGPT and GPT-4. So I thought I’d give it a go myself. I was astonished to see I was able to actually make a couple of things myself — as not only could GPT-4 write the code, it could tell me the step by step process to get things live, and debut as I went. - what did you make early on? Within a week, I went from never having shipped anything (on my own), to having published: Marketing Quotes: A free Chrome Extension where with each new tab, it displays a randomised, famous marketing quote (from a list I provided). Ramen Shop: An internet radio player playing lo-fi beats in an anime ramen shop.

General Discussion Recently just had a meeting regarding the product design and coding. People from other fields overestimate the capability of AI. They think it will code the design into HTML and call it a day. But the reality is that software engineers spend more time thinking about the system design, code structure, and architect than writing the CSS code. Even if the AI code looks fine, It will break the code structure and patterns. We'll end up spending more time refining the AI code. Read more postman • Promoted Great APIs aren't made alone.

Let's... For the sake of argument... Pretend that ai reaches the lofty dreams Wall Street has for it. It is effective in generating full stack solutions and greatly reduces the head count needed on dev teams. If it can do that, a job that I would argue is much more complex than many other white collar positions, then doesn't it stand to reason that it would also take out a long list of other careers before it gets there? Accounting, Marketing, Financial Advisors, etc... It's odd to me that developers and semi truck drivers seem to be the only people in the ai hot seat during these conversations. I can't take people seriously when they discuss it. Then you will hear all about how safe trade / blue collar jobs are usually from some other dumb ass. Really? Again... Assuming this dooms day prophecy holds true and there is a mass reset - tons of white collar careers wiped out of existence. Where will all those people flood to? What kind of jobs will all new graduates flock to? That answer in this hypothetical is anywhere that will have them. If this Sci Fi movie happens the way big business wants it to happen then no careers are safe.

People who don't program think programming is hard because programming languages don't look like English. If you can describe what you want in plain English, surely you won't need programmers anymore. Right? Of course not. Anyone who has ever programmed seriously knows that plain language is way too nuanced to describe what a program should do. Programming is a lot more about making sense of conflicting requirements and making the right trade-offs than it is about writing code. Programming is both a much more human and a much more logical task than people believe.

General Discussion Recently just had a meeting regarding the product design and coding. People from other fields overestimate the capability of AI. They think it will code the design into HTML and call it a day. But the reality is that software engineers spend more time thinking about the system design, code structure, and architect than writing the CSS code. Even if the AI code looks fine, It will break the code structure and patterns. We'll end up spending more time refining the AI code. Read more postman • Promoted Great APIs aren't made alone.

Let's... For the sake of argument... Pretend that ai reaches the lofty dreams Wall Street has for it. It is effective in generating full stack solutions and greatly reduces the head count needed on dev teams. If it can do that, a job that I would argue is much more complex than many other white collar positions, then doesn't it stand to reason that it would also take out a long list of other careers before it gets there? Accounting, Marketing, Financial Advisors, etc... It's odd to me that developers and semi truck drivers seem to be the only people in the ai hot seat during these conversations. I can't take people seriously when they discuss it. Then you will hear all about how safe trade / blue collar jobs are usually from some other dumb ass. Really? Again... Assuming this dooms day prophecy holds true and there is a mass reset - tons of white collar careers wiped out of existence. Where will all those people flood to? What kind of jobs will all new graduates flock to? That answer in this hypothetical is anywhere that will have them. If this Sci Fi movie happens the way big business wants it to happen then no careers are safe.

People who don't program think programming is hard because programming languages don't look like English. If you can describe what you want in plain English, surely you won't need programmers anymore. Right? Of course not. Anyone who has ever programmed seriously knows that plain language is way too nuanced to describe what a program should do. Programming is a lot more about making sense of conflicting requirements and making the right trade-offs than it is about writing code. Programming is both a much more human and a much more logical task than people believe.

You can fill in the finer details of the classes yourself, but AI can save you from some of the grunt work. I just wouldn't use AI to do anything more complicated than that.

A weekly newsletter covering AI trends, ideas, business breakdowns and how companies are using it internally. I wrote a series of posts like this as an experiment. Now I’ve launched Ben’s Bites Pro. If you find these posts valuable, consider subscribing. AI coding is exploding. search volume for ‘AI coding’ The biggest player here is Github Copilot. search volume for ‘Github Copilot’ GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, significantly impacts developer productivity: Early adopters reported up to 20% productivity improvements. A survey of 2,000 developers by GitHub showed that 88% claimed to be more productive using the tool. A test showed that those using GitHub Copilot were 55% faster and had a 7% higher completion rate among 95 developers. Within the first year on the market, nearly 30% of code suggestions were accepted by users. GitHub Copilot benefits less experienced developers more. Duolingo saw a 25% boost in developer velocity with GitHub Copilot. A study found that Copilot integration increased PRs by 10.6% and reduced cycle time by 3.5 hours. According to an Akvelon survey, one-third of participants reported GitHub Copilot’s suggestions had an 80% accuracy rate. GitHub Copilot Chat accelerated code reviews by 15%. About 70% of participants accepted reviewer comments using GitHub Copilot Chat. Developers felt more confident when they used GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat. They stated that coding became easier, less error-prone, more readable, more reusable, more concise, more maintainable, and more resilient than coding without it. It’s had such a profound impact on GitHub’s platform that it is now the foundation for the next era of GitHub (the AI-powered developer platform). Here’s what some users told me: It's bundled with my code editor and it was the first real AI product released. It helps me write code faster. It also often helps me \"remember\" things that I would otherwise have to Google. It's deeply embedded in my workflow which is very important. I don't have to switch from my code editor to a browser. More importantly, it has context of my code and auto completes. Sounds trivial but this saves SO much time. I tried Cursor for a bit. I totally see the benefit because in addition to auto complete you get a prompt box that is embedded. I think I stopped using it because of a UI bug. I will probably try again at some point. And another: We were already using GitHub for storing our web projects as we are a Wordpress developer. We’ve created our own repository of reusable backed settings and components and then slice a new front end with each client. GitHub copilot has made our coding so much faster and can recall complex variables and conditional logic that we often times mess up and have to fix in QA which is way more expensive. It’s been a phenomenal tool. New kid on the code block; Cursor search volume for ‘cursor ai’ Cursor is an AI-powered code editor based on VSCode with several features: One-Click Migration from VSCode: Cursor.sh is a VSCode fork that lets users import extensions, themes, and keybindings easily with a single click. AI-Powered Editing Capabilities Pair-Programming with AI Privacy and Code Security: Emphasizing privacy, Cursor.sh ensures user code isn’t stored on its servers or logs in privacy mode. Integration of Modern Development Tools: The platform supports modern development tools such as LSP, GitHub Copilot, Vim keybindings, and Remote SSH. People LOVE it. Just check the Twitter shoutouts on their homepage. Here’s what some users I spoke to had to say: Best feature is command+k to edit a selected portion of code. I use that to add features to a react component all the time. Second best feature is the “AI fix in chat” button when there is an error. Those two account for 80% of the value for me, the rest is probably just easy access to ChatGPT inside my editor. I don’t have any numbers but I bet I am 20% more efficient and effective as an engineer. Helps to resolve issues faster, but you have to keep the brain switched on anyway. At least 20% faster development, you are not left alone with blockers. You still have to combine it with Github Copilot, which would be +$10 per month, it's not a substitution like somebody says. It's sidebar chat and inline chat is very good. From testing it against Co-pilot chat in VSCode it far outperforms it and grasps exactly what you are looking for quicker. One of the underrated features is when you get a pylint or typescript error, you can quickly get context of exactly what is causing it as sometimes it's not always obvious. If you are coming from VSCode it's as if nothing changed. The key difference you have super powers now with AI! The onboarding is very clever, when I was doing it, it had you generate a game using chat. Before using Cursor I used Visual Studio Code with Github CoPilot. I still use CoPilot within Cursor as it has certain functionality Cursor is lacking. However, Cursor seems to be iterating more aggressively on their AI features so I will keep using them unless something better comes along! If ChatGPT didn't exist then Cursor would be a complete game-changer. Given that ChatGPT does exist, and I'm a paying user, I'd say that Cursor is a very nice-to-have and helps me squeeze out perhaps an extra 10% efficiency as a developer… Using Cursor has increased my coding velocity by at least 50% if not 100%. I almost never visit StackOverflow and visit Google about 1/4 of the time. I get unstuck much quicker and I don't have to worry about creating as much boilerplate code as I used to. As someone with a low attention span I find it easier to stay on track and focussed as Cursor is able to quickly answer any questions or help me scaffold out the otherwise boring parts of some of the code I need to create. cmd+K inline diff workflow is AMAZING writes 90% of my code now. I do 90% of my job in this app. Use it 5+ days a week. I'm at least 2-5x faster at my job than a year ago when combining with chatGPT Nothing comes close to cmd+k workflow Cursor is the best tool for working an in actual enterprise scale codebase. Invaluable. The themes here (and from the other reviews I received) are: AI-Powered Editing and Pair Programming: Many users appreciate Cursor’s AI features, especially the Command+K function for editing and the AI chat for debugging and coding help. Ease of Transition from VS Code: Users often note how easily they switch from VS Code to Cursor, as it’s a fork of VS Code. They value the familiar interface and functionality, coupled with the seamless importing of VS Code settings and extensions.. Pricing and OpenAI API Integration: The pricing structure welcomes the option to use one’s own OpenAI API key, offering flexibility that lets users manage costs and broadens software accessibility. Concerns about Privacy and Transparency: Users express concerns about privacy and transparency, particularly about data sharing and usage. They worry about the software’s permissions and its access to GitHub accounts. Overall Productivity and Efficiency Gains: Reviews consistently report major gains in coding efficiency and productivity. Users develop quicker, rely less on resources like StackOverflow, and improve their problem-solving skills. Some other notable companies in this space: Replit AI - Your AI partner in code. Harness the power of Replit’s AI to boost your productivity and creativity. Built into the world's most popular online IDE. Factory (I’m an investor) - Autonomous software engineering. “While many AI tools focus on helping individual developers write lines of code with autocomplete, Factory is focused on fully automating organization-wide processes.” Cosine (I’m an investor) - Your AI co-developer. Cosine understands your codebase better than you do. Ask any question about your codebase, get explanations about any feature and get suggestions about how to write new code. The Opportunity Coding is becoming faster and simpler. Yet, a significant gap exists for those who can’t code (like me). I love the idea of writing less code (I built and sold a startup on this theme). But I still need coding knowledge to start. A course designed for coding with AI tools. A newsletter that gives you examples of mini-exercises. Advent of AI, anyone? A Duolingo-style app for teaching coding with AI.

A weekly newsletter covering AI trends, ideas, business breakdowns and how companies are using it internally. I wrote a series of posts like this as an experiment. Now I’ve launched Ben’s Bites Pro. If you find these posts valuable, consider subscribing. AI coding is exploding. search volume for ‘AI coding’ The biggest player here is Github Copilot. search volume for ‘Github Copilot’ GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, significantly impacts developer productivity: Early adopters reported up to 20% productivity improvements. A survey of 2,000 developers by GitHub showed that 88% claimed to be more productive using the tool. A test showed that those using GitHub Copilot were 55% faster and had a 7% higher completion rate among 95 developers. Within the first year on the market, nearly 30% of code suggestions were accepted by users. GitHub Copilot benefits less experienced developers more. Duolingo saw a 25% boost in developer velocity with GitHub Copilot. A study found that Copilot integration increased PRs by 10.6% and reduced cycle time by 3.5 hours. According to an Akvelon survey, one-third of participants reported GitHub Copilot’s suggestions had an 80% accuracy rate. GitHub Copilot Chat accelerated code reviews by 15%. About 70% of participants accepted reviewer comments using GitHub Copilot Chat. Developers felt more confident when they used GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat. They stated that coding became easier, less error-prone, more readable, more reusable, more concise, more maintainable, and more resilient than coding without it. It’s had such a profound impact on GitHub’s platform that it is now the foundation for the next era of GitHub (the AI-powered developer platform). Here’s what some users told me: It's bundled with my code editor and it was the first real AI product released. It helps me write code faster. It also often helps me \"remember\" things that I would otherwise have to Google. It's deeply embedded in my workflow which is very important. I don't have to switch from my code editor to a browser. More importantly, it has context of my code and auto completes. Sounds trivial but this saves SO much time. I tried Cursor for a bit. I totally see the benefit because in addition to auto complete you get a prompt box that is embedded. I think I stopped using it because of a UI bug. I will probably try again at some point. And another: We were already using GitHub for storing our web projects as we are a Wordpress developer. We’ve created our own repository of reusable backed settings and components and then slice a new front end with each client. GitHub copilot has made our coding so much faster and can recall complex variables and conditional logic that we often times mess up and have to fix in QA which is way more expensive. It’s been a phenomenal tool. New kid on the code block; Cursor search volume for ‘cursor ai’ Cursor is an AI-powered code editor based on VSCode with several features: One-Click Migration from VSCode: Cursor.sh is a VSCode fork that lets users import extensions, themes, and keybindings easily with a single click. AI-Powered Editing Capabilities Pair-Programming with AI Privacy and Code Security: Emphasizing privacy, Cursor.sh ensures user code isn’t stored on its servers or logs in privacy mode. Integration of Modern Development Tools: The platform supports modern development tools such as LSP, GitHub Copilot, Vim keybindings, and Remote SSH. People LOVE it. Just check the Twitter shoutouts on their homepage. Here’s what some users I spoke to had to say: Best feature is command+k to edit a selected portion of code. I use that to add features to a react component all the time. Second best feature is the “AI fix in chat” button when there is an error. Those two account for 80% of the value for me, the rest is probably just easy access to ChatGPT inside my editor. I don’t have any numbers but I bet I am 20% more efficient and effective as an engineer. Helps to resolve issues faster, but you have to keep the brain switched on anyway. At least 20% faster development, you are not left alone with blockers. You still have to combine it with Github Copilot, which would be +$10 per month, it's not a substitution like somebody says. It's sidebar chat and inline chat is very good. From testing it against Co-pilot chat in VSCode it far outperforms it and grasps exactly what you are looking for quicker. One of the underrated features is when you get a pylint or typescript error, you can quickly get context of exactly what is causing it as sometimes it's not always obvious. If you are coming from VSCode it's as if nothing changed. The key difference you have super powers now with AI! The onboarding is very clever, when I was doing it, it had you generate a game using chat. Before using Cursor I used Visual Studio Code with Github CoPilot. I still use CoPilot within Cursor as it has certain functionality Cursor is lacking. However, Cursor seems to be iterating more aggressively on their AI features so I will keep using them unless something better comes along! If ChatGPT didn't exist then Cursor would be a complete game-changer. Given that ChatGPT does exist, and I'm a paying user, I'd say that Cursor is a very nice-to-have and helps me squeeze out perhaps an extra 10% efficiency as a developer… Using Cursor has increased my coding velocity by at least 50% if not 100%. I almost never visit StackOverflow and visit Google about 1/4 of the time. I get unstuck much quicker and I don't have to worry about creating as much boilerplate code as I used to. As someone with a low attention span I find it easier to stay on track and focussed as Cursor is able to quickly answer any questions or help me scaffold out the otherwise boring parts of some of the code I need to create. cmd+K inline diff workflow is AMAZING writes 90% of my code now. I do 90% of my job in this app. Use it 5+ days a week. I'm at least 2-5x faster at my job than a year ago when combining with chatGPT Nothing comes close to cmd+k workflow Cursor is the best tool for working an in actual enterprise scale codebase. Invaluable. The themes here (and from the other reviews I received) are: AI-Powered Editing and Pair Programming: Many users appreciate Cursor’s AI features, especially the Command+K function for editing and the AI chat for debugging and coding help. Ease of Transition from VS Code: Users often note how easily they switch from VS Code to Cursor, as it’s a fork of VS Code. They value the familiar interface and functionality, coupled with the seamless importing of VS Code settings and extensions.. Pricing and OpenAI API Integration: The pricing structure welcomes the option to use one’s own OpenAI API key, offering flexibility that lets users manage costs and broadens software accessibility. Concerns about Privacy and Transparency: Users express concerns about privacy and transparency, particularly about data sharing and usage. They worry about the software’s permissions and its access to GitHub accounts. Overall Productivity and Efficiency Gains: Reviews consistently report major gains in coding efficiency and productivity. Users develop quicker, rely less on resources like StackOverflow, and improve their problem-solving skills. Some other notable companies in this space: Replit AI - Your AI partner in code. Harness the power of Replit’s AI to boost your productivity and creativity. Built into the world's most popular online IDE. Factory (I’m an investor) - Autonomous software engineering. “While many AI tools focus on helping individual developers write lines of code with autocomplete, Factory is focused on fully automating organization-wide processes.” Cosine (I’m an investor) - Your AI co-developer. Cosine understands your codebase better than you do. Ask any question about your codebase, get explanations about any feature and get suggestions about how to write new code. The Opportunity Coding is becoming faster and simpler. Yet, a significant gap exists for those who can’t code (like me). I love the idea of writing less code (I built and sold a startup on this theme). But I still need coding knowledge to start. A course designed for coding with AI tools. A newsletter that gives you examples of mini-exercises. Advent of AI, anyone? A Duolingo-style app for teaching coding with AI.

Perplexity, by contrast, offers useful summary briefings on any topic you want to learn about, with relevant citations, so you can dig deeper into original sources. How I use it: To get up to speed quickly on concepts, people or topics that are new to me, for both work and leisure interests. Also for product comparisons, to educate myself on cultural trends with helpful citations, and to find useful sources for context on historical events. Read more: My take on how to make the most of Perplexity NotebookLM 📓 Apply AI to research Why this is a winner: Draw connections between up to 50 files and documents that relate to a project you’re working on. NotebookLM has a huge context window so you can upload millions of words for each project, much more than you can add on other platforms. You get helpful insights with citations to help you return to relevant sections of your documents. An example of how I use it: I created a notebook for my Readwise highlights, which includes the passages I’ve marked in my Kindle books, online articles I’ve highlighted, and podcasts I’ve listened to with Snipd. Now I can query my own highlights on my favorite passages from the past decade to gain insight about material that’s resonated with me. Streamline Collaboration Fathom 🎥 Sum up meetings with AI Why this is a winner: Following up on dozens of meetings is hard. Fathom makes it easy by giving you great summaries of any online gathering. You get both a summary and a timecoded transcript so you can jump directly to key moments in your recording. Other strengths: It’s easy to set up by linking it to your calendar. That enables it to join your Zooms. Afterwards you can send other attendees a link to the summary. You can auto-request approval so no one is surprised by having an AI present. If you ever don’t want it there, it’s easy to remove or turn off. You can even mark highlights during the meeting with a button click. I still use the free version — it’s so good you may not need to pay. How I use it: To summarize and return to important points in internal and external meetings, and to record and share live workshops and events I host. Good alternatives: Supernormal is great for transcribing and summarizing meetings, alerting you to follow-up tasks from those meetings, and allowing you to expand on important points in the summary. Granola is great for allowing AI to flesh out your own meeting notes. Claude Projects 📂 Apply AI to ongoing work Why this is a winner: Most AI chatbots focus on standalone queries. You ask for input once. Then you start over later with a new prompt. But my work — and I’m guessing at least some of yours — often stretches out over days or weeks, requiring multiple related steps. How it works: Claude Projects allows me to upload relevant documents and give it specific instructions for each project I’m working on. It then gives me helpful ideas and analysis, provides useful editing suggestions, and helps me think through problems. How I use it: I like having a digital assistant for ongoing or repetitive work. It helps me when I get stuck or confused. It also comes in handy when I’m filling out repetitive forms or preparing to facilitate book discussions. Read more: Here’s my overview, with detailed examples and features Craft 🎨 Design attractive documents Craft just launched version 3 with lots of new design upgrades. Check out my introduction to Craft for more on how to use it. Whether I’m teaching, writing or public speaking, it’s one of my favorite tools for making and sharing handouts.

I love Friday, when I get your Newsletter and get introduced to interesting and wonderful programmes to try out. - I love Ideogram for the simple reason it actually gets the text right. And I also love Hailuo - for making 6 second videos from picture or your text input. My favourite at the moment is Squibler, however, it is very expensive at $46 Australian dollars a month. Not do-able on a pension. - Thanks again Jeremy for your kindness and hard work.

I love Friday, when I get your Newsletter and get introduced to interesting and wonderful programmes to try out. - I love Ideogram for the simple reason it actually gets the text right. And I also love Hailuo - for making 6 second videos from picture or your text input. My favourite at the moment is Squibler, however, it is very expensive at $46 Australian dollars a month. Not do-able on a pension. - Thanks again Jeremy for your kindness and hard work. It is very appreciated. - Jenn Expand full comment Like (1) Reply Share Clint Till Dec 18 Just started uploading material to NotebookLM and organizing my notebooks. Thanks for the recommendation.
