By Ruben Castaneda | June 21, 2017 By Ruben Castaneda | June 21, 2017, at 9:41 a.m. Save More 5 Tips for Finding the Right Pickup Game or Sports Partner More If you’re a weekend athlete who loves to play basketball, tennis, soccer or another sport but would rather compete on a pickup level instead of joining a league, what’s the best way to find a game or partner that suits you? A generation ago, many amateur sportsmen and sportswomen found athletic competition by word of mouth or by hanging out at courts or fields of play in the hopes of getting into a game. The options for finding the right game or sports partner today are greater, thanks to technology. With a few keystrokes of your laptop or by punching in letters on your cellphone, you can locate potential tennis partners at your skill level in your neighborhood who are looking for someone to hit with – or find the nearest pickup game of ultimate (formerly known widely as ultimate Frisbee). You can also go online to find pickup soccer contests, including games for men and women and coed competitions. Finding the right game or athletic partner is crucial. Joining a hoops, soccer or volleyball game where you’re completely overmatched, or hitting with a tennis partner you routinely crush, wouldn’t be any fun. “Competing with athletes of similar experience, skill and competitive expectations is one of the most crucial factors in having a rewarding sports experience,” says Christopher Cousins, a physical therapist in the District of Columbia who treats many people who injured themselves playing a pickup sport. [See: The Many Ways Exercise Fights Depression.] Good pickup games often have a core group of people who’ve played together for years, even decades. For example, Larry Gondelman is “commissioner” of a pickup basketball game that he and some fellow Georgetown University Law Center students launched in 1974, back when Richard Nixon was in the White House (though not for long). They’d play four-on-four, half-court, on one of the outdoor courts outside McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown University campus in the District of Columbia. They’d compete as long as it was dry and the temperature was at least 30 degrees. Eventually, Gondelman and his fellow hoopsters moved to an indoor gym. Today, the band of basketball brothers includes about 18 core members, including a handful who, like Gondelman, have played together more than 40 years. To keep the game vibrant, Gondelman over the years has invited younger players, including the sons of some of the original members. And the attorney has recruited people he played with at the downtown YMCA. Others who’ve learned of the game from one of the regulars joined after asking Gondelman, 65, if they could play. The competition at Gondelman's hoops game is spirited, not cutthroat. Many of the hoopsters who’ve played in Gondelman’s game have formed or deepened friendships over the years; the players used to have an annual banquet, and some go to the beach together with their respective families. This sort of camaraderie is evident with many pickup groups. Nick Salafsky, 51, says he’s gotten to know the character of fellow ultimate players at his two weekly pickup games in the District of Columbia. “There are guys I’ve played disc with for 20 years,” he says. “You don’t know their last name, if they're married or single, if they’re gay or straight, if they’re high-powered lawyers or bike couriers. Yet you know everything about their character, who cheats and who doesn’t, who you’d want to be in a foxhole with and who you wouldn’t. You don’t know anything conventional about them, but you know everything important about them.” [See: 7 Signs You Should Stop Exercising Immediately.] Whether you’re moving to a new town and need to find a new game, are taking up a new sport or are coming back from injury or looking for a fun way to exercise, finding the right group for pickup games can seem daunting. Longtime pickup athletes and a tennis instructor suggest these strategies: Network as if you were job-hunting. Whatever the sport, “ask your friends, read local media and blogs, research like you would for a job,” Gondelman says. Asking friends and co-workers about pickup games can still be an effective way to find one that ‘s a good fit for you. Also, your pals and colleagues can invite you to the game or introduce you to its commissioner. Word of mouth is how Ella Lipin learned some of her co-workers at a think tank in the District of Columbia were playing in a weeknight pickup hoops game. \"I liked that it was welcoming of all ages, genders and talent level, so I've continued to drop in whenever I can,\" says Lipin, 28. \"I briefly played JV basketball in high school, but unfortunately my love of basketball always far exceeded my skill.\" Look for games and sports partners online and on apps. There are plenty of online resources and apps to find pickup games in a variety of sports. For example, pickupultimate.com lists more than 50 cities in the mainland U.S., Alaska and Hawaii where ultimate players can find a game. Some ultimate pickup games, such as one in suburban Virginia, also use Facebook to communicate and plan games, says Jacob Kass, 27, a member of that group. There are Meetup groups online for people looking for pickup soccer, volleyball and tennis games. Pedro Ast, founder of the Bvddy app, says the service helps people find pickup games at their skill level in more than 70 sports, including basketball, badminton, field hockey and lacrosse. People can also use the app to find partners to go hiking or workout partners, he says. Hang out at a public court or field. If you learn of a pickup game at a particular court or field, show up with your sneakers or cleats laced up, hang out and see if you can get into a game. If someone didn’t show up as usual, one of the teams might need a player. Some pickup games – such as those played on public fields or courts – may have a core group of players but, because they’re on a public facility, can’t keep the competition closed. So, you might be able to watch a game and call “next” and get in the next game. At some public tennis courts, you can show up with your racket and a can of balls and, with some luck, find someone else who’s looking for a partner to hit with. [See: 6 Reasons You're Procrastinating on Your Health Goals – and How to Stop.] Ask a coach. If you’re taking lessons to improve your game, ask your coach if he or she knows of anyone who’d be a good competitive match, says Chris Pelsor, a tennis pro with Affordable Tennis Lessons in Los Angeles. “Your coach will have other students, which comprise a network of players at all levels,” he says. “When you’re starting out and you’re at a certain level it might be difficult to find someone to play with because you’re self-conscious about whether you’re good enough. Your coach will know of other people looking for someone to play with.” Don’t be a jerk. When you’re a newbie at a pickup game, keep in mind that the group you’re joining is likely to be assessing not just your sports skills in deciding whether to invite you back. For example, Gondelman puts newbies on a “probationary” period to see if they fit in with the group – that is, whether they're at roughly the same skill level as the other players and get along with the gang. Gondelman's group pays to rent the basketball court, and the commissioner doesn't ask a newbie to chip in financially the first time he or she plays, in case it turns out to be the last time he or she is invited. “Over the years, there have been two players who didn’t make it off probation,” Gondelman says. “One because he was a terrible player, the other because he had a bit of an attitude.” 13 Fun Sports That Burn Calories ### 13 Fun Sports That Burn Calories View All 15 Slides Tags: exercise and fitness, sports Most Popular Food Is Any Alcohol Good for You?

Implementing technology solutions like apps or websites could be a significant step in this direction. Upvote · Suraj Mehta Entrepreneur and Software Engineer · 12y While there is a definitive need to create a more functional app for pick-up sports, the problem is much larger than that. Why haven't all these apps tackled the issue of filling up activities? Do people even care enough to go online and find people to play with?

Most of the companies in this market simply create an event planning system, and the more advanced ones integrate your facebook and email buds, but the problem still exists. Let me take you through a scenario. You go on an application like the ones mentioned above, create an activity, and share it on twitter, facebook or other big boy social media platforms to get some virality. You might even get a few bodies to join,but not enough to complete the activity. What's the problem here? Through the millions of items shared on these platforms, how is joining an ultimate frisbee activity cool vs. looking at some sexy instagram photo, or reading about the Kardashians family vacation? The internet is vain, and posts that get viewed and shared the most are the ones that electrify certain qualities or accomplishments of an individual. There isn't a need for an app to organize pick up sports; we have a bunch of those. We need to incentivize joining or creating these activities by rewarding them. Everyone wants to be healthy, but it's just not as easy, so why not make a game out of who can be the healthiest? If someone posted something like, \"I am about to lose 300 calories in this Frisbee activity\", or \"I am 200 points away from getting a par of Jordans\", I guarantee people will be sharing it.

If everyone has a little skin in the game, then we limit both and can just enjoy the game! What is the minimum age to join a game? You must be 18 years or older to join any GoodRec game. Do I need to bring any equipment? Not at all! We provide the balls and most of our games have pinnies. Just keep an eye on the games chat and description in case that specific facility has requirements (i.e. no cleats). Do I need to be at a specific level to join a game? Unless clearly stated in the game title and description, our games are open to all levels! JOIN THE GOODREC FAMILY AND START PLAYING TODAY Our hope is that GoodRec brings people together. We love hearing that best friends have met, relationships have started, and group chats have been born through these games. We're excited to have you join us.

      "content": "How to find pickup soccer games | ENDALGO Blog Start a new group Listing Explore Support How to find pickup soccer games Oct 13th, 2022 - Soccer Among the active soccer player audience we conducted a study on, the data shows 54% of that player pool played pickup soccer the past year (with soccer league (40%) and club soccer (36.5%) coming in as second and third). This tells us how much pickup soccer is popular among soccer players as a medium to enjoy the sport. This was actually a higher number than we expected; considering the researched pool is a group of active players who most likely play more than twice a month, we expected more of the organized type of soccer, such as club soccer, leagues, and tournaments, would have more participation among the pool. It just confirms how pickup games make soccer accessible not only to casual players but also to more committed players. So, we went further into finding out how players find those games and why they even play pickup games. How games are found right now. How players have been finding pickup games has been traditionally and has stayed that way: word of mouth. When we asked the active soccer players how they find local pickup soccer games, 49% answered that they get information on games through word of mouth, followed by online community (45%) and social media (37%) (note that players were allowed to choose multiple options). Even in this era of digital prosperity, it is quite surprising that players still find pickup soccer through their friends' and teammates' networks. Why players want to find and play pickup games. As you might have expected, pickup games are usually far from trying to be competitive and playing to win a match. Hence, many people play to stay in shape and socialize. When the pool of active players was asked what their favorite thing about the player (pickup) soccer is, staying in shape consisted for 40.5%, and meeting new people (social life) consisted of 40%. Sports are fun because of the aspect of competing and striving to win, but pickup soccer was more of a stage that is casual among the types of soccer that are played. ENDALGO is the best pickup soccer app. Perhaps, finding a pickup game through friends can be the most effective way, but players without that network or newcomers to specific areas may not be able to leverage that channel of finding games through word of mouth. Also, pickup games can vary in styles and skill levels; as mentioned earlier, the majority of the audience may want to have a good time and socialize while trying to stay in shape, but that doesn’t mean some players want to play competitively and play more seriously. ENDALGO has the ability to list and recommend local soccer events and pickup games based on user location. Moreover, on the games that pickup groups, teams, and clubs host on ENDALGO, they can be specific on the type of games and events they are providing so that the audience can filter through their needs, benefiting both the players and the hosts. Conclusion Although the information we found was from active soccer players, the results seem fitting even for beginner and more casual soccer players. Pickup soccer is undeniably one of the most effective and fun ways for all soccer players and audiences to stay active and engage with the beautiful sport. Hope this information got more people to think that soccer is more approachable even without skills and experience. We recommend giving ENDALGO a try to see what’s happening in your area and, furthermore, RSVP’ing to a game to have fun and even meet new people to play soccer with.
