My name is Nick Gray and I will teach you how to make friends, meet new people, and even build big relationships. Making new friends can be challenging, but it can also be transformative. It certainly was for me. My friends motivate and inspire me, offer support, and even played a role in starting my last business. Whether you‚Äôve relocated to a new city, begun a new job, or simply want to expand your social circle, there is plenty of advice online on how to make new friends. However, I‚Äôm going to share a few unconventional ideas you might not have thought of, including: Joining a sports league. Discover the best sports for making new friends. Exploring local clubs. Learn where to find listings for these. Guided tours. This unexpected idea really works! Find out why. And many more tips! I‚Äôve tried this advice with numerous people who have gone on to meet countless new friends and acquaintances. If you want to jump straight to the heart of meeting new people, I can summarize my advice like this: ‚ÄúIf you want to meet interesting people, you have to do interesting things.‚Äù In addition to common tropes like joining a sports club or attending a church event, I‚Äôll also give you some non-traditional ideas for where and how you can meet new people. I‚Äôll show you how to make it easy, how to make it fun, and then how to make the types of friends who inspire and encourage you. Why you should trust me: I moved to New York City hardly knowing anyone. I wasn‚Äôt outgoing, socially confident, and I definitely didn‚Äôt know how to host a party. Over the last 15 years I‚Äôve met thousands of people and hosted hundreds of parties to build big relationships. I wrote this article and interviewed several others who have used these techniques to meet new friends, best friends, and even boosted their careers. Keep reading to see our best tips. Table of Contents Toggle Why Making New Friends is Important Ways to Make New Friends Join a Club or Organization Find an Online Group (and Where) Special Interests and Hobbies Guided Tours, Especially When Traveling Talk to Your Co-workers or Neighbors More Places to Meet New Friends Host a 2-Hour Cocktail Party Conclusion Why Making New Friends is Important Making new friends can help you in a variety of different ways. You can learn how to meet new people and make friends. When you do, you‚Äôll get invited to more events, have a greater sense of community, and generally be happier. Science backs this up: studies show that as we get older, we need more friends to stay connected in our community. Making friends is a crucial skill that is not taught in school. It can be scary and uncomfortable, but once you know what to do it is exciting and worthwhile! Ways to Make New Friends I‚Äôll outline and describe each of these techniques below: Join a Club or Organization Find an Online Group (and Where) Special Interests and Hobbies Guided Tours, Especially When Traveling Talk to Your Co-workers or Neighbors More Places to Meet New Friends Host a 2-Hour Cocktail Party or happy hour Pro tip: You need to break the ice in order to build new connections. Take a look at these questions that you can ask when you meet someone interesting. Join a Club or Organization Get involved in any activity that matters to you. It is where you‚Äôre most likely to meet people with similar values and interests as you. Clubs are excuses for people to hang out with each other consistently. Some examples of clubs are: Book club Gym or exercise class Country clubs and Golf resorts Rec sports like kickball Yoga studios Foodie clubs Ski clubs Pro tip: Kickball is the best sport to play for making friends because the teams are large, and you‚Äôll spend half the time hanging out in the dugout altogether. Organizations are more purpose-driven. They are a great way to make a difference and create new friends who have similar interests as you. Some examples of organizations are local committees, local non-profits, and language classes. Find an Online Group (and Where) You can find online communities around your passions. List some of your favorite hobbies and activities. Then search online to find groups about those things. I find that the best place to look for these online groups is discord channels, slack communities, Facebook, and forums. Where To Find Local Communities Meetup.com has a surplus of small local events that you can go to. Toastmasters is another one that literally forces you to speak to new people. Facebook groups that have consistent events. Event boards and newsletters. Special Interests and Hobbies Ask yourself these two questions: What do you do with your free time already? How can you go to areas filled with other people doing this same activity? For example, if you love yoga and you always practice at home with YouTube videos by yourself, you should sign up for a yoga studio. Many have complimentary sample or trial memberships. Or find a nearby park where locals host their own yoga classes. Barb in Florida suggests visiting some galleries. Their daughter, Rachel, shared her strategy and ‚Äúcheat code‚Äù for meeting new people in any new area. Attending art gallery shows often host receptions with refreshments and hors d‚Äôoeuvres. A perfect life hack to meet new people in the area and get free food and drinks while you‚Äôre at it. Guided Tours, Especially When Traveling The point of traveling is to experience a new part of the world. And the best way to get a more immersive experience in an area is to take a tour. You get to surround yourself with people who are traveling just like you. This is a perfect opportunity to connect with people and make new friends. Here are a few tours that you might find on Airbnb Experiences, TripAdvisor, Yelp, or elsewhere: Art tours Museums National parks Food tours Boat tours Bus tours Talk to Your Co-workers or Neighbors Make sure to talk to them about their interests, their hobbies, and whatever else seems important to them. Since every human being‚Äôs favorite subject is themselves, it makes it really easy to connect with someone by talking about their passions. My friend, Sujan, did something genius! He printed out friendly family flyers and put them in everyone‚Äôs mailbox in his suburban neighborhood. It‚Äôs not a core group in the traditional sense, but it still got him enough RSVPs to have the confidence to invite more people to his first gathering. More Places to Meet New Friends Here are some more suggestions from people who read early drafts of my book: ‚ÄúLook at organizations for ex-pats like InterNations. They have groups in over four hundred cities. I find ex-pats can be more open to connecting. Unlike locals, they don‚Äôt have established networks and might have just moved to a city.‚Äù ‚ÄîJudhajit De ‚ÄúI have invited a few very distant relatives that live in town to parties. For example, my mother-in-law‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs daughter. She‚Äôs someone I met once at a big family event, seemed cool, and it turned out we could be friends in addition to extremely distant in-laws.‚Äù ‚ÄîAlex Gates ‚ÄúFor women looking to meet new friends, try the Bumble app and use the Bumble BFF setting. It‚Äôs a great way to connect. I met a number of new people using it and invited them to my parties.‚Äù ‚ÄîGena Stanley ‚ÄúJoin a recreational sports league in your area. I play on soccer teams and have made many friends over the years. My own Party Pro Tip: To maximize the opportunity of meeting people, play kickball because that sport has the largest teams.‚Äù ‚ÄîSeth Hanes ‚ÄúReach out to people from your yoga, boxing, or gym classes. Invite the coaches and instructors too.‚Äù ‚ÄîRui Zhang Host a 2-Hour Cocktail Party Now that you‚Äôve made a bunch of new friends or met several new people, it is time to connect them all. Hosting a party can be a great way to deepen your relationships and make new friends. Ask your five closest friends if they are available to meet up on a specific day. They will form the ‚ÄúCore Group‚Äù of your party attendees. The best time frame is three weeks away. I suggest hosting your party on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday night since it will be easier for people to attend. Pro tip: Learn more about hosting a cocktail party here. Read some of the case studies I wrote about my readers from all over the world who used the formula from my book here. Conclusion I remember the first time that I made a new friend in New York City. I was so excited that I could barely sleep. I never knew that I could simply talk to someone, get their contact information, and start to build a relationship. Now you can start to do the same. Once you start using these tips and techniques, it‚Äôll become much easier to make new friends. I hope that I‚Äôve convinced you of the benefits of hosting a small party, too. Remember: ‚ÄúIf you want to meet interesting people, do interesting things.‚Äù The first three things you should look to do are: Join a sports league Research local clubs Find guided tours Talk to your co-workers or neighbors Host a cocktail party or happy hour I‚Äôve tested this advice with dozens of people who have met hundreds of new friends. Good luck and let me know how it goes! Want to bring interesting people together for a cocktail party? Want them to beg you to host more? You can do this with a simple 2-hour cocktail party.

There is a long distance between going to an event and having a real circle of friends that goes deeper than quaffing beers and pretzels after a kickball game. Reply Nick Gray November 5, 2024 at 09:26 Hey, thanks for reading! You‚Äôre absolutely right‚Äîthere‚Äôs a big difference between just chatting at an event and building a real friendship. A good next step after meeting someone is to follow up casually, like sending a quick message about something you both enjoyed or even planning to meet up for another activity you‚Äôre both into (maybe grabbing coffee after the next yoga class). From there, it‚Äôs about finding shared interests or values. Do stuff that naturally brings you together more regularly‚Äîit could be joining the same class, grabbing lunch every so often, or even introducing them to other friends if things click. That‚Äôs when things start to go deeper and feel like a genuine circle of friends rather than just acquaintances.

My name is Nick Gray and I will teach you how to make friends, meet new people, and even build big relationships. Making new friends can be challenging, but it can also be transformative. It certainly was for me. My friends motivate and inspire me, offer support, and even played a role in starting my last business. Whether you‚Äôve relocated to a new city, begun a new job, or simply want to expand your social circle, there is plenty of advice online on how to make new friends. However, I‚Äôm going to share a few unconventional ideas you might not have thought of, including: Joining a sports league. Discover the best sports for making new friends. Exploring local clubs. Learn where to find listings for these. Guided tours. This unexpected idea really works! Find out why. And many more tips! I‚Äôve tried this advice with numerous people who have gone on to meet countless new friends and acquaintances. If you want to jump straight to the heart of meeting new people, I can summarize my advice like this: ‚ÄúIf you want to meet interesting people, you have to do interesting things.‚Äù In addition to common tropes like joining a sports club or attending a church event, I‚Äôll also give you some non-traditional ideas for where and how you can meet new people. I‚Äôll show you how to make it easy, how to make it fun, and then how to make the types of friends who inspire and encourage you. Why you should trust me: I moved to New York City hardly knowing anyone. I wasn‚Äôt outgoing, socially confident, and I definitely didn‚Äôt know how to host a party. Over the last 15 years I‚Äôve met thousands of people and hosted hundreds of parties to build big relationships. I wrote this article and interviewed several others who have used these techniques to meet new friends, best friends, and even boosted their careers. Keep reading to see our best tips. Table of Contents Toggle Why Making New Friends is Important Ways to Make New Friends Join a Club or Organization Find an Online Group (and Where) Special Interests and Hobbies Guided Tours, Especially When Traveling Talk to Your Co-workers or Neighbors More Places to Meet New Friends Host a 2-Hour Cocktail Party Conclusion Why Making New Friends is Important Making new friends can help you in a variety of different ways. You can learn how to meet new people and make friends. When you do, you‚Äôll get invited to more events, have a greater sense of community, and generally be happier. Science backs this up: studies show that as we get older, we need more friends to stay connected in our community. Making friends is a crucial skill that is not taught in school. It can be scary and uncomfortable, but once you know what to do it is exciting and worthwhile! Ways to Make New Friends I‚Äôll outline and describe each of these techniques below: Join a Club or Organization Find an Online Group (and Where) Special Interests and Hobbies Guided Tours, Especially When Traveling Talk to Your Co-workers or Neighbors More Places to Meet New Friends Host a 2-Hour Cocktail Party or happy hour Pro tip: You need to break the ice in order to build new connections. Take a look at these questions that you can ask when you meet someone interesting. Join a Club or Organization Get involved in any activity that matters to you. It is where you‚Äôre most likely to meet people with similar values and interests as you. Clubs are excuses for people to hang out with each other consistently. Some examples of clubs are: Book club Gym or exercise class Country clubs and Golf resorts Rec sports like kickball Yoga studios Foodie clubs Ski clubs Pro tip: Kickball is the best sport to play for making friends because the teams are large, and you‚Äôll spend half the time hanging out in the dugout altogether. Organizations are more purpose-driven. They are a great way to make a difference and create new friends who have similar interests as you. Some examples of organizations are local committees, local non-profits, and language classes. Find an Online Group (and Where) You can find online communities around your passions. List some of your favorite hobbies and activities. Then search online to find groups about those things. I find that the best place to look for these online groups is discord channels, slack communities, Facebook, and forums. Where To Find Local Communities Meetup.com has a surplus of small local events that you can go to. Toastmasters is another one that literally forces you to speak to new people. Facebook groups that have consistent events. Event boards and newsletters. Special Interests and Hobbies Ask yourself these two questions: What do you do with your free time already? How can you go to areas filled with other people doing this same activity? For example, if you love yoga and you always practice at home with YouTube videos by yourself, you should sign up for a yoga studio. Many have complimentary sample or trial memberships. Or find a nearby park where locals host their own yoga classes. Barb in Florida suggests visiting some galleries. Their daughter, Rachel, shared her strategy and ‚Äúcheat code‚Äù for meeting new people in any new area. Attending art gallery shows often host receptions with refreshments and hors d‚Äôoeuvres. A perfect life hack to meet new people in the area and get free food and drinks while you‚Äôre at it. Guided Tours, Especially When Traveling The point of traveling is to experience a new part of the world. And the best way to get a more immersive experience in an area is to take a tour. You get to surround yourself with people who are traveling just like you. This is a perfect opportunity to connect with people and make new friends. Here are a few tours that you might find on Airbnb Experiences, TripAdvisor, Yelp, or elsewhere: Art tours Museums National parks Food tours Boat tours Bus tours Talk to Your Co-workers or Neighbors Make sure to talk to them about their interests, their hobbies, and whatever else seems important to them. Since every human being‚Äôs favorite subject is themselves, it makes it really easy to connect with someone by talking about their passions. My friend, Sujan, did something genius! He printed out friendly family flyers and put them in everyone‚Äôs mailbox in his suburban neighborhood. It‚Äôs not a core group in the traditional sense, but it still got him enough RSVPs to have the confidence to invite more people to his first gathering. More Places to Meet New Friends Here are some more suggestions from people who read early drafts of my book: ‚ÄúLook at organizations for ex-pats like InterNations. They have groups in over four hundred cities. I find ex-pats can be more open to connecting. Unlike locals, they don‚Äôt have established networks and might have just moved to a city.‚Äù ‚ÄîJudhajit De ‚ÄúI have invited a few very distant relatives that live in town to parties. For example, my mother-in-law‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs daughter. She‚Äôs someone I met once at a big family event, seemed cool, and it turned out we could be friends in addition to extremely distant in-laws.‚Äù ‚ÄîAlex Gates ‚ÄúFor women looking to meet new friends, try the Bumble app and use the Bumble BFF setting. It‚Äôs a great way to connect. I met a number of new people using it and invited them to my parties.‚Äù ‚ÄîGena Stanley ‚ÄúJoin a recreational sports league in your area. I play on soccer teams and have made many friends over the years. My own Party Pro Tip: To maximize the opportunity of meeting people, play kickball because that sport has the largest teams.‚Äù ‚ÄîSeth Hanes ‚ÄúReach out to people from your yoga, boxing, or gym classes. Invite the coaches and instructors too.‚Äù ‚ÄîRui Zhang Host a 2-Hour Cocktail Party Now that you‚Äôve made a bunch of new friends or met several new people, it is time to connect them all. Hosting a party can be a great way to deepen your relationships and make new friends. Ask your five closest friends if they are available to meet up on a specific day. They will form the ‚ÄúCore Group‚Äù of your party attendees. The best time frame is three weeks away. I suggest hosting your party on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday night since it will be easier for people to attend. Pro tip: Learn more about hosting a cocktail party here. Read some of the case studies I wrote about my readers from all over the world who used the formula from my book here. Conclusion I remember the first time that I made a new friend in New York City. I was so excited that I could barely sleep. I never knew that I could simply talk to someone, get their contact information, and start to build a relationship. Now you can start to do the same. Once you start using these tips and techniques, it‚Äôll become much easier to make new friends. I hope that I‚Äôve convinced you of the benefits of hosting a small party, too. Remember: ‚ÄúIf you want to meet interesting people, do interesting things.‚Äù The first three things you should look to do are: Join a sports league Research local clubs Find guided tours Talk to your co-workers or neighbors Host a cocktail party or happy hour I‚Äôve tested this advice with dozens of people who have met hundreds of new friends. Good luck and let me know how it goes! Want to bring interesting people together for a cocktail party? Want them to beg you to host more? You can do this with a simple 2-hour cocktail party.

      "content": "Published Time: 2023-11-20T15:46:01-05:00 Use Sports and Games to Meet New Friends Search: 4 Fun Ways To Meet New People Through Sport and Game bctest |Nov 20, 2023 3:46 pm|Nov 27, 2023 12:18 pm Photo by Sharefaith / Pexels For numerous individuals, sports and games offer more than just leisure; they‚Äôre hubs of community and relaxation. If you‚Äôre keen on broadening your social network to include like-minded enthusiasts, this piece offers four innovative ways to forge connections through activities that blend competition, teamwork, and sheer enjoyment ‚Äì be it in the virtual realm or in-person. Whether it‚Äôs joining local leagues or participating in esports tournaments, these avenues introduce you to fresh faces who may swiftly evolve into lifelong pals, all bonded by a shared love for athletics and play. 1: Join a Recreational Sports League Playing recreational sports is a fun way to be more socially active and meet new people. Choose a sport you enjoy, like kickball, flag football, or soccer. Search online for recreational leagues in your area. You can join as an individual and get assigned to a team. Leagues are usually organized through local parks departments or private sports organizations. Teams meet regularly at scheduled times, like once or twice a week. Games last around an hour and are played at neighborhood fields and courts. You can also arrive early before games to introduce yourself to teammates. Recreational sports are low-pressure leagues since the focus is on exercise and camaraderie rather than intense competition. Between games, you can chat with teammates and opponents. After the games, many leagues have a tradition of hitting a local spot for food, drinks, and socializing. This is a prime time to get to know your teammates better away from the field or court. 2: Online Video-Chat Platforms Online video-chat platforms provide a great way to connect with others who share your interests in sports and games, even if your busy schedule makes attending in-person events difficult. When you sign up for one of these services, you fill out a profile listing your hobbies and interests. The platform then uses this information to match you in one-on-one video chats with people with similar interests to have a fun chat experience with them. For example, if you‚Äôre an avid esports fan, you could get matched with someone who roots for the same teams as you and chat about recent tournaments, player trades, and more. Once you‚Äôve established a rapport through the casual video chats, you can decide if you want to meet up in person for a shared activity like attending a live game event together. Moreover, those initial video conversations make in-person meetings much more comfortable. You already have shared interests and some familiarity with the other person. 3: Take a class Signing up for a sports or gaming class can be a great way to meet people who share your interests. Whether golf lessons or martial arts, these classes provide a built-in opportunity to connect with like-minded people. The best part is you don‚Äôt have to force conversations ‚Äì they happen naturally as you partner up for drills or help each other improve techniques. Friendly rivalries often form over time as you and your classmates compete for top scores or fastest times. Classes are designed to facilitate social interactions. Arrive early to introduce yourself to other students before the instructor starts. Stick around after class and see if anyone wants a smoothie or coffee. Before you know it, you‚Äôve got a new group of friends who share your hobbies and interests, thanks to signing up for a class. It‚Äôs a super easy way to expand your social circle while improving your skills. 4: Test your skills at an arcade bar For a social and playful environment to meet new people, visit an arcade bar in your area. These fun hangouts combine retro arcade games, skeeball, air hockey, and pinball with a full bar. The games spark friendly competition and camaraderie. Challenge strangers to head-to-head battles in Street Fighter or race side-by-side in Mario Kart. Compliment impressive high scores and exchange tips to improve. Grab a drink at the bar between rounds to continue conversations and get to know other gamers. The lively ambiance makes it easy to mingle and meet new faces. Many arcade bars host competitive leagues and tournaments for games like Skee-Ball or pinball. Sign up to participate or cheer on the contenders while bonding over your appreciation for classics. With gameplay at the center of the social experience, an arcade bar allows you to meet new people who share your fondness for fun and competition. And a few cocktails help get the conversation started. Conclusion Whether your interests lie in team sports, solo athletics, or esports, there are now more options than ever to find like-minded connections. When you leverage virtual platforms and local communities, you can surround yourself with people who share your passions. Embracing new social circles can lead to lifelong friendships and partners that enrich your life.

However, moving to a new city or town may feel a little intimidating if you don‚Äôt know very many people. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to make friends in your new location. If you‚Äôre looking for some tips on how to do so on your next travel nurse assignment, follow our ideas below. 1. Volunteer in the community As a nurse, there is no doubt you already love to give back. When you have a passion for giving back, it is easy to find others who share that passion. Find the perfect volunteer opportunity for you on VolunteerMatch.org by entering your city and your areas of interest. 2. Join an amateur sports team Whether you are highly athletic or just enjoy having fun, there is a sports league for you. From competitive softball to flag football, to ‚Äújust for fun‚Äù dodgeball leagues, sports leagues create great ways to meet new friends in new cities. 3. Join a gym and try an exercise class Working in patient care, it can be easy to forget about your own health and well-being. Joining a gym and trying a class is a great way to stay fit and get social. You may find something you really enjoy, and a new workout partner could become a friend outside the gym as well. 4. Join a dance class You don‚Äôt need to be an experienced dancer to join a class! If you enjoy great music and staying active, dance classes provide one of the best ways to meet new friends. 5. Run a local road race Races and running clubs offer fun ways to meet new friends, see your town from a new perspective, and break a sweat. 6. Join your local Chamber of Commerce or a Professional Networking Group If you own your own business, joining the Chamber of Commerce is a highly effective way to meet new people and build a network of referrals. If you don‚Äôt own your own business, networking events are the number one way to meet people in a travel nursing profession. 7. Join a religious group or cultural club Becoming active in a local church, synagogue or mosque will ensure that you engage with a community of like-minded people who will support you. If religion isn‚Äôt for you, but you have strong ties to your culture, consider seeking out the local club or chapter that represents your culture in your city. 8. Join a wine club If you enjoy a nice glass of wine and good conversation, it won‚Äôt be hard to make new friends in a wine club. Many cities have wine clubs that tour the local wine bars and wineries (where applicable). Learn more about wine and make friends on the journey! 9. Join a book club Unwind with a new book each month and join a club where you can find new friends and enjoy a discussion. Finding the right book club is easy with websites like My Coffee and Book Club. 10. Join a sports team fan club Do you love your team? You aren‚Äôt alone! Chances are there are others in your city who also love them. Joining a fan club is one of the great ways to meet friends online! The easiest way to find these clubs is through your team‚Äôs official website. 11. Take your dog to the park If you love dogs and the outdoors, taking your dog to the dog park is definitely one of the best ways to meet new friends. No dog parks nearby? Walk your dog in a popular place like downtown where there will be a lot of people around. 12. Go to the beach or lake You spend a lot of time in healthcare facilities as a travel nurse, so go enjoy the sunshine at a beach or lake when you can! Spending time at the beach or lake is a fun activity by yourself, but it creates lots of opportunities to meet new friends. Consider taking a water-based class like paddleboarding or snorkeling and use these activities to meet friends. 13. Join local Facebook Groups One of the best ways to meet friends online is to join Facebook Groups. There are so many groups you can join to find other people with similar interests. Maybe you want to find fellow travelers that are in the area temporarily or a local who can show you fun activities to do on the weekends. Just use the search bar at the top of the home page and select ‚Äúgroups‚Äù to narrow down results to your liking.

Visit a museum, zoo, aquarium or national park Spending time at one of these public places can be a great way to enjoy the day and meet new friends who share similar interests. 16. Go to a local music, food or art festival Festivals are very communal, centered around having fun, and often include group activities like games, competitions, and demonstrations that will encourage interaction with others. 17. Take a foreign language class Learning a new language is a fantastic way to continue your education and open yourself up to a new culture. Learning in a group setting makes it easy to form new connections, but it can also be a great way to meet friends online. 18. Shop at local businesses Spending time in the local boutiques and restaurants in your town creates opportunities to meet other members of the community who also ‚Äúshop local‚Äù and could become shopping buddies. 19. Go to a farmer‚Äôs market Many towns offer monthly farmer‚Äôs markets full of great produce and local products. Like shopping locally, farmer‚Äôs markets create a fun way to support your community and surround yourself with neighbors who are interested in doing the same. 20. Take a local brewery tour In addition to great beer, these breweries often offer tours and classes, making them a great place to meet new people and have fun. 21. Join MeetUp.com Perhaps one of the very best ways to meet new friends is to join MeetUp.com. This online forum allows you to enter your city and interest to view endless numbers of ‚Äúmeetups‚Äù near you.

However, moving to a new city or town may feel a little intimidating if you don‚Äôt know very many people. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to make friends in your new location. If you‚Äôre looking for some tips on how to do so on your next travel nurse assignment, follow our ideas below. 1. Volunteer in the community As a nurse, there is no doubt you already love to give back. When you have a passion for giving back, it is easy to find others who share that passion. Find the perfect volunteer opportunity for you on VolunteerMatch.org by entering your city and your areas of interest. 2. Join an amateur sports team Whether you are highly athletic or just enjoy having fun, there is a sports league for you. From competitive softball to flag football, to ‚Äújust for fun‚Äù dodgeball leagues, sports leagues create great ways to meet new friends in new cities. 3. Join a gym and try an exercise class Working in patient care, it can be easy to forget about your own health and well-being. Joining a gym and trying a class is a great way to stay fit and get social. You may find something you really enjoy, and a new workout partner could become a friend outside the gym as well. 4. Join a dance class You don‚Äôt need to be an experienced dancer to join a class! If you enjoy great music and staying active, dance classes provide one of the best ways to meet new friends. 5. Run a local road race Races and running clubs offer fun ways to meet new friends, see your town from a new perspective, and break a sweat. 6. Join your local Chamber of Commerce or a Professional Networking Group If you own your own business, joining the Chamber of Commerce is a highly effective way to meet new people and build a network of referrals. If you don‚Äôt own your own business, networking events are the number one way to meet people in a travel nursing profession. 7. Join a religious group or cultural club Becoming active in a local church, synagogue or mosque will ensure that you engage with a community of like-minded people who will support you. If religion isn‚Äôt for you, but you have strong ties to your culture, consider seeking out the local club or chapter that represents your culture in your city. 8. Join a wine club If you enjoy a nice glass of wine and good conversation, it won‚Äôt be hard to make new friends in a wine club. Many cities have wine clubs that tour the local wine bars and wineries (where applicable). Learn more about wine and make friends on the journey! 9. Join a book club Unwind with a new book each month and join a club where you can find new friends and enjoy a discussion. Finding the right book club is easy with websites like My Coffee and Book Club. 10. Join a sports team fan club Do you love your team? You aren‚Äôt alone! Chances are there are others in your city who also love them. Joining a fan club is one of the great ways to meet friends online! The easiest way to find these clubs is through your team‚Äôs official website. 11. Take your dog to the park If you love dogs and the outdoors, taking your dog to the dog park is definitely one of the best ways to meet new friends. No dog parks nearby? Walk your dog in a popular place like downtown where there will be a lot of people around. 12. Go to the beach or lake You spend a lot of time in healthcare facilities as a travel nurse, so go enjoy the sunshine at a beach or lake when you can! Spending time at the beach or lake is a fun activity by yourself, but it creates lots of opportunities to meet new friends. Consider taking a water-based class like paddleboarding or snorkeling and use these activities to meet friends. 13. Join local Facebook Groups One of the best ways to meet friends online is to join Facebook Groups. There are so many groups you can join to find other people with similar interests. Maybe you want to find fellow travelers that are in the area temporarily or a local who can show you fun activities to do on the weekends. Just use the search bar at the top of the home page and select ‚Äúgroups‚Äù to narrow down results to your liking. Use the search bar at the top of the home page and select ‚Äúgroups‚Äù to narrow down results to your liking. 14. Go to bars with events like Trivia Night If you enjoy a competitive round of trivia, consider making new friends by joining a team at a local bar or brewery. 15. Visit a museum, zoo, aquarium or national park Spending time at one of these public places can be a great way to enjoy the day and meet new friends who share similar interests. 16. Go to a local music, food or art festival Festivals are very communal, centered around having fun, and often include group activities like games, competitions, and demonstrations that will encourage interaction with others. 17. Take a foreign language class Learning a new language is a fantastic way to continue your education and open yourself up to a new culture. Learning in a group setting makes it easy to form new connections, but it can also be a great way to meet friends online. 18. Shop at local businesses Spending time in the local boutiques and restaurants in your town creates opportunities to meet other members of the community who also ‚Äúshop local‚Äù and could become shopping buddies. 19. Go to a farmer‚Äôs market Many towns offer monthly farmer‚Äôs markets full of great produce and local products. Like shopping locally, farmer‚Äôs markets create a fun way to support your community and surround yourself with neighbors who are interested in doing the same. 20. Take a local brewery tour In addition to great beer, these breweries often offer tours and classes, making them a great place to meet new people and have fun. 21. Join MeetUp.com Perhaps one of the very best ways to meet new friends is to join MeetUp.com. This online forum allows you to enter your city and interest to view endless numbers of ‚Äúmeetups‚Äù near you.

Top Sports and Fitness Activities for Meeting New People Here, you'll find the types of sports that work well with examples and some considerations to help you pick the best option for your individual needs, whether you're looking for an accountability partner, fitness date ideas, or sports to make new friends over. 1. Individual Sports with Social Aspects Individual sports that offer social interaction opportunities are excellent for meeting new people. Sports like golf, tennis, badminton, and pickleball provide one-on-one or small-group interactions, allowing plenty of time for conversation. These activities attract a wide age range and can be played both casually or competitively. However, it's worth noting that some of these activities can be expensive or weather-dependent. Summary: Best for fitness dates and finding accountability partners. The one-on-one nature of these sports allows for deeper conversations and personal connections. 2. Team Sports Team sports naturally foster camaraderie and provide ample opportunities for social interaction, making them excellent for building friendships and teamwork skills. Volleyball, basketball, and soccer are prime examples of team sports that can help you meet new people. Keep in mind that participating in team sports may require a consistent time commitment. Summary: Ideal for making new friends and expanding your social circle. The team dynamic creates a natural environment for forming bonds with multiple people at once. 3. Outdoor Activities Outdoor activities are highly accessible and allow for flexible pacing alongside beautiful scenery, which can serve as great conversation starters. Hiking, running, and cycling are popular choices in this category. While these activities are excellent for meeting people, they can be weather-dependent and may require travel to suitable locations. Summary: Great for fitness dates and finding accountability partners. The relaxed pace and natural surroundings provide ample opportunity for conversation and shared experiences. 4. Fitness Classes Regular fitness classes help foster a sense of community and cater to various fitness levels and interests. Group fitness classes such as spinning, HIIT, bootcamp, CrossFit, and calisthenics, are great options.

Summary: Excellent for finding accountability partners and making new friends. The regular schedule and shared goals create a supportive environment for forming connections. 5. Adventure Sports Adventure sports encourage teamwork and trust-building, often involving group excursions that create shared experiences. Rock climbing, bouldering, kayaking, and canoeing are excellent examples of adventure sports that can help you meet new people. Keep in mind that these activities may require specialized equipment.

The exciting nature of these activities creates memorable shared experiences, fostering stronger connections. 6. Martial Arts and Combat Sports Martial arts and combat sports build confidence and discipline while often involving partner work. They foster a strong sense of community in many dojos.

Dance and Rhythmic Activities Dance and rhythmic activities, especially partner dances, are inherently social. They provide a fun and energetic atmosphere while improving coordination.

The close interaction and fun atmosphere make these activities perfect for breaking the ice and forming connections. 8. Water Sports Water sports offer low-impact activities suitable for all ages and fitness levels. They provide refreshing and enjoyable experiences, especially in summer.

By Cole Henke, Sports editor August 24, 2017 Traveling to a new country and attending a new university can be really tough. Take it from somebody who‚Äôs done it before. I spent last spring semester studying abroad in Australia, and I was the only person from the University of Illinois at my new university. I knew absolutely nobody. Half of me was excited about the fresh start, and the other was scared to death. I‚Äôm sure many international students at the University of Illinois are feeling the same way I was. But that scared feeling didn‚Äôt last long for me. As soon as I got to campus I got heavily involved in all sorts of intramural sports. Intramural sports are, in my opinion, the best way to make new friends. There‚Äôs no quicker way to become friends with people than being on the same team as them. Growing up, I played every sport I could and met some of my best friends in the process. I knew that was my best way to make friends in Australia. It worked like a charm. I played the same sports I have been playing for years, and some sports that I have never played before, like Australian rules football and rugby. After practice and games, I had spent so much time with my teammates that I felt like I had known them for forever. I spent more time with them than anybody else at my university. We were in pretty competitive leagues, so we were always focused on our next game. Meanwhile, the University of Illinois offers intramural leagues for tons of sports. It‚Äôs a great opportunity to try sports you‚Äôve never played before, and don‚Äôt worry; they have recreational leagues for the rookies. The level of competition is lowered for people who are just looking to have fun and try out the sports. Those are definitely the way to go if you are just trying out the sport. There‚Äôs no worse feeling than being a beginner on a team full of people who want to really take the game seriously. It takes all the fun out of it, and ultimately that is the reason you are playing. If I had to give any piece of advice to incoming international students, it would be to get involved in as many intramural leagues as possible. Play that sport you‚Äôve always thought about playing but never have. Get back into that sport you played all the time as a kid. It will definitely be a blast. Not only because you will become friends with all your teammates, but since intramural leagues are friendly competitions, you will become friends with your opponents, too. There is nothing better than going out to get some exercise with your teammates and then going to hang out afterward. Take it from a guy who has done it before. One of the main goals for all international students is to get a taste of the culture in the new country. My time traveling showed me that no other country loves their sports as much as the United States does. Sports dominate everyday life for tons of Americans, so if you like sports and want to assimilate into American culture, then intramurals are your quickest answer.

In youth, socialization was a daily part of our routine. We went to school, surrounded by peers. Our parents put us in after school programs, summer camps, and sports leagues with other kids. Then we graduated into the working class, commuting to an office every day. We interacted with our coworkers and business partners, attending post-work happy hours. But now many of us work from home. We can go days without speaking to another human in person. Many of us live semi-nomadic lives, working remotely from different cities throughout the year. And so do our friends. It‚Äôs hard to know who‚Äôs in town to hang. Then the babies come. It‚Äôs more difficult to find time to spend time with friends that have children. Parents have even more responsibilities that eat into their weekends. Impromptu hangs are almost impossible when hiring a sitter is required. It‚Äôs easy to live in isolation. We‚Äôre more connected online than ever before, yet loneliness is abundant. As much as I love the internet and its ability to bring people together, we‚Äôre biologically wired for IRL human connection and many aren‚Äôt getting it. So, what‚Äôs the solution? Social sports.

Pop Culture Quizzes & Games Shopping Video Lifestyle Community From Our Partners About BuzzFeed Tasty BuzzFeed Goodful HuffPost 11 Helpful Tips For Making Friends As An Adult Me: seeking five people to have coffee with in Central Perk. BuzzFeed Staff Hi! I'm Natasha, and two years ago I moved from the UK to New York City. One of the downsides of moving to a totally new place is having a friend count of zero. So, here are a couple of tips I picked up for making new friends as an adult human being: 1. First, join online communities. Peruse social media, especially Facebook and Reddit, for online groups that reflect your interests and your area. For example, I'm part of a Facebook group for expats living in New York that holds gatherings (pre-pandemic) for other people in the same boat. 2. Use apps. Apps like Bumble BFF take the dating app formula and apply it to friendship ‚Äî because why should you only be swiping for a romantic partner? 3. Lean into your hobbies... My hobby is playing the drums, so when I moved to a new city, I joined a band, a local musicians' Facebook group, and a drummers' collective, and just started attending shows in my area like a fiend. Although music might not be your thing, the point I'm getting at is that there might be lots of ways to turn a seemingly solitary hobby into something that allows you to meet new people. 4. ...or take a class and find a new hobby. No existing hobbies? No problem! Spend some time learning that thing that you always thought sounded cool but never had the time for. The goal ‚Äî and I cannot stress this enough ‚Äî isn't necessarily to be good at whatever you're picking up (although, if you want to master something, go for it!). I SUCK at rock climbing but did it because it was fun and a great way to hang out with people. 5. Organize your own group. Unfortunately, there might not be an existing network for what you're interested in ‚Äî but fortunately, that means you get to make it! Back in the day, I made a Facebook group for amateur musicians, which was an objective flop, BUT it did allow me to meet my future bandmates. 6. Join a sports team. This might evoke one of two reactions in you: a) Woohoo! I love sports! or b) Oh god, sports?! If you're a fellow person who thinks the latter, then I'd add that plenty of chill, no-stress amateur teams exist that are more about having fun than, you know, actually being good at sports. 7. Join a book club. If books are a bit too much of a time commitment, you can also look into essay, movie, or poetry clubs. 8. Volunteer in your community. In addition to benefiting your community, it'll allow you to meet people with a similar value system. 9. Go places solo and meet people there. See an event that you're super interested in but don't have anyone to go with? Go solo! You'll either a) meet people there on the fly or b) have an awesome time by yourself, you magnificent human being. 10. Reach out to people within your existing network. Whether it's asking that coworker you think is funny to go out for drinks or posting on social media asking for connections in a new city, there's a chance that you might know someone already who is your ticket to Friend Town. 11. Finally, it's a clich√©, but be yourself! Look, you're an adult ‚Äî you don't need to be friends with people unless they're adding value to your life. You have nothing to lose by being your true, authentic self. At worst, people don't like you ‚Äî which, screw 'em, anyway ‚Äî and at best, you make meaningful connections.",
