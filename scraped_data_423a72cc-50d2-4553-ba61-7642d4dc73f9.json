  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, so let’s break this down. When I see a URL like \"getmorebacklinks.org,\" the first thing that pops into my mind is that this site is probably all about boosting your online presence, specifically through backlinks. You know how important those little links are for SEO, right? They’re like street cred in the digital world; the more you have, the more people start to trust you and your content. So, if I were to guess, the site might offer some services or tools to help you snag those backlinks. Maybe they’ve got some kind of automated system that finds high-quality sites where you can get your links put in, or perhaps they offer guest blogging opportunities. Those are pretty popular ways to build backlinks without too much hassle. I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a blog section too, sharing tips and tricks on link building strategies. They might talk about things like “white hat” vs. “black hat” techniques—basically the good and the shady stuff you can do to boost your SEO. And let’s be real, who doesn’t love a good listicle about “10 Ways to Get More Backlinks”? Now, given that it’s a .org domain, it might also have a bit of an educational angle. Perhaps they’re trying to share knowledge about SEO best practices with the broader community instead of just being a hard-sell business. Kind of like a friendly neighborhood guide helping you navigate the sometimes murky waters of the web. There’s a chance they offer some kind of community aspect, too—maybe forums or a resource page where you can learn from other folks in the game. Think of it as a virtual watering hole where digital marketers and small business owners hang out, swapping stories and strategies for getting noticed online. Honestly, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of some success stories or testimonials. You know, those “we helped these people rank in Google!” type of deals because who doesn’t want to see proof that the methods work? They might even have a section with case studies showing off how their strategies have turned some sad little websites into traffic magnets. Also, if they’re trying to make it all easy for you, they could have a range of pricing plans or packages for different needs, whether you're a startup just dipping your toes in or a more established business that needs a serious boost. And hey, if they’re on top of their game, they might even be offering some sort of free trial for one of their services. You know how it goes—try before you buy! So yeah, while I’m just riffing here, it seems pretty clear that \"getmorebacklinks.org\" is probably your go-to spot for all things backlinks—whether you’re looking to learn, strategize, or just get some solid links to help up your SEO game. Sounds like a solid place to check out if you’re looking to climb those search engine rankings. Cheers!",

This challenge is compounded by the fact that high-quality backlinks are one of the most significant ranking factors for search engines like Google. According to a survey by Ahrefs, websites with a solid backlink profile are far more likely to rank higher in search results. As digital marketing evolves, so does the need for effective link building strategies. This is where link building automation comes into play, helping agencies and marketers streamline their efforts and improve their SEO results. In this article, we’ll explore the importance of backlinks, delve into effective link building strategies, and discuss how automation can enhance your efforts. We’ll also provide actionable tips and examples to help you implement these strategies effectively. The Importance of Backlinks Understanding Backlinks Backlinks, or inbound links, are links from one website to another. They serve as a vote of confidence for your website, indicating to search engines that your content is valuable and trustworthy. The more quality backlinks you have pointing to your site, the higher your chances of ranking well in search engine results pages (SERPs). How Backlinks Enhance SEO Backlinks are crucial for several reasons: Domain Authority: High-quality backlinks can improve your domain authority, a metric used by search engines to evaluate the credibility and trustworthiness of your website. Websites with higher domain authority tend to rank better. Referral Traffic: Backlinks can drive significant traffic to your site from referring websites. If a user clicks on a link to your website from a reputable source, you’re likely to see a spike in traffic. Improved Search Rankings: Search engines view backlinks as a sign of relevance and authority. A website with a strong backlink profile is more likely to rank higher for competitive keywords. The Impact of Backlinks on Rankings A study by Moz found that backlinks are among the top three factors influencing search rankings. Websites with quality backlinks tend to outperform their competitors, emphasizing the need for effective link building strategies. Understanding Link Building What is Link Building? Link building is the process of acquiring backlinks to your website from other sites. It is a critical component of any SEO strategy, as it directly impacts your search engine rankings. There are several types of links you can pursue: Natural Links: These occur when other websites link to your content without any action on your part. High-quality content is key to attracting natural links. Manual Links: These are acquired through outreach efforts, where you request other websites to link to your content. Self-Created Links: These are created by adding your website link to directories or forums. While easier to obtain, they are often of lower quality and less impactful. Importance of Quality Over Quantity While it may be tempting to focus on acquiring as many backlinks as possible, it’s essential to prioritize quality over quantity. A few high-quality backlinks from authoritative websites can be far more beneficial than numerous low-quality links. Focus on obtaining links from sites within your industry or niche, as they will be more relevant and impactful. Build Quality Backlinks Link building automation software and tools can significantly streamline the process of acquiring quality backlinks, saving time and effort for digital marketers and SEO professionals. These tools offer features like automated outreach, email tracking, and prospecting capabilities to identify high-authority websites relevant to your niche. You can use tools like Linkee, for instance, which provides an intuitive platform that automates outreach and allows users to analyze competitor backlinks while effectively managing relationships. By leveraging advanced algorithms and data analytics, Linkee helps users monitor the effectiveness of their outreach campaigns, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to building a strong backlink profile. Utilizing such software enhances the efficiency of your link building efforts and ultimately contributes to improved search engine rankings. The Role of Automation in Link Building Overview of Link Building Automation Link building automation refers to the use of tools and software to streamline the link acquisition process. Automation can help agencies and marketers save time, maintain consistency, and scale their link building efforts more effectively. However, while automation can significantly enhance efficiency, its effectiveness depends on a well-structured approach. Simply using tools without a strategic framework may not yield sustainable results. For a deeper understanding of how to integrate automation into a scalable and results-driven link-building strategy, refer to a link-building process guide that covers key steps, best practices, and techniques to maximize efficiency. Benefits of Automation Time Efficiency: Automation tools can perform repetitive tasks, such as sending outreach emails or tracking backlinks, freeing up your time for more strategic initiatives. Consistency: Automated processes ensure that your link building efforts are consistent and systematic, which can lead to better results over time. Scalability: As your business grows, so too do your link building needs. Automation allows you to scale your efforts without sacrificing quality. Key Strategies for Effective Link-Building Automation Identifying Target Websites The first step in your link-building strategy is identifying relevant websites to target. Here are some tools and techniques to consider: SEO Tools: Tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, and Moz can help you analyze competitors’ backlink profiles and identify potential link opportunities. Google Search: Performing advanced searches using specific keywords can help you find relevant websites that may be interested in linking to your content. Industry Directories: Look for reputable industry directories where you can submit your website for potential backlinks. Creating Quality Content Quality content is the foundation of any successful link-building strategy. To attract backlinks, your content must be valuable, informative, and shareable. Consider the following types of content that often earn backlinks: In-Depth Guides: Comprehensive, well-researched guides on relevant topics can attract links from bloggers and industry sites. Infographics: Visual content like infographics is highly shareable and can lead to numerous backlinks. Case Studies: Sharing success stories and case studies can position your brand as an authority in your field, leading to more backlinks. Best Practices for Link Building Automation Personalization in Outreach While automation can streamline your outreach efforts, it’s essential to maintain a personal touch. Tailor your outreach messages to each recipient, referencing their content or specific interests to improve response rates. Personalized messages demonstrate that you value their time and are genuinely interested in collaborating. Avoiding Black-Hat Techniques As tempting as it may be to use shortcuts, avoid black-hat link-building techniques, such as buying links or participating in link farms. Engaging in unethical practices can lead to penalties from search engines, severely impacting your rankings. Regularly Updating Strategies The digital marketing landscape is constantly evolving. Stay informed about changes in search engine algorithms and industry trends, and be willing to adjust your link-building strategies accordingly. Regularly reassess your outreach efforts and the quality of your backlinks to ensure ongoing success. Case Studies and Success Stories Agency Example XYZ Digital Marketing Agency implemented a link-building automation strategy that included using BuzzStream for outreach and creating high-quality infographics. Within six months, they saw a 50% increase in referring domains and a significant improvement in organic search traffic. Marketer Example John Doe, a freelance marketer, utilized Mailshake to automate his outreach efforts while focusing on creating in-depth guides. As a result, he secured backlinks from several high-authority websites, leading to a 70% increase in website traffic and improved search rankings. Conclusion Today, effective link-building is more important than ever for improving SEO. By leveraging link-building automation, agencies and marketers can streamline their efforts, save time, and achieve better results. By focusing on the importance of backlinks, implementing quality link-building strategies, and utilizing automation tools, you can enhance your SEO strategy and drive significant growth for your brand.

This challenge is compounded by the fact that high-quality backlinks are one of the most significant ranking factors for search engines like Google. According to a survey by Ahrefs, websites with a solid backlink profile are far more likely to rank higher in search results. As digital marketing evolves, so does the need for effective link building strategies. This is where link building automation comes into play, helping agencies and marketers streamline their efforts and improve their SEO results. In this article, we’ll explore the importance of backlinks, delve into effective link building strategies, and discuss how automation can enhance your efforts. We’ll also provide actionable tips and examples to help you implement these strategies effectively. The Importance of Backlinks Understanding Backlinks Backlinks, or inbound links, are links from one website to another. They serve as a vote of confidence for your website, indicating to search engines that your content is valuable and trustworthy. The more quality backlinks you have pointing to your site, the higher your chances of ranking well in search engine results pages (SERPs). How Backlinks Enhance SEO Backlinks are crucial for several reasons: Domain Authority: High-quality backlinks can improve your domain authority, a metric used by search engines to evaluate the credibility and trustworthiness of your website. Websites with higher domain authority tend to rank better. Referral Traffic: Backlinks can drive significant traffic to your site from referring websites. If a user clicks on a link to your website from a reputable source, you’re likely to see a spike in traffic. Improved Search Rankings: Search engines view backlinks as a sign of relevance and authority. A website with a strong backlink profile is more likely to rank higher for competitive keywords. The Impact of Backlinks on Rankings A study by Moz found that backlinks are among the top three factors influencing search rankings. Websites with quality backlinks tend to outperform their competitors, emphasizing the need for effective link building strategies. Understanding Link Building What is Link Building? Link building is the process of acquiring backlinks to your website from other sites. It is a critical component of any SEO strategy, as it directly impacts your search engine rankings. There are several types of links you can pursue: Natural Links: These occur when other websites link to your content without any action on your part. High-quality content is key to attracting natural links. Manual Links: These are acquired through outreach efforts, where you request other websites to link to your content. Self-Created Links: These are created by adding your website link to directories or forums. While easier to obtain, they are often of lower quality and less impactful. Importance of Quality Over Quantity While it may be tempting to focus on acquiring as many backlinks as possible, it’s essential to prioritize quality over quantity. A few high-quality backlinks from authoritative websites can be far more beneficial than numerous low-quality links. Focus on obtaining links from sites within your industry or niche, as they will be more relevant and impactful. Build Quality Backlinks Link building automation software and tools can significantly streamline the process of acquiring quality backlinks, saving time and effort for digital marketers and SEO professionals. These tools offer features like automated outreach, email tracking, and prospecting capabilities to identify high-authority websites relevant to your niche. You can use tools like Linkee, for instance, which provides an intuitive platform that automates outreach and allows users to analyze competitor backlinks while effectively managing relationships. By leveraging advanced algorithms and data analytics, Linkee helps users monitor the effectiveness of their outreach campaigns, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to building a strong backlink profile. Utilizing such software enhances the efficiency of your link building efforts and ultimately contributes to improved search engine rankings. The Role of Automation in Link Building Overview of Link Building Automation Link building automation refers to the use of tools and software to streamline the link acquisition process. Automation can help agencies and marketers save time, maintain consistency, and scale their link building efforts more effectively. However, while automation can significantly enhance efficiency, its effectiveness depends on a well-structured approach. Simply using tools without a strategic framework may not yield sustainable results. For a deeper understanding of how to integrate automation into a scalable and results-driven link-building strategy, refer to a link-building process guide that covers key steps, best practices, and techniques to maximize efficiency. Benefits of Automation Time Efficiency: Automation tools can perform repetitive tasks, such as sending outreach emails or tracking backlinks, freeing up your time for more strategic initiatives. Consistency: Automated processes ensure that your link building efforts are consistent and systematic, which can lead to better results over time. Scalability: As your business grows, so too do your link building needs. Automation allows you to scale your efforts without sacrificing quality. Key Strategies for Effective Link-Building Automation Identifying Target Websites The first step in your link-building strategy is identifying relevant websites to target. Here are some tools and techniques to consider: SEO Tools: Tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, and Moz can help you analyze competitors’ backlink profiles and identify potential link opportunities. Google Search: Performing advanced searches using specific keywords can help you find relevant websites that may be interested in linking to your content. Industry Directories: Look for reputable industry directories where you can submit your website for potential backlinks. Creating Quality Content Quality content is the foundation of any successful link-building strategy. To attract backlinks, your content must be valuable, informative, and shareable. Consider the following types of content that often earn backlinks: In-Depth Guides: Comprehensive, well-researched guides on relevant topics can attract links from bloggers and industry sites. Infographics: Visual content like infographics is highly shareable and can lead to numerous backlinks. Case Studies: Sharing success stories and case studies can position your brand as an authority in your field, leading to more backlinks. Best Practices for Link Building Automation Personalization in Outreach While automation can streamline your outreach efforts, it’s essential to maintain a personal touch. Tailor your outreach messages to each recipient, referencing their content or specific interests to improve response rates. Personalized messages demonstrate that you value their time and are genuinely interested in collaborating. Avoiding Black-Hat Techniques As tempting as it may be to use shortcuts, avoid black-hat link-building techniques, such as buying links or participating in link farms. Engaging in unethical practices can lead to penalties from search engines, severely impacting your rankings. Regularly Updating Strategies The digital marketing landscape is constantly evolving. Stay informed about changes in search engine algorithms and industry trends, and be willing to adjust your link-building strategies accordingly. Regularly reassess your outreach efforts and the quality of your backlinks to ensure ongoing success. Case Studies and Success Stories Agency Example XYZ Digital Marketing Agency implemented a link-building automation strategy that included using BuzzStream for outreach and creating high-quality infographics. Within six months, they saw a 50% increase in referring domains and a significant improvement in organic search traffic. Marketer Example John Doe, a freelance marketer, utilized Mailshake to automate his outreach efforts while focusing on creating in-depth guides. As a result, he secured backlinks from several high-authority websites, leading to a 70% increase in website traffic and improved search rankings. Conclusion Today, effective link-building is more important than ever for improving SEO. By leveraging link-building automation, agencies and marketers can streamline their efforts, save time, and achieve better results. By focusing on the importance of backlinks, implementing quality link-building strategies, and utilizing automation tools, you can enhance your SEO strategy and drive significant growth for your brand.

Kevin Rowe on May 3, 2023 at 8:00 am | Reading time: 11 minutes Chat with SearchBot Chat with SearchBot Please note that your conversations will be recorded. I am trained with Search Engine Land content. Ask me anything! SearchBot is thinking ... × Powered by Search Engine Land (and love) Close Opinion One of my biggest challenges with designing link building campaigns is that a successful strategy for one website may not work on another. For instance, the technique for an information-heavy affiliate marketing site may yield a different number of links for an ecommerce product page or localized service pages. The techniques below can be used for almost any situation, with varying degrees of scale depending on many factors. But before we get into the strategies, you need to ensure you are using the right one for your company’s situation. Am I using the right link building strategy? Every website and situation is slightly more unique than the last. These variables can be due to the company structure, overall marketing strategy, or the website’s niche. Several factors can make one website harder to build links than others. Below is a list of top questions to help you understand which technique to use and scale based on the website’s current situation. A litmus test for link strategy How many topics are there to discuss in your niche? What type of website will get the links? Are specific link building techniques easier or harder to do in your niche? Is your website in a “Your Money or Your Life” niche (YMYL)? How competitive are your keywords? What type of content is currently available? Or what are your content capabilities? Which pages do you want to rank? What are your prospecting and outreach capabilities? Do you have an in-house team, or are you outsourcing to a link building agency? Do you have a following? Will anyone share your content naturally? Are you focused locally, nationally or internationally? Do you have the time and resources to perform the link building strategy? Asking yourself these questions is the first step before selecting a link building strategy. By understanding these variables, the strategy may yield more links or links to the target website pages. Out of all these questions, the type of website has the most significant impact on which technique is used. Let’s look more into how to select pages for link building. Selecting pages for link building by website type Different websites can produce wildly different types of content or need different pages to rank. Some sites may produce little informational content, like many ecommerce sites, while others build their entire marketing program around informational content production, like educational affiliate sites. The list of website types below has the most common types of websites. Affiliate websites These sites can come in many forms, including blogs, coupon sites, product listicles, product directories, review sites, shopping comparisons and more. Typically, these sites need links to the articles or brand listing pages. Almost any technique below can be used for affiliate websites but guest posting, resource page links, and competitor link building will be very effective in most niches. Marketplace or directories These sites connect buyers and sellers, usually facilitating transactions. Some examples include Etsy, Upwork and Themeforest. Building links directly to the listing pages or informational articles is possible with the strategies below. Ecommerce An ecommerce site will want links to brand, product or category pages to improve ranking. These are one of the most challenging pages to get links for. Guest posting, competitor link building, resource pages, image link building, and product samples can build links to almost any page when done correctly. But my favorite technique is finding unlinked brand mentions of the site’s products. For example, if an ecommerce site sells Nike shoes, find articles mentioning Nike Shoes and ask for a link. However, a direct-to-consumer CPG ecommerce site may have a lot of informational content that can be used for link building. Consider the skyscraper technique and create content that is designed for link building. Online training and certificates These websites can improve enrollment page rankings with links to enrollment pages. These links are difficult to secure, but they use similar techniques to ecommerce. Universities Both online and brick-and-mortar universities likely have a lot of authoritative content, some of which professors can write. Blogs like to cite reputable sources, a unique angle universities can leverage to secure links. These sites will often have a blog but need links to the program pages. I’ve found that building links to informational pages and internally linking to the program pages can yield a lot of natural links. Direct-to-consumer CPG Consumer packaged goods (CPG) that sell directly to consumers via the website tend to produce content heavily and have an ecommerce section. Additionally, they tend to spend a lot of time building brand awareness. Strategies like guest posting, unlinked brand mentions, image link building, product samples, and even blogger roundups can yield many links for these brands. Informational articles or ecommerce pages are ideal targets for links. I highly recommend leveraging HARO with a CPG brand. National with a local focus A company with a national presence but targets local keywords has unique link building challenges. These sites typically have a page for each location, which is ideal for building links. I’ve found great success with travel or even local bloggers finding links to a location page. However, consider creating long-form content to rank for national keywords and not just focus on local. This will ensure you develop a diverse and natural link profile. SaaS and tech (B2B or B2C) A large technology company or startup can find links directly to informational articles, solutions pages, industry pages or informational articles. Competitor link building, guest posting and resource page links can yield a lot of links to these types of pages. A resource link may go directly to a product or homepage, but they are still excellent links. Local services Local businesses tend to have fewer resources to produce content, but a primary focus will mostly be the home, location or service pages. Local sites that attend local events are good sources for a few “low-hanging fruit” links. Still, digital PR, competitor link building and roundup articles for local businesses can secure links for the local market. Travel bloggers listing the business’s city on their site can make sense to link to your website on pages about your city. The strategies below can work for any of the website types listed. However, if the site runs an active content marketing program, specific strategies will work better than others. Get the newsletter search marketers rely on. Business email address Sign me up!

Distribute content through established blogger relationships Since opening my business in 2018, I started building relationships with bloggers. This approach is focused on email outreach to bloggers, authors, or publishers and then securing links through those relationships. An email to someone you know tends to receive a much higher response rate than a cold email, which may receive 1-5% successful response rate. Successful ways to engage a publisher or author include: Meeting at events. Performing a free broken link analysis of their site. Sponsoring or advertising on the website. Contributing to their community. Sharing an exciting story. Sending free product samples. 2. High-quality guest posting and including natural links A guest post is a technique that can either focus on finding guest posting opportunities for team members or building relationships with existing contributors to a site. However, it’s easy to waste time writing articles for low-quality blogs, so ensure you use your time wisely and contribute to high-quality sites. The easiest way to find guest posting opportunities is to go to Google with the search operator {keyword} intitle: “write for us”/”guest author”/”contributor.” Then go down the list and begin pitching article topics. 3. Competitor link building with cold outreach Sites that link to competitors but not your site have been one of my go-to strategies for securing links in any niche. Tools like Ahrefs, Moz, Majestic, and Semrush all have large databases of links. Each tool has features that make it easy to enter one or many competitors to get a list of referring domains and links. Using one of the tools above, enter a competitor domain, find a list of unique referring domains, use a tool like PitchBox or Buzzstream to find a list of emails, then begin outreach. 4. Skyscraper links from top-ranking sites Popularized by Brian Dean, this technique involves: Analyzing top-ranking sites for a given keyword. Building content that creates unique value compared to the top-ranking articles. Reaching out to the sites linking to those articles. Asking them to update their link with yours. First, identify a popular topic, research the best content available, and then create a more comprehensive, up-to-date version. Finally, connect with bloggers and influencers in your niche to ask for backlinks to your content. 5. Journalist pitching with HARO or #journorequest Finding journalists and bloggers searching for sources, data, or information for upcoming articles can increase response rates from these campaigns. Use pitch request lists like Help a Reporter Out (HARO) or #journorequest hashtag on Twitter, develop a pitch deck for a specific subject matter expert at the company, and identify relevant requests. After that, you can contact them by email in HARO, comment on the #journorequest tag thread, or reach out directly on Twitter to the writer making the #journorequest.

Resource page links to homepage or internal pages This approach leverages existing resource pages that list websites, articles, products, or other assets to provide valuable resources for readers. A simple way to get started is to research using Google, Ahrefs or BuzzStream. Use the search operators below, upload to Ahrefs Batch Analysis tool, export the list, filter out low Domain Rating (DR) domains, then upload to BuzzStream to get emails and outreach. “keyword” + inurl:resources “keyword” + intitle:resources “keyword” + intitle:links “keyword” + “useful resources” “keyword” + “useful links” Replace “keyword” with your target keyword(s) or niche-related terms. 7. Image link building through reverse image lookup This strategy is used to create backlinks to a website that already uses imagery from your website but needs to be cited correctly. After identifying these images, outreach and request proper citation and a link. This approach works well when a site has a lot of unique images, ideally that are custom created. Start by doing a reverse image search in Google Images or TinEye and clicking on the image to find the source URL. Then, upload the site list to BuzzStream to begin outreach or use the forms directly on the site. 8. Universal unlinked mention Traditionally, the term was “unlinked brand mentions” to explain a process of finding unlinked mentions of the main company’s brand. However, I use a broad definition to explain “unlinked mentions” and consider it to be any mention of the company, products/services, competitors’ names, or even topically relevant articles. Because this modification to the unlinked brand mentions strategy includes many more keywords, almost every website affiliate website, ecommerce selling brands, CPG, Saas, and startups using PR, to name a few. 9. Earn links by ranking for statistical keywords Having articles with unique statistics will make link building outreach much more effective, but they can also earn links by ranking for keywords with “statistics” or “study” in them. Bloggers and journalists are always searching for sources and data to include in upcoming articles, and many start by googling terms like “SEO statistics.” These can secure links without a single email being sent. For example, an Ahrefs article about 78 SEO Statistics for 2023 ranks in Google at position 1 for “seo statistics” and has almost 2,000 referring domain links. Start by keyword brainstorming to create a list of keywords that look like [keyword] + “statistics” or “study.” Then google the keyword and see what type of studies are showing up. Analyze the top-ranking articles and either create a roundup of statistics online or perform a new study. 10. Link building with podcast websites Podcasting is becoming very prevalent, but not all have a website. Find podcasts with websites where they promote or reuse the content in written form. Podcasts are great for increasing brand awareness, but the objective is to secure a website link that will drive ranking improvement. In your selected niche, Google [keyword]+podcasts to find a podcast website, then visit the website to ensure they summarize the podcast episodes in an article. From this list, listen to each podcast to understand their angle on the topic. Finally, engage with the hosts or other guests on social media and prepare to pitch. Proven link building strategies for any niche Link building remains essential to a successful SEO strategy for websites in various niches. Understand the unique aspects of your website and niche so you can tailor your approach to secure the most effective links. The strategies above can be applied to diverse website types, including affiliate websites, ecommerce platforms, universities, and local businesses. When you ask the right questions and select the appropriate technique for your website, you can dramatically improve rankings or traffic.

Informational articles or ecommerce pages are ideal targets for links. I highly recommend leveraging HARO with a CPG brand. National with a local focus A company with a national presence but targets local keywords has unique link building challenges. These sites typically have a page for each location, which is ideal for building links. I’ve found great success with travel or even local bloggers finding links to a location page. However, consider creating long-form content to rank for national keywords and not just focus on local. This will ensure you develop a diverse and natural link profile. SaaS and tech (B2B or B2C) A large technology company or startup can find links directly to informational articles, solutions pages, industry pages or informational articles. Competitor link building, guest posting and resource page links can yield a lot of links to these types of pages. A resource link may go directly to a product or homepage, but they are still excellent links. Local services Local businesses tend to have fewer resources to produce content, but a primary focus will mostly be the home, location or service pages. Local sites that attend local events are good sources for a few “low-hanging fruit” links. Still, digital PR, competitor link building and roundup articles for local businesses can secure links for the local market. Travel bloggers listing the business’s city on their site can make sense to link to your website on pages about your city. The strategies below can work for any of the website types listed. However, if the site runs an active content marketing program, specific strategies will work better than others. Get the newsletter search marketers rely on. Business email address Sign me up!

Distribute content through established blogger relationships Since opening my business in 2018, I started building relationships with bloggers. This approach is focused on email outreach to bloggers, authors, or publishers and then securing links through those relationships. An email to someone you know tends to receive a much higher response rate than a cold email, which may receive 1-5% successful response rate. Successful ways to engage a publisher or author include: Meeting at events. Performing a free broken link analysis of their site. Sponsoring or advertising on the website. Contributing to their community. Sharing an exciting story. Sending free product samples. 2. High-quality guest posting and including natural links A guest post is a technique that can either focus on finding guest posting opportunities for team members or building relationships with existing contributors to a site. However, it’s easy to waste time writing articles for low-quality blogs, so ensure you use your time wisely and contribute to high-quality sites. The easiest way to find guest posting opportunities is to go to Google with the search operator {keyword} intitle: “write for us”/”guest author”/”contributor.” Then go down the list and begin pitching article topics. 3. Competitor link building with cold outreach Sites that link to competitors but not your site have been one of my go-to strategies for securing links in any niche. Tools like Ahrefs, Moz, Majestic, and Semrush all have large databases of links. Each tool has features that make it easy to enter one or many competitors to get a list of referring domains and links. Using one of the tools above, enter a competitor domain, find a list of unique referring domains, use a tool like PitchBox or Buzzstream to find a list of emails, then begin outreach. 4. Skyscraper links from top-ranking sites Popularized by Brian Dean, this technique involves: Analyzing top-ranking sites for a given keyword. Building content that creates unique value compared to the top-ranking articles. Reaching out to the sites linking to those articles. Asking them to update their link with yours. First, identify a popular topic, research the best content available, and then create a more comprehensive, up-to-date version. Finally, connect with bloggers and influencers in your niche to ask for backlinks to your content. 5. Journalist pitching with HARO or #journorequest Finding journalists and bloggers searching for sources, data, or information for upcoming articles can increase response rates from these campaigns. Use pitch request lists like Help a Reporter Out (HARO) or #journorequest hashtag on Twitter, develop a pitch deck for a specific subject matter expert at the company, and identify relevant requests. After that, you can contact them by email in HARO, comment on the #journorequest tag thread, or reach out directly on Twitter to the writer making the #journorequest.

Resource page links to homepage or internal pages This approach leverages existing resource pages that list websites, articles, products, or other assets to provide valuable resources for readers. A simple way to get started is to research using Google, Ahrefs or BuzzStream. Use the search operators below, upload to Ahrefs Batch Analysis tool, export the list, filter out low Domain Rating (DR) domains, then upload to BuzzStream to get emails and outreach. “keyword” + inurl:resources “keyword” + intitle:resources “keyword” + intitle:links “keyword” + “useful resources” “keyword” + “useful links” Replace “keyword” with your target keyword(s) or niche-related terms. 7. Image link building through reverse image lookup This strategy is used to create backlinks to a website that already uses imagery from your website but needs to be cited correctly. After identifying these images, outreach and request proper citation and a link. This approach works well when a site has a lot of unique images, ideally that are custom created. Start by doing a reverse image search in Google Images or TinEye and clicking on the image to find the source URL. Then, upload the site list to BuzzStream to begin outreach or use the forms directly on the site. 8. Universal unlinked mention Traditionally, the term was “unlinked brand mentions” to explain a process of finding unlinked mentions of the main company’s brand. However, I use a broad definition to explain “unlinked mentions” and consider it to be any mention of the company, products/services, competitors’ names, or even topically relevant articles. Because this modification to the unlinked brand mentions strategy includes many more keywords, almost every website affiliate website, ecommerce selling brands, CPG, Saas, and startups using PR, to name a few. 9. Earn links by ranking for statistical keywords Having articles with unique statistics will make link building outreach much more effective, but they can also earn links by ranking for keywords with “statistics” or “study” in them. Bloggers and journalists are always searching for sources and data to include in upcoming articles, and many start by googling terms like “SEO statistics.” These can secure links without a single email being sent. For example, an Ahrefs article about 78 SEO Statistics for 2023 ranks in Google at position 1 for “seo statistics” and has almost 2,000 referring domain links. Start by keyword brainstorming to create a list of keywords that look like [keyword] + “statistics” or “study.” Then google the keyword and see what type of studies are showing up. Analyze the top-ranking articles and either create a roundup of statistics online or perform a new study. 10. Link building with podcast websites Podcasting is becoming very prevalent, but not all have a website. Find podcasts with websites where they promote or reuse the content in written form. Podcasts are great for increasing brand awareness, but the objective is to secure a website link that will drive ranking improvement. In your selected niche, Google [keyword]+podcasts to find a podcast website, then visit the website to ensure they summarize the podcast episodes in an article. From this list, listen to each podcast to understand their angle on the topic. Finally, engage with the hosts or other guests on social media and prepare to pitch. Proven link building strategies for any niche Link building remains essential to a successful SEO strategy for websites in various niches. Understand the unique aspects of your website and niche so you can tailor your approach to secure the most effective links. The strategies above can be applied to diverse website types, including affiliate websites, ecommerce platforms, universities, and local businesses. When you ask the right questions and select the appropriate technique for your website, you can dramatically improve rankings or traffic.

What are the risks of buying backlinks? 6. How often should I check my backlink profile? Final Thoughts What are Backlinks in SEO? Backlinks, often called “inbound links” or “incoming links,” are simply links from one website to another. If another website links to your site, you have a backlink from them. If you link to another website, they have a backlink from you. It sounds simple, but the impact of these links is huge. Always go for organic backlinks. Avoid the scams of buying backlinks. Types of Backlinks: Dofollow vs. Nofollow Dofollow Backlinks are the gold standard in backlinking. They pass on link equity from the source site to the destination site and help improve your site’s ranking and visibility. Nofollow Backlinks: Introduced to combat spam, no-follow links do not pass on link equity. They are used mainly when linking to an unverified source or in paid links, and while they don’t contribute directly to your website’s ranking, they can still bring in traffic. Why are Backlinks Important? Backlinks are important for SEO because they signal to search engines that others vouch for your content. Think of each backlink as a vote of confidence in the quality of your website. Search engines, like Google, see these votes and think, “Hey, if so many websites are linking to this content, it must be useful and valuable.” This recognition often translates to better rankings on search engine results pages (SERPs), meaning more site visibility. Importance of Getting More Backlinks Now that we understand backlinks and their basic types let’s explore why it’s crucial to keep accumulating these SEO gems. Impact on SEO Backlinks significantly boost your website’s visibility and credibility. Search engines like Google use backlinks as a significant ranking signal. They see these links as endorsements from other sites. Each backlink tells search engines that your content is valuable, credible, and useful. More backlinks typically lead to better search engine rankings, provided they are high quality. It means links from reputable and relevant sites in your industry. As your site climbs up in search rankings, it gains more visibility. This increased visibility translates into more organic traffic as more users discover your site through search results. Furthermore, backlinks can create a snowball effect. The more visible your site is, the more people will link to it, further enhancing your site’s authority and SEO performance. This continuous cycle of gaining backlinks and improving rank is necessary for achieving sustained online presence and success. Relevance Across Different Industries Backlinks are universally beneficial, but their impact can vary across different types of websites and industries: E-commerce Sites: For e-commerce, backlinks can directly influence sales by driving more potential customers to product pages. They also help build brand credibility, which is crucial for online stores. Blogs and Content Platforms: Backlinks significantly boost readership for blogs by improving search rankings and visibility. They can also help establish the blog as a thought leader in its niche. SaaS and B2B Companies: For SaaS (Software as a Service) and B2B (Business to Business) companies, backlinks from industry-specific publications can dramatically increase credibility and attract potential business clients. Local Businesses: For local businesses, backlinks from local news outlets, community blogs, and industry-related local pages can improve local search visibility, which is crucial for driving foot traffic. Educational and Non-Profit Organizations: For these sites, backlinks from authoritative educational and government sites can significantly enhance credibility and visibility, essential for trust and fundraising. By tailoring your backlink-building strategy to your specific industry and focusing on acquiring high-quality backlinks, you can maximize the benefits and see substantial improvements in your website’s performance. Investing in backlinks can be part of your website expenses, but do you know the overall cost of building a website? Read the linked article to find out. How to Get Backlinks: Top 20 Backlinking Strategies Backlinks are the backbone of SEO success, acting as crucial signals to search engines that others value and endorse your content. However, not all backlinks are created equal; the quality, relevance, and method of obtaining these links can significantly impact their effectiveness. Let’s discuss the top 22 backlinking strategies for 2024, which provide you with various techniques to enhance your digital presence and SEO. Each strategy is designed to help you attract high-quality backlinks and boost your website’s search engine rankings. 1. Guest Blogging Guest blogging is a fantastic way to create backlinks, increase exposure, and establish authority in your niche. This strategy involves writing articles for other reputable websites in your industry, with each published piece including a link back to your site. How to Implement Guest Blogging: Identify Target Blogs: Use tools like Moz’s Domain Authority to find authoritative blogs within your industry. These blogs should have a relevant audience interested in your content. Pitch Relevant Topics: Develop content ideas that offer value to the blog’s audience and align with your expertise. Contact the blog owners with your pitch, emphasizing how your post can benefit their readers. Include Natural Backlinks: When crafting your guest post, integrate natural, contextual backlinks to your site. Ensure these links are relevant and add value to the content. Follow Guest Post Guidelines: Respect the host blog’s posting guidelines, including their rules on links, to build a positive relationship for future opportunities. Benefits of Guest Blogging: Reach a New Audience: By publishing on other blogs, you expose your brand to a broader audience, which can lead to increased traffic and followers. Build Industry Relationships: Regular guest blogging can help you build lasting relationships with key influencers and industry leaders, opening the door to more collaboration and backlink opportunities. Enhance SEO: The backlinks obtained through guest blogging are valuable for SEO, helping to boost your site’s visibility and ranking in search engine results. Pro Tip: Aim for quality in the articles you submit and the sites you partner with. High-quality content on reputable sites will yield the best backlink benefits. 2. Find Backlink Opportunities with Top Referral Sources Identifying and leveraging top referral sources is the best backlink strategy. This helps to create backlinks that substantially increase your site’s traffic and SEO ranking. This method involves analyzing where your competitors are getting their backlinks and targeting these sources to gain similar benefits. How to Implement This Strategy: Use Analytics Tools: Tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, Analytify, or Google Analytics can help you identify where your competitors’ traffic is coming from. Look for websites that are driving significant traffic to your competitors. Evaluate the Source: Once you’ve identified potential referral sources, evaluate their relevance and authority in your industry. High-quality sources typically provide the most beneficial backlinks. Reach Out for Collaboration: Contact these top referral sources to discuss potential collaboration opportunities. This could be in the form of guest posts, joint webinars, or other content partnerships that include a backlink to your site. Monitor Your Progress: Keep track of the backlinks you obtain and assess how they impact your site’s traffic and search engine rankings. It will help refine your strategy and focus on the most effective sources. Benefits of Using Top Referral Sources: Highly Targeted Traffic: Backlinks from top referral sources are likely to bring in traffic already interested in your niche, which can lead to higher conversion rates. Improved SEO Rankings: Quality backlinks from authoritative sites can significantly improve your search engine rankings, making your site more visible to potential customers. Establish Authority: Associating with respected names in your industry can boost your brand’s credibility and authority. Pro Tip: Always tailor your pitch to each referral source. Show them how linking to your site or collaborating with you can provide value to their audience. This personalized approach can increase your chances of securing valuable backlinks. 3. Create High-Quality Content That’s Link-Worthy Creating high-quality, link-worthy content is at the heart of any effective SEO backlink strategy. This approach revolves around producing content that naturally attracts backlinks because of its value, uniqueness, or comprehensiveness. How to Implement This Strategy: Identify Popular Topics: Use tools like, Google keyword planner, Google Trends, or Ahrefs to find topics that are currently popular in your industry. These topics often have a higher potential for attracting backlinks. Focus on Quality and Depth: Create content beyond what’s already out there. This could be through comprehensive guides, detailed tutorials, or in-depth case studies that provide valuable insights not easily found elsewhere. Utilize Engaging Formats: Consider diverse formats like infographics, videos, or interactive content that can encourage more shares and links. Visual and interactive content often gets higher engagement than text-only posts. Promote Your Content: Once it is live, promote it through social media, email marketing, and other channels. The more eyes you get on your content, the higher the chance of earning backlinks. Additionally, analyze your social media and email marketing campaigns using GA4 or another tool to identify the most effective channels and scale those efforts. Focusing on high-performing strategies will optimize your overall campaign results. Benefits of Creating Link-Worthy Content: Organic Backlink Growth: High-quality content tends to attract backlinks naturally over time, reducing the need for direct outreach. Enhanced Brand Authority: By consistently producing valuable content, you establish your brand as a thought leader in your industry, which can attract more backlinks from other authorities. Increased User Engagement: Engaging content not only attracts links but also boosts user interaction, leading to higher dwell times and better SEO metrics. Pro Tip: Always keep the user in mind. Content that truly addresses user needs, answers their questions, and solves their problems is more likely to be linked to and shared. A high-quality SEO landing page is more likely to attract backlinks naturally. When your content is informative, well-optimized, and provides value to users, other websites are more inclined to link to it. 4. Writing Statistical Articles as a Strategy to Earn Backlinks One effective strategy to achieve this is by incorporating valuable statistics into your content. Articles with well-researched and credible statistics tend to attract more links, as other content creators often reference these data points. Here’s how you can use statistics to enhance your backlink profile: Conduct Original Research Performing original research and publishing unique data positions your website as an authoritative source. When you provide fresh, relevant statistics, others in your industry will likely cite your findings, resulting in valuable backlinks. For example: Conduct a survey on industry trends or consumer behavior. Publish your findings in a detailed report or blog post. Example title: “2024 E-Commerce Trends: Insights from Our Exclusive Industry Survey.” 2 . Regularly Update Your Statistics Keeping your content updated with the latest statistics ensures it remains relevant and authoritative. Regular updates can also prompt other websites to link to your content as a reliable source. Example: Set a schedule to review and update your articles with new data. Announce updates on social media and in your newsletter. Example title: “Updated: The State of SEO in 2024 – Latest Trends and Statistics.” Benefits of Writing Statistical Articles: Authority Building: Original research and data enhance your credibility, establishing you as a thought leader in your field. High Shareability: Data-driven content is more likely to be cited in articles, reports, and blog posts, leading to high-quality backlinks. Long-Term Relevance: Statistical articles often remain relevant for a long time, providing a continuous source of backlinks as more people discover and reference your data. 5. Broken Link Building Broken link building is the best backlink-building strategy to get backlinks by identifying and replacing dead links on other websites with your own relevant, functioning links. It helps you gain valuable backlinks and improves the user experience on the hosting website by fixing broken links. How to Implement This Strategy: Identify Broken Links: Use tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush to scan relevant websites in your industry for broken links. If you use SEMrush, go to the backlinks report and checkmark the Lost box. You’ll see a list of lost or broken links, as shown in the screenshot below: Create or Identify Replacement Content: Once you’ve found a broken link, create content that can serve as an appropriate replacement or use an existing piece of content that matches the topic. Reach Out to the Webmaster: Contact the site’s owner or webmaster about the broken link. Politely inform them about the broken link and suggest your content as a replacement. Be helpful and courteous in your communication to increase the likelihood of a positive response. Follow-up: If you don’t hear back within a week or so, consider sending a follow-up email. Sometimes, messages can be missed, and a gentle reminder can help. Benefits of Broken Link Building: Improves Web Ecosystem: By helping others fix broken links, you contribute to a better web experience, enhancing your reputation among peers. High Success Rate: Since you’re helping the webmaster fix a problem, this approach often has a higher success rate than other backlinking strategies. Relevant and Contextual Links: Broken link building allows you to place links in highly relevant contexts, improving your SEO more significantly than random backlinks. Pro Tip: Always ensure that your replacement content is highly relevant and offers value. Webmasters are more likely to replace a broken link with your content if it significantly contributes to their site’s quality and user experience. 6. Reclaim Unlinked Mentions Reclaiming unlinked mentions is a straightforward yet powerful technique in your backlink strategy. It involves identifying instances where your brand, product, or content is mentioned online but not linked to your site, and then reaching out to request that these mentions be converted into backlinks. How to Implement This Strategy: Monitor Brand Mentions: Use tools like Google Alerts or Ahrefs to track where your brand or products are mentioned across the web. Identify Unlinked Mentions: Review these mentions to determine which ones do not include a link back to your website. Reach Out Politely: Contact the website owner or author of the content. Politely ask if they would consider adding a link to the mention, pointing out that it would enhance the reader’s experience by providing an easy way to find more information. Provide Precise URL: When requesting the link, provide the exact URL you want them to link to, making it as easy as possible for them to add the link. Benefits of Reclaiming Unlinked Mentions: Low-Hanging Fruit: Since your brand is already mentioned, the site is aware of you, which often makes them more receptive to adding a link. Cost-Effective: This method does not require significant resources or time, making it a cost-effective way to gain backlinks. Increases Credibility and Traffic: Each newly added link enhances your site’s credibility and can directly lead to increased traffic. Pro Tip: Be gracious and professional in your outreach, and always explain the benefit to the audience. Building a good relationship can lead to more backlinks in the future. That’s how to get free backlinks. 7. Get Contextual Links Getting contextual links is a strategy focused on acquiring backlinks within the main content of a page, rather than in sidebars, footers, or other less impactful areas. These links are highly valued because they are often seen by search engines as more relevant and authentic endorsements of your content. How to Implement This Strategy: Create Link-Worthy Content: First, ensure that you have content worth linking to. This could be in-depth articles, innovative research findings, helpful resources, or any content that provides significant value. Identify Target Websites: Look for websites that have written about similar topics. Tools like Ahrefs can help you find articles that already link to similar content and might be interested in your resources. Craft Personalized Outreach: Reach out to the authors or site owners with a personalized message. Explain how your content can add value to their piece and enhance understanding or provide additional resources for their readers. Offer Specific Suggestions: Don’t just ask for a link; suggest where your link could fit into their content. For example, point out a section where they discuss a related topic and explain how your content could provide further insight or data. Benefits of Getting Contextual Links: High Relevance and Authority: Contextual links are more likely to be relevant to the content, which enhances the perceived authority of your website by search engines. Better User Engagement: Because these links are embedded within content that readers are already engaged with, they are more likely to click through, leading to better traffic quality. Improved SEO Impact: Search engines generally give more weight to contextual links, as they are seen as genuine recommendations within relevant content. Pro Tip: Always ensure that the content you’re linking from is relevant to your link’s destination. Relevance is key in making sure that these links contribute positively to your SEO efforts. 8. Get ‘Best X’ List Mentions If you are thinking on how to get high quality backlinks, getting best X list mentions is the best way. Being featured in ‘Best X’ lists is a valuable strategy to secure high-quality backlinks and enhance your brand’s visibility. These lists are often sought after by consumers looking for the top recommendations in a particular category, making them a great source of targeted traffic and credibility. For example, LoginPress published a recent article on 11 Best WordPress Automation Tools + Plugins (Expert Pick 2024) and it mentioned Analytify in the list and gave a backlink. How to Implement This Strategy: Identify Relevant Lists: Search for existing ‘Best X’ or ‘Top Y’ lists in your industry. Use search queries like “best [product/service] in [year]” or “top [industry] tools.” Create List-Worthy Offerings: Ensure that your product, service, or content is outstanding and worthy of inclusion. This may involve improving your offerings or showcasing unique features that set you apart. Reach Out to List Creators: Contact the authors or publishers of these lists. Introduce your product or service and explain why it deserves to be included. Provide them with all the necessary information and any media (images, videos) that could enhance your chances of being listed. Offer Updates for Existing Lists: If you find lists that are slightly outdated, suggest an update to the author, recommending the inclusion of your offering. Highlight any recent awards, improvements, or endorsements that might bolster your case. Benefits of Getting ‘Best X’ List Mentions: High-Quality Backlinks: These lists are typically published by reputable sites within your industry, offering valuable backlinks that can significantly improve your search engine rankings. Increased Visibility and Traffic: Being featured on a ‘Best X’ list can drive highly targeted traffic to your site, as potential customers consult these lists for guidance before making purchases or decisions. Enhanced Brand Reputation: Inclusion in such lists can enhance your brand’s reputation, positioning your offerings as top-tier choices in your market. Pro Tip: Keep an eye on new opportunities by setting alerts for new ‘Best X’ lists in your industry. Being one of the first to get featured when a list is updated can give you a competitive edge. 9. Become a Source for Other Publishers Becoming a reliable source for other publishers is a strategic way to get backlinks. By providing valuable insights, quotes, or unique data that writers and journalists can use in their articles, you can help build backlinks and establish your authority in your industry. How to Implement This Strategy: Establish Expertise: Make sure you or your company are well-versed and credible in your field. This could involve conducting original research, publishing detailed case studies, or consistently producing insightful content. Sign Up for HARO: Help a Reporter Out (HARO) is a platform where journalists seek expert comments on various topics. Respond to relevant queries promptly with detailed and helpful answers. Network with Journalists and Bloggers: Build relationships with key figures in your industry’s media. Regular interaction can make you their go-to source when they need expert insights. Offer Exclusive Data or Insights: If you have unique data or insights, offer them to publishers exclusively. This exclusivity can make the offer more appealing and likely to be used—and linked. Benefits of Becoming a Source for Other Publishers: Quality Backlinks: Links from news sites and reputable blogs are highly valued by search engines and can significantly boost your SEO. Increased Visibility and Credibility: Regular appearances in various publications can enhance your or your company’s profile and credibility within the industry. Establish Authority: By providing expert insights, you position yourself or your business as an authority figure, which can attract more opportunities for exposure and backlinks. Pro Tip: Always be ready with high-quality, quick responses. Journalists often work on tight deadlines, so being prompt can increase your chances of being featured. That’s how to get high quality backlinks for your website. 10. Update Old Content Updating old content is a strategic and often overlooked method of getting backlinks. Refreshing and expanding your existing content not only makes it more relevant and useful for your audience but also attracts new backlinks, as updated content is more likely to be shared and linked to. How to Implement This Strategy: Identify Update-worthy Content: Review your older blog posts, articles, or other content pieces to find those that have performed well in the past but may now be outdated or could be expanded with new information. Enhance and Expand: Update statistics, add new sections, improve explanations, or include recent developments related to the topic. Ensure that the updates add significant value and are not just cosmetic. Relaunch the Content: Once updated, relaunch the content as if it were new. Promote it through newsletters, social media, and other marketing platforms. Reach Out to Previous Linkers: Notify websites that previously linked to the content about the update. They might be interested in sharing the refreshed version, which can lead to additional backlinks. Benefits of Updating Old Content: Improved SEO Performance: Updated content can regain its former glory in search engine rankings, attracting more organic traffic and potential backlinks. Enhanced User Experience: Providing the most current and comprehensive information ensures a better experience for your readers, which can increase shares and backlinks. Cost-Effective: Updating existing content is often less resource-intensive than creating new content from scratch, yet it can yield similar benefits in terms of SEO and user engagement. Pro Tip: When updating content, consider adding interactive elements like videos, infographics, or quizzes to make it more engaging and shareable. This helps retain the current audience and attracts new visitors who may link to your content. 11. Build Free Tools Building free tools that are useful for your target audience is a powerful method of getting backlinks. When you provide something of value at no cost, other websites naturally encourage you to link to your tool as a resource, boosting your SEO and enhancing your brand’s visibility. How to Implement This Strategy: Identify a Need: Research your audience and industry to identify a gap or a frequent challenge that a simple tool could solve. For example, a mortgage calculator for a real estate website, a free headline checker tool or a hashtag generator for social media marketing. Or, you may also be a WordPress developer and can develop free WordPress plugins similar to Analytify. Develop the Tool: Depending on your resources, you can either develop the tool in-house or hire developers. Ensure the tool is user-friendly, visually appealing, and genuinely helpful. Promote the Tool: Launch the tool with a dedicated landing page on your website. Promote it through your social media channels, email newsletters, and by reaching out directly to influencers in your industry who might find it valuable. Monitor Usage and Gather Feedback: Keep track of how the tool is used and actively seek feedback to make improvements. Regular updates can keep the tool relevant and encourage ongoing backlinks and user engagement. Benefits of Building Free Tools: High-Quality Backlinks: Tools that provide real value can attract backlinks from various sources, including blogs, industry websites, and forums. Enhanced Brand Recognition: As your tool gains popularity, it helps enhance your brand recognition and credibility within your industry. Drive Traffic: Free tools can drive significant traffic to your website, not only from direct users but also through the sites that link to the tool. Pro Tip: Include a clear call to action on your tool’s landing page, encouraging users to explore your other offerings or to contact you for more information. It can help convert one-time tool users into regular visitors or even customers. 12. Publish Ultimate Guides Publishing “Ultimate Guides” is a robust strategy to get backlinks. These comprehensive resources cover topics in-depth, providing valuable information that users and other websites want to reference and link to, making them a magnet for high-quality backlinks. Let’s check an example of Analytify’s ultimate guides. These are comprehensive guides where you can find the answer to every possible question a user might have about a particular topic. How to Implement This Strategy: Choose the Right Topic: Select a topic relevant to your industry that hasn’t been exhaustively covered or where you can provide a unique perspective or more in-depth information than currently available. Research Extensively: Gather all available information, statistics, and insights on the topic to ensure your guide is the most comprehensive, covering all aspects. Consider interviewing experts or including case studies for added depth. Structure the Guide Effectively: Organize the content in a logical, easy-to-navigate format. Use sections with clear headings, lists, bullet points, and infographics to make the information accessible and engaging. Optimize for SEO: Use relevant keywords throughout the guide to ensure it ranks well in search engine results. It not only increases visibility but also the likelihood of getting backlinks. Promote the Guide: Share your guide through all available channels — social media, email newsletters, and even webinars. You can also reach out directly to influencers or experts quoted in the guide to encourage them to share it. Benefits of Publishing Ultimate Guides: Authority and Credibility: By providing a detailed and well-researched guide, you establish your brand as an authority in your field, enhancing trust and credibility. Long-Term Traffic: Ultimate guides continue to attract visitors over time, as they remain relevant and useful long after publication. Natural Link Building: Because of the depth and quality of the content, ultimate guides naturally attract backlinks from various sources, including educational institutions, industry forums, and other authoritative websites. Pro Tip: Keep your ultimate guides updated. Regular updates not only maintain but can improve the SEO ranking of the guide, ensuring it continues to attract backlinks and new readers over time. 13. Use Images to Earn Links & Mentions Using images to earn links and mentions is an effective strategy to get backlinks. High-quality, unique images such as infographics, charts, photographs, and illustrations can naturally attract attention and prompt others to share and link to your content. How to Implement This Strategy: Create Unique Visual Content: Develop or commission engaging visual content that stands out. It could be infographics, detailed charts, custom illustrations, or high-quality photographs related to your industry. Optimize Images for SEO: Include relevant keywords in your image file names, alt text, and surrounding content to enhance their discoverability in search engine image searches. For example: Design an infographic that illustrates key industry statistics. Ensure the infographic is easy to understand and visually appealing. Example title: “Infographic: Social Media Usage Statistics 2024.” Share Widely: Post your images on your website, social media platforms, and image sharing sites like Pinterest, Instagram, or Flickr. Also, consider submitting them to popular online galleries or forums relevant to your niche. Offer Embed Codes: Make it easy for others to use and share your images by providing embed codes that include a backlink to your site. This can significantly increase the spread of your visuals and the backlinks they generate. Reach Out to Relevant Parties: Contact bloggers, journalists, and content creators who might be interested in your images. Offer them the use of your visuals for free in exchange for a credit link back to your site. Benefits of Using Images to Earn Links & Mentions: Visual Appeal: Images can break up text-heavy content, making it more appealing and likely to be shared. Increased Engagement: Visual content tends to engage viewers more effectively, increasing the likelihood of shares and backlinks. Enhanced Discoverability: Well-optimized images can appear in search engine results, leading to increased traffic and potential backlinks from various sources. Pro Tip: Regularly update your image content and keep track of where your images are being used. This can help you negotiate backlinks from sites that are using your images without proper attribution. 14. Use Directories (They still work!) Using directories to earn backlinks may seem like an old-school method, but when done correctly, it still can be a valuable SEO backlink strategy. The key is to focus on reputable, industry-specific directories that enhance your online presence and SEO. How to Implement This Strategy: Identify Reputable Directories: Look for directories that are well-regarded within your industry. Avoid low-quality or spammy directories, as they can do more harm than good. Ensure Relevance: Choose directories that are relevant to your business. For example, a local restaurant will benefit from being listed in local business directories and food industry directories. Provide Complete and Accurate Information: When you list your business, include a comprehensive and accurate description, contact information, and a link to your website. This not only helps in SEO but also in driving direct traffic. Monitor Your Listings: Regularly check your directory listings to ensure the information remains accurate and update it as necessary. Benefits of Using Directories: Targeted Exposure: Being listed in industry-specific directories helps you reach a more targeted audience, which can lead to quality traffic. Improved Local SEO: For local businesses, directories play a crucial role in local SEO. Being listed in local business directories helps improve your visibility in local search results. Authority Building: High-quality directories are often seen as authoritative sites. A backlink from such directories can enhance your site’s authority. Pro Tip: Always prioritize quality over quantity when it comes to directories. A few high-quality directory listings are much more beneficial than numerous listings in low-quality directories. 15. Podcast Guesting Podcast Guesting is an increasingly popular way to gain exposure and get backlinks by appearing as an expert on relevant podcasts within your industry. This method not only helps in building your brand but also provides opportunities for hosts to link back to your website in their show notes. With over 500 million listeners and 5 million active podcasts worldwide, the podcasting industry continues to expand, offering exceptional opportunities to enhance authority, link building, and improve search rankings. How to Implement This Strategy: Identify Relevant Podcasts: Research podcasts that are popular in your industry and whose audience aligns with your target market. Tools like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts can help you find appropriate shows. Pitch to Podcast Hosts: Prepare a compelling pitch that highlights your expertise and how it can add value to the podcast. Mention specific topics you can discuss that would interest their listeners. Prepare for the Show: If you’re invited to a podcast, prepare thoroughly. Know your key points, have anecdotes ready, and be able to provide actionable insights for the audience. Promote the Episode: Once the podcast is live, promote it through your own marketing channels. This helps the podcast grow and directs your audience to the episode where they can find the backlink to your site. Benefits of Podcast Guesting: Builds Credibility: Sharing your expertise on podcasts establishes you as an authority in your field. Enhances Personal Branding: Podcast guesting puts a voice to your name, making your personal and business brand more relatable and recognizable. Generates High-Quality Backlinks: Many podcast hosts include a dedicated guest page or show notes that provide backlinks to the guest’s website, which can significantly boost SEO. Expands Network: Interacting with podcast hosts and their audience can lead to new professional relationships and further backlink opportunities. Pro Tip: Always follow up with the host after the episode airs. Thank them for the opportunity, and suggest staying in touch. Building a good relationship may lead to more guest spots or other collaborative opportunities. 16. Influencer Outreach Influencer Outreach is a dynamic strategy to get backlinks by leveraging the reach and authority of influencers in your industry. Collaborating with influencers can significantly amplify your content’s exposure and lead to valuable backlinks from their platforms. How to Implement This Strategy: Identify Key Influencers: Use tools like BuzzSumo, Upfluence, or simply Instagram and YouTube searches to find influencers who resonate with your target audience and have a strong presence in your industry. Build Relationships: Rather than immediately asking for backlinks, focus on building relationships. Engage with their content, offer genuine value, and gradually introduce the idea of collaboration. Propose Collaboration Ideas: Once a relationship is established, propose collaboration ideas that benefit both parties, such as co-authored articles, joint webinars, or cross-promotional contests. Provide High-Quality Content: Ensure that any content provided for the collaboration is of high quality and aligns well with the influencer’s standards and audience expectations. Benefits of Influencer Outreach: Enhanced Brand Exposure: Influencers have a dedicated audience that trusts their recommendations. Collaborating with them can introduce your brand to a broader audience. Quality Backlinks: Influencers typically have well-established websites or social media platforms that can provide high-quality backlinks. Increased Credibility: An association with respected figures in your industry can boost your credibility and authority. Drives Traffic: Effective collaborations often result in direct traffic from the influencer’s platform to yours, as well as improved SEO through backlinks. Pro Tip: Tailor your outreach to each influencer by showing that you understand their work and audience. Personalized approaches are far more effective than generic pitches. 17. Resource Page Link Building Resource page link building involves getting your website listed on pages that curate resources relevant to a particular topic in your industry. How to Implement: Identify Resource Pages: Search for pages that list resources or links in your niche using search queries like “keyword + useful resources.” Reach Out: Contact the administrators of these pages, suggesting that your content or service could be a valuable addition to their list. Provide Value: Explain clearly why your resource benefits their audience, enhancing the appeal of your proposition. Benefits for Backlinking: High-Quality Backlinks: Resource pages often have high domain authority and provide valuable backlinks that improve your site’s SEO. Increased Visibility: Being listed on reputable resource pages can enhance your brand’s credibility and visibility within your industry. Networking Opportunities: Engaging with webmasters and administrators can open doors to future collaborations and link-building opportunities. Pro Tip: Instead of one-off link requests, focus on building long-term relationships with webmasters. Offer to reciprocate by sharing their content or featuring them in your own resource lists. 18. Testimonials and Case Studies Let’s learn how to get backlinks to your websites using testimonials and case studies. Offering to write testimonials for products or services you use or providing detailed case studies can lead to backlinks from respected businesses’ websites. How to Implement: Choose Relevant Vendors: Select products or services that are relevant to your industry and which you genuinely endorse. Write a Testimonial: Contact the provider, offering a testimonial in exchange for a backlink. Publish Case Studies: If you have a compelling user story with a product, offer to create a case study that the provider can feature on their site. Benefits for Backlinking: High-Authority Backlinks: Testimonials and case studies published on reputable vendors’ websites can provide high-authority backlinks, boosting your SEO. Credibility and Trust: Featuring your testimonial or case study on well-known websites enhances your credibility and establishes trust with your audience. Pro Tip: Ensure your testimonials and case studies are authentic and specific. Generic or insincere testimonials are less likely to be accepted. 19. Competitor Backlink Replication Analyze your competitors’ backlink profiles to discover where they are getting their backlinks and target the same sources. How to Implement: Use Backlink Analysis Tools: Tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush can show you where your competitors’ backlinks come from. Target Similar Sources: Contact these sources and propose your content as an additional resource they might consider linking to. Benefits: Proven Link Sources: Since these sources are already linked to competitors in your industry, they are more likely to consider linking to your content as well. Improved SEO: Replicating high-quality backlinks can boost your search engine rankings and increase your site’s authority. Pro Tip: Regularly check your competitors’ backlink profiles to stay updated on new links they acquire and seize timely opportunities. 20. Scholarship Link Building Creating a scholarship and promoting it to educational institutions can secure backlinks from .edu sites, which are highly valued by search engines. For example, Coursera is well known for its scholarships and grants, as well as free courses. How to Implement: Set Up a Scholarship: Design a scholarship relevant to your industry, outlining clear criteria and benefits. Promote to Educational Institutions: Reach out to colleges and universities, informing them about the scholarship and how students can benefit from it. Ensure Proper Listings: Make sure your scholarship is listed on their scholarships or resources pages. Benefits: High-Authority Backlinks: You can get high-authority educational backlinks. This will significantly boost your site’s SEO. Brand Exposure: Promoting a scholarship increases your brand’s visibility and positions your business as socially responsible. Community Engagement: Engaging with educational institutions and students fosters a positive image and community connection. Pro Tip: Promote your scholarship through press releases and social media to maximize exposure and attract more educational institutions to list your scholarship.

A high-quality backlink comes from a reputable and relevant source that shares a similar audience to your own. The site should have authority in its niche, evidenced by its domain authority (DA) and page authority (PA). The backlink should also be contextually integrated into the content, not just randomly placed or in a list of links. Moreover, the linking site should not be involved in spammy practices or link schemes. 2. How many backlinks do I need to improve my SEO? No fixed number of backlinks guarantees improved SEO. The focus should be on the quality of backlinks rather than the quantity. A few high-quality backlinks from authoritative sites can be more beneficial than numerous low-quality ones. SEO improvements are also influenced by other factors, such as on-page SEO, content quality, and user engagement. 3. Are nofollow links worth pursuing? Yes, nofollow links are still worth pursuing. While they don’t pass on link equity, they can still bring valuable traffic to your site and contribute to your brand’s visibility. Additionally, a natural backlink profile should include a mix of dofollow and nofollow links to appear more organic to search engines. 4. How do I get backlinks from top industry sites? To get backlinks from top industry sites, focus on creating valuable content that appeals to the interests and needs of their audience. Engage with these sites through comments, forums, or by sharing their content. You can also reach out directly with a well-crafted pitch for guest posts or suggest content collaborations that provide mutual benefits. 5. What are the risks of buying backlinks? Buying backlinks can lead to severe penalties from search engines like Google, including the possibility of your site being deindexed. Search engines have algorithms designed to detect unnatural linking patterns, and buying links typically violates these guidelines. It’s much safer and more beneficial in the long term to invest in organic backlink strategies. 6. How often should I check my backlink profile? It’s a good practice to check your backlink profile regularly, at least once a quarter. This allows you to monitor the growth and health of your backlinks, identify any potentially harmful links, and strategize ways to get more beneficial backlinks. Tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Google Search Console can help you monitor and analyze your backlink profile effectively.

What are the risks of buying backlinks? 6. How often should I check my backlink profile? Final Thoughts What are Backlinks in SEO? Backlinks, often called “inbound links” or “incoming links,” are simply links from one website to another. If another website links to your site, you have a backlink from them. If you link to another website, they have a backlink from you. It sounds simple, but the impact of these links is huge. Always go for organic backlinks. Avoid the scams of buying backlinks. Types of Backlinks: Dofollow vs. Nofollow Dofollow Backlinks are the gold standard in backlinking. They pass on link equity from the source site to the destination site and help improve your site’s ranking and visibility. Nofollow Backlinks: Introduced to combat spam, no-follow links do not pass on link equity. They are used mainly when linking to an unverified source or in paid links, and while they don’t contribute directly to your website’s ranking, they can still bring in traffic. Why are Backlinks Important? Backlinks are important for SEO because they signal to search engines that others vouch for your content. Think of each backlink as a vote of confidence in the quality of your website. Search engines, like Google, see these votes and think, “Hey, if so many websites are linking to this content, it must be useful and valuable.” This recognition often translates to better rankings on search engine results pages (SERPs), meaning more site visibility. Importance of Getting More Backlinks Now that we understand backlinks and their basic types let’s explore why it’s crucial to keep accumulating these SEO gems. Impact on SEO Backlinks significantly boost your website’s visibility and credibility. Search engines like Google use backlinks as a significant ranking signal. They see these links as endorsements from other sites. Each backlink tells search engines that your content is valuable, credible, and useful. More backlinks typically lead to better search engine rankings, provided they are high quality. It means links from reputable and relevant sites in your industry. As your site climbs up in search rankings, it gains more visibility. This increased visibility translates into more organic traffic as more users discover your site through search results. Furthermore, backlinks can create a snowball effect. The more visible your site is, the more people will link to it, further enhancing your site’s authority and SEO performance. This continuous cycle of gaining backlinks and improving rank is necessary for achieving sustained online presence and success. Relevance Across Different Industries Backlinks are universally beneficial, but their impact can vary across different types of websites and industries: E-commerce Sites: For e-commerce, backlinks can directly influence sales by driving more potential customers to product pages. They also help build brand credibility, which is crucial for online stores. Blogs and Content Platforms: Backlinks significantly boost readership for blogs by improving search rankings and visibility. They can also help establish the blog as a thought leader in its niche. SaaS and B2B Companies: For SaaS (Software as a Service) and B2B (Business to Business) companies, backlinks from industry-specific publications can dramatically increase credibility and attract potential business clients. Local Businesses: For local businesses, backlinks from local news outlets, community blogs, and industry-related local pages can improve local search visibility, which is crucial for driving foot traffic. Educational and Non-Profit Organizations: For these sites, backlinks from authoritative educational and government sites can significantly enhance credibility and visibility, essential for trust and fundraising. By tailoring your backlink-building strategy to your specific industry and focusing on acquiring high-quality backlinks, you can maximize the benefits and see substantial improvements in your website’s performance.

Guest Blogging Guest blogging is a fantastic way to create backlinks, increase exposure, and establish authority in your niche. This strategy involves writing articles for other reputable websites in your industry, with each published piece including a link back to your site. How to Implement Guest Blogging: Identify Target Blogs: Use tools like Moz’s Domain Authority to find authoritative blogs within your industry. These blogs should have a relevant audience interested in your content. Pitch Relevant Topics: Develop content ideas that offer value to the blog’s audience and align with your expertise. Contact the blog owners with your pitch, emphasizing how your post can benefit their readers. Include Natural Backlinks: When crafting your guest post, integrate natural, contextual backlinks to your site. Ensure these links are relevant and add value to the content. Follow Guest Post Guidelines: Respect the host blog’s posting guidelines, including their rules on links, to build a positive relationship for future opportunities. Benefits of Guest Blogging: Reach a New Audience: By publishing on other blogs, you expose your brand to a broader audience, which can lead to increased traffic and followers. Build Industry Relationships: Regular guest blogging can help you build lasting relationships with key influencers and industry leaders, opening the door to more collaboration and backlink opportunities. Enhance SEO: The backlinks obtained through guest blogging are valuable for SEO, helping to boost your site’s visibility and ranking in search engine results. Pro Tip: Aim for quality in the articles you submit and the sites you partner with. High-quality content on reputable sites will yield the best backlink benefits. 2. Find Backlink Opportunities with Top Referral Sources Identifying and leveraging top referral sources is the best backlink strategy. This helps to create backlinks that substantially increase your site’s traffic and SEO ranking. This method involves analyzing where your competitors are getting their backlinks and targeting these sources to gain similar benefits. How to Implement This Strategy: Use Analytics Tools: Tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, Analytify, or Google Analytics can help you identify where your competitors’ traffic is coming from. Look for websites that are driving significant traffic to your competitors. Evaluate the Source: Once you’ve identified potential referral sources, evaluate their relevance and authority in your industry. High-quality sources typically provide the most beneficial backlinks. Reach Out for Collaboration: Contact these top referral sources to discuss potential collaboration opportunities. This could be in the form of guest posts, joint webinars, or other content partnerships that include a backlink to your site. Monitor Your Progress: Keep track of the backlinks you obtain and assess how they impact your site’s traffic and search engine rankings. It will help refine your strategy and focus on the most effective sources. Benefits of Using Top Referral Sources: Highly Targeted Traffic: Backlinks from top referral sources are likely to bring in traffic already interested in your niche, which can lead to higher conversion rates. Improved SEO Rankings: Quality backlinks from authoritative sites can significantly improve your search engine rankings, making your site more visible to potential customers. Establish Authority: Associating with respected names in your industry can boost your brand’s credibility and authority. Pro Tip: Always tailor your pitch to each referral source. Show them how linking to your site or collaborating with you can provide value to their audience. This personalized approach can increase your chances of securing valuable backlinks. 3. Create High-Quality Content That’s Link-Worthy Creating high-quality, link-worthy content is at the heart of any effective SEO backlink strategy. This approach revolves around producing content that naturally attracts backlinks because of its value, uniqueness, or comprehensiveness. How to Implement This Strategy: Identify Popular Topics: Use tools like, Google keyword planner, Google Trends, or Ahrefs to find topics that are currently popular in your industry. These topics often have a higher potential for attracting backlinks. Focus on Quality and Depth: Create content beyond what’s already out there. This could be through comprehensive guides, detailed tutorials, or in-depth case studies that provide valuable insights not easily found elsewhere. Utilize Engaging Formats: Consider diverse formats like infographics, videos, or interactive content that can encourage more shares and links. Visual and interactive content often gets higher engagement than text-only posts. Promote Your Content: Once it is live, promote it through social media, email marketing, and other channels. The more eyes you get on your content, the higher the chance of earning backlinks. Additionally, analyze your social media and email marketing campaigns using GA4 or another tool to identify the most effective channels and scale those efforts. Focusing on high-performing strategies will optimize your overall campaign results. Benefits of Creating Link-Worthy Content: Organic Backlink Growth: High-quality content tends to attract backlinks naturally over time, reducing the need for direct outreach. Enhanced Brand Authority: By consistently producing valuable content, you establish your brand as a thought leader in your industry, which can attract more backlinks from other authorities. Increased User Engagement: Engaging content not only attracts links but also boosts user interaction, leading to higher dwell times and better SEO metrics. Pro Tip: Always keep the user in mind. Content that truly addresses user needs, answers their questions, and solves their problems is more likely to be linked to and shared. A high-quality SEO landing page is more likely to attract backlinks naturally. When your content is informative, well-optimized, and provides value to users, other websites are more inclined to link to it. 4. Writing Statistical Articles as a Strategy to Earn Backlinks One effective strategy to achieve this is by incorporating valuable statistics into your content. Articles with well-researched and credible statistics tend to attract more links, as other content creators often reference these data points. Here’s how you can use statistics to enhance your backlink profile: Conduct Original Research Performing original research and publishing unique data positions your website as an authoritative source. When you provide fresh, relevant statistics, others in your industry will likely cite your findings, resulting in valuable backlinks. For example: Conduct a survey on industry trends or consumer behavior. Publish your findings in a detailed report or blog post. Example title: “2024 E-Commerce Trends: Insights from Our Exclusive Industry Survey.” 2 . Regularly Update Your Statistics Keeping your content updated with the latest statistics ensures it remains relevant and authoritative. Regular updates can also prompt other websites to link to your content as a reliable source. Example: Set a schedule to review and update your articles with new data. Announce updates on social media and in your newsletter. Example title: “Updated: The State of SEO in 2024 – Latest Trends and Statistics.” Benefits of Writing Statistical Articles: Authority Building: Original research and data enhance your credibility, establishing you as a thought leader in your field. High Shareability: Data-driven content is more likely to be cited in articles, reports, and blog posts, leading to high-quality backlinks. Long-Term Relevance: Statistical articles often remain relevant for a long time, providing a continuous source of backlinks as more people discover and reference your data. 5. Broken Link Building Broken link building is the best backlink-building strategy to get backlinks by identifying and replacing dead links on other websites with your own relevant, functioning links. It helps you gain valuable backlinks and improves the user experience on the hosting website by fixing broken links. How to Implement This Strategy: Identify Broken Links: Use tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush to scan relevant websites in your industry for broken links. If you use SEMrush, go to the backlinks report and checkmark the Lost box. You’ll see a list of lost or broken links, as shown in the screenshot below: Create or Identify Replacement Content: Once you’ve found a broken link, create content that can serve as an appropriate replacement or use an existing piece of content that matches the topic. Reach Out to the Webmaster: Contact the site’s owner or webmaster about the broken link. Politely inform them about the broken link and suggest your content as a replacement. Be helpful and courteous in your communication to increase the likelihood of a positive response. Follow-up: If you don’t hear back within a week or so, consider sending a follow-up email. Sometimes, messages can be missed, and a gentle reminder can help. Benefits of Broken Link Building: Improves Web Ecosystem: By helping others fix broken links, you contribute to a better web experience, enhancing your reputation among peers. High Success Rate: Since you’re helping the webmaster fix a problem, this approach often has a higher success rate than other backlinking strategies. Relevant and Contextual Links: Broken link building allows you to place links in highly relevant contexts, improving your SEO more significantly than random backlinks. Pro Tip: Always ensure that your replacement content is highly relevant and offers value. Webmasters are more likely to replace a broken link with your content if it significantly contributes to their site’s quality and user experience. 6. Reclaim Unlinked Mentions Reclaiming unlinked mentions is a straightforward yet powerful technique in your backlink strategy. It involves identifying instances where your brand, product, or content is mentioned online but not linked to your site, and then reaching out to request that these mentions be converted into backlinks. How to Implement This Strategy: Monitor Brand Mentions: Use tools like Google Alerts or Ahrefs to track where your brand or products are mentioned across the web. Identify Unlinked Mentions: Review these mentions to determine which ones do not include a link back to your website. Reach Out Politely: Contact the website owner or author of the content. Politely ask if they would consider adding a link to the mention, pointing out that it would enhance the reader’s experience by providing an easy way to find more information. Provide Precise URL: When requesting the link, provide the exact URL you want them to link to, making it as easy as possible for them to add the link. Benefits of Reclaiming Unlinked Mentions: Low-Hanging Fruit: Since your brand is already mentioned, the site is aware of you, which often makes them more receptive to adding a link. Cost-Effective: This method does not require significant resources or time, making it a cost-effective way to gain backlinks. Increases Credibility and Traffic: Each newly added link enhances your site’s credibility and can directly lead to increased traffic. Pro Tip: Be gracious and professional in your outreach, and always explain the benefit to the audience. Building a good relationship can lead to more backlinks in the future. That’s how to get free backlinks. 7. Get Contextual Links Getting contextual links is a strategy focused on acquiring backlinks within the main content of a page, rather than in sidebars, footers, or other less impactful areas. These links are highly valued because they are often seen by search engines as more relevant and authentic endorsements of your content. How to Implement This Strategy: Create Link-Worthy Content: First, ensure that you have content worth linking to. This could be in-depth articles, innovative research findings, helpful resources, or any content that provides significant value. Identify Target Websites: Look for websites that have written about similar topics. Tools like Ahrefs can help you find articles that already link to similar content and might be interested in your resources. Craft Personalized Outreach: Reach out to the authors or site owners with a personalized message. Explain how your content can add value to their piece and enhance understanding or provide additional resources for their readers. Offer Specific Suggestions: Don’t just ask for a link; suggest where your link could fit into their content. For example, point out a section where they discuss a related topic and explain how your content could provide further insight or data. Benefits of Getting Contextual Links: High Relevance and Authority: Contextual links are more likely to be relevant to the content, which enhances the perceived authority of your website by search engines. Better User Engagement: Because these links are embedded within content that readers are already engaged with, they are more likely to click through, leading to better traffic quality. Improved SEO Impact: Search engines generally give more weight to contextual links, as they are seen as genuine recommendations within relevant content. Pro Tip: Always ensure that the content you’re linking from is relevant to your link’s destination. Relevance is key in making sure that these links contribute positively to your SEO efforts. 8. Get ‘Best X’ List Mentions If you are thinking on how to get high quality backlinks, getting best X list mentions is the best way. Being featured in ‘Best X’ lists is a valuable strategy to secure high-quality backlinks and enhance your brand’s visibility. These lists are often sought after by consumers looking for the top recommendations in a particular category, making them a great source of targeted traffic and credibility. For example, LoginPress published a recent article on 11 Best WordPress Automation Tools + Plugins (Expert Pick 2024) and it mentioned Analytify in the list and gave a backlink. How to Implement This Strategy: Identify Relevant Lists: Search for existing ‘Best X’ or ‘Top Y’ lists in your industry. Use search queries like “best [product/service] in [year]” or “top [industry] tools.” Create List-Worthy Offerings: Ensure that your product, service, or content is outstanding and worthy of inclusion. This may involve improving your offerings or showcasing unique features that set you apart. Reach Out to List Creators: Contact the authors or publishers of these lists. Introduce your product or service and explain why it deserves to be included. Provide them with all the necessary information and any media (images, videos) that could enhance your chances of being listed. Offer Updates for Existing Lists: If you find lists that are slightly outdated, suggest an update to the author, recommending the inclusion of your offering. Highlight any recent awards, improvements, or endorsements that might bolster your case. Benefits of Getting ‘Best X’ List Mentions: High-Quality Backlinks: These lists are typically published by reputable sites within your industry, offering valuable backlinks that can significantly improve your search engine rankings. Increased Visibility and Traffic: Being featured on a ‘Best X’ list can drive highly targeted traffic to your site, as potential customers consult these lists for guidance before making purchases or decisions. Enhanced Brand Reputation: Inclusion in such lists can enhance your brand’s reputation, positioning your offerings as top-tier choices in your market. Pro Tip: Keep an eye on new opportunities by setting alerts for new ‘Best X’ lists in your industry. Being one of the first to get featured when a list is updated can give you a competitive edge. 9. Become a Source for Other Publishers Becoming a reliable source for other publishers is a strategic way to get backlinks. By providing valuable insights, quotes, or unique data that writers and journalists can use in their articles, you can help build backlinks and establish your authority in your industry. How to Implement This Strategy: Establish Expertise: Make sure you or your company are well-versed and credible in your field. This could involve conducting original research, publishing detailed case studies, or consistently producing insightful content. Sign Up for HARO: Help a Reporter Out (HARO) is a platform where journalists seek expert comments on various topics. Respond to relevant queries promptly with detailed and helpful answers. Network with Journalists and Bloggers: Build relationships with key figures in your industry’s media. Regular interaction can make you their go-to source when they need expert insights. Offer Exclusive Data or Insights: If you have unique data or insights, offer them to publishers exclusively. This exclusivity can make the offer more appealing and likely to be used—and linked. Benefits of Becoming a Source for Other Publishers: Quality Backlinks: Links from news sites and reputable blogs are highly valued by search engines and can significantly boost your SEO. Increased Visibility and Credibility: Regular appearances in various publications can enhance your or your company’s profile and credibility within the industry. Establish Authority: By providing expert insights, you position yourself or your business as an authority figure, which can attract more opportunities for exposure and backlinks. Pro Tip: Always be ready with high-quality, quick responses. Journalists often work on tight deadlines, so being prompt can increase your chances of being featured. That’s how to get high quality backlinks for your website. 10. Update Old Content Updating old content is a strategic and often overlooked method of getting backlinks. Refreshing and expanding your existing content not only makes it more relevant and useful for your audience but also attracts new backlinks, as updated content is more likely to be shared and linked to. How to Implement This Strategy: Identify Update-worthy Content: Review your older blog posts, articles, or other content pieces to find those that have performed well in the past but may now be outdated or could be expanded with new information. Enhance and Expand: Update statistics, add new sections, improve explanations, or include recent developments related to the topic. Ensure that the updates add significant value and are not just cosmetic. Relaunch the Content: Once updated, relaunch the content as if it were new. Promote it through newsletters, social media, and other marketing platforms. Reach Out to Previous Linkers: Notify websites that previously linked to the content about the update. They might be interested in sharing the refreshed version, which can lead to additional backlinks. Benefits of Updating Old Content: Improved SEO Performance: Updated content can regain its former glory in search engine rankings, attracting more organic traffic and potential backlinks. Enhanced User Experience: Providing the most current and comprehensive information ensures a better experience for your readers, which can increase shares and backlinks. Cost-Effective: Updating existing content is often less resource-intensive than creating new content from scratch, yet it can yield similar benefits in terms of SEO and user engagement. Pro Tip: When updating content, consider adding interactive elements like videos, infographics, or quizzes to make it more engaging and shareable. This helps retain the current audience and attracts new visitors who may link to your content. 11. Build Free Tools Building free tools that are useful for your target audience is a powerful method of getting backlinks. When you provide something of value at no cost, other websites naturally encourage you to link to your tool as a resource, boosting your SEO and enhancing your brand’s visibility. How to Implement This Strategy: Identify a Need: Research your audience and industry to identify a gap or a frequent challenge that a simple tool could solve. For example, a mortgage calculator for a real estate website, a free headline checker tool or a hashtag generator for social media marketing. Or, you may also be a WordPress developer and can develop free WordPress plugins similar to Analytify. Develop the Tool: Depending on your resources, you can either develop the tool in-house or hire developers. Ensure the tool is user-friendly, visually appealing, and genuinely helpful. Promote the Tool: Launch the tool with a dedicated landing page on your website. Promote it through your social media channels, email newsletters, and by reaching out directly to influencers in your industry who might find it valuable. Monitor Usage and Gather Feedback: Keep track of how the tool is used and actively seek feedback to make improvements. Regular updates can keep the tool relevant and encourage ongoing backlinks and user engagement. Benefits of Building Free Tools: High-Quality Backlinks: Tools that provide real value can attract backlinks from various sources, including blogs, industry websites, and forums. Enhanced Brand Recognition: As your tool gains popularity, it helps enhance your brand recognition and credibility within your industry. Drive Traffic: Free tools can drive significant traffic to your website, not only from direct users but also through the sites that link to the tool. Pro Tip: Include a clear call to action on your tool’s landing page, encouraging users to explore your other offerings or to contact you for more information. It can help convert one-time tool users into regular visitors or even customers. 12. Publish Ultimate Guides Publishing “Ultimate Guides” is a robust strategy to get backlinks. These comprehensive resources cover topics in-depth, providing valuable information that users and other websites want to reference and link to, making them a magnet for high-quality backlinks. Let’s check an example of Analytify’s ultimate guides. These are comprehensive guides where you can find the answer to every possible question a user might have about a particular topic. How to Implement This Strategy: Choose the Right Topic: Select a topic relevant to your industry that hasn’t been exhaustively covered or where you can provide a unique perspective or more in-depth information than currently available. Research Extensively: Gather all available information, statistics, and insights on the topic to ensure your guide is the most comprehensive, covering all aspects. Consider interviewing experts or including case studies for added depth. Structure the Guide Effectively: Organize the content in a logical, easy-to-navigate format. Use sections with clear headings, lists, bullet points, and infographics to make the information accessible and engaging. Optimize for SEO: Use relevant keywords throughout the guide to ensure it ranks well in search engine results. It not only increases visibility but also the likelihood of getting backlinks. Promote the Guide: Share your guide through all available channels — social media, email newsletters, and even webinars. You can also reach out directly to influencers or experts quoted in the guide to encourage them to share it. Benefits of Publishing Ultimate Guides: Authority and Credibility: By providing a detailed and well-researched guide, you establish your brand as an authority in your field, enhancing trust and credibility. Long-Term Traffic: Ultimate guides continue to attract visitors over time, as they remain relevant and useful long after publication. Natural Link Building: Because of the depth and quality of the content, ultimate guides naturally attract backlinks from various sources, including educational institutions, industry forums, and other authoritative websites. Pro Tip: Keep your ultimate guides updated. Regular updates not only maintain but can improve the SEO ranking of the guide, ensuring it continues to attract backlinks and new readers over time. 13. Use Images to Earn Links & Mentions Using images to earn links and mentions is an effective strategy to get backlinks. High-quality, unique images such as infographics, charts, photographs, and illustrations can naturally attract attention and prompt others to share and link to your content. How to Implement This Strategy: Create Unique Visual Content: Develop or commission engaging visual content that stands out. It could be infographics, detailed charts, custom illustrations, or high-quality photographs related to your industry. Optimize Images for SEO: Include relevant keywords in your image file names, alt text, and surrounding content to enhance their discoverability in search engine image searches. For example: Design an infographic that illustrates key industry statistics. Ensure the infographic is easy to understand and visually appealing. Example title: “Infographic: Social Media Usage Statistics 2024.” Share Widely: Post your images on your website, social media platforms, and image sharing sites like Pinterest, Instagram, or Flickr. Also, consider submitting them to popular online galleries or forums relevant to your niche. Offer Embed Codes: Make it easy for others to use and share your images by providing embed codes that include a backlink to your site. This can significantly increase the spread of your visuals and the backlinks they generate. Reach Out to Relevant Parties: Contact bloggers, journalists, and content creators who might be interested in your images. Offer them the use of your visuals for free in exchange for a credit link back to your site. Benefits of Using Images to Earn Links & Mentions: Visual Appeal: Images can break up text-heavy content, making it more appealing and likely to be shared. Increased Engagement: Visual content tends to engage viewers more effectively, increasing the likelihood of shares and backlinks. Enhanced Discoverability: Well-optimized images can appear in search engine results, leading to increased traffic and potential backlinks from various sources. Pro Tip: Regularly update your image content and keep track of where your images are being used. This can help you negotiate backlinks from sites that are using your images without proper attribution. 14. Use Directories (They still work!) Using directories to earn backlinks may seem like an old-school method, but when done correctly, it still can be a valuable SEO backlink strategy. The key is to focus on reputable, industry-specific directories that enhance your online presence and SEO. How to Implement This Strategy: Identify Reputable Directories: Look for directories that are well-regarded within your industry. Avoid low-quality or spammy directories, as they can do more harm than good. Ensure Relevance: Choose directories that are relevant to your business. For example, a local restaurant will benefit from being listed in local business directories and food industry directories. Provide Complete and Accurate Information: When you list your business, include a comprehensive and accurate description, contact information, and a link to your website. This not only helps in SEO but also in driving direct traffic. Monitor Your Listings: Regularly check your directory listings to ensure the information remains accurate and update it as necessary. Benefits of Using Directories: Targeted Exposure: Being listed in industry-specific directories helps you reach a more targeted audience, which can lead to quality traffic. Improved Local SEO: For local businesses, directories play a crucial role in local SEO. Being listed in local business directories helps improve your visibility in local search results. Authority Building: High-quality directories are often seen as authoritative sites. A backlink from such directories can enhance your site’s authority. Pro Tip: Always prioritize quality over quantity when it comes to directories. A few high-quality directory listings are much more beneficial than numerous listings in low-quality directories. 15. Podcast Guesting Podcast Guesting is an increasingly popular way to gain exposure and get backlinks by appearing as an expert on relevant podcasts within your industry. This method not only helps in building your brand but also provides opportunities for hosts to link back to your website in their show notes. With over 500 million listeners and 5 million active podcasts worldwide, the podcasting industry continues to expand, offering exceptional opportunities to enhance authority, link building, and improve search rankings. How to Implement This Strategy: Identify Relevant Podcasts: Research podcasts that are popular in your industry and whose audience aligns with your target market. Tools like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts can help you find appropriate shows. Pitch to Podcast Hosts: Prepare a compelling pitch that highlights your expertise and how it can add value to the podcast. Mention specific topics you can discuss that would interest their listeners. Prepare for the Show: If you’re invited to a podcast, prepare thoroughly. Know your key points, have anecdotes ready, and be able to provide actionable insights for the audience. Promote the Episode: Once the podcast is live, promote it through your own marketing channels. This helps the podcast grow and directs your audience to the episode where they can find the backlink to your site. Benefits of Podcast Guesting: Builds Credibility: Sharing your expertise on podcasts establishes you as an authority in your field. Enhances Personal Branding: Podcast guesting puts a voice to your name, making your personal and business brand more relatable and recognizable. Generates High-Quality Backlinks: Many podcast hosts include a dedicated guest page or show notes that provide backlinks to the guest’s website, which can significantly boost SEO. Expands Network: Interacting with podcast hosts and their audience can lead to new professional relationships and further backlink opportunities. Pro Tip: Always follow up with the host after the episode airs. Thank them for the opportunity, and suggest staying in touch. Building a good relationship may lead to more guest spots or other collaborative opportunities. 16. Influencer Outreach Influencer Outreach is a dynamic strategy to get backlinks by leveraging the reach and authority of influencers in your industry. Collaborating with influencers can significantly amplify your content’s exposure and lead to valuable backlinks from their platforms. How to Implement This Strategy: Identify Key Influencers: Use tools like BuzzSumo, Upfluence, or simply Instagram and YouTube searches to find influencers who resonate with your target audience and have a strong presence in your industry. Build Relationships: Rather than immediately asking for backlinks, focus on building relationships. Engage with their content, offer genuine value, and gradually introduce the idea of collaboration. Propose Collaboration Ideas: Once a relationship is established, propose collaboration ideas that benefit both parties, such as co-authored articles, joint webinars, or cross-promotional contests. Provide High-Quality Content: Ensure that any content provided for the collaboration is of high quality and aligns well with the influencer’s standards and audience expectations. Benefits of Influencer Outreach: Enhanced Brand Exposure: Influencers have a dedicated audience that trusts their recommendations. Collaborating with them can introduce your brand to a broader audience. Quality Backlinks: Influencers typically have well-established websites or social media platforms that can provide high-quality backlinks. Increased Credibility: An association with respected figures in your industry can boost your credibility and authority. Drives Traffic: Effective collaborations often result in direct traffic from the influencer’s platform to yours, as well as improved SEO through backlinks. Pro Tip: Tailor your outreach to each influencer by showing that you understand their work and audience. Personalized approaches are far more effective than generic pitches. 17. Resource Page Link Building Resource page link building involves getting your website listed on pages that curate resources relevant to a particular topic in your industry. How to Implement: Identify Resource Pages: Search for pages that list resources or links in your niche using search queries like “keyword + useful resources.” Reach Out: Contact the administrators of these pages, suggesting that your content or service could be a valuable addition to their list. Provide Value: Explain clearly why your resource benefits their audience, enhancing the appeal of your proposition. Benefits for Backlinking: High-Quality Backlinks: Resource pages often have high domain authority and provide valuable backlinks that improve your site’s SEO. Increased Visibility: Being listed on reputable resource pages can enhance your brand’s credibility and visibility within your industry. Networking Opportunities: Engaging with webmasters and administrators can open doors to future collaborations and link-building opportunities. Pro Tip: Instead of one-off link requests, focus on building long-term relationships with webmasters. Offer to reciprocate by sharing their content or featuring them in your own resource lists. 18. Testimonials and Case Studies Let’s learn how to get backlinks to your websites using testimonials and case studies. Offering to write testimonials for products or services you use or providing detailed case studies can lead to backlinks from respected businesses’ websites. How to Implement: Choose Relevant Vendors: Select products or services that are relevant to your industry and which you genuinely endorse. Write a Testimonial: Contact the provider, offering a testimonial in exchange for a backlink. Publish Case Studies: If you have a compelling user story with a product, offer to create a case study that the provider can feature on their site. Benefits for Backlinking: High-Authority Backlinks: Testimonials and case studies published on reputable vendors’ websites can provide high-authority backlinks, boosting your SEO. Credibility and Trust: Featuring your testimonial or case study on well-known websites enhances your credibility and establishes trust with your audience. Pro Tip: Ensure your testimonials and case studies are authentic and specific. Generic or insincere testimonials are less likely to be accepted. 19. Competitor Backlink Replication Analyze your competitors’ backlink profiles to discover where they are getting their backlinks and target the same sources. How to Implement: Use Backlink Analysis Tools: Tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush can show you where your competitors’ backlinks come from. Target Similar Sources: Contact these sources and propose your content as an additional resource they might consider linking to. Benefits: Proven Link Sources: Since these sources are already linked to competitors in your industry, they are more likely to consider linking to your content as well. Improved SEO: Replicating high-quality backlinks can boost your search engine rankings and increase your site’s authority. Pro Tip: Regularly check your competitors’ backlink profiles to stay updated on new links they acquire and seize timely opportunities. 20. Scholarship Link Building Creating a scholarship and promoting it to educational institutions can secure backlinks from .edu sites, which are highly valued by search engines. For example, Coursera is well known for its scholarships and grants, as well as free courses. How to Implement: Set Up a Scholarship: Design a scholarship relevant to your industry, outlining clear criteria and benefits. Promote to Educational Institutions: Reach out to colleges and universities, informing them about the scholarship and how students can benefit from it. Ensure Proper Listings: Make sure your scholarship is listed on their scholarships or resources pages. Benefits: High-Authority Backlinks: You can get high-authority educational backlinks. This will significantly boost your site’s SEO. Brand Exposure: Promoting a scholarship increases your brand’s visibility and positions your business as socially responsible. Community Engagement: Engaging with educational institutions and students fosters a positive image and community connection. Pro Tip: Promote your scholarship through press releases and social media to maximize exposure and attract more educational institutions to list your scholarship.

A high-quality backlink comes from a reputable and relevant source that shares a similar audience to your own. The site should have authority in its niche, evidenced by its domain authority (DA) and page authority (PA). The backlink should also be contextually integrated into the content, not just randomly placed or in a list of links. Moreover, the linking site should not be involved in spammy practices or link schemes. 2. How many backlinks do I need to improve my SEO? No fixed number of backlinks guarantees improved SEO. The focus should be on the quality of backlinks rather than the quantity. A few high-quality backlinks from authoritative sites can be more beneficial than numerous low-quality ones. SEO improvements are also influenced by other factors, such as on-page SEO, content quality, and user engagement. 3. Are nofollow links worth pursuing? Yes, nofollow links are still worth pursuing. While they don’t pass on link equity, they can still bring valuable traffic to your site and contribute to your brand’s visibility. Additionally, a natural backlink profile should include a mix of dofollow and nofollow links to appear more organic to search engines. 4. How do I get backlinks from top industry sites? To get backlinks from top industry sites, focus on creating valuable content that appeals to the interests and needs of their audience. Engage with these sites through comments, forums, or by sharing their content. You can also reach out directly with a well-crafted pitch for guest posts or suggest content collaborations that provide mutual benefits. 5. What are the risks of buying backlinks? Buying backlinks can lead to severe penalties from search engines like Google, including the possibility of your site being deindexed. Search engines have algorithms designed to detect unnatural linking patterns, and buying links typically violates these guidelines. It’s much safer and more beneficial in the long term to invest in organic backlink strategies. 6. How often should I check my backlink profile? It’s a good practice to check your backlink profile regularly, at least once a quarter. This allows you to monitor the growth and health of your backlinks, identify any potentially harmful links, and strategize ways to get more beneficial backlinks. Tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Google Search Console can help you monitor and analyze your backlink profile effectively.

We’re not just saying that, over the years of doing off-page SEO we are proud to have built up some wonderful relationships with trade publications, niche specific digital magazines and wider news sites, as a consequence we have earned some powerful and important links for our clients. That being said, traditional digital PR and news tactics are not the only way you can drive links for your website. At Varn we leverage multiple methods, (depending on the client niche), and have seen some great results both in terms of coverage and ranking movements. Here we look at the methods you can use to drive backlinks without creating news-worthy content. 1. Unlinked Mentions Unlinked mentions occur when your brand is referenced without a link. By identifying these mentions and requesting a link, you can enhance backlinks, improve SEO, and increase traffic. This strategy leverages existing content that already acknowledges your brand, boosting its authority and visibility. If for example your brand has been mentioned in an online magazine due to some PR coverage, but has not provided a link back, this represents a warm opportunity to reach out. 2. Image Link Building The image link building tactic uses high-quality visuals like infographics to attract backlinks. Sharing these images encourages other sites to link back to your website. This method drives traffic, improves search engine rankings, and ensures images are discoverable with proper optimisation. This can range from infographics to industry relevant images. Sites like Flickr and Unsplash can be used to publish these images, you can then use the correct Creative Commons licence so that people that use images must link back. 3. Link placement outreach Link placement outreach involves contacting website owners to include your link in their content. Researching relevant sites and crafting personalised messages can increase success. This strategy enhances your backlink profile, drives targeted traffic, and improves SEO by associating with trusted sources. The key here is to make it worth their while, this can be done through an offer to share the content on your socials, (if you have good reach), or through optimising another element of content. 4. Broken link building The broken link building tactic finds and replaces broken links on other websites with your content. This helps webmasters maintain their sites and provides you with high-quality backlinks. By identifying broken links and reaching out with helpful suggestions, you can boost your backlink profile and SEO. You can look for both broken links to competitor sites or your websites. 5. Partner link outreach The partner link building tactic involves collaborating with industry partners to secure backlinks.

We’re not just saying that, over the years of doing off-page SEO we are proud to have built up some wonderful relationships with trade publications, niche specific digital magazines and wider news sites, as a consequence we have earned some powerful and important links for our clients. That being said, traditional digital PR and news tactics are not the only way you can drive links for your website. At Varn we leverage multiple methods, (depending on the client niche), and have seen some great results both in terms of coverage and ranking movements. Here we look at the methods you can use to drive backlinks without creating news-worthy content. 1. Unlinked Mentions Unlinked mentions occur when your brand is referenced without a link. By identifying these mentions and requesting a link, you can enhance backlinks, improve SEO, and increase traffic. This strategy leverages existing content that already acknowledges your brand, boosting its authority and visibility. If for example your brand has been mentioned in an online magazine due to some PR coverage, but has not provided a link back, this represents a warm opportunity to reach out. 2. Image Link Building The image link building tactic uses high-quality visuals like infographics to attract backlinks. Sharing these images encourages other sites to link back to your website. This method drives traffic, improves search engine rankings, and ensures images are discoverable with proper optimisation. This can range from infographics to industry relevant images. Sites like Flickr and Unsplash can be used to publish these images, you can then use the correct Creative Commons licence so that people that use images must link back. 3. Link placement outreach Link placement outreach involves contacting website owners to include your link in their content. Researching relevant sites and crafting personalised messages can increase success. This strategy enhances your backlink profile, drives targeted traffic, and improves SEO by associating with trusted sources. The key here is to make it worth their while, this can be done through an offer to share the content on your socials, (if you have good reach), or through optimising another element of content. 4. Broken link building The broken link building tactic finds and replaces broken links on other websites with your content. This helps webmasters maintain their sites and provides you with high-quality backlinks. By identifying broken links and reaching out with helpful suggestions, you can boost your backlink profile and SEO. You can look for both broken links to competitor sites or your websites. 5. Partner link outreach The partner link building tactic involves collaborating with industry partners to secure backlinks. By establishing mutual relationships, you can cross-promote and share content, diversifying your backlink portfolio. This strategy expands your reach, drives traffic, and enhances SEO through credible links. This can be done through trade industry contacts or clients of your website.

This is because when it comes to link building quality always has a higher priority than quantity. To elaborate, one high-quality backlink is often better than several low-quality backlinks. However, you’ll often see some SEOs finding it difficult whenever they have to define what it actually means to have a powerful backlink. So, let us explain it all today. The Main Factors of a Powerful Backlink? To put it simply, powerful backlinks are the ones that bring the most impact to a website. However, different SEOs give different priorities to these factors. However, in any case, adding all these factors to your checklist will ensure you can effectively gauge whether you’re building powerful backlinks or not. Do-Follow/No-Follow Whether a backlink is Do-Follow or No-Follow is often considered the first step as SEOs start weighing the quality of a backlink. Knowing the right backlinks types for ranking can be crucial for your SEO strategy. Do-Follow backlinks are generally considered better as they directly pass link juice, signaling to Google that the website linking to you trusts you. However, this does not mean that No-Follow links aren’t useful. In fact, we busted this myth years ago! DR/DA Strength Another factor to gauge whether you have powerful backlinks in your profile is to check DA/DR. Domain Authority (DA) is a metric by Moz that calculates the authority of a website. Domain Rating (DR) by Ahrefs, is the other equivalent made for the same purpose. What you’re looking for is either of them to be high. The higher the DA/DR of the website linking to you, the more authority it likely has with Google. However, according to Xamsor, DA can be manipulated, and even DR can be manipulated. So, when someone tells you to buy high DA backlinks, keep in mind that this metric isn’t the sole factor of quality. The main idea is to check whether the website linking to you is trustworthy or not. A quick audit can provide valuable insights into the credibility and authority of these referring domains. Relevance Now this is a factor that consumes time for SEOs every time. In order to check for relevance in a backlink, you’ll have to not only check whether the linking domain operates in your niche but also observe the context in which your website’s backlink has been placed. Even if you’re unable to find a relation between the linking domain and your niche, the context of the backlink’s placement will tell you whether it has been placed right or should be disavowed. Link Position Link Position is another important factor in gauging whether you have powerful backlinks. The backlinks you’ll earn from natural link-building techniques are the ones that should be present within the body of the page, instead of popping up in the header or footer. Traffic One of the major aspects in determining whether you have a powerful backlink is the amount of traffic that trickles down to your website from it. White-hat backlinks, with everything done right, should bring you organic traffic. In fact, the most powerful backlinks are the ones that bring authority and traffic to provide maximum ROI. Anchor Text The Anchor Text is basically the highlighted text that a user clicks leading them to another page. We have a complete blog piece on the Importance of Anchor Texts for Link Building. The clickable text in the hyperlink you see in the previous sentence is an anchor text, and we purposely used it in context to showcase how to do it right. Similarly, when you’re weighing whether you have scored powerful backlinks, you’ll need to check anchor text to check whether it’s done right or not. What Types of Links are the Most Powerful? Now that you have an idea of the factors that lead to a powerful backlink, we can discuss the types of powerful backlinks that bring maximum ROI. Editorial Links Editorial Links are mostly earned through blog content. Moreover, these links are also mostly present in blog pieces. Editorial links are the ones that Google emphasizes websites to actively pursue. This is so because editorial links are the most natural ones. An editorial link is earned when a person writing a blog post uses information stated by you to add more authenticity to their work. For example, if you state a fact from an original study, others writing in the same niche who find it insightful will likely quote you on it while linking to your website. However, based on the definition, editorial links are ones that are earned based solely on on-page content, which means there is no outreach done for them. However, this does not mean that only written content can earn you editorial backlinks. In fact, organic link building for editorial ones can also occur if you’re adept at repurposing content. Following are some of the content types that are known for helping earn editorial links. Infographics Research-Backed Articles Ultimate Guides and Tutorials Free Tools and Calculators Editorial links are also considered Top SEO backlinks because they are highly relevant to your niche, which means any traffic coming to your website from them is intentional and from your target audience. Moreover, the contribution to your natural backlink profile also registers to Google, which can propel your rankings on the SERPs. Digital PR Links Digital PR is all about enhancing your online presence to reach and stay at the top of your target audience’s mind. While you can always explore how to get Digital PR links, a better method would be to get them from a trusted white label link building agency. Now Digital PR links are some of the most powerful backlinks you’ll come across. With a high authority Digital PR backlink, your brand gets more recognition, showcasing an achievement or surmounting a challenge, while simultaneously garnering link juice from Google. There couldn’t be a better win-win! You can make use of different PR tactics as well: Reactive PR Newsjacking Thought-leadership Product PR Creative Campaigns While the longevity of a PR link depends on how it was earned and the context, there are multiple SEOs who believe the results are worth it. However, getting PR links often isn’t easy, which is why we would recommend learning about common problems in Digital PR and how to tackle them. Conclusion The answer to the question ‘how to get powerful backlinks” has always been exceptional content. Thus, white-label agencies like us have remained unfazed in building backlinks after Google updates. So, if you want to build powerful backlinks in 2025, the best method will still be to create exceptional, link-worthy content. Additionally, you now also have an alternative to get powerful backlinks via digital PR links. Good Luck! Spread the love Don't forget to share this post!

You will also know that these strategies are becoming less effective. Most website owners know the value of links, and getting people to give you a link is more challenging than ever. In the digital world, the traditional ways of building backlinks just aren't cutting it anymore. Finding creative ways to get backlinks has become essential. Daniel Martin, the co-founder of LinkDoctor, an agency that specializes in building powerful backlinks, states, \"We constantly discover unique methods of building backlinks using AB Testing and single variable testing on experimental websites we host. Our approach to link building today is vastly different from what it was this time last year. With an experimental mindset, we've built quality backlinks that have driven results for over 600 businesses. Websites that builds more backlinks using our cutting-edge methods are not only seeing improvements in their Google rankings but also enjoying significant growth. On the other hand, those relying on outdated tactics are finding it tough to stay ahead.\" To get ahead today, you need to think outside the box with your link-building strategies and develop unique ideas to get backlinks. That’s what you’re going to learn how to do in this article. How to Build Backlinks in 2023 We all know the most common link-building techniques—guest posting, link insertions, etc. Every site owner gets hundreds of guest posts, or link insert requests daily. But most of these techniques have been done so much that success has become hard to come by. Most of them are absolute garbage. Those that aren’t tend to be ignored by association. Only some site owners today are naive enough to believe that your link can add value to their website or post. Thus, they’re unlikely to give you a link without any other incentive, and usually, incentives for link building can become very costly. If you aim to climb the search engine ranks and draw more attention to your website, collaborating with professional link building companies becomes a pivotal strategy for your success on the web. And getting people to agree to publish your guest post is difficult when everyone knows the post is just a vessel to get a backlink. Can Google detect and devalue paid or unnatural links? Links are still essential for SEO. Google still needs a way to tell which websites are most trustworthy and authoritative; backlinks from other traditional sites are the best way to show that. The sites that can find a way through the noise and develop new and inventive ways to get links will increasingly rise to the top of Google searches. Those who stick to old and outdated link-building techniques will not last. 5 Innovative and Effective Link-Building Strategies Are your existing strategies of guest post outreach and paid link insertions not moving the needle? Try these tactics to get links instead. Most of these strategies (except for #1) are not as scalable as guest posting or link outreach, meaning you generally won’t get hundreds of links. You will, however, get high-authority, natural links. These links will be better than you can get from a guest post and will likely do more for your domain authority than a hundred low-quality, paid links. In addition, by using these strategies, you may also gain valuable no-follow links, which, although they do not pass link equity, can still provide traffic and exposure to your website. You can also use tools to check website backlinks to ensure good link quality. 1. Write quotable content The best way to get links today is to write naturally link-worthy content. Be warned this technique is not guaranteed to deliver links. It also requires trial and error. But when it pays off, it pays off in a big way. The basic idea is to write the content people naturally quote in an article, such as data-driven posts or case studies, that provides real value for writers or journalists. Article writers often search for data or quotes on their topic in Google. You want to have your post show up for those searches. People will start linking to it in their posts when it does. It creates a flywheel effect. The more visibility your post gets, the more people find and link to it, and the higher it ranks. It just takes a little traction to kick this flywheel into gear, and you can get hundreds of links from high-authority sites without lifting a finger. Quotable content examples Take this post as an example. You’ll see quotes from it on significant sites such as The Guardian, Financial Post, and Business Insider, all of which cited it after finding it on Google. Image Source: Ahrefs Statistics roundups like the post above are great fits for this strategy. You’ll compile a collection of data from around the internet on your topic, structure it in a way that’s easy to consume, and optimize your post for SEO. Here’s another example, which puts together a few examples of a high-volume search query (“companies with unlimited PTO”), and presents it in a way that’s easy for writers to use as a source. It works - see this natural 81 DR backlink as an example. Source: Ahrefs Another way to do this is to write a post directly answering a question. Take the following example. The post targets a specific query and clearly answers it in the first heading. Source: Find Your Gi Posts like this often appear as featured snippets, giving people a quick and easy way to link to your site naturally. 2. Go on podcasts If you’re in a position where you’ve got something interesting to say, podcasts are a great way to build strong and naturally occurring links. You’ll usually get a link to your website and/or socials in the show notes when you go on a podcast. It’ll give you a link to the podcast’s website (if they’re halfway good at promotion, they’ll probably have a strong DR). You may also get links from high-authority podcast platforms where the podcast is distributed. See this example: the website (DR 70) links to every person/product mentioned in the episode. Source: Tropical MBA You might be surprised if you don’t think anyone would want you on a podcast. Podcasts are always looking for guests, and there are probably some in your niche where you could share something worthwhile for their audience. Simply being a business owner or a successful digital marketer is enough to get on many shows to share your experience (and get a link!). It’s even better if you can launch your own podcast. Running a podcast is a lot of work, but it allows you to publish on platforms like Anchor, Stitcher, Player FM, and 80+ DR sites, getting multiple homepage backlinks from each. 3. Launch an app Want multiple dofollow links from 96 and 97 DR sites? Links that are also a considerable signal of authority and authenticity in the eyes of Google? Image Source: Ahrefs You can get that by launching an app and publishing it in the Android and Apple App Stores. These high-authority links come with the app store listings. They boost your domain authority and provide a show of legitimacy whenever someone sees the “Available on the App Store” badge on your site. You must pay very little for the links - just the nominal fees to create and maintain developer accounts for Apple and Google. The more significant issue is in creating the app itself. But it’s easier and more accessible than you’d think. If you’re running a content site, you can build and launch an app that’s essentially just your mobile website packaged as a mobile app. You don’t need a novel app idea. The app could simply be a recreation of your website. You also don’t need to know much about app development or have a considerable budget to launch an app today. You can use a no-code app builder to build an app with drag-and-drop tools like you would with a site builder like Elementor. Many of these tools also have WordPress integrations, which make it extremely easy to convert your site into an app and run it from your website’s dashboard. Now the app development cost that you could launch an app for is as little as $200 (including developer accounts and app builder software). That’s an incredible price to pay for these powerful app store links. 4. Write testimonials for tools and services It’s the simplest way to get more natural links from high-quality websites. You can do it right now and get some excellent links. You’re probably using many different software tools or services in your business. Most of these tools will be delighted to get a testimonial from you and will give you a backlink in exchange for doing so. See what Surfer SEO does on their site. They feature several testimonials from Surfer users, each providing a link to the person’s site. Source: Surfer SEO Surfer’s DR is 78. That’s a powerful link for simply writing a paragraph on how a tool helps you. A lot of other tools do the same thing. Testimonials are highly beneficial for these businesses, so they’ll usually jump at the chance to publish yours. Another idea could be to offer your experience with the tool or service as a case study. Again, this is hugely valuable for the other business, and only some will turn down someone coming to them and asking to provide a case study. 5. Donate to organizations or sponsor events One more option is to donate or sponsor events or organizations. When you do this, you’ll usually get a shoutout on their website and marketing materials, including a link to your website. Source: SEO Mastery Summit These links are genuine, natural, and usually authoritative. It can be even better if the event picks up the press, in which case you can often get a lot of high-quality media links as well. This strategy is great if you’re trying to build a more robust SEO profile in a particular location. You can sponsor local events and get featured in the local press, which will be more beneficial than generic links. You’ll also benefit from increased brand presence by being seen by people in your community and/or niche. It isn’t something you can do for free. But you can often swing it, so you provide free products or support for the event, keeping the monetary cost to your company to a minimum. Summing Up There are three options you have for building links today. You can keep going with the traditional approach of guest post outreach and link insertions. You’ll be banging your head against the wall most of the time, but if you send enough emails, you may get some (average) links just by brute force. You could also ignore link building, focus on content, and hope your content is good enough to make Google like you. The third option, a must if you’re in a competitive market with high-authority rivals, is to get creative with your link-building. The five techniques above are great examples of thinking outside the box to get high-quality backlinks. You focus on providing value or doing real work to earn links rather than beg (or pay) for them. The future of Google will only tip more strongly in favor of sites that build high-quality and natural links. Those who go for the easy option will find these links are eventually worthless. To build a sustainable online business long-term, you must consider sustainable link-building methods.

You got it? The world of backlinks is wild, my friend. Picture me sitting in a dimly lit diner, channeling all my energy into this rant. Buckle up because we’re hitting this topic from both ends.Listen, backlinks are like oxygen for your website. Without them, you’re gasping for air, stuck in the depths of page two (or worse) of search results. It’s not just about climbing that SEO ladder; it’s about building a reputation, establishing your presence, and doing it all ethically. We’re ripping past the fluff and getting into the raw shit about creating content that genuinely offers value—not just jargon-filled pages chasing the latest SEO trend.This isn’t a game of manipulation or shortcuts. Trust me, I've been there and done that, and it blew up in my face harder than my cousin Tony’s epic paint mishap! That dude thought he was some kind of Picasso and trashed his whole setup with paint everywhere when he tried to DIY. I’d swear, I didn’t think it was possible to mess up so badly. Paint on the ceiling? Yeah, that happened.But Tony’s moment of chaos taught me something vital. If you don’t take the time to lay down a solid foundation, the entire structure can come crashing down in a colorful frenzy of regret. Same goes for your website; if you’re not building those backlinks ethically, you’ll be cleaning up a mess you didn’t even see coming.Now, let’s strap in because it’s a rollercoaster—here’s the full damn ride…Why Quick Fixes Aren’t EnoughLet’s hit the ground running. Quick fixes are like a sugar rush; they feel great for a hot minute but leave you crashing hard. Picture my buddy Tony again, who started that eco-friendly paint company. Dude went viral",
