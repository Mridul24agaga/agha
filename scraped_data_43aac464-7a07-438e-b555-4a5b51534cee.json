  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, let’s dive into this URL you’ve dropped: https://transcript.study/. From the name alone, it’s giving off some serious vibes of an educational or academic platform. \"Transcript\" suggests something that’s related to documentation or records, probably in the context of learning or education. I’m picturing a site that might be aimed at students, teachers, or even lifelong learners. You know, those folks who are always trying to expand their knowledge base or just keep their skills sharp. The word “study” seals the deal, right? It's got that whole scholarly feel to it, like it’s somewhere you’d go when you’re looking to hit the books or prep for exams. Now, let's think about what they might offer. Maybe it’s a platform where people can access various transcripts from educational institutions, sort of like an archive of materials that you can study from. Picture lecture notes, research papers, or even audio/video transcripts from educational videos or lectures. That’s super helpful for students who want to revisit complex topics without digging through a mountain of notes. Alternatively, they could be offering tools or resources for people to create their own transcripts. Like, if you're a student who's recorded lectures or discussions, maybe this site helps you transcribe that audio into written format. That would be handy for anyone trying to capture all those golden nuggets of wisdom from their classes. Also, since it's dot-study, there might be some interactive elements too—think forums or discussion boards where learners can connect, share insights, or even compare their understanding of different subjects. It’s that classic blend of community and study that makes learning more enjoyable rather than just a solitary grind. And hey, if we’re really riffing here, this site might also have a section for tips and tricks on how to study effectively. We all remember those late-night cram sessions, right? So, having a spot to find study hacks or learning techniques could definitely attract some traffic. You could find articles, videos, or even infographics that guide you through various study methods or note-taking systems. In a nutshell, this site sounds like a cozy little corner of the internet where learners and educators can gather to share knowledge, find resources, and boost their study game. Whether you’re scrambling to finish up your degree, looking to pick up a few new skills, or just curious about a topic, there’s probably something for everyone here. So, grab a coffee, kick back, and dive into the treasure trove of knowledge they’re likely offering. Cheers to that!",

This makes a huge difference in the long-term Be diversified, especially when you are older. Putting all your eggs in one basket doesn’t make sense. The key differences about living abroad are: You usually can’t get access to your home country's social security system. Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older after not putting enough aside for themselves and their families in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have become too difficult due to PFIC and other rules. Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but on two—or three-year contracts in teaching, oil and gas, intergovernmental organizations, etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do often have restrictions if they move again. So, finding a genuinely portable, global, and expat-friendly provider is key. So, the urgency is often more significant for expats. Gain two free expat ebooks today! Click here to receive them today!

The foundational things are boring to an extent and make a lousy YouTube presentation. It is much more fun to show you some controls and some tricks. You never get a sense of the “why” of what you are actually doing when making an image. I know, everyone knows how to make an image, you just point the shiny glass thing somewhere and press the button on top. Ok, we got that out of our system. An image is defined by light and the absence of light. Light and shadow are all you actually have to work with. Seeing things as just light and shadow is more difficult than it seems it should be. We get taken in by the thing itself, we are seduced with color and sense of place, there is a lot that gets in the way of light and shadow. So, read your camera manual. They are usually found in a PDF online. Learn what the basic controls are. At first, if you are really new, set the camera up on Aperture priority. On a PASM dial, that should be the A setting. If you don’t know, check the manual. Set the lens to f/5.6 for this lesson, that will improve your work immensely. Set the camera to monochrome for this lesson. Shoot only interesting patterns of shadows and light. You will learn several things from doing this. One is, you will teach yourself to be able to see light and shadow clearly and to see how they comprise the definition of every single thing. Also, you will teach yourself the essence of good composition. The more you practice this lesson the much, much better you will become. When you want to take real images, keep the aperture priority set on f/5.6 and switch off the monochrome setting and go back to normal or color or whatever it was set up originally for. Read the manual if you have doubts, don’t guess. Even though now you are in color, think of what you did in black and white and incorporate your new skill in seeing light and shadow and now add the color to the images. Your progress will be swift. One added lesson. Shoot only at f/5.6 for the next year. What you will learn, is how to isolate your subject. Also, only shoot when the light is crossing from your right or left. Never shoot when the light is behind you, ever. You will see how now the light is defining the planes that comprise your image. this is a sure fire way to make the most rapid progress in learning photography outside of a classroom. If you really want to learn, take classes. If you want to see really bad images, look at people’s work who have only learned online and having only been doing this for five years or less. Then make your own decisions on what you want to learn and how you want to learn it.

Taking Internet classes has many advantages for a non-traditional, and traditional student, such as: saving money, saving time, and most of all the convenience. Internet classes are the answer for many students with non-traditional needs. However, the only downfall to my Internet class is decrease in my eye sight and back pain as it is difficult to sit before the computer whole day. This situation should be considered when taking an Internet class. In my experience with Internet classes, the good far outweigh the bad. Taking Internet classes has saved the money. If I were taking traditional classes, I would be spending much money as i have to leave my home town and have to bear housing,transportation ,fooding and other expenses. The only expense that I incur with Internet classes is my server charge, which is less in comparison to all those expenses. I could finance a new computer with the savings from taking online classes. Furthermore, I have learned just as much online as I would have in a traditional class. I do not have the interactions with the instructor and the classmates, but I can email my instructor or my classmates at anytime. Internet classes have the discussion board where my classmates and I can exchange comments and ideas about our papers online. I do not feel as though I am missing out on anything by taking online classes. Actually, I am gaining much more that I am losing. For example, I involve my family in my Internet assignments, and I get ideas from them on assignments. I make a list like a survey, and question everyone on his or her ideas. This is a lot of fun, and it gives me ideas for my assignments. This is a learning experience for my whole family. And also, I am spending time with my family; which is difficult for a non-traditional student. Finally, online classes fit my lifestyle, because I am not a traditional student. If given a choice I would take all of my classes through the Internet. Online classes have saved me money and time. The only drawback is my decreasing health but that we can manage by doing exercises. Other than that my experience with online classes has been a rewarding, learning experience.

Not all websites ar Continue Reading Let’s be real—if you Google “best online learning resources,” you’ll get millions of results. Some are goldmines of knowledge, others are sketchy at best, and a few are just plain useless. So how do you figure out what’s actually worth your time? As a writer (and someone who’s helped a lot of students navigate academic chaos), I’ve seen firsthand how the right resources can make or break your learning experience. So if you’re feeling overwhelmed by the sea of options, here’s how to cut through the noise and find the good stuff. 1️⃣ Credibility Check: Who’s Behind the Resource? Not all websites are created equal. Some are run by experts, universities, or established educators. Others? Not so much. 🚩 Red Flags to Watch For: No clear author or credentials Clickbait-style headlines (“Guaranteed A+ Answers!”) Poor grammar or spelling mistakes (seriously, if they can’t spell, why trust their info?) ✅ Better Options: University websites (Harvard, MIT OpenCourseWare, Khan Academy) Well-known educational platforms (Coursera, Udemy, edX) Sites run by actual experts in the field 💡 Pro Tip: If you can’t figure out who wrote the content or where they got their info, it’s probably not worth your time. 2️⃣ Accuracy & Up-to-Date Information Ever tried learning from a resource that’s way outdated? I once found an economics site still referencing pre-2008 market trends like they were current. (Not helpful.) Before trusting a resource, check: ✅ The publication date – Is it recent? ✅ The references – Do they cite reputable sources? ✅ The examples used – If they mention floppy disks, it might be time to move on. 🚀 Real Talk: In fast-moving subjects like tech, science, and business, even a two-year-old article can be outdated. Always double-check. 3️⃣ Learning Style Compatibility: Does It Work for You? Everyone learns differently. Some students thrive on interactive courses, while others prefer reading articles or watching videos. If a resource doesn’t match your learning style, it’s not going to stick. 🎧 If you’re an auditory learner: Try podcasts (TED Talks, The Daily Stoic, or course lectures). 📺 If you learn best visually: Video-based platforms like YouTube, CrashCourse, or Udemy are great. 📖 If you prefer reading/writing: PDFs, ebooks, and academic journals might be your best bet. 💡 Test it out! If a resource feels frustrating or boring, it’s probably not the right fit for you. 4️⃣ Depth vs. Surface-Level Info: Does It Go Beyond Basics? Some websites just skim the surface—great for quick definitions but useless for deep understanding. If you’re trying to actually master a subject, you need resources that explain why things work, not just what they are. 🚩 Avoid sites that: ❌ Only give textbook definitions with no real-world examples ❌ Overuse AI-generated summaries that lack real explanations ❌ Don’t allow deeper exploration (e.g., no follow-up sources or citations) ✅ Better Options: Research databases (Google Scholar, JSTOR, PubMed) In-depth video courses with exercises Books and expert-authored articles 🚀 Pro Tip: A good resource doesn’t just answer your question—it makes you think deeper about the topic. 5️⃣ Engagement & Interactivity: Does It Keep You Interested? Let’s be honest—some learning resources are boring as hell. If it feels like reading a phone book, are you really going to stick with it? 📌 Signs of an engaging resource: Quizzes, exercises, or practice problems Case studies or real-life applications Clear visuals, videos, or infographics 💡 Try Before You Commit! Many platforms offer free previews—use them before paying for a course or subscribing. 6️⃣ Reviews & Student Feedback: What Are Others Saying? If a resource is bad, someone else has probably complained about it already. 📢 Check Reviews On: Reddit (r/learnprogramming, r/OnlineLearning) Quora (for student experiences) Course review platforms (Class Central, Trustpilot) 🚀 Pro Tip: A single bad review isn’t a dealbreaker, but if multiple people say the course is trash, believe them. 7️⃣ Cost vs. Value: Is It Worth Paying For? Some of the best resources are free (Khan Academy, MIT OpenCourseWare, YouTube tutorials). But sometimes, investing in a paid course is worth it—especially if it: ✅ Offers structured lessons with assignments ✅ Gives access to expert instructors ✅ Provides certification (useful for resumes or job applications) 🚀 Final Tip: Never pay for an online resource without checking for free alternatives first. And always look for student discounts! Final Takeaway: How to Choose the Best Learning Resources ✔ Check credibility – Who created it, and are they legit? ✔ Ensure accuracy – Is the info up to date and backed by real sources? ✔ Match your learning style – Videos, articles, or interactive courses—what works best for you? ✔ Go beyond basics – Does it actually teach you, or just list facts? ✔ Keep engagement in mind – If it’s boring, you won’t use it. ✔ Check reviews – What do other students say? ✔ Think about value – Free options first, paid courses only if they’re worth it. At the end of the day, the best resource is the one that actually helps you learn. So test things out, experiment with different formats, and don’t be afraid to ditch a resource that doesn’t work for you.

This makes a huge difference in the long-term Be diversified, especially when you are older. Putting all your eggs in one basket doesn’t make sense. The key differences about living abroad are: You usually can’t get access to your home country's social security system. Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older after not putting enough aside for themselves and their families in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have become too difficult due to PFIC and other rules. Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but on two—or three-year contracts in teaching, oil and gas, intergovernmental organizations, etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do often have restrictions if they move again.

The foundational things are boring to an extent and make a lousy YouTube presentation. It is much more fun to show you some controls and some tricks. You never get a sense of the “why” of what you are actually doing when making an image. I know, everyone knows how to make an image, you just point the shiny glass thing somewhere and press the button on top. Ok, we got that out of our system. An image is defined by light and the absence of light. Light and shadow are all you actually have to work with. Seeing things as just light and shadow is more difficult than it seems it should be. We get taken in by the thing itself, we are seduced with color and sense of place, there is a lot that gets in the way of light and shadow. So, read your camera manual. They are usually found in a PDF online. Learn what the basic controls are. At first, if you are really new, set the camera up on Aperture priority. On a PASM dial, that should be the A setting. If you don’t know, check the manual. Set the lens to f/5.6 for this lesson, that will improve your work immensely. Set the camera to monochrome for this lesson. Shoot only interesting patterns of shadows and light. You will learn several things from doing this. One is, you will teach yourself to be able to see light and shadow clearly and to see how they comprise the definition of every single thing. Also, you will teach yourself the essence of good composition. The more you practice this lesson the much, much better you will become. When you want to take real images, keep the aperture priority set on f/5.6 and switch off the monochrome setting and go back to normal or color or whatever it was set up originally for. Read the manual if you have doubts, don’t guess. Even though now you are in color, think of what you did in black and white and incorporate your new skill in seeing light and shadow and now add the color to the images. Your progress will be swift. One added lesson. Shoot only at f/5.6 for the next year. What you will learn, is how to isolate your subject. Also, only shoot when the light is crossing from your right or left. Never shoot when the light is behind you, ever. You will see how now the light is defining the planes that comprise your image. this is a sure fire way to make the most rapid progress in learning photography outside of a classroom. If you really want to learn, take classes. If you want to see really bad images, look at people’s work who have only learned online and having only been doing this for five years or less. Then make your own decisions on what you want to learn and how you want to learn it.

Along with the device you’ll be using to connect to lessons, it’s a good idea to have other supplies on hand that you might need (paper, pencils, headset, ring light, etc.). A comfortable, quiet, prepared learning space can make a world of difference in helping you focus. Think beforehand about what you would like to do during breaks. Snacks? Drinks? Movement? If your online learning days are long, you’ll want to have a bit of a plan for how you’ll break up those days. In your first few days, be prepared to ask questions if you haven’t done online learning before. Your teacher should be okay with supporting you in making sure things are going smoothly. After your first few days, reflect on what has gone well and what has felt a little bumpy. Think about how you can work to make the next couple of days even better. You might consider trying a new desk arrangement, asking your teacher for tips, or going to bed earlier to help with focus.

But online classes is much convenient for me. They allow me to take additional classes that would not have fit into my schedule otherwise. I am not a traditional student, so I have non-traditional needs. Internet classes allow me to remain at home with my family. Taking Internet classes has many advantages for a non-traditional, and traditional student, such as: saving money, saving time, and most of all the convenience. Internet classes are the answer for many students with non-traditional needs. However, the only downfall to my Internet class is decrease in my eye sight and back pain as it is difficult to sit before the computer whole day. This situation should be considered when taking an Internet class. In my experience with Internet classes, the good far outweigh the bad. Taking Internet classes has saved the money. If I were taking traditional classes, I would be spending much money as i have to leave my home town and have to bear housing,transportation ,fooding and other expenses. The only expense that I incur with Internet classes is my server charge, which is less in comparison to all those expenses. I could finance a new computer with the savings from taking online classes. Furthermore, I have learned just as much online as I would have in a traditional class. I do not have the interactions with the instructor and the classmates, but I can email my instructor or my classmates at anytime. Internet classes have the discussion board where my classmates and I can exchange comments and ideas about our papers online. I do not feel as though I am missing out on anything by taking online classes. Actually, I am gaining much more that I am losing. For example, I involve my family in my Internet assignments, and I get ideas from them on assignments. I make a list like a survey, and question everyone on his or her ideas. This is a lot of fun, and it gives me ideas for my assignments. This is a learning experience for my whole family. And also, I am spending time with my family; which is difficult for a non-traditional student. Finally, online classes fit my lifestyle, because I am not a traditional student. If given a choice I would take all of my classes through the Internet. Online classes have saved me money and time. The only drawback is my decreasing health but that we can manage by doing exercises. Other than that my experience with online classes has been a rewarding, learning experience.

Let’s be real—if you Google “best online learning resources,” you’ll get millions of results. Some are goldmines of knowledge, others are sketchy at best, and a few are just plain useless. So how do you figure out what’s actually worth your time? As a writer (and someone who’s helped a lot of students navigate academic chaos), I’ve seen firsthand how the right resources can make or break your learning experience. So if you’re feeling overwhelmed by the sea of options, here’s how to cut through the noise and find the good stuff. 1️⃣ Credibility Check: Who’s Behind the Resource?

Some are goldmines of knowledge, others are sketchy at best, and a few are just plain useless. So how do you figure out what’s actually worth your time? As a writer (and someone who’s helped a lot of students navigate academic chaos), I’ve seen firsthand how the right resources can make or break your learning experience. So if you’re feeling overwhelmed by the sea of options, here’s how to cut through the noise and find the good stuff. 1️⃣ Credibility Check: Who’s Behind the Resource? Not all websites are created equal. Some are run by experts, universities, or established educators. Others? Not so much. 🚩 Red Flags to Watch For: No clear author or credentials Clickbait-style headlines (“Guaranteed A+ Answers!”) Poor grammar or spelling mistakes (seriously, if they can’t spell, why trust their info?) ✅ Better Options: University websites (Harvard, MIT OpenCourseWare, Khan Academy) Well-known educational platforms (Coursera, Udemy, edX) Sites run by actual experts in the field 💡 Pro Tip: If you can’t figure out who wrote the content or where they got their info, it’s probably not worth your time. 2️⃣ Accuracy & Up-to-Date Information Ever tried learning from a resource that’s way outdated? I once found an economics site still referencing pre-2008 market trends like they were current. (Not helpful.) Before trusting a resource, check: ✅ The publication date – Is it recent? ✅ The references – Do they cite reputable sources? ✅ The examples used – If they mention floppy disks, it might be time to move on. 🚀 Real Talk: In fast-moving subjects like tech, science, and business, even a two-year-old article can be outdated. Always double-check. 3️⃣ Learning Style Compatibility: Does It Work for You? Everyone learns differently. Some students thrive on interactive courses, while others prefer reading articles or watching videos. If a resource doesn’t match your learning style, it’s not going to stick. 🎧 If you’re an auditory learner: Try podcasts (TED Talks, The Daily Stoic, or course lectures). 📺 If you learn best visually: Video-based platforms like YouTube, CrashCourse, or Udemy are great. 📖 If you prefer reading/writing: PDFs, ebooks, and academic journals might be your best bet. 💡 Test it out! If a resource feels frustrating or boring, it’s probably not the right fit for you. 4️⃣ Depth vs. Surface-Level Info: Does It Go Beyond Basics? Some websites just skim the surface—great for quick definitions but useless for deep understanding. If you’re trying to actually master a subject, you need resources that explain why things work, not just what they are. 🚩 Avoid sites that: ❌ Only give textbook definitions with no real-world examples ❌ Overuse AI-generated summaries that lack real explanations ❌ Don’t allow deeper exploration (e.g., no follow-up sources or citations) ✅ Better Options: Research databases (Google Scholar, JSTOR, PubMed) In-depth video courses with exercises Books and expert-authored articles 🚀 Pro Tip: A good resource doesn’t just answer your question—it makes you think deeper about the topic. 5️⃣ Engagement & Interactivity: Does It Keep You Interested? Let’s be honest—some learning resources are boring as hell. If it feels like reading a phone book, are you really going to stick with it? 📌 Signs of an engaging resource: Quizzes, exercises, or practice problems Case studies or real-life applications Clear visuals, videos, or infographics 💡 Try Before You Commit! Many platforms offer free previews—use them before paying for a course or subscribing. 6️⃣ Reviews & Student Feedback: What Are Others Saying? If a resource is bad, someone else has probably complained about it already. 📢 Check Reviews On: Reddit (r/learnprogramming, r/OnlineLearning) Quora (for student experiences) Course review platforms (Class Central, Trustpilot) 🚀 Pro Tip: A single bad review isn’t a dealbreaker, but if multiple people say the course is trash, believe them. 7️⃣ Cost vs. Value: Is It Worth Paying For? Some of the best resources are free (Khan Academy, MIT OpenCourseWare, YouTube tutorials). But sometimes, investing in a paid course is worth it—especially if it: ✅ Offers structured lessons with assignments ✅ Gives access to expert instructors ✅ Provides certification (useful for resumes or job applications) 🚀 Final Tip: Never pay for an online resource without checking for free alternatives first. And always look for student discounts! Final Takeaway: How to Choose the Best Learning Resources ✔ Check credibility – Who created it, and are they legit? ✔ Ensure accuracy – Is the info up to date and backed by real sources? ✔ Match your learning style – Videos, articles, or interactive courses—what works best for you? ✔ Go beyond basics – Does it actually teach you, or just list facts? ✔ Keep engagement in mind – If it’s boring, you won’t use it. ✔ Check reviews – What do other students say? ✔ Think about value – Free options first, paid courses only if they’re worth it. At the end of the day, the best resource is the one that actually helps you learn. So test things out, experiment with different formats, and don’t be afraid to ditch a resource that doesn’t work for you.

Just remember to cancel your membership before the free trial period is up unless you don’t mind paying the annual fee, which is often the equivalent of several hundred dollars. Don’t buy into the myth of “learning styles” and think that you learn better one way than another. You don’t, no matter what the learning styles quiz might tell you. There has never been any evidence supporting learning styles. Further, there’s no evidence that a novice at a skill knows the best way to teach or learn it. But be prepared to not be very good at the skill at first. It doesn’t mean you’re bad at the skill, just that you’re new at the skill. You must also be prepared to practice diligently and consistently, mastering one step before proceeding to the next. Practice is more than doing the same thing repeatedly. It’s about breaking down the skill to component parts and doing those systematically. A teacher can be of immense help with this if they help you analyse what you’re doing and suggest ways to improve. Upvote · Sponsored by Fisher Investments Unlock 7 Wealth-Building Tips.

But it's also no secret that obtaining a quality education is challenging, and it’s hard for students to find resources that match their needs. With such an overwhelming amount of information available, identifying reliable sources can feel like an uphill battle. So, how do you go about finding educational resources tailored to your learning style and interests? Well, in this blog post, we'll explore some practical advice for locating the best educational resources for students both online and offline. Read on for more info! Free Educational Resources Let's start by discussing the free educational resources available. As a student, you may not always have the funds to spend on expensive learning materials. Fortunately, there are plenty of free educational resources that you can access with just an internet connection. Here are a few of them: Open Education Databases Many universities, libraries, and educational institutions offer open access to their educational materials. These databases contain a wealth of useful information, from textbooks and lectures to research papers and multimedia content.

What teachers and schools do daily impacts students for the rest of their lives, providing them with essential knowledge and skills to succeed. Seeing to understand how students learn best in the classroom and researching tips you can implement in your classroom is a great way to determine how to improve students’ performance. 1. Establish Goals and Monitor Progress When you want to improve your students’ learning, creating goals can help involve them in their progress and give them steps they can follow to achieve those aspirations. Especially when working on individualized improvement, goals are an excellent way for students and teachers to identify areas of improvement and determine how to accomplish the desired outcome. Students can use goals to reach different results and apply them where needed to aid their learning journey. From achieving good grades to learning to study better, goals are excellent individualized tools. Many teachers use SMART goals to guide students toward improvement in the classroom. SMART stands for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timely. These principles help students and teachers create achievable goals that give students the details they need to carry out their completion. They can also help provide teachers with a guide for making practical goals to serve their classes and encourage individual improvement. Teachers can also benefit from making goals. Students can take their learning and improvement into their own hands, but there are many strategies teachers can use to drive an overall improvement in the classroom. Whether trying new teaching methods or giving more individualized care, teaching goals can prepare classes for change and growth. 2. Emphasize Active Listening Teachers can develop deeper levels of learning in their students by encouraging and highlighting active listening in the classroom. This communication method requires students to go beyond hearing what their teachers say to ensure they understand the meaning of the points. When students use active listening, they are more likely to comprehend and recall information later, whether completing homework or a test. In the classroom, instructors can implement many habits to help spark more active listening in students. Some ways teachers can inspire active learning in the classroom include: Asking Students to Repeat Information Teachers can ensure students are listening and retaining information by asking them to repeat what they’ve said back to them or paraphrase essential points. This system requires students to reflect on their teacher’s words, helping develop their recall and deepening learning beyond memorization. Repetition can also help teachers assess how much their students internalized so that they can repeat essential points, from assignment instructions to vital facts. Showing They’re Listening Students can better listen if they are more active in the conversation or lecture. Nodding and other affirmative movements can help students engage in the content, requiring them to mentally check in and assess their understanding and participation. These movements are also essential communication skills, allowing students to better converse with their peers and others in the future. Like paraphrasing, teachers can use nodding and other actions to determine how engaged their students are with the information. Encouraging Note-Taking Other actions can help students actively participate in lessons and better retain information. Taking notes can help students paraphrase information without speaking, making it ideal for shy kids or teachers with larger classes. Writing encourages students to stay engaged in lessons and think about what their teachers tell them and how it relates to other lessons. They also have to determine what information they need to write down and what is nonessential, helping them apply critical thinking to studies. Making Connections Connections help students relate lessons to what they understand outside the classroom. These learning strategies can help students develop a deeper knowledge of the subject matter, helping them better understand what they’re learning and increase their chances of remembering it when needed. Teachers can use active listening by asking students to make connections throughout the lesson — students will have to pay attention and internalize information to create strong connections. Active listening can boost student learning and establish strong communication skills they can take outside the classroom. Many teachers use their time with students to give them the essential social skills and work ethic they can apply to higher education and the workforce. Active listening has many applications outside the classroom, but it can help students improve as they learn. 3. Create a Consistent Structure Many aspects of school and learning involve structure to help students focus on education and lessons. They can better prepare for what each class offers when they can move from class to class without thought. Further, structure helps students know what to expect, so they can better control their emotions and manage their energy when in the classroom. Some ways teachers can help maintain structure in their classroom include: Using visual cues: Whether teachers have the same students all day or different classes every hour, visual elements can help students know what to expect when they enter the classroom. Teachers can write down every lesson they have for the day so students know when they are about to have a math or reading lesson. Pictures and color coding can be helpful for younger students still learning to read. If they teach one subject, outline the planned lessons and activities. Alerting for changes: Changes in regular schedules do happen, even when teachers try to prioritize consistency. There might be an assembly or an unplanned absence that disrupts the normal flow. In these cases, communication is critical. Speak with students about how changes affect regular class time and what else will look different. This system will help students know what to expect for their day, allowing them to process information and ask questions. Reminding frequently: If students are learning to read, verbal reminders can help them establish structure in the classroom. Give them countdowns to their next activity or tell them how much longer they have to work on something. These systems can help prepare students for changes in activities so they are less surprised and teach them how to manage time. Structure helps students get ready to learn. Whether they need to prepare supplies for the next lesson or wrap up an assignment for the day, structure and schedules let students understand what their day looks like and guide their learning and actions. 4. Teach Lessons in Different Formats While structure in the classroom is essential, teachers can also improve student learning by switching up the formats regularly. Students have to sit for long periods at a time with few breaks between lessons — changing formats and mediums when teaching can help keep students engaged and interested in the materials. Variety can also ensure all students receive information in a way that makes sense to them. Each child generally falls under three different learning styles — visual, auditory and kinesthetic. Many teachers have a teaching style that usually falls under one learning style, which makes it challenging for other students to learn in the classroom. Changing the formats can engage all students and ensure they receive content in a way that helps them learn best. Some ways to engage the different learning styles include: Visual learners: This learning type benefits from visual information to comprehend the material. Power points, images, videos, printed instructions and worksheets are ways that teachers can incorporate this learning style into their curriculum. Auditory learners: Students with this learning style learn best by listening. They might benefit from lectures, videos, songs and podcasts in the classroom. Kinesthetic learners: Kinesthetic learners are often trickier for teachers to accommodate because they require movement and actions to help them learn. Try worksheets, games and gadgets to keep them engaged and interested throughout lessons. Catering to students’ learning preferences can help improve their classroom performance and increase comprehension. Whether they want better grades or to build a stronger foundation for later classes, understanding learning styles and meeting them with different teaching formats can benefit students in several ways. 5. Incorporate Movement and Breaks While classroom structure is essential, teachers can better encourage learning by respecting the students’ natural workflow and energy levels. Younger children especially have lots of energy and often lack the tools to manage it, resulting in disruptions to learning and teaching. On the other hand, high schools overlook recess, leaving older students sitting in classes back to back with little time to move around and get out any energy they might have. Breaks are a great way to prepare the mind and body for learning, so students can become more engaged during lessons. When students can move around the classroom or other areas, they can prepare their bodies to return to a learning environment and process what they’ve already learned. As teachers work movement and breaks into their classroom, they can take a structured or unstructured approach: Structured breaks: Working structured breaks into lessons is one way to give students the chance to move around and break up sessions of heavy learning. At regular intervals or good stopping points, offer students an opportunity to walk around, stretch their legs, get water and go to the bathroom. When they return to their seats, they will feel more ready to focus on the lesson. Unstructured breaks: While teachers schedule structured breaks into their day, unstructured breaks are up to the students. They decide when they need a break and take them as needed. Teachers can still set rules around unstructured breaks, like requiring students to be quiet and undisruptive. Unstructured breaks might include students walking around or using the restroom when needed. For younger students, teachers might want to offer quiet interactive toys, like kinetic sand. With long learning periods every day, breaks can help students get the rest and movement they need to foster their success. Even the best students need breaks from learning. Teachers that set their classroom rules and lesson schedules allow students to get the care they need to support their learning. 6. Consider Mindfulness Activities Mindfulness exercises can be an effective structured break option or way to start classes each day. Mindfulness helps focus the mind and allows students to become more present — this type of exercise uses lots of breathing exercises and reflection, which can also reduce stress and let students process their emotions. Some ways teachers can implement mindfulness in the classroom include: Daily journaling. Breathing exercises. Mental imaging. Stretching and yoga. Calming activities like mindfulness are a great way to ready the class after exciting activities, from lunch and recess to assemblies. Students often have difficulty shifting from social activities to learning environments, making learning harder. Mindfulness can help center their thoughts so they are ready to engage in the lesson. 7. Equip Classrooms With the Right Tools Teachers have many tips and habits they can implement into their classrooms to help their students learn and succeed. Technology can be an excellent addition to the school, expanding teaching options and impacting how students learn. While some people might believe that classroom technology might distract students, there are many benefits to using these tools while teaching. Some tools teachers can implement in their classroom include: Projectors Many students are visual learners, meaning they need visual cues and resources to optimize their learning. Projectors allow teachers to share visual information with large groups of people, from PowerPoint presentations that aid lectures to videos from experts on different subjects. Visual materials can also help break up verbal content and keep students engaged during long classes. Speakers While lecturing is an excellent way to relay information to students, the internet allows teachers to find many fantastic resources they can share. Quality speakers and sound systems make it possible to share music, podcasts and videos with students so that teachers can expand their learning beyond the classroom. Smartboards Paired with projectors, smartboards allow students and teachers to interact with the displayed content. Teachers can write out math problems and solve them in a different color or break down grammar constructions. They can also use the boards to work through concepts for students and see how a student works through problems in real time. Tabletop Cameras With large classes, it can be challenging to plan demonstrations and ensure that all students can see. Tabletop cameras allow teachers to connect to projectors and share presentations with the whole class, even those who sit in the back. Teachers can conduct more science experiments or show art techniques in a new way that keeps all students engaged and interested in the lesson. Technology can help provide new ways to reach students. Content allows teachers to keep students engaged throughout lessons, creating breaks in the usual teaching style. With the right classroom tech, teachers can continue offering students the best education. Having the right technology can also be helpful when working with online learning.

What teachers and schools do daily impacts students for the rest of their lives, providing them with essential knowledge and skills to succeed. Seeing to understand how students learn best in the classroom and researching tips you can implement in your classroom is a great way to determine how to improve students’ performance. 1. Establish Goals and Monitor Progress When you want to improve your students’ learning, creating goals can help involve them in their progress and give them steps they can follow to achieve those aspirations. Especially when working on individualized improvement, goals are an excellent way for students and teachers to identify areas of improvement and determine how to accomplish the desired outcome. Students can use goals to reach different results and apply them where needed to aid their learning journey. From achieving good grades to learning to study better, goals are excellent individualized tools. Many teachers use SMART goals to guide students toward improvement in the classroom. SMART stands for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timely. These principles help students and teachers create achievable goals that give students the details they need to carry out their completion. They can also help provide teachers with a guide for making practical goals to serve their classes and encourage individual improvement. Teachers can also benefit from making goals. Students can take their learning and improvement into their own hands, but there are many strategies teachers can use to drive an overall improvement in the classroom. Whether trying new teaching methods or giving more individualized care, teaching goals can prepare classes for change and growth. 2. Emphasize Active Listening Teachers can develop deeper levels of learning in their students by encouraging and highlighting active listening in the classroom. This communication method requires students to go beyond hearing what their teachers say to ensure they understand the meaning of the points. When students use active listening, they are more likely to comprehend and recall information later, whether completing homework or a test. In the classroom, instructors can implement many habits to help spark more active listening in students. Some ways teachers can inspire active learning in the classroom include: Asking Students to Repeat Information Teachers can ensure students are listening and retaining information by asking them to repeat what they’ve said back to them or paraphrase essential points. This system requires students to reflect on their teacher’s words, helping develop their recall and deepening learning beyond memorization. Repetition can also help teachers assess how much their students internalized so that they can repeat essential points, from assignment instructions to vital facts. Showing They’re Listening Students can better listen if they are more active in the conversation or lecture. Nodding and other affirmative movements can help students engage in the content, requiring them to mentally check in and assess their understanding and participation. These movements are also essential communication skills, allowing students to better converse with their peers and others in the future. Like paraphrasing, teachers can use nodding and other actions to determine how engaged their students are with the information. Encouraging Note-Taking Other actions can help students actively participate in lessons and better retain information. Taking notes can help students paraphrase information without speaking, making it ideal for shy kids or teachers with larger classes. Writing encourages students to stay engaged in lessons and think about what their teachers tell them and how it relates to other lessons. They also have to determine what information they need to write down and what is nonessential, helping them apply critical thinking to studies. Making Connections Connections help students relate lessons to what they understand outside the classroom. These learning strategies can help students develop a deeper knowledge of the subject matter, helping them better understand what they’re learning and increase their chances of remembering it when needed. Teachers can use active listening by asking students to make connections throughout the lesson — students will have to pay attention and internalize information to create strong connections. Active listening can boost student learning and establish strong communication skills they can take outside the classroom. Many teachers use their time with students to give them the essential social skills and work ethic they can apply to higher education and the workforce. Active listening has many applications outside the classroom, but it can help students improve as they learn. 3. Create a Consistent Structure Many aspects of school and learning involve structure to help students focus on education and lessons. They can better prepare for what each class offers when they can move from class to class without thought. Further, structure helps students know what to expect, so they can better control their emotions and manage their energy when in the classroom. Some ways teachers can help maintain structure in their classroom include: Using visual cues: Whether teachers have the same students all day or different classes every hour, visual elements can help students know what to expect when they enter the classroom. Teachers can write down every lesson they have for the day so students know when they are about to have a math or reading lesson. Pictures and color coding can be helpful for younger students still learning to read. If they teach one subject, outline the planned lessons and activities. Alerting for changes: Changes in regular schedules do happen, even when teachers try to prioritize consistency. There might be an assembly or an unplanned absence that disrupts the normal flow. In these cases, communication is critical. Speak with students about how changes affect regular class time and what else will look different. This system will help students know what to expect for their day, allowing them to process information and ask questions. Reminding frequently: If students are learning to read, verbal reminders can help them establish structure in the classroom. Give them countdowns to their next activity or tell them how much longer they have to work on something. These systems can help prepare students for changes in activities so they are less surprised and teach them how to manage time. Structure helps students get ready to learn. Whether they need to prepare supplies for the next lesson or wrap up an assignment for the day, structure and schedules let students understand what their day looks like and guide their learning and actions. 4. Teach Lessons in Different Formats While structure in the classroom is essential, teachers can also improve student learning by switching up the formats regularly. Students have to sit for long periods at a time with few breaks between lessons — changing formats and mediums when teaching can help keep students engaged and interested in the materials. Variety can also ensure all students receive information in a way that makes sense to them. Each child generally falls under three different learning styles — visual, auditory and kinesthetic. Many teachers have a teaching style that usually falls under one learning style, which makes it challenging for other students to learn in the classroom. Changing the formats can engage all students and ensure they receive content in a way that helps them learn best. Some ways to engage the different learning styles include: Visual learners: This learning type benefits from visual information to comprehend the material. Power points, images, videos, printed instructions and worksheets are ways that teachers can incorporate this learning style into their curriculum. Auditory learners: Students with this learning style learn best by listening. They might benefit from lectures, videos, songs and podcasts in the classroom. Kinesthetic learners: Kinesthetic learners are often trickier for teachers to accommodate because they require movement and actions to help them learn. Try worksheets, games and gadgets to keep them engaged and interested throughout lessons. Catering to students’ learning preferences can help improve their classroom performance and increase comprehension. Whether they want better grades or to build a stronger foundation for later classes, understanding learning styles and meeting them with different teaching formats can benefit students in several ways. 5. Incorporate Movement and Breaks While classroom structure is essential, teachers can better encourage learning by respecting the students’ natural workflow and energy levels. Younger children especially have lots of energy and often lack the tools to manage it, resulting in disruptions to learning and teaching. On the other hand, high schools overlook recess, leaving older students sitting in classes back to back with little time to move around and get out any energy they might have. Breaks are a great way to prepare the mind and body for learning, so students can become more engaged during lessons. When students can move around the classroom or other areas, they can prepare their bodies to return to a learning environment and process what they’ve already learned. As teachers work movement and breaks into their classroom, they can take a structured or unstructured approach: Structured breaks: Working structured breaks into lessons is one way to give students the chance to move around and break up sessions of heavy learning. At regular intervals or good stopping points, offer students an opportunity to walk around, stretch their legs, get water and go to the bathroom. When they return to their seats, they will feel more ready to focus on the lesson. Unstructured breaks: While teachers schedule structured breaks into their day, unstructured breaks are up to the students. They decide when they need a break and take them as needed. Teachers can still set rules around unstructured breaks, like requiring students to be quiet and undisruptive. Unstructured breaks might include students walking around or using the restroom when needed. For younger students, teachers might want to offer quiet interactive toys, like kinetic sand. With long learning periods every day, breaks can help students get the rest and movement they need to foster their success. Even the best students need breaks from learning. Teachers that set their classroom rules and lesson schedules allow students to get the care they need to support their learning. 6. Consider Mindfulness Activities Mindfulness exercises can be an effective structured break option or way to start classes each day. Mindfulness helps focus the mind and allows students to become more present — this type of exercise uses lots of breathing exercises and reflection, which can also reduce stress and let students process their emotions. Some ways teachers can implement mindfulness in the classroom include: Daily journaling. Breathing exercises. Mental imaging. Stretching and yoga. Calming activities like mindfulness are a great way to ready the class after exciting activities, from lunch and recess to assemblies. Students often have difficulty shifting from social activities to learning environments, making learning harder. Mindfulness can help center their thoughts so they are ready to engage in the lesson. 7.
