  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, let‚Äôs take a stab at this‚ÄîMoody Tunes, huh? Just from the name and that URL, I‚Äôm getting some good vibes about a site that‚Äôs all about music, maybe leaning into the mood-based playlists or something similar. You know how sometimes you need a song that matches your mood, like when you're feeling nostalgic, hyped, or just straight-up chill? That‚Äôs where I bet this site shines. I picture it as a cozy little corner of the internet where you can explore tunes based on how you‚Äôre feeling. You log in after a long day, and instead of scrolling through endless playlists that just don‚Äôt hit right, you‚Äôve got something that understands where you‚Äôre at emotionally. Maybe you click on a mood, and bam, a curated playlist drops that‚Äôs just perfect for whatever vibe you‚Äôre riding. There‚Äôs probably an easy-to-navigate interface too. I can see it having some slick design elements‚Äîmaybe soft colors and a chill aesthetic that makes browsing feel like a laid-back Saturday morning. You might even find some cool features like mood mixers or AI-generated playlists that adapt to your listening habits. Just picture it‚Äîa little bit of algorithm magic creating a tailor-made background soundtrack for your life. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if they‚Äôve got some social elements going on. You know, sharing playlists with friends or maybe seeing what tunes are resonating with others. Nothing better than discovering a banger because your buddy dropped it in the comments, right? And I bet there‚Äôs a community vibe, where folks can discuss their favorite tracks or even share personal stories about certain songs that really hit home. Another angle could be exploring different genres that match specific feelings. Like, you‚Äôre super pumped and want some high-energy tracks‚ÄîMoody Tunes probably has you covered. Or let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre chilling out and want something acoustic and soothing‚Äîyeah, I can see that being right there too. It‚Äôs like your personal DJ, but one that‚Äôs all about the feels. And speaking of feels, they might even have some articles or blog posts about the connection between music and emotions. You know, diving into why certain songs make us feel a certain way or how different genres can pull at the heartstrings. Maybe they even feature some artist spotlights, giving you the lowdown on up-and-coming musicians who are crafting tunes that fit your vibe. Now, if they‚Äôre really savvy, I bet there‚Äôs a mobile app where you can take the tunes on the go. Imagine this‚Äîyou're out in the park, feeling that spring breeze, and you whip out your phone for the perfect soundtrack. It just makes sense, right? So yeah, that‚Äôs my brain swirling around on what Moody Tunes is all about. A chill spot for music lovers designed to make your listening experience match how you‚Äôre feeling. Whether you‚Äôre out with friends, winding down at home, or just looking for the right beat to match your mood, I can see this site being the kind of place that feels like a friend in your pocket. Cheers to that, right?",

good time listening to and talking about music and i'm just gonna listen to music that makes me feel very nostalgic oh yeah and if you're wondering why i'm wearing such strange lipstick uh the answer is a it is fun and b i mean come on here's just sort of a quick sampling of some of the bands we're going to be listening to today alanis morissette seal the prodigy chemical brothers marilyn manson static x and also some trans and sidetrans cause i was really into that around the age of 14 15. so the first cd i ever bought well i bought two cds at the same time sealed by seal and alanis morissette jacket little pill all i really want right the harmonica [Music] okay i remember always feeling like i never really could tell when the downbeat was gonna hit and i still can't that's funny can you [Music] uh [Music] oh do i stress you out my sweater is on backwards and inside out and you say how appropriate i don't want to dissect everything today i don't mean to pick you apart you see but i can't yeah yeah [Music] and there i go jumping before the good shows [Music] if only i could haunt the this is really well well produced this is from 1996. the drum grooves were great very like loop-based kind of hip-hop inspired grooves love that uh now i didn't know this at the time but this was what a lot of musicians call rock major or also called mixolydian so it's like a major scale but then there's like this edgy note so and then that one but it has that overall kind of pumped up feeling it's not like a very pensive minor and then what knocked me down what a melody i mean man that's just moving she's going up a chord [Music] yeah another one i really love from that album was right through you i'll listen to like five seconds of that before you turn me away there's the other that's okay so there's like flat sevens in all of her songs that's that rock major sound now you turn me away instead of you turn me away which is what it would be in major that's just it's it's got so much attitude the flat seven to me is the attitude note it's the sas note [Applause] [Music] this is so great okay so pretty much so far all the chords have been major for the most part but she keeps throwing in these uh these major chords that start on the minor notes basically in the scale so when you do that you get this drama and this it's unexpected sound i love it also okay e again oh i'm sorry my voice and piano are a little out of sync with the music that's something i haven't figured out how to uh resolve but anyway all right so let's keep going so seal uh was the other cd i got sealed by seal so kiss from a rose was the reason i bought the cd i was just like this is just one of the most incredible songs i've ever heard and of course i was only 10 so you know i'd only heard so much music but it just stood out and i i was just in love with his voice in love with his sense of harmony and production and how cinematic it was uh so we'll have to listen to some of it it's going to be hard to stop it though reminded me of like a the secret garden or something [Music] oboe the mournful but bittersweet no harmonies oh yeah [Music] me [Music] flat 6 city so i forgot that this i don't know if it was recorded at a at a regularly tuned note and then the in the mixing or production process it goes up a semitone i'm sorry a quarter tone whatever the point is it's a little bit in between the notes on the piano so i think it's between g and g sharp so it's something in there i can't really play along to it but uh if i just play in the key of g for now this is another situation where the flat 6 prominently featured this is just gonna be a video about the flat six chord i've already done two videos about it it is my soul mate though [Music] oh the melody is just absolutely incredible in the song [Music] that moment was always so oh my gosh i mean at the at this age i didn't know any music theory but i knew what major and minor was so i guess i knew like you know the most minimal amount that anybody playing an instrument would know but i knew that moment it went minor did you know that when it snows oh my eyes become a large and not going home yet why did major baby [Music] okay there's a few more steel tracks i just want to listen to the beginnings of them just to get that feeling again of like oh man i'm 10. bring it on [Music] first i didn't have the wheel to carry on oh nice vocal harmonies i love the sort of flanger almost on his voice bring it on don't cry oh don't be so [Music] oh my baby that's the chord [Music] i think that's what i loved so much about this album other than just i liked the production i loved his voice uh but also just there's so much of mixing major and minor keys like you know in the same progression or in the same even melodic lines just the ones i just uh i love that and i'm stronger now i would say that like my musical taste changed in very short amounts of time so i went from being obsessed with like the hansen brothers to being obsessed with corn in i think the span of one year before i got to the corn phase i was really into savage garden so we're gonna have to listen to one of those songs to bring me back i'm gonna chew i'm not gonna do chicka cherry cola we're gonna do break me shake me which probably wasn't on the radio but i really liked this one it was actually kind of an angry song and it's very minor and dark and serious i never thought opinion again but you moved me in away michael jackson [Music] i might have to add this song to the list of uh songs that have a minor v chord in them because i really really love that sound and it's not used a whole lot in fact classical musicians invented a whole scale just so they could use the major version of this chord so that just goes to show you how important it is for western music but i really really like the minor version it just sounds so much more pensive and just a little bit different so um [Music] there it is that's pretty then it goes to the five this time i love it when a chord progression will like change direction the second time but the melody hasn't changed so it's called reharmonization or re-harm okay but this part [Music] okay so now we're going to move into a phase that you might be more familiar with and this is when i discovered my local alternative rock radio station 101x or 101.5 in austin texas so i got exposed to a whole different set of genres the prodigy fat of the land breathe was the first track i heard i i have a feeling that this album has held up really well i mean it's so classic oh my god oh the whip [Music] just hearing a whip you sampled and used rhythmically like that i mean and it really does sound like it's going back and forth it was just so visceral and i always loved the kind of reverse symbols just really creative production [Music] and that strings well feels like a train is coming but it also just sounds like maybe an orchestral like a chord like a sample i don't know i love that it's all in the right all these little rhythmic accents i was just i remember just like i knew all of them and then okay i can't seem to sound like a symbol today but anyway oh my god [Music] okay what is he saying atticusain attic insane is it a person named attica zane but that just the way oh and of course what's coming up i'm so excited for but just the there's something about this that feels like there's just like like a wall of fire being blasted at my face i love the just the the rhythmic flow of i guess it's rapping but man it's so great that come play my game oh man i loved that and it took me a second to figure out what they were saying too because the accent's so heavy but comply my god and this is chromatic he could have said psycho-chromatic [Music] it's chromatic up until that point [Music] that's in a harmonic minor which i have no idea what that was back then but it's a minor scale but oh that's the one i was talking about where they invented the scale way back in the day so that they could have a leading tone or a major five chord which sounds like this so so they could have this chord [Music] that's the note that's the one that i had to bring in and in this context it sounds pretty demented the imperial march is also in the harmonic minor scale okay well that's such a good song but i also i remember loving mine fields and we have to listen to the like the chorus or the brit or whatever there's a part i just have i have to hear it very very cinematic right opening more strings [Music] oh i love this song okay it's slightly lower than f so the piano is going to sound out of tune with it but that'll sound kind of it'll sound kind of cool oh sorry this is dangerous [Music] this feels like they're going easy on us you know like you're like is it dangerous [Music] that's kind of cool but then oh okay this base this base is so nice it reminds me a lot of the timbre of the base used in uk garage music anyone remember this genre is it still going maybe it is [Music] oh this is a dorian that sound i love that then they're so good at these sort of accents that kind of come in that's kind of how they like add variation [Music] and that's just the beginning they're leaving off the end right and they don't bring that into later i love that so just it's just building slowly [Music] what are qe and f we gotta get to that part because i think it does a lydian thing which is another scale uh that has a very curious sound yeah oh it's so cool [Music] it's kind of got this like a mischievous sounding scale the other one i really loved was narayan we just have to listen to just a few seconds of this [Music] wow music like this there are just elements that you will you can't hear everything until you've listened to it over and over again and then you start to hear all the layers or even decades later you're like oh i'm still hearing new things oh and i love this part it goes there's like a string sample maybe [Music] that's the tritone it's so like [Music] great sound design they know how to build something right they're making me anticipate everything i'm like i can't wait you know [Music] i love the snare in this one just really nice syncopation great accents ornamentation [Music] all right now in a similar vein block rock and beats chemical brothers so i bought uh digging your own hole after hearing block reckon beats on 101x and loved the entire album and then i think at the time surrender was already out so then i got surrendered but this album is unparalleled for me it's just oh god like this this the level of nostalgia i feel hearing that panning and [Music] but the whole intro is in like a different key than this part [Music] that fell that phil is perfect [Music] [Music] hi so i don't get asmr as far as i'm aware but there are certain sounds qualities of sound that just like i don't know i they they hype me up or or just make me want to like hit something you know like they're just so there's they do something to the nervous system i i don't know what it is but the drum sounds in this groove kind of do that but then it ups the ante when it gets this part where the tail i guess it's like the reverb tail or delay or something gets bigger and everything sounds like it's a bit further away and they i don't know what they're doing but it just feels like that the groove gets thwackier is this very satisfying thwack sound that to this day clearly makes me feel like in a good way uh [Music] interesting [Music] they sampled some kind of instrument i don't know what it is but i feel like there's metal involved and it's maybe something you shake or i don't know um but they have that kind of going underneath it can you hear that [Music] and this song was always interesting to me because like it very clearly didn't have much of a low end like there's this big sort of boom at the beginning of every measure uh but there's no like bass i mean there's a bass guitar but you know that that guitar doesn't actually sound like it has much low end it kind of can't but a lot of the song feels sort of suspended and elevated in a really strange way [Music] by the way they just took the sample of the bass guitar and they just pitched it up a whole step sorry it just goes up to create some kind of difference right just some kind of little bit of tension that they create or some kind of variety right just a contrast and that's all i did they just took their sample moved it up a whole step or a note but there's that i would love to know what those sounds really are cause you can hear them really well at the very end similarly to the prodigy right just really creative with these sounds and recognizing sort of not just their rhythmic properties but also like their their timbre and like that one kind of goes down then this one goes a lot higher you know creating something very musical with the sounds that inherently aren't okay now here is a song that uh i don't know how i'm gonna react to listening to again this is i'm with stupid by static x i can tell that that was a band that i was into for a very short amount of time and then it just didn't i just didn't like it anymore i'll tell you something i i think this song might have sounded a little bit better if they didn't have that like clap so this has a has a flat two so that's a note that's very heavy sounding and very dark it's used a lot in metal um that's what jaws is [Music] big accent on that really heavy note i like that so i grabbed my shovel i like that change really like emphasize that gap that the rhythm leaves that duh right and then they bring in this sample i mean i think this part was so compelling i was like what on earth is this person saying what is this from what's going on and this is before i was like so i grabbed my shovels like that my shovel oh my god i remember trying to figure out what on earth he was saying here and i came up with some very sinister stuff like i beat him with a skull so he wouldn't yell i i still like that part i am i am i am mine i am mine i am mine i am mine i am mayan name and the rhythm it creates the emphasis is a little bit uh uneven little polyrhythmic now i remember getting a marilyn manson record interestingly enough i did not buy the album with the beautiful people on it but i got the mechanical animals and i remember staring at the cover just being like whoa what is going on like this is like a scary and i also like really like it who is this person how did they do this i remember thinking about like is he wearing a suit is it all cgi like like is that even his body you know it was just so compelling there were a couple songs that really really stuck with me the dope show and i don't like the drugs with the drugs like me [Music] a guitar tone isn't [Music] it's so textured like his i think his voice was very very close to the mic so you can hear just every like uh you know we're all stars now in the dope show again it's that sort of satisfying feeling like so i really really like that this groove is interesting this is what you might call a shuffle you could i don't know but it's it's like got this kind of swinging 68 field and i like that i love slow grooves too because you can really like sink into them with your body and with your teeth just like ah there's so many marilyn's like he tracked his vocals so many times i mean overdubbing like you can hear all these different timbres and textures some of them sound very close and sound very far away maybe not very but further away it's a really interesting feeling like there's all these people around you and you're like who are you all and where are you coming from you know i like this part all right i don't like the drugs but the drugs like me okay i do think there's three octaves i mean come on don't look don't like don't like [Music] oh my god [Music] i forgot how funky this is [Music] it is weird listening to the lyrics now but i'm an adult there's a lot of stuff in here that just went over my head i didn't know what missionary meant i'll tell you that i like this part i love this this is kind of the closer nine inch nails groove you got that you just got this nice like solid kind of kick on the beats or maybe on the back beat and then you got the snare on the two and the four and then you've got these big open hi-hats filling that space and the offbeats it just it sounds great with rock i really like that sound it feels it it feels very like foreboding and kind of sensual and oh i have not heard this in such a long time that's a cool interlude because that phrasing is kind of uneven and just totally you can't really predict what's about to happen i like this don't like the drugs the drugs the drugs next up is a psytrance song so this is called who's nutty and i heard this um it's by space tribe and i heard this on 101 x on some kind of show that they were doing i think it was like after hours could have been like 2 a.m who's nutty is what got me into psychedelic trans oh my god it's like it was yesterday that guitar and he's got these cartoon samples it made me feel so weird pulsating they really filled it up i learned so much from this song i ended up writing trans myself for quite a while [Music] like i would just pattern my songs off of this you know and be like okay then they bring in the hi-hats then they bring in the bass and all the elements i was like this is what makes it work uh so oh man but that bass sounds good that sounds really great it's panned so well it's mixed so well oh oh yeah those accents all those harmonics oh my god there's a tambo no truth be tambo i definitely put tambo in my trans for a while too i thought it sounded good and you know maybe maybe it did anyways this goes on for eight minutes so so we got a part two we got a part three coming up or 2000 to 2005. and i also want to do a whole series on the stank face songs awesome thank you so so much for watching and thank you endlessly to my patrons for supporting me and allowing me to make videos like this if you're interested in hearing my thoughts on a song that

good time listening to and talking about music and i'm just gonna listen to music that makes me feel very nostalgic oh yeah and if you're wondering why i'm wearing such strange lipstick uh the answer is a it is fun and b i mean come on here's just sort of a quick sampling of some of the bands we're going to be listening to today alanis morissette seal the prodigy chemical brothers marilyn manson static x and also some trans and sidetrans cause i was really into that around the age of 14 15. so the first cd i ever bought well i bought two cds at the same time sealed by seal and alanis morissette jacket little pill all i really want right the harmonica [Music] okay i remember always feeling like i never really could tell when the downbeat was gonna hit and i still can't that's funny can you [Music] uh [Music] oh do i stress you out my sweater is on backwards and inside out and you say how appropriate i don't want to dissect everything today i don't mean to pick you apart you see but i can't yeah yeah [Music] and there i go jumping before the good shows [Music] if only i could haunt the this is really well well produced this is from 1996. the drum grooves were great very like loop-based kind of hip-hop inspired grooves love that uh now i didn't know this at the time but this was what a lot of musicians call rock major or also called mixolydian so it's like a major scale but then there's like this edgy note so and then that one but it has that overall kind of pumped up feeling it's not like a very pensive minor and then what knocked me down what a melody i mean man that's just moving she's going up a chord [Music] yeah another one i really love from that album was right through you i'll listen to like five seconds of that before you turn me away there's the other that's okay so there's like flat sevens in all of her songs that's that rock major sound now you turn me away instead of you turn me away which is what it would be in major that's just it's it's got so much attitude the flat seven to me is the attitude note it's the sas note [Applause] [Music] this is so great okay so pretty much so far all the chords have been major for the most part but she keeps throwing in these uh these major chords that start on the minor notes basically in the scale so when you do that you get this drama and this it's unexpected sound i love it also okay e again oh i'm sorry my voice and piano are a little out of sync with the music that's something i haven't figured out how to uh resolve but anyway all right so let's keep going so seal uh was the other cd i got sealed by seal so kiss from a rose was the reason i bought the cd i was just like this is just one of the most incredible songs i've ever heard and of course i was only 10 so you know i'd only heard so much music but it just stood out and i i was just in love with his voice in love with his sense of harmony and production and how cinematic it was uh so we'll have to listen to some of it it's going to be hard to stop it though reminded me of like a the secret garden or something [Music] oboe the mournful but bittersweet no harmonies oh yeah [Music] me [Music] flat 6 city so i forgot that this i don't know if it was recorded at a at a regularly tuned note and then the in the mixing or production process it goes up a semitone i'm sorry a quarter tone whatever the point is it's a little bit in between the notes on the piano so i think it's between g and g sharp so it's something in there i can't really play along to it but uh if i just play in the key of g for now this is another situation where the flat 6 prominently featured this is just gonna be a video about the flat six chord i've already done two videos about it it is my soul mate though [Music] oh the melody is just absolutely incredible in the song [Music] that moment was always so oh my gosh i mean at the at this age i didn't know any music theory but i knew what major and minor was so i guess i knew like you know the most minimal amount that anybody playing an instrument would know but i knew that moment it went minor did you know that when it snows oh my eyes become a large and not going home yet why did major baby [Music] okay there's a few more steel tracks i just want to listen to the beginnings of them just to get that feeling again of like oh man i'm 10. bring it on [Music] first i didn't have the wheel to carry on oh nice vocal harmonies i love the sort of flanger almost on his voice bring it on don't cry oh don't be so [Music] oh my baby that's the chord [Music] i think that's what i loved so much about this album other than just i liked the production i loved his voice uh but also just there's so much of mixing major and minor keys like you know in the same progression or in the same even melodic lines just the ones i just uh i love that and i'm stronger now i would say that like my musical taste changed in very short amounts of time so i went from being obsessed with like the hansen brothers to being obsessed with corn in i think the span of one year before i got to the corn phase i was really into savage garden so we're gonna have to listen to one of those songs to bring me back i'm gonna chew i'm not gonna do chicka cherry cola we're gonna do break me shake me which probably wasn't on the radio but i really liked this one it was actually kind of an angry song and it's very minor and dark and serious i never thought opinion again but you moved me in away michael jackson [Music] i might have to add this song to the list of uh songs that have a minor v chord in them because i really really love that sound and it's not used a whole lot in fact classical musicians invented a whole scale just so they could use the major version of this chord so that just goes to show you how important it is for western music but i really really like the minor version it just sounds so much more pensive and just a little bit different so um [Music] there it is that's pretty then it goes to the five this time i love it when a chord progression will like change direction the second time but the melody hasn't changed so it's called reharmonization or re-harm okay but this part [Music] okay so now we're going to move into a phase that you might be more familiar with and this is when i discovered my local alternative rock radio station 101x or 101.5 in austin texas so i got exposed to a whole different set of genres the prodigy fat of the land breathe was the first track i heard i i have a feeling that this album has held up really well i mean it's so classic oh my god oh the whip [Music] just hearing a whip you sampled and used rhythmically like that i mean and it really does sound like it's going back and forth it was just so visceral and i always loved the kind of reverse symbols just really creative production [Music] and that strings well feels like a train is coming but it also just sounds like maybe an orchestral like a chord like a sample i don't know i love that it's all in the right all these little rhythmic accents i was just i remember just like i knew all of them and then okay i can't seem to sound like a symbol today but anyway oh my god [Music] okay what is he saying atticusain attic insane is it a person named attica zane but that just the way oh and of course what's coming up i'm so excited for but just the there's something about this that feels like there's just like like a wall of fire being blasted at my face i love the just the the rhythmic flow of i guess it's rapping but man it's so great that come play my game oh man i loved that and it took me a second to figure out what they were saying too because the accent's so heavy but comply my god and this is chromatic he could have said psycho-chromatic [Music] it's chromatic up until that point [Music] that's in a harmonic minor which i have no idea what that was back then but it's a minor scale but oh that's the one i was talking about where they invented the scale way back in the day so that they could have a leading tone or a major five chord which sounds like this so so they could have this chord [Music] that's the note that's the one that i had to bring in and in this context it sounds pretty demented the imperial march is also in the harmonic minor scale okay well that's such a good song but i also i remember loving mine fields and we have to listen to the like the chorus or the brit or whatever there's a part i just have i have to hear it very very cinematic right opening more strings [Music] oh i love this song okay it's slightly lower than f so the piano is going to sound out of tune with it but that'll sound kind of it'll sound kind of cool oh sorry this is dangerous [Music] this feels like they're going easy on us you know like you're like is it dangerous [Music] that's kind of cool but then oh okay this base this base is so nice it reminds me a lot of the timbre of the base used in uk garage music anyone remember this genre is it still going maybe it is [Music] oh this is a dorian that sound i love that then they're so good at these sort of accents that kind of come in that's kind of how they like add variation [Music] and that's just the beginning they're leaving off the end right and they don't bring that into later i love that so just it's just building slowly [Music] what are qe and f we gotta get to that part because i think it does a lydian thing which is another scale uh that has a very curious sound yeah oh it's so cool [Music] it's kind of got this like a mischievous sounding scale the other one i really loved was narayan we just have to listen to just a few seconds of this [Music] wow music like this there are just elements that you will you can't hear everything until you've listened to it over and over again and then you start to hear all the layers or even decades later you're like oh i'm still hearing new things oh and i love this part it goes there's like a string sample maybe [Music] that's the tritone it's so like [Music] great sound design they know how to build something right they're making me anticipate everything i'm like i can't wait you know [Music] i love the snare in this one just really nice syncopation great accents ornamentation [Music] all right now in a similar vein block rock and beats chemical brothers so i bought uh digging your own hole after hearing block reckon beats on 101x and loved the entire album and then i think at the time surrender was already out so then i got surrendered but this album is unparalleled for me it's just oh god like this this the level of nostalgia i feel hearing that panning and [Music] but the whole intro is in like a different key than this part [Music] that fell that phil is perfect [Music] [Music] hi so i don't get asmr as far as i'm aware but there are certain sounds qualities of sound that just like i don't know i they they hype me up or or just make me want to like hit something you know like they're just so there's they do something to the nervous system i i don't know what it is but the drum sounds in this groove kind of do that but then it ups the ante when it gets this part where the tail i guess it's like the reverb tail or delay or something gets bigger and everything sounds like it's a bit further away and they i don't know what they're doing but it just feels like that the groove gets thwackier is this very satisfying thwack sound that to this day clearly makes me feel like in a good way uh [Music] interesting [Music] they sampled some kind of instrument i don't know what it is but i feel like there's metal involved and it's maybe something you shake or i don't know um but they have that kind of going underneath it can you hear that [Music] and this song was always interesting to me because like it very clearly didn't have much of a low end like there's this big sort of boom at the beginning of every measure uh but there's no like bass i mean there's a bass guitar but you know that that guitar doesn't actually sound like it has much low end it kind of can't but a lot of the song feels sort of suspended and elevated in a really strange way [Music] by the way they just took the sample of the bass guitar and they just pitched it up a whole step sorry it just goes up to create some kind of difference right just some kind of little bit of tension that they create or some kind of variety right just a contrast and that's all i did they just took their sample moved it up a whole step or a note but there's that i would love to know what those sounds really are cause you can hear them really well at the very end similarly to the prodigy right just really creative with these sounds and recognizing sort of not just their rhythmic properties but also like their their timbre and like that one kind of goes down then this one goes a lot higher you know creating something very musical with the sounds that inherently aren't okay now here is a song that uh i don't know how i'm gonna react to listening to again this is i'm with stupid by static x i can tell that that was a band that i was into for a very short amount of time and then it just didn't i just didn't like it anymore i'll tell you something i i think this song might have sounded a little bit better if they didn't have that like clap so this has a has a flat two so that's a note that's very heavy sounding and very dark it's used a lot in metal um that's what jaws is [Music] big accent on that really heavy note i like that so i grabbed my shovel i like that change really like emphasize that gap that the rhythm leaves that duh right and then they bring in this sample i mean i think this part was so compelling i was like what on earth is this person saying what is this from what's going on and this is before i was like so i grabbed my shovels like that my shovel oh my god i remember trying to figure out what on earth he was saying here and i came up with some very sinister stuff like i beat him with a skull so he wouldn't yell i i still like that part i am i am i am mine i am mine i am mine i am mine i am mayan name and the rhythm it creates the emphasis is a little bit uh uneven little polyrhythmic now i remember getting a marilyn manson record interestingly enough i did not buy the album with the beautiful people on it but i got the mechanical animals and i remember staring at the cover just being like whoa what is going on like this is like a scary and i also like really like it who is this person how did they do this i remember thinking about like is he wearing a suit is it all cgi like like is that even his body you know it was just so compelling there were a couple songs that really really stuck with me the dope show and i don't like the drugs with the drugs like me [Music] a guitar tone isn't [Music] it's so textured like his i think his voice was very very close to the mic so you can hear just every like uh you know we're all stars now in the dope show again it's that sort of satisfying feeling like so i really really like that this groove is interesting this is what you might call a shuffle you could i don't know but it's it's like got this kind of swinging 68 field and i like that i love slow grooves too because you can really like sink into them with your body and with your teeth just like ah there's so many marilyn's like he tracked his vocals so many times i mean overdubbing like you can hear all these different timbres and textures some of them sound very close and sound very far away maybe not very but further away it's a really interesting feeling like there's all these people around you and you're like who are you all and where are you coming from you know i like this part all right i don't like the drugs but the drugs like me okay i do think there's three octaves i mean come on don't look don't like don't like [Music] oh my god [Music] i forgot how funky this is [Music] it is weird listening to the lyrics now but i'm an adult there's a lot of stuff in here that just went over my head i didn't know what missionary meant i'll tell you that i like this part i love this this is kind of the closer nine inch nails groove you got that you just got this nice like solid kind of kick on the beats or maybe on the back beat and then you got the snare on the two and the four and then you've got these big open hi-hats filling that space and the offbeats it just it sounds great with rock i really like that sound it feels it it feels very like foreboding and kind of sensual and oh i have not heard this in such a long time that's a cool interlude because that phrasing is kind of uneven and just totally you can't really predict what's about to happen i like this don't like the drugs the drugs the drugs next up is a psytrance song so this is called who's nutty and i heard this um it's by space tribe and i heard this on 101 x on some kind of show that they were doing i think it was like after hours could have been like 2 a.m who's nutty is what got me into psychedelic trans oh my god it's like it was yesterday that guitar and he's got these cartoon samples it made me feel so weird pulsating they really filled it up i learned so much from this song i ended up writing trans myself for quite a while [Music] like i would just pattern my songs off of this you know and be like okay then they bring in the hi-hats then they bring in the bass and all the elements i was like this is what makes it work uh so oh man but that bass sounds good that sounds really great it's panned so well it's mixed so well oh oh yeah those accents all those harmonics oh my god there's a tambo no truth be tambo i definitely put tambo in my trans for a while too i thought it sounded good and you know maybe maybe it did anyways this goes on for eight minutes so so we got a part two we got a part three coming up or 2000 to 2005. and i also want to do a whole series on the stank face songs

by Eve six I mean [Music] [Music] it's been round to a beautiful oblivion rendezvous [Music] our time has gotten stale I did it anyone else feel like this guitar tone is just very delicious [Music] also who likes how he says ginger ale laughs that's so dramatic [Music] but my stomach turns oh that's fun more flat six [Music] I think it stays on that cord [Music] [Music] the chords are different first time it's goes [Music] hey this has got that gated guitar thing too I guess that must must have been a 90s thing I love that oh I love this part it's one note [Music] another example of how incredibly important rhythm is for catchy Melodies number one Crush [Music] it's so nasty [Music] to know that you're mine foreign [Music] apt about this song and there's a lot of reasons why I think but one of them is the notes that that Shirley is kind of leaning on have a lot of half steps in them half steps are like this so if we're in the key of D like those or uh [Music] you hear that [Music] I see your face [Music] that was so fucking graceful pardon my French oh my gosh Okay so and that's so beautiful because it's the Plastics cord but also because she's singing notes that create this interval called a tritone which is very unstable but in these cases I think it can sound really vulnerable okay what are the lyrics [Music] but then over this chord there's a tritone in there too and that's because these two chords have a lot of notes in common sorry and that chord sounds almost hopeful what is she sing there you will believe [Music] Lord ignored hear that motion but these chords listen to them fast [Music] there's there's something very dramatic about how all those chords are related this whole song is amazing I'm just going to skip to the end though because the end is so amazing the way she goes down down down in her voice so she's talking about well her number one Crush has to say is saying things like I will wait for you I'd make room for you I'd steal ships for you to be close to you to be part of you because I believe in you I believe in you and it feels like it's building to like some final statement right because it's just continuing I do this for you I do this to be that to be that right they're all connected and meanwhile she's slowly lowering her voice to be closer now it's close to you [Music] [Music] so not only is that the lowest note she sung in the entire song and that's a pretty low note for a woman D I would die for you uh but she's not sung that note even like higher in this part of the song right where she's going you know [Music] and that note is not as finished sounding as this one because we're in the key of D so she's going [Music] now it still feels kind of like we could stay there but you start to get the feeling like she is going to finally seal the deal and go all the way down but she's prolonging it just chalk that up to like the one of the most tasteful choices they could have made I think it's so brilliant because this person is stalking her right and this it's completely out of touch with reality and clearly dangerous right and just to to hear her go down there Feels Like Anything Could Have I don't know I just love that part so much I always look forward to it I'm sure I'm not alone in loving that I mean it's sexy now that was in Romeo and Juliet and this song was also in Romeo and Juliet this is talk show host by Radiohead now there are two versions of this um I am familiar with the one from the movie soundtrack so that's the one I'm gonna play [Music] if you want to play this by the way it's it's not too difficult do you have a B flat and a c and then you have G on top always E flat on the bottom then B then C's it just goes down like it's got an attitude that's very cool like this song smokes [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so so many things about this song are so good the percussion is really creative here just the groove it kind of has that almost like like a 50s kind of two I don't know also spy movie I don't know there's something spy movie about this so syncopated and all the sound design around them right the kind of whistling makes you feel like you're kind of losing your mind a little bit like things just aren't quite balanced inside you want me and his Melody is amazing see he leaves keeps leaving you on this very unfinished note it's like a question and he literally sang you want me so it's perfect you want me that note makes it oh my God [Music] flat six [Music] I'm whistling [Music] [Music] he's got all these like uh I think it's well it could be vocal fry you could put it that way maybe or like a little bit of a vocal cry uh I guess crying is different than frying [Music] there's something with a delay playing this interval the whole time I love that um [Music] [Music] that's great I love that those two major chords that sound very dramatic honey on his voice I don't think it's a voice it could be it probably is a voice but they've modulated it so much that it sounds otherworldly and like it doesn't even have an instrument but it's above him going but doesn't sound quite so clear super heavy flanger maybe they're strings maybe it was strings harmonizing with him but that Flander is so cool I think it's a flanger some kind of filter I love that part all these little details [Music] me but he really draws that out so it's a delayed gratification feeling [Music] and the last song is letting the cable sleep by Bush bringing it back full circle [Music] thank you in the dark you were the pain [Music] I really love rock drums but I also really like electronic drums when they're used Tastefully and I feel like this was the right decision I think it would have sound fine satisfying with live drums too like with a cross stick or something kind of gentle but it just adds a really nice element a little bit of a Detachment that I think is appropriate for the song so this is got a flat six chord right away and it also has that mode mixture I was talking about so [Music] do do this Court's not expected after this you would expect so some of these chords are what are called sus cores or ad9 chords all you need to know is that there's a note in there that normally wouldn't be there creating all this tension and Beauty so this one I don't know this one's probably just major but it could be an add nine and then this one sometimes I think it has that one this one definitely sometimes has it so it's this notes but add that with the major chords but then you add that with the major chords [Music] you hear that oh [Music] what's up whatever you say it's all right whatever you do it's all good building the tension every say it's all right finally relief so pretty wow it's interesting because I was just I just made a video about an arcade fire song and they have a similar vamp [Music] [Music] me into Oblivion however all the way and then he does heaven is on the way and it does it again that chord has always stood out to me I think it's probably it's like a major chord and it doesn't belong in the key [Music] hell [Music] Frozen that's such an incomplete sound again just leading you and leaving you in this unanswered question so lovely [Music] oh yeah okay whoever arranged these strings is has my heart this is so beautiful so they got foreign purposely end on this minor chord instead it's always been that major one but not that's the minor so see how much darker that sounds [Music] [Music] thank you you wanna see on a decline Breaking the Waves watching the lights go down [Music] it's beautiful that that you on the sea on decline Breaking the Waves how much space they left in the mix there the drums and him and the Reverb it's so intriguing and then watching the lights go down the strings watching the lights go down oh no I'm gonna cry [Music] it's so good okay I think that's enough thank you so much for watching I love the 90s are the 90s As Good As It Seems like it is it just my generation or is it just unequivocally fantastic music I think it's maybe a little bit of both I got the poison [Music] ous reluctantly crouched at the starting line [Music]",

going to finally seal the deal and go all the way down but she's prolonging it just chalk that up to like the one of the most tasteful choices they could have made I think it's so brilliant because this person is stalking her right and this it's completely out of touch with reality and clearly dangerous right and just to to hear her go down there Feels Like Anything Could Have I don't know I just love that part so much I always look forward to it I'm sure I'm not alone in loving that I mean it's sexy now that was in Romeo and Juliet and this song was also in Romeo and Juliet this is talk show host by Radiohead now there are two versions of this um I am familiar with the one from the movie soundtrack so that's the one I'm gonna play [Music] if you want to play this by the way it's it's not too difficult do you have a B flat and a c and then you have G on top always E flat on the bottom then B then C's it just goes down like it's got an attitude that's very cool like this song smokes [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so so many things about this song are so good the percussion is really creative here just the groove it kind of has that almost like like a 50s kind of two I don't know also spy movie I don't know there's something spy movie about this so syncopated and all the sound design around them right the kind of whistling makes you feel like you're kind of losing your mind a little bit like things just aren't quite balanced inside you want me and his Melody is amazing see he leaves keeps leaving you on this very unfinished note it's like a question and he literally sang you want me so it's perfect you want me that note makes it oh my God [Music] flat six [Music] I'm whistling [Music] [Music] he's got all these like uh I think it's well it could be vocal fry you could put it that way maybe or like a little bit of a vocal cry uh I guess crying is different than frying [Music] there's something with a delay playing this interval the whole time I love that um [Music] [Music] that's great I love that those two major chords that sound very dramatic honey on his voice I don't think it's a voice it could be it probably is a voice but they've modulated it so much that it sounds otherworldly and like it doesn't even have an instrument but it's above him going but doesn't sound quite so clear super heavy flanger maybe they're strings maybe it was strings harmonizing with him but that Flander is so cool I think it's a flanger some kind of filter I love that part all these little details [Music] me but he really draws that out so it's a delayed gratification feeling [Music] and the last song is letting the cable sleep by Bush bringing it back full circle [Music] thank you in the dark you were the pain [Music] I really love rock drums but I also really like electronic drums when they're used Tastefully and I feel like this was the right decision I think it would have sound fine satisfying with live drums too like with a cross stick or something kind of gentle but it just adds a really nice element a little bit of a Detachment that I think is appropriate for the song so this is got a flat six chord right away and it also has that mode mixture I was talking about so [Music] do do this Court's not expected after this you would expect so some of these chords are what are called sus cores or ad9 chords all you need to know is that there's a note in there that normally wouldn't be there creating all this tension and Beauty so this one I don't know this one's probably just major but it could be an add nine and then this one sometimes I think it has that one this one definitely sometimes has it so it's this notes but add that with the major chords but then you add that with the major chords [Music] you hear that oh [Music] what's up whatever you say it's all right whatever you do it's all good building the tension every say it's all right finally relief so pretty wow it's interesting because I was just I just made a video about an arcade fire song and they have a similar vamp [Music] [Music] me into Oblivion however all the way and then he does heaven is on the way and it does it again that chord has always stood out to me I think it's probably it's like a major chord and it doesn't belong in the key [Music] hell [Music] Frozen that's such an incomplete sound again just leading you and leaving you in this unanswered question so lovely [Music] oh yeah okay whoever arranged these strings is has my heart this is so beautiful so they got foreign purposely end on this minor chord instead it's always been that major one but not that's the minor so see how much darker that sounds [Music] [Music] thank you you wanna see on a decline Breaking the Waves watching the lights go down [Music] it's beautiful that that you on the sea on decline Breaking the Waves how much space they left in the mix there the drums and him and the Reverb it's so intriguing and then watching the lights go down the strings watching the lights go down oh no I'm gonna cry [Music] it's so good okay I think that's enough thank you so much for watching I love the 90s are the 90s As Good As It Seems like it is it just my generation or is it just unequivocally fantastic music I think it's maybe a little bit of both I got the poison [Music] ous reluctantly crouched at the starting line [Music]"
