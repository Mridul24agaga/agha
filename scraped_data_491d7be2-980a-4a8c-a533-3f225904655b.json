There’s nothing quite like the anticipation of your favorite artist’s new album. As a bona fide Swiftie, I awoke early on April 19 and was surprised by not one new masterpiece from Taylor Swift, but a double album: “The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology.” For the next 72 hours, I streamed the songs over and over. Swift’s new album is a departure from her mostly upbeat pop material, and to me it perfectly encapsulates heartbreak and how it feels to be a woman in your mid-30s. It even seemed like the weekend’s gloomy weather captured Swift’s and my moody dispositions. It’s no surprise that music affects our mental health, but how and why? Danielle Sukenik, instructor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, discusses how music affects our brains, our collective excitement about a new album and what to look out for when the excitement goes too far. How does music affect our brains? Music impacts our brain in profound ways, ways in which scientists and neuroscientists are still trying to understand. Many different regions of our brain are activated when we listen to music, including the auditory cortex and the temporal lobe, which process tone and pitch. From there, it impacts the limbic system, including the amygdala and hippocampus, responsible for emotions and memories respectively. This explains why music can evoke nostalgia, or a strong association with past memories and is also why we're seeing some individuals with dementia respond really well to music. Music also impacts the cerebellum, which is a part of regulating and processing timing, rhythm and movement. Why does it sometimes feel so good to listen to sad music when you’re feeling down? When we listen to music that matches our mood, it can help us feel our feelings. If we're feeling sad and move towards sad music, then it aligns with our mood and the energy flow of the emotion can move through us. It can help us give words to our feelings that sometimes can be really difficult to describe, especially with those harder emotions, and it feels really good to be acknowledged and understood from that musical lens. There are also hypotheses that prolactin can be produced by listening to music, which is a hormone that may promote crying; it also produces a calming effect that can help sit with emotional pain a bit easier. Can music positively impact our moods? Absolutely. Music activates the reward system in our brain, producing neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and endorphins triggering feelings associated with joy and pleasure. Music can also lower cortisol levels, which is directly associated with stress and why we can sometimes feel more relaxed when we're listening to music and it can help prepare us for sleep. There have also been studies on how music can produce naturally occurring opioids or pain reducers in our systems. Does experiencing music live vs. recorded have any noted mental health benefits? Yes, studies have shown that live music impacts our emotional state more significantly than recorded music. Live music is like the evolutionary root of music. Music has existed long before recording technology and streaming devices, and listening to it live really can't be replicated. There's something about witnessing the musicians and feeling the energy of the crowd that we just don't get when we're listening to a recording on a device. Why is there so much anticipation when Taylor Swift or another popular artist releases new music? Humans like to be a part of something, and there’s certainly a community and culture around Taylor Swift or anticipating an artist’s new release. Since Swift’s music is often so relatable, this leaves many feeling seen and understood, which keeps them anticipating the next drop. When we anticipate something, it creates this sense of craving in our brain and leaves us wanting more. When we do get it, whether it’s a release or a drop in a song, it produces a really pleasurable effect. Of course, marketing plays a role here too – an artist may be more successful with a new release if they work to build up hype within their audience. Is there a point when a para-social relationship with a musician like Taylor Swift can go too far in terms of someone’s mental health? I'm very much a believer that most things are OK and harmless in moderation and with balance, including para-social relationships. It's normal, usually harmless, but has the potential to create issues for some. If we find ourselves developing one of these relationships on a celebrity crush, it’s important to check in and ask: Are other areas of my life being impacted by this, such as my personal relationships, work, school or home life? That's a good measure for any kind of pattern or behavior: Is it impacting my functioning in areas of my life? It’s also important to check in with how someone feels. For many people, a para-social relationship can be really fun and bring joy and a lightness, or it can be really consuming and distressful, and then people may not be living aligned with what's important to them which can be a cause for concern. Who is your Taylor Swift? I appreciate this question because I don't identify as a Swiftie. I respect and admire what she's doing, but it's not my vibe. My “Taylor Swift” is a feature that I use on the listening platform I use, Spotify, and it's called ‘daylist.’ It curates songs and changes four to five times a day based on my listening patterns and the time of day. It usually resonates with my mood or the activity that I'm doing, and it helps me connect to new artists, so it produces that same exciting, pleasurable feeling some may get when singing their favorite Taylor Swift song.

Whether it’s the heartbreak that runs through a Lana Del Rey song or the raw vulnerability expressed in Post Malone’s lyrics, music has a unique way of capturing the essence of human emotions. Over the years, artists have continuously used their music to create a powerful dialogue with their audience, and this connection has only grown stronger as societal values, struggles, and triumphs evolve. Lana Del Rey, for example, has become an icon for her ability to express complex emotional experiences. Her songs often capture a sense of nostalgia, longing, and vulnerability, reflecting themes of love, loss, and self-discovery. Her album tracks resonate with listeners worldwide, and her sound has transcended simple genres, blending cinematic qualities with melancholic pop. If you want to dive deeper into the artistic journey of Lana Del Rey, explore her Lana Del Rey top songs to truly understand how her music captures the emotional essence of society's evolving moods. Similarly, Post Malone's music has become a soundtrack to the modern era, with lyrics that reflect personal experiences and societal anxieties. His song “Die For Me” is a perfect example of how music can intertwine personal vulnerability with universal themes of love and emotional turmoil. The Die For Me Post Malone lyrics provide insight into the deeper emotional currents that drive the artist’s music. This song isn’t just about relationships; it’s a reflection of how people sometimes struggle to find the balance between selflessness and personal sacrifice. Through his music, Post Malone has been able to articulate the confusion, pain, and longing that many people feel in relationships, making his work timeless and relevant to a wide range of listeners. In the contemporary music landscape, Maneskin has emerged as one of the most important new rock bands that blends the power of rock with modern influences, such as pop and alternative music. Their raw energy and defiance of traditional norms have been central to their appeal. The band, originating from Italy, has revolutionized the rock genre with their bold lyrics and theatrical performances, drawing global attention. Maneskin’s unapologetic sound and fiery stage presence reflect the defiance and freedom that many young people are feeling in today's society. Their success is a testament to how music can adapt and grow to reflect the current climate of cultural change and rebellion. By pushing boundaries, Maneskin is helping reshape the future of rock music, inviting listeners to embrace authenticity and self-expression without apology. The modern music industry is also witnessing a significant shift in its business structure. Record labels like HYBE Geffen Records are playing a crucial role in shaping the industry by providing a platform for artists to explore innovative music styles while staying true to their identity. This partnership has brought together diverse cultures and artists to create music that resonates across different regions. HYBE’s involvement in global partnerships signals a new era of cross-cultural influence, where artists from various parts of the world can impact global trends. The synergy between these major companies is helping the music industry reflect not only its changing emotions but also the ongoing evolution of music consumption and production. Post Malone’s “Circles” is another significant example of how music can capture emotional depth while still offering a sound that appeals to mainstream audiences. The Circles Post Malone lyrics highlight a different facet of emotion, one that is both introspective and relatable. The song’s melody, which blends pop and rock influences, perfectly complements the lyrics that delve into themes of emotional confusion and the cyclical nature of life and relationships. “Circles” has become an anthem for many who feel trapped in situations they cannot escape, yet it also offers a sense of hope and understanding. This mixture of emotional conflict and acceptance of life’s challenges resonates with listeners who are going through similar experiences. The way music mirrors society’s emotional shifts is not just about lyrics or melodies—it’s also about the broader context in which it’s created. The music industry itself plays a role in shaping the narrative by embracing new sounds, genres, and perspectives. Artists are no longer confined to one genre or style; they are free to experiment, collaborate, and create music that defies categorization. The rise of platforms like Spotify and Apple Music has democratized music consumption, allowing artists to gain exposure globally. This shift has allowed music to speak to broader audiences and capture a wider range of emotions, experiences, and cultural moments. The partnerships between record labels, streaming services, and independent artists are helping to amplify diverse voices, ensuring that music remains a powerful tool for social commentary. Looking at the emotional journey captured through the music of Lana Del Rey, Post Malone, Maneskin, and others, we can see how they are not only artists but also cultural commentators. They have the ability to capture the emotional tides of society, reflect them back to their audiences, and offer a space for listeners to process their feelings. Music is an outlet for expression, and as society continues to evolve, so too will the sounds and messages that artists convey. By listening closely to songs like those from Lana Del Rey top songs, Die For Me Post Malone lyrics, Maneskin, and Circles Post Malone lyrics, we gain insight not only into the artist’s journey but into our own emotions as well. These songs provide a soundtrack to the moments of our lives and help us understand the emotions that often go unspoken. As music continues to reflect the changes in society, its emotional power will undoubtedly remain a vital part of our lives, guiding us through the ever-evolving human experience. In conclusion, music will always be a reflection of society’s emotional landscape, and through the works of artists like Lana Del Rey, Post Malone, Maneskin, and the collaborative efforts of labels like HYBE Geffen Records, we are able to explore these complex emotions. These artists continue to push the boundaries of their craft, ensuring that music remains a powerful force for understanding and expression in the world. how to About the Creator Deliver My Tune Enjoyed the story?

Over the years, artists have continuously used their music to create a powerful dialogue with their audience, and this connection has only grown stronger as societal values, struggles, and triumphs evolve. Lana Del Rey, for example, has become an icon for her ability to express complex emotional experiences. Her songs often capture a sense of nostalgia, longing, and vulnerability, reflecting themes of love, loss, and self-discovery. Her album tracks resonate with listeners worldwide, and her sound has transcended simple genres, blending cinematic qualities with melancholic pop. If you want to dive deeper into the artistic journey of Lana Del Rey, explore her Lana Del Rey top songs to truly understand how her music captures the emotional essence of society's evolving moods. Similarly, Post Malone's music has become a soundtrack to the modern era, with lyrics that reflect personal experiences and societal anxieties. His song “Die For Me” is a perfect example of how music can intertwine personal vulnerability with universal themes of love and emotional turmoil. The Die For Me Post Malone lyrics provide insight into the deeper emotional currents that drive the artist’s music. This song isn’t just about relationships; it’s a reflection of how people sometimes struggle to find the balance between selflessness and personal sacrifice. Through his music, Post Malone has been able to articulate the confusion, pain, and longing that many people feel in relationships, making his work timeless and relevant to a wide range of listeners. In the contemporary music landscape, Maneskin has emerged as one of the most important new rock bands that blends the power of rock with modern influences, such as pop and alternative music. Their raw energy and defiance of traditional norms have been central to their appeal. The band, originating from Italy, has revolutionized the rock genre with their bold lyrics and theatrical performances, drawing global attention. Maneskin’s unapologetic sound and fiery stage presence reflect the defiance and freedom that many young people are feeling in today's society. Their success is a testament to how music can adapt and grow to reflect the current climate of cultural change and rebellion. By pushing boundaries, Maneskin is helping reshape the future of rock music, inviting listeners to embrace authenticity and self-expression without apology. The modern music industry is also witnessing a significant shift in its business structure. Record labels like HYBE Geffen Records are playing a crucial role in shaping the industry by providing a platform for artists to explore innovative music styles while staying true to their identity. This partnership has brought together diverse cultures and artists to create music that resonates across different regions. HYBE’s involvement in global partnerships signals a new era of cross-cultural influence, where artists from various parts of the world can impact global trends. The synergy between these major companies is helping the music industry reflect not only its changing emotions but also the ongoing evolution of music consumption and production. Post Malone’s “Circles” is another significant example of how music can capture emotional depth while still offering a sound that appeals to mainstream audiences. The Circles Post Malone lyrics highlight a different facet of emotion, one that is both introspective and relatable. The song’s melody, which blends pop and rock influences, perfectly complements the lyrics that delve into themes of emotional confusion and the cyclical nature of life and relationships. “Circles” has become an anthem for many who feel trapped in situations they cannot escape, yet it also offers a sense of hope and understanding. This mixture of emotional conflict and acceptance of life’s challenges resonates with listeners who are going through similar experiences. The way music mirrors society’s emotional shifts is not just about lyrics or melodies—it’s also about the broader context in which it’s created. The music industry itself plays a role in shaping the narrative by embracing new sounds, genres, and perspectives. Artists are no longer confined to one genre or style; they are free to experiment, collaborate, and create music that defies categorization. The rise of platforms like Spotify and Apple Music has democratized music consumption, allowing artists to gain exposure globally. This shift has allowed music to speak to broader audiences and capture a wider range of emotions, experiences, and cultural moments. The partnerships between record labels, streaming services, and independent artists are helping to amplify diverse voices, ensuring that music remains a powerful tool for social commentary. Looking at the emotional journey captured through the music of Lana Del Rey, Post Malone, Maneskin, and others, we can see how they are not only artists but also cultural commentators. They have the ability to capture the emotional tides of society, reflect them back to their audiences, and offer a space for listeners to process their feelings. Music is an outlet for expression, and as society continues to evolve, so too will the sounds and messages that artists convey. By listening closely to songs like those from Lana Del Rey top songs, Die For Me Post Malone lyrics, Maneskin, and Circles Post Malone lyrics, we gain insight not only into the artist’s journey but into our own emotions as well. These songs provide a soundtrack to the moments of our lives and help us understand the emotions that often go unspoken. As music continues to reflect the changes in society, its emotional power will undoubtedly remain a vital part of our lives, guiding us through the ever-evolving human experience. In conclusion, music will always be a reflection of society’s emotional landscape, and through the works of artists like Lana Del Rey, Post Malone, Maneskin, and the collaborative efforts of labels like HYBE Geffen Records, we are able to explore these complex emotions. These artists continue to push the boundaries of their craft, ensuring that music remains a powerful force for understanding and expression in the world. how to About the Creator Deliver My Tune Enjoyed the story?

I'm working on a performance piece where I'd like to dance to the same song but in three different styles to reinterpret the same lyrics. It starts off cozy/breezy/normal, then the same song becomes a little off-kilter or suspicious, then it goes into \"secretly sad\" or \"this sounds sinister\". (The performance is based on personal mental health stuff; the idea is that different states of mental health can make the same words or situations feel very different emotionally.) I doubt there's one song that does all I want at once, so I'm interested in songs that have covers or alternate arrangements that hit the other notes. I'd imagine it's easier to find happy songs with sad cover versions than the reverse, but I'm open to any combination! The songs/artists/covers don't have to be famous or recognisable, though that could help if it's particularly poignant. Any genre is fine, though preferably in English since this is for an English-speaking audience. posted by divabat to Media & Arts (55 answers total) 32 users marked this as a favorite You got this rather mellow, sexy version of Nothing Compares to You (written by Prince) - versus the heartrending Sinead O'Conner version. posted by karmachameleon at 11:01 PM on October 15, 2017 [1 favorite] Born in the USA, 2 ways: Album version 12-string version posted by wemayfreeze at 11:03 PM on October 15, 2017 The song “Satisfaction” by The Rolling Stones, covered by Devo, and covered more disturbingly by the Residents. posted by ejs at 11:06 PM on October 15, 2017 [4 favorites] Ooh! And one more Born in the USA, by Casiotone for the Painfully Alone! posted by wemayfreeze at 11:06 PM on October 15, 2017 Owner of a Lonely Heart, original by Yes, or as covered by Grizzly Bear. In My Time of Dying (Jesus Gonna Make Up My Dying Bed), by Josh White, or as covered by Led Zeppelin. (There are many more versions of this song and lots of other blues-folk songs, covered by rock bands). Gin and Juice, by Snoop or a country version by an ?unknown? artist. posted by stillmoving at 11:13 PM on October 15, 2017 In general, the Residents are excellent at this sort of thing. posted by potrzebie at 11:16 PM on October 15, 2017 [4 favorites] Mad World By Tears For Fears Mad World By Gary Jules posted by christiehawk at 11:19 PM on October 15, 2017 [2 favorites] I've always been partial to Travis' lovely and melancholy cover of Britney's Hit Me Baby One More Time. posted by hurdy gurdy girl at 11:39 PM on October 15, 2017 [2 favorites] Florence + the Machine turned Robert Palmer's ostentatious, lackadaisical \"Addicted to Love\" into something that sounds more like a saloon shootout between Raphael's cherubs. posted by armeowda at 11:39 PM on October 15, 2017 Not sure how well Spotify playlists link, but there is a pretty nice list of covers called, Take Note of These Covers that has 92 cover songs on it.

The first really sinister cover of a danceable pop song that came to mind was Thanatos's \"That's the Way (I Like It).\" Just googling a bit, I see a number of options for it: breezy acoustic, metal, original, the Michael Jackson version with an extra vocal part, Dead or Alive, and more. I know \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" also has a zillion covers in different styles, e.g. an upbeat but off-putting version, a sort of breezy version, a happy version, an even more maudlin version, a slow, soft acoustic version, etc. posted by Wobbuffet at 11:53 PM on October 15, 2017 by an ?unknown? artist. the gourds posted by poffin boffin at 12:27 AM on October 16, 2017 [3 favorites] Oh, a poignant example that came to mind of the artist radically changing the emotional tone herself: Cyndi Lauper, \"She Bop\" (video version) vs. \"She Bop (The Body Acoustic Version).\" For off-putting, there's Matisse or, uh, GWAR ... Others' \"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\" covers often shift the tone too, e.g. Ben Gibbard (Death Cab) vs. Chromatics vs. Postmodern Jukebox. posted by Wobbuffet at 12:45 AM on October 16, 2017 [1 favorite] Que Sera Sera by Doris Day (breezy) and by Pink Martini (slightly sinister). posted by misteraitch at 12:46 AM on October 16, 2017 light and sweet \"Night & Day\" by Ella Fitzgerald super creepy and stalker-y \"Night & Day\" by U2 posted by alchemist at 12:59 AM on October 16, 2017 [3 favorites] Nancy Sinatra's original These Boots Are Walkin is breezy.

The latter breezy and crisp, the former heavy and creepy. posted by lasagnaboy at 1:38 AM on October 16, 2017 Richard Cheese covers a multitude of other songs in a lounge singer style. It is all quite funny. posted by koolkat at 1:43 AM on October 16, 2017 [2 favorites] Also, The Girl From Ipanema has a million different covers with many different feelings. The wistful nature of the song means there's probably a trace of sadness even in the breezy versions, but if you're OK with that, here are a few examples: BREEZY: Frank Sinatra Amy WinehouseAstrud Gilberto OFF-KILTER: Dictionaraoke Kompressor A band called Toydeath has a weird version recorded entirely on children's toys-- it has a very sad/creepy clown feeling. I can't find an MP3 online but message me if you're interested (or hit the band up on Facebook.) SAD: Stan Getz & Joao Gilberto And if that's not enough, here's a list of many different covers of the song. posted by yankeefog at 2:04 AM on October 16, 2017 [1 favorite] Breezy and sassy: Love For Sale by Anita O'Day Smooth and alluring: Love For Sale by Ella Fitzgerald Desparate and haunting: Love For Sale by Elvis Costello posted by Too-Ticky at 2:04 AM on October 16, 2017 Lots of Radiohead Creep covers out there. Here are 10 ranked according to someone or other. posted by UnoDosTresEsto at 2:30 AM on October 16, 2017 Best answer: Poignantly (as it was produced by edgeways who has since passed away) this is a lovely wistful version of You Spin Me Round by Dead or Alive. posted by billiebee at 2:41 AM on October 16, 2017 Mountain Goats cover of The Boys Are Back in Town. White Stripes cover of Jolene posted by easternblot at 3:14 AM on October 16, 2017 Adding to Stillmoving, there's this cover of Gin and Juice. You may want to review a bunch of Richard Cheese's oeveur - I always thought of it as the 'happy face being put on for the world by a depressed person', including their cover of \"Down with the Sickness\": Original by Disturbed Richard Cheese A close-to-the-original version with acoustic guitars that sounds very different posted by mephron at 3:27 AM on October 16, 2017 Wistful: \"Summer Breeze,\" Seals & Croft Off-kilter/sinister, \"Summer Breeze,\" Type O Negative posted by MonkeyToes at 4:22 AM on October 16, 2017 [1 favorite] Coffee by Sylvan Esso partially covers Hanky Panky by Tommy James in a melancholic tune. posted by buttonedup at 4:31 AM on October 16, 2017 Oh, and Johnny Cash's version of NIN's \"Hurt.\" posted by stillmoving at 4:38 AM on October 16, 2017 [3 favorites] Toxic, the original, by Britney Spears. The cover by Yael Naim that is a lovely, melancholic reworking of the same. Sorry, on the phone, cannot post links, but both available on Apple Music. posted by Nieshka at 4:42 AM on October 16, 2017 Let's Dance: Original high 80's cheese by David Bowie. M Ward turns it into something haunting and melancholy. posted by ActionPopulated at 4:44 AM on October 16, 2017 There is only one great answer to this question. Brian Wilson & The Beach Boys \"God Only Knows\" is a song about eternal love, right? Not exactly. In the hands of Elvis Costello & The Brodsky Quartet, \"God Only Knows\" becomes a biting acidic treatise of \"I would have been better off without you,\" but like, wrapped in a melodious fluffy pillow. It's the sort of twist that will really fuck you up. posted by jbenben at 5:02 AM on October 16, 2017 Response by poster: Wobbuffet: Do you have particular thematic constraints for the lyrics? I'm pretty open, but I'm thinking mostly in the vein of \"could be a generic pop song\" lyrically. Like, Mad World isn't going to work because it's too on the nose and gives away the story too quickly, and Born in the USA has its own strong narrative. Girls Just Wanna Have Fun is a good suggestion because the lyrics can be quite relevant. But yeah, anything where the lyrics don't necessarily stand out unless you're paying attention to them/hear them in a different emotional context would be good! posted by divabat at 5:40 AM on October 16, 2017 Response by poster: _\"I kissed a girl\" has several different versions. jill sobule's is touching, poignant, and.. From the Clueless soundtrack. Huh. Katy Perry's is brash, reminds me of club girls, and absolutely not poignant. posted by Jacen_ They share a title but are two completely different songs! posted by divabat at 5:43 AM on October 16, 2017 [3 favorites] \"Dirge-like\" rendition of Fame by our own chococat, vs Irene Cara's from the movie. posted by jaruwaan at 6:37 AM on October 16, 2017 To add to Yankeefog's list (BTW that Kompressor was AWESOME), 200+ versions of These Boots Are Made For Walkin'. Many different moods. posted by JulesER at 6:46 AM on October 16, 2017 [2 favorites] What about Radiohead's \"Morning Bell\"? The versions on Kid A and Amnesiac are so different that I didn't even realize it was the same song for an embarrassingly long time. posted by saladin at 7:18 AM on October 16, 2017 [1 favorite] Sonic Youth covered Superstar by The Carpenters with a stalkery vibe. posted by soelo at 7:41 AM on October 16, 2017 [1 favorite] My fave might be Springsteen's re-visioning of Blinded by the Light. (Original) posted by booth at 8:05 AM on October 16, 2017 Jennifer Paige's Crush is a silly pop song from the nineties. The Dismemberment Plan's version is just depressing. posted by galvanized unicorn at 8:18 AM on October 16, 2017 [1 favorite] Glen Hansard did sparse, lyrically-focused covers of Justin Timberlake's \"Cry Me a River\" (Original) and Britney Spears's \"Everytime.\" (Original) Each of them are beautiful, and bring out the emotional weight of the lyrics. (In her defense, Britney's version is pretty sparse, too. Maybe it's my fault that I can't hear her voice and treat it with sufficient gravitas.) posted by AgentRocket at 8:57 AM on October 16, 2017 Jose Gonzalez's wistful, melancholy acoustic version of Heartbeats is the best known, and assumed by many to be the original. It's actually a cover of a more wild and desperate electro dance track by The Knife. Speaking of electro dance, Fischerspooner's cover of The 15th vs. the original version by The Wire might scratch this itch too. posted by capricorn at 9:14 AM on October 16, 2017 You got this rather mellow, sexy version of Nothing Compares to You (written by Prince) - versus the heartrending Sinead O'Conner version. And then the totally bonkers, genderbent, Little Richard-styled cover by Big Daddy! Please consult Big Daddy for all your novelty '50s-themed cover song needs. posted by Faint of Butt at 9:49 AM on October 16, 2017 [2 favorites] A-ha remade their own \"Take on Me\" recently, as discussed here. The original is bright and poppy and the new version is soft and soothing. posted by jhope71 at 9:57 AM on October 16, 2017 For some reason I keep going to Disney for this. Which you may be able to work to your advantage - Disney songs have the extra weight of cultural baggage attached to them in the original, so it can somehow be even more subversive when you spin them. There was a super-creepy version of \"I've Got No Strings\" from Pinocchio that I heard used in a movie trailer once - I don't know the artist but it was probably one of these folks. There was an entire tribute album of Disney covers some years back, which includes a Tom Waits cover of \"Heigh-Ho\" from Snow White. Which is bound to be a mind-fuck. Another source to check out - either of the \"Super Hits\" albums by the German artist Max Raabe. He does German 1920s style big band dancehall stuff, and the \"Super Hits\" albums are that style covers of contemporary pop songs. His cover of \"Oops I Did It Again\" is bonkers. I don't know how menacing any of the other covers would be, but they're odd enough that some people may be freaked out (or it could round out a selection that you've already got). Side note upon reading this thread - Glen Hansard did a cover of Cry Me A River???? I gotta listen when I get home from work. posted by EmpressCallipygos at 10:10 AM on October 16, 2017 [1 favorite] Some extreme varieties of style, if not necessarily emotional content: Avriel and the Sequoias - Hey Ya The Cleverlys - Gangnam Style I would check out Johnny Cash's American Songs collection -- many of those have something of a departure in emotions from the original.

Linking it anyway.) posted by daisystomper at 3:51 PM on October 16, 2017 Adalita’s cover of “Burning Up” turns Madonna’s fun poppy dance track about having the hots for someone into an unsettling and creepy ballad about an unhealthy relationship (song starts about 55 seconds in to the YouTube link). posted by arha at 3:58 PM on October 16, 2017 My first thought was Ryan Adams's cover of Taylor Swift's album 1989. Those are all very different versions--his slow, ballad, sad versions of her high-energy pop songs. Like, check out their two versions of Blank Space, and then I got this one by googling around. Bad Blood is another one that has several versions that are very different in tone. posted by gideonfrog at 4:44 PM on October 16, 2017 True Faith New Order George Michael Lotte Kester posted by moira at 8:28 PM on October 16, 2017 I love First Aid Kit‘s cover of Simon & Garfunkel’s America. posted by bendy at 10:02 PM on October 16, 2017 Chris Cornell’s cover of Billie Jean is amazing and so complex compared to the original. You could also add his cover of “Nothing Compares 2 U” to the suggestions from the first post and you’d have your 3 versions right there.

      "title": "Same song, different feeling - Music songs emotions | Ask MetaFilter New Site Beta Testing || ChatGPT policy updated || February Site Update || Non Profit FAQ Ask MetaFilter ============== querying the hive mind Log In Sign Up MetaFilter AskMeFi FanFare Projects Music Jobs IRL MetaTalk More Best Of Podcast Chat Labs Mall Search MetaFilter… Menu Home FAQ About Archives Tags Popular Random Same song, different feeling October 15, 2017 10:53 PM Subscribe ================================================================================================================================ Looking for suggestions of songs with alternative arrangements or cover versions that interpret the same lyrics with different emotional notes: breezy, slightly off-putting, sad/deary/Sinister. I'm working on a performance piece where I'd like to dance to the same song but in three different styles to reinterpret the same lyrics. It starts off cozy/breezy/normal, then the same song becomes a little off-kilter or suspicious, then it goes into \"secretly sad\" or \"this sounds sinister\". (The performance is based on personal mental health stuff; the idea is that different states of mental health can make the same words or situations feel very different emotionally.) I doubt there's one song that does all I want at once, so I'm interested in songs that have covers or alternate arrangements that hit the other notes. I'd imagine it's easier to find happy songs with sad cover versions than the reverse, but I'm open to any combination! The songs/artists/covers don't have to be famous or recognisable, though that could help if it's particularly poignant. Any genre is fine, though preferably in English since this is for an English-speaking audience. posted by divabat to Media & Arts (55 answers total) 32 users marked this as a favorite You got this rather mellow, sexy version of Nothing Compares to You (written by Prince) - versus the heartrending Sinead O'Conner version. posted by karmachameleon at 11:01 PM on October 15, 2017 [1 favorite] Born in the USA, 2 ways: Album version 12-string version posted by wemayfreeze at 11:03 PM on October 15, 2017 The song “Satisfaction” by The Rolling Stones, covered by Devo, and covered more disturbingly by the Residents. posted by ejs at 11:06 PM on October 15, 2017 [4 favorites] Ooh!

In My Time of Dying (Jesus Gonna Make Up My Dying Bed), by Josh White, or as covered by Led Zeppelin. (There are many more versions of this song and lots of other blues-folk songs, covered by rock bands). Gin and Juice, by Snoop or a country version by an ?unknown? artist. posted by stillmoving at 11:13 PM on October 15, 2017 In general, the Residents are excellent at this sort of thing. posted by potrzebie at 11:16 PM on October 15, 2017 [4 favorites] Mad World By Tears For Fears Mad World By Gary Jules posted by christiehawk at 11:19 PM on October 15, 2017 [2 favorites] I've always been partial to Travis' lovely and melancholy cover of Britney's Hit Me Baby One More Time. posted by hurdy gurdy girl at 11:39 PM on October 15, 2017 [2 favorites] Florence + the Machine turned Robert Palmer's ostentatious, lackadaisical \"Addicted to Love\" into something that sounds more like a saloon shootout between Raphael's cherubs. posted by armeowda at 11:39 PM on October 15, 2017 Not sure how well Spotify playlists link, but there is a pretty nice list of covers called, Take Note of These Covers that has 92 cover songs on it. Might be a place to start. posted by wile e at 11:43 PM on October 15, 2017 [1 favorite] Chris Cornell's version of Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean.\" John Lennon's \"Imagine\" by A Perfect Circle. posted by xyzzy at 11:50 PM on October 15, 2017 [1 favorite] Do you have particular thematic constraints for the lyrics? The first really sinister cover of a danceable pop song that came to mind was Thanatos's \"That's the Way (I Like It).\" Just googling a bit, I see a number of options for it: breezy acoustic, metal, original, the Michael Jackson version with an extra vocal part, Dead or Alive, and more. I know \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" also has a zillion covers in different styles, e.g. an upbeat but off-putting version, a sort of breezy version, a happy version, an even more maudlin version, a slow, soft acoustic version, etc. posted by Wobbuffet at 11:53 PM on October 15, 2017 by an ?unknown? artist. the gourds posted by poffin boffin at 12:27 AM on October 16, 2017 [3 favorites] Oh, a poignant example that came to mind of the artist radically changing the emotional tone herself: Cyndi Lauper, \"She Bop\" (video version) vs. \"She Bop (The Body Acoustic Version).\" For off-putting, there's Matisse or, uh, GWAR ... Others' \"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\" covers often shift the tone too, e.g. Ben Gibbard (Death Cab) vs. Chromatics vs. Postmodern Jukebox. posted by Wobbuffet at 12:45 AM on October 16, 2017 [1 favorite] Que Sera Sera by Doris Day (breezy) and by Pink Martini (slightly sinister). posted by misteraitch at 12:46 AM on October 16, 2017 light and sweet \"Night & Day\" by Ella Fitzgerald super creepy and stalker-y \"Night & Day\" by U2 posted by alchemist at 12:59 AM on October 16, 2017 [3 favorites] Nancy Sinatra's original These Boots Are Walkin is breezy. The Del Rubio Triplets version is a little more intense and off-kilter. David Byrne's cover is desperate and a little unhinged And then along comes Crispin Glover with a totally deranged cover. posted by yankeefog at 1:34 AM on October 16, 2017 Some of my faves: Stayin' Alive by the Bee Gees performed by Supple Tubthumping by Chumbawumba performed by Angus and Julia Stone Guns of Brixton by The Clash performed by Nouvelle Vague And my fave place for covers, ABC JJJ Radio's \"Like a Version\" series (Youtube Channel) posted by Thella at 1:37 AM on October 16, 2017 [1 favorite] The Pere Ubu Surfer Girl; The Beach Boys’ Surfer Girl. The latter breezy and crisp, the former heavy and creepy. posted by lasagnaboy at 1:38 AM on October 16, 2017 Richard Cheese covers a multitude of other songs in a lounge singer style. It is all quite funny. posted by koolkat at 1:43 AM on October 16, 2017 [2 favorites] Also, The Girl From Ipanema has a million different covers with many different feelings. The wistful nature of the song means there's probably a trace of sadness even in the breezy versions, but if you're OK with that, here are a few examples: BREEZY: Frank Sinatra Amy WinehouseAstrud Gilberto OFF-KILTER: Dictionaraoke Kompressor A band called Toydeath has a weird version recorded entirely on children's toys-- it has a very sad/creepy clown feeling. I can't find an MP3 online but message me if you're interested (or hit the band up on Facebook.) SAD: Stan Getz & Joao Gilberto And if that's not enough, here's a list of many different covers of the song. posted by yankeefog at 2:04 AM on October 16, 2017 [1 favorite] Breezy and sassy: Love For Sale by Anita O'Day Smooth and alluring: Love For Sale by Ella Fitzgerald Desparate and haunting: Love For Sale by Elvis Costello posted by Too-Ticky at 2:04 AM on October 16, 2017 Lots of Radiohead Creep covers out there. Here are 10 ranked according to someone or other. posted by UnoDosTresEsto at 2:30 AM on October 16, 2017 Best answer: Poignantly (as it was produced by edgeways who has since passed away) this is a lovely wistful version of You Spin Me Round by Dead or Alive. posted by billiebee at 2:41 AM on October 16, 2017 Mountain Goats cover of The Boys Are Back in Town. White Stripes cover of Jolene posted by easternblot at 3:14 AM on October 16, 2017 Adding to Stillmoving, there's this cover of Gin and Juice. You may want to review a bunch of Richard Cheese's oeveur - I always thought of it as the 'happy face being put on for the world by a depressed person', including their cover of \"Down with the Sickness\": Original by Disturbed Richard Cheese A close-to-the-original version with acoustic guitars that sounds very different posted by mephron at 3:27 AM on October 16, 2017 Wistful: \"Summer Breeze,\" Seals & Croft Off-kilter/sinister, \"Summer Breeze,\" Type O Negative posted by MonkeyToes at 4:22 AM on October 16, 2017 [1 favorite] Coffee by Sylvan Esso partially covers Hanky Panky by Tommy James in a melancholic tune. posted by buttonedup at 4:31 AM on October 16, 2017 Oh, and Johnny Cash's version of NIN's \"Hurt.\" posted by stillmoving at 4:38 AM on October 16, 2017 [3 favorites] Toxic, the original, by Britney Spears.

M Ward turns it into something haunting and melancholy. posted by ActionPopulated at 4:44 AM on October 16, 2017 There is only one great answer to this question. Brian Wilson & The Beach Boys \"God Only Knows\" is a song about eternal love, right? Not exactly. In the hands of Elvis Costello & The Brodsky Quartet, \"God Only Knows\" becomes a biting acidic treatise of \"I would have been better off without you,\" but like, wrapped in a melodious fluffy pillow. It's the sort of twist that will really fuck you up. posted by jbenben at 5:02 AM on October 16, 2017 Response by poster: Wobbuffet: Do you have particular thematic constraints for the lyrics? I'm pretty open, but I'm thinking mostly in the vein of \"could be a generic pop song\" lyrically. Like, Mad World isn't going to work because it's too on the nose and gives away the story too quickly, and Born in the USA has its own strong narrative. Girls Just Wanna Have Fun is a good suggestion because the lyrics can be quite relevant. But yeah, anything where the lyrics don't necessarily stand out unless you're paying attention to them/hear them in a different emotional context would be good! posted by divabat at 5:40 AM on October 16, 2017 Response by poster: _\"I kissed a girl\" has several different versions. jill sobule's is touching, poignant, and.. From the Clueless soundtrack. Huh. Katy Perry's is brash, reminds me of club girls, and absolutely not poignant. posted by Jacen_ They share a title but are two completely different songs! posted by divabat at 5:43 AM on October 16, 2017 [3 favorites] \"Dirge-like\" rendition of Fame by our own chococat, vs Irene Cara's from the movie. posted by jaruwaan at 6:37 AM on October 16, 2017 To add to Yankeefog's list (BTW that Kompressor was AWESOME), 200+ versions of These Boots Are Made For Walkin'. Many different moods. posted by JulesER at 6:46 AM on October 16, 2017 [2 favorites] What about Radiohead's \"Morning Bell\"? The versions on Kid A and Amnesiac are so different that I didn't even realize it was the same song for an embarrassingly long time. posted by saladin at 7:18 AM on October 16, 2017 [1 favorite] Sonic Youth covered Superstar by The Carpenters with a stalkery vibe. posted by soelo at 7:41 AM on October 16, 2017 [1 favorite] My fave might be Springsteen's re-visioning of Blinded by the Light.

When you’re sad, you understand the lyrics.” — Frank Ocean The emotional connection we form with music is an age-old bond. It is an intersection where melodies meet feelings and lyrics capture nuances. Frank Ocean, a modern-day philosopher clothed as a musician, has encapsulated this sentiment profoundly. As an expert in psychology and the ways it intersects with music, I find it essential to delve into the fascinating relationship between music and our emotional states, using Frank Ocean’s quote as the framework. Music as a Reflection of Emotional States Sound vs. Substance Consider the difference between tapping your feet to an upbeat tune when you’re happy and finding solace in the sorrowful lyrics of a song when you’re sad. There’s a fundamental reason behind this dichotomy. When you’re happy, your emotional and psychological needs are already met, largely through external stimuli. There’s no void to fill, and therefore, you’re less inclined to seek substance or meaning from a song. The melody and rhythm, in this case, act like the cherry on top of a well-prepared cake. They amplify your existing emotional state without requiring depth. On the other hand, sadness, almost by definition, implies a lack of something — whether it’s love, achievement, or peace. It turns us inward, driving us to fill an emotional or existential void. In this case, a bouncy tune just won’t cut it. This leads us to latch onto the deeper elements in music, the lyrics, which offer more than mere distraction — they offer understanding, and importantly, validation. The Lyrics as Emotional Outlets Sadness propels us into a journey inward. This journey is not one that everyone around us may understand or even acknowledge, and hence, finding an emotional outlet becomes imperative for mental well-being. Lyrics often provide this outlet. It’s not so much about listening to sad music to make you sadder; it’s about finding the right set of lyrics that put your complex emotions into words. This articulation, achieved vicariously through music, acts as an emotional release valve, helping to alleviate your sadness. It is catharsis, a psychological concept indicating a release of emotional tension, in action. The Universal Solace of Music Feeling Less Alone There’s an implicit social element to music, even when you’re listening alone in your room. It could be the artist from decades ago or someone from another part of the world entirely, but if the lyrics resonate with you, there’s a feeling of connectedness that transcends time and space. This ability of music to make one feel ‘understood’ is not only emotionally relieving but also psychologically beneficial. Numerous studies have shown that perceived social support — feeling like you’re not alone — can significantly impact mental health outcomes. Emotional Validation Lyrics often validate our emotions, providing the emotional sustenance we crave, especially when we’re down. Sometimes, knowing that another person has felt what you’re feeling and found the words to express it can be infinitely comforting. It’s the emotional version of the saying, “If they can do it, so can I.” Emotional validation is a powerful tool for resilience. Validated emotions are easier to process and manage, giving us a better shot at working through our difficulties constructively. The Healing Frequency of Music Therapeutic Processing The relationship between music and emotional well-being isn’t merely anecdotal. It is supported by numerous scientific studies. Music therapy has been shown to be effective in clinical settings, especially for emotional release. Emotion Regulation Music doesn’t just let us express our emotions; it allows us to manage them in a structured way. While some critics argue that aggressive or ‘angry’ music can encourage maladaptive coping the overall impact of music seems more constructive. Music aligned to our emotional state has been shown to improve mood and reduce anxiety. Quick Tips for Emotional Music Listening Mindful Selection While many of us have playlists for every mood, intentional listening can enhance the emotional benefits of music. Choose songs that resonate with your current emotional state, not just your favorite hits. Active Listening Don’t just hear; listen. Engage with the lyrics. Pause and ponder over phrases that strike a chord. Active listening can be a potent form of emotional release. Reflect and Write After listening, jot down thoughts or lines that stood out. Express why they resonated. Writing combines well with emotional music listening to offer a fuller, richer emotional experience. Frank Ocean’s statement uncovers a deeply ingrained psychological interplay between our emotional state and our engagement with music. The next time you feel your mood shifting, remember that the perfect tune might not just lift your spirits or offer solace — it may well serve as your emotional guide, offering wisdom in ways words alone can’t.
