Sales vs. Marketing: Understanding the Key Differences Table of Contents Sales and Marketing are like two seemingly inseparable twins – forever entwined in the world of business, similar, yet with their own distinct personalities. While they are just like two peas in a pod, working harmoniously towards a common goal – generating revenue, their approaches are as different as chalk and cheese. Understanding these differences is important not only for the effective operation of a company but also for unlocking its full potential. It’s as if you had a bike instead of a business. There are two wheels of the same size but different functions, and it is better to leave them like that. If they are treated as the same thing, or one is ignored, the bicycle loses its balance, making it difficult to ride smoothly and efficiently. Of course, there are statistics to back it up. In 2020 LinkedIn conducted a study and found that a whopping 87% of Sales and Marketing experts believe that teamwork between their departments helps businesses grow. Not only that, but 85% of them also think that getting Sales and Marketing on the same page is the golden ticket to boosting their overall business performance. Sales vs. Marketing By definition, the sales process is about selling products or services, and there is no money without it. Sometimes, “sales” can also refer to the money made or the quantity of items sold. It’s a crucial part of any company’s success, in both action and measurement, but we will be talking about the former. Marketing, on the other hand, is all about getting the word out about your products or services. It includes things like doing research to understand what customers want and using this information to grab people’s attention. So, it’s the fun, creative side of the business that helps people learn about and fall in love with what you’re selling. Purpose of Sales and Marketing In a big short: sales is all about closing the deal. It turns prospects into paying customers using numerous interpersonal techniques. A good salesperson is the one who can sweet-talk their way into getting a free dessert at a restaurant. They are the faces of the company who make sure that the right product or service finds a loving home in the arms of customers. Marketing, on the other hand, is the BFF of sales. It’s the wingman that sets the stage for sales to do its thing. The brand awareness lures potential customers into the sales funnel by creating interest, trust, and a bit of pizzazz. From catchy slogans to eye-popping visuals, marketing makes sure people know about your product and why they need it in their lives. The Difference Between Sales and Marketing Focus In the discussion on sales vs. marketing, their focus is the first element worth considering. The sales team’s main concern is the people. They’re the social butterflies of the business world, always eager to chat with potential customers, get to know them, and figure out what they need. They piece together clues to find the perfect solution for each individual prospect. They are passionate about building relationships as well as creating positive experiences that turn potential buyers into happy customers. They’re the ones who dream up and execute everything from attention-grabbing ads to engaging social media posts that capture the hearts and minds of potential customers. Beyond that, they’re constantly analyzing market trends and consumer behavior to ensure that their strategies remain relevant and effective. It is all about creating a buzz and generating leads, setting the stage for the sales team. Delivery: Storytelling vs. Asking Questions A good salesperson has to be like a curious child, specifically when it comes to asking questions (a lot of them). Asking by itself is not enough, though, people from the sales department listen carefully, offer helpful advice, and work hard to find the perfect solution for each person. Their inquisitive nature helps them dig much deeper than any market analysis would ever allow. Marketing is all about spinning a good yarn, it’s more general as it has to apply to a larger group of people. And what do people like? – a good story. Marketers are the storytellers of the business world, creating emotional and engaging connections between the brand and its audience. They paint vivid pictures of how amazing life could be with their products or services, making potential customers feel like they’re witnessing a thrilling narrative part that they can purchase. Tactics Sales is all about getting up close and personal with prospects and customers. It’s about being a friend who’s always there to lend an ear and help you find what you need. Whether it’s a phone call, face-to-face meeting, or video conference, they’re great at answering questions, addressing concerns, as well as offering special deals to make sure people feel confident in their purchase and that they get the right product. In a party full of people, marketing is its life, using all sorts of creative tactics to be noticed and remembered. Marketers not just talking to one person; they want to spread the word far and wide, no matter if people need what they have to offer. They use a mix of traditional and digital channels to connect with as many people as possible, spark their interest, and turn them into fans of your brand. From eye-catching billboards to viral videos, marketing teams consistently innovate to ensure your brand stays top of mind. Skill Sets What’s worth considering is that a good marketing person won’t necessarily make a good salesperson. The latter requires a combination of a soul-of-the-party logician and a therapist – someone who can listen while identifying and understanding customer needs and preferences as well as various patterns. Add to that a good dose of resilience and persistence (because, let’s face it, rejection is part and parcel of the sales world) and a keen sense of timing followed by the ability to close deals, and you get yourself a successful salesperson. Marketing needs an artist with a hint of a mathematician in them – a creative thinker and storyteller, weaving engaging narratives that draw people in and don’t let go, but also data-driven and analytical at the same time. They have to be able to interpret metrics and make informed decisions to optimize campaigns while looking at the bigger picture and developing long-term plans to boost brand visibility and reach. Metrics Sales just love numbers – specifically, the money numbers. When it comes to measuring success, sales teams look at revenue, which means how much cash they’ve brought in from all those deals they’ve closed. They also track key performance indicators (KPIs) like conversion rates and average deal sizes. Although it sounds complicated, it’s rather straightforward: more sales equals more success (and commission). With marketing, the measurement game is a bit more complex. They can look at a bunch of different factors, like how many people are visiting their website, how many new leads they’re bringing in, and how engaged people are with their content. They also track metrics like brand awareness and customer sentiment. Regardless of different factors that may be taken into account, it’s sometimes hard to say if the campaign is even working. For marketing, it’s not just about the money; it’s about how well they’re connecting with their audience and whether they’re making a positive impact on the brand, and that’s something that’s extremely hard to put a tag on. Timeframe The sale process is quick, like a sprint. Wins are short-term and immediate. All in all, it doesn’t take long to close a deal and get the customer on board, or at least it shouldn’t – targets and deadlines are always pushing to hit the right numbers and make sales happen right now. Sales reps often juggle multiple prospects at once, ensuring that they maintain momentum and keep their schedules full. Marketing isn’t like that, it is more like a marathon, focused on the long game. Marketers are all about building a strong brand and forging lasting relationships with customers. It takes time to create a loyal fan base, and the efforts might not pay off immediately. It’s for this reason that it is often neglected, but the patience it requires is undoubtedly worth it. The investment is in marketing strategies that will grow the brand over time and keep customers coming back for more. Marketing teams are constantly fine-tuning their approach, adjusting campaigns, and analyzing results to ensure they’re on track to achieve long-term success. Patience and perseverance are key for marketing professionals as they work to create a solid foundation for the brand’s future growth. Similarities Between Sales and Marketing Shared Goal The most obvious thing that comes to mind when we talk about similarities is that sales goals and marketing ones are pretty much the same. Ultimately, it’s about growing the business. They might have different methods and focuses, but it’s all about making the company more successful. Customer-Centric Approach At the heart of both sales and marketing strategy is the customer. Both of them need to understand their customers and be able to tell what are their needs, preferences, pain points, and what floats their boat in general. All of that is crucial to tailor the messaging and strategies accordingly. Adaptability and flexibility The business world is like a roller coaster, full of twists, turns, and unexpected surprises. To stay ahead, both teams need to be as flexible as a yoga master. They must respond quickly to market changes, customer feedback, and new opportunities, always ready to refine their strategies and tactics to remain competitive and drive growth. Both of these worlds are those of constant development and keeping up to date. Slowing down for a while can mean losing ground to competitors and missing out on potential sales or leads. Collaboration and communication To achieve the best results, sales and marketing teams need to communicate effectively and collaborate closely. Sharing information and working together can create a seamless customer journey that changes random passersby into loyal customers. This teamwork involves sharing customer insights, aligning messaging, and coordinating strategies. The more these two departments can work together, the more successful their efforts will be. Conclusion Sales and marketing might seem like two sides of the same business coin, but they have their own unique ways of making things happen. While sales are all about connecting with people and sealing the deal, marketing is the mastermind behind creating interest and building the brand. Each team has its own focus, techniques, and skill sets, but they share the common goal of driving business growth. Thus, in the end, sales vs. marketing is just about pointing out the small differences that make each other special, but which together are a super-power for every business. It’s important to remember that a company’s success doesn’t come down to choosing one over the other. Instead, it’s about embracing their differences and ensuring they work together like a well-oiled machine. Understanding how each team operates, communicating effectively, and collaborating on strategies can create a customer experience that keeps people coming back for more. So, at the end of the day, it’s not about picking a winner in the sales vs. marketing debate. It’s about recognizing the value both bring to the table and harnessing their unique strengths to create a powerful, unstoppable force that drives your business forward.

As the sector continues to grow, one thing has become abundantly clear: in order to successfully sell anything online, you need to sell it on more than one sales channel. While that sounds simple and straightforward in theory, it becomes increasingly more apparent how challenging cross listing can be the deeper your dive into the practical details. How do you avoid selling the same unit twice? How can you ensure that each product listing is perfectly compliant and optimized for every selling channel? How do you decide which items to cross-list and which to list only on certain channels? These challenges only multiply with each item you add to your selection and every sales channel you include in your selling repertoire, making it practically impossible to sell on multiple channels without the help of a good crosslisting app. But choosing the best cross listing app for your selling needs can be challenging, especially when there are just so many crosslisting apps on the market touting themselves as the best app for crosslisting to certain channels or the best crosslisting app for resellers. The truth is that finding the best crosslisting app for your business will depend heavily on your specific crosslisting needs, both now and in the future. In this guide, we'll teach you how to find the best crosslisting app for your unique ecommerce business by helping you understand what to look for in a cross listing app. Keep reading to learn what ecommerce cross listing is, what its benefits are, and how to determine which crosslisting app is the best choice for your selling needs. ‍ What is eCommerce Cross Listing? In ecommerce, the term \"cross listing\" or \"crosslisting\" refers to listing an item on more than one selling channel. The idea behind crosslisting is simple: reach more buyers on more platforms, and raise your chances of a successful sale. Crosslisting is used by virtually all successful ecommerce sellers, no matter on which sales channels they started their online selling journey or what they're selling. The reason for this is that crosslisting works – it's the single simplest way to instantly multiply your pool of potential buyers, raise your brand awareness, and drive sales. ‍ What are the Benefits of Cross Listing? Crosslisting is an incredibly powerful approach to online commerce, with a multitude of benefits that range from better reach to a more robust and resilient ecommerce business. The main benefits of crosslisting include: Increased Visibility and Reach: Crosslisting to new channels allows you to instantly increase the visibility of your listings by getting them in front of new buyers who would never have seen them on their original sales channel. Saved Time and Effort: When done with a crosslisting app, the experience of multichannel selling is closer to running one large store rather than a selection of smaller ones in terms of product data and listing management. That's because crosslisting a product to a new channel is far faster and easier than creating a new product listing from scratch, making for a more efficient listing experience. Diversified Sales Channels: Crosslisting gives you the ability to diversify your sales channels and make your ecommerce business more robust in the face of challenges like account suspensions. If one of your marketplace stores is suspended for review, for example, you don't have to worry about losing your sole revenue stream. ‍ Essential Features to Look for in a Cross-Listing App While the concept of crosslisting is simple, its application is far from, which is why getting the implementation right is essential to successful multichannel cross selling. In other words, choosing the best crosslisting app for your needs will be a defining factor for how successful your crosslisting endeavors will be. To help you get it right, we'll go over the five essential features to look for when choosing a crosslisting app for your ecommerce business, and explain the significance of each one in day-to-day multichannel selling. Multi-Channel Integrations Not all crosslisting apps are created equal, and that is most evident by the number of channel integrations each one offers. As a general rule, better crosslisting apps will offer a wider selection of multichannel integrations. That said, quantity does not equal quality, and it's important to go over the actual sales channel integrations offered to see if they're relevant to your selling needs. If you sell car parts, for example, an Etsy integration will be of no use to you, but an eBay integration will be non-negotiable. Furthermore, it's wise to choose a crosslisting app that constantly has new integrations in the works, so you don't find yourself lacking integration for a key sales channel a few years down the line. Inventory Management A key component of successful multichannel selling is the ability to manage inventory across channels. If you update an item's attributes on your primary sales channel, you'll want your crosslisting app to update that item's corresponding listings on all your other sales channels too. Likewise, if you make changes to an item's quantity or delist it, your crosslisting app needs to reflect those changes in every channel where that item is crosslisted. Automated Syncing and Listing One of the biggest challenges of multichannel selling is ensuring that all your sales channels are on the same page in terms of listing and item synchronization. As such, the ability to automatically sync products and listings across channels is an essential part of any crosslisting app. In practice, this means that if a unit sells on one channel, your crosslisting app needs to be able to update all your other sales channels and delist it, so you don't end up selling an item you no longer have in stock. Furthermore, any changes you make to inventory, such as adding new products or adjusting stock levels, must be updated on all your selling channels. Listing Optimization Another major challenge of selling on multiple channels is ensuring that each listing is optimized for every sales channel it's crosslisted to. This means not only ensuring platform-specific compliance, but also sales-channel-specific search engine optimization, image optimization, and more. If your crosslisting app doesn't give you the tools you need to tweak and optimize product listings for each sales channel, it's not going to give you the results you need – that is, sales – when you use it to cross list products to new channels. In other words, a crosslisting app should offer you more than just copy-and-paste for your listings; it needs to have customizable and automatable optimizations that can be applied to your products when they're crosslisted to new channels. Order Management Multichannel selling means multichannel orders, and those can quickly get overwhelming without a good way to view and manage them, so a good crosslisting app should enable you to do just that. Make sure that the crosslisting app you choose doesn't just allow you to cross list products to new channels, but also gives you a way to manage the resulting multichannel orders in a single integrated interface, so you won't have to log into each channel multiple times a day to check if a new order has come in. ‍ Top 9 Cross Listing Apps for eCommerce Sellers Now that we gone over crosslisting is and understood the essential features of a good cross listing app, we'll use these criteria to take a look at 9 of the leading cross listing apps for online sellers. We'll go over the key features of each one, understand what kind of ecommerce seller they'd be most suitable for, take a look at their pricing structure, and review some of the main pros and cons of each one. ‍ 1.

Pros: ExportYourStore ExportYourStore is a unique crosslisting and multichannel selling tool that allows sellers to set up new sales channels by linking them to their main ecommerce store. This means sellers can continue managing their ecommerce business in the way they're used to, from their current ecommerce store, while still reaping the benefits of multichannel selling. ExportYourStore's unique approach to cross-listing and multichannel selling means that sellers no longer need to commit to learning exactly how to create and publish a listing on every new channel and platform they wish to sell on just to get started, making it a great choice for sellers who want to start selling on new channels but don't have the time to study each one in depth beforehand. ExportYourStore enables sellers to export their listings to a wide variety of online marketplaces, shopping cart platforms, and social media channels, including eBay, Amazon, Walmart, Shopify, WooCommerce, Mercari, Depop, Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram. It allows for seamless multichannel integration, and provides a way for sellers to expand their reach by crosslisting products with channel-specific optimizations for titles, descriptions, images, and even pricing. ExportYourStore also simplifies the process of multichannel selling with features like automatic cross-channel inventory synchronization, auto delisting, custom and automatable listing optimizations, bulk actions, an integrated multichannel order management interface, and even fully automatable Amazon MCF using FBA inventory for all selling channels. ‍ 2. Sellbrite Sellbrite is a multichannel selling app designed to help online retailers manage and sell their products across multiple sales channels, including eBay, Amazon, Walmart, and Shopify. Sellbrite works via a centralized dashboard that requires users to upload their products in order to list and manage inventory and orders on multiple marketplaces. Sellbrite separates its plans into plans for Shopify sellers and all other sellers. Sellers who wish to use FBA, whether for Amazon fulfillment or for multichannel fulfillment, will need to purchase additional expansions on top of Sellbrite's standard subscription packages. Key Features: Sellbrite Best for: Sellbrite is a good choice for sellers who have predictable and relatively limited order volumes, since each subscription tier places a limit on how many monthly orders you can have across channels. It's also a good choice for sellers who only want to expand their business to marketplaces and shopping carts. Pricing: Sellbrite's first paid subscription tier starts at $29 per month, and allows for up to 100 monthly orders. FBA integration costs an additional $19 per month. For sellers who sell on Shopify or Shopify Plus and need Shopify integration, the first paid subscription tier costs $19 per month. Pros: Sellbrite Along with multichannel listing capabilities, Sellbrite's features include bulk listing tools, inventory synchronization, order management, and reporting capabilities. Furthermore, Sellbrite has integrations for some third-party tools, including research tools like Algopix and fulfillment tools like Flexport. Sellbrite also offers a free plan for very small sellers, whose multichannel sales do not exceed 30 order per month, although this plan cannot support FBA integration. Cons: Sellbrite Sellbrite's subscription tiers are relatively convoluted, and it can be difficult for sellers to understand what subscription will work for their selling needs. Furthermore, Sellbrite effectively caps your earnings by limiting the number of orders you can have based on your subscription tier. On top of that, FBA integration, a backbone of many successful multichannel ecommerce operations, carries an additional cost every month. Sellbrite's channel integrations are also relatively limited, with only a handful of marketplaces available, and no integrations available at all for lucrative social commerce channels like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. ‍ 3. Rithum Rithum is a business management and automation tool designed to help ecommerce sellers consolidate their multichannel operations, manage inventory, and optimize their listings across various sales channels. It offers features such as bulk product uploading, inventory synchronization, order management, and reporting. Rithum supports integration with an unbeatably wide array of ecommerce platforms from all over the world, enabling enterprise-level businesses to manage, scale, and expand their operations more efficiently. Key Features: Rithum Best for: Rithum is best suited for sellers who have very large sales volumes, who require an extensive selection of third-party integrations, and who wish to expand to many multinational sales channels. It's aimed at enterprise-level sellers, with its pricing and toolset reflecting the needs of its target audience. ‍Pricing: Unlike ExportYourStore and Sellbrite above, Rithum does not have tiered subscription plans. Instead, Rithum's pricing works on a commission-based model, in which Rithum agrees on a price with each individual seller. Pricing is subject to change over time as the agreement with Rithum is renewed. Pros: Rithum Rithum is not just a cross-listing app; it's a massive and multifaceted ecommerce tool that offers solutions for a variety of ecommerce needs. It offers practically every ecommerce solution under the sun, and aims to fulfill every one of its clients' ecommerce needs, in the present and in the future. Cons: Rithum While Rithum can be used by small and midsize sellers, it's aimed primarily at enterprise level commerce, so its features – and pricing – reflect that. The latter is not transparent, and is tailored to each client with a unique contract. Rithum also has a huge ecosystem of ecommerce tools, so even if you only use some of them, it's very difficult to understand what tools you actually need for your current and projected selling needs, especially if you're just starting out with multichannel selling. ‍ 4. Listing Mirror Listing Mirror is a multichannel ecommerce listing and inventory management tool designed to help online sellers manage their product listings across multiple marketplaces, such as eBay, Amazon, Walmart, and Shopify, from a single platform. It offers features like bulk listing creation, inventory synchronization, and order management. The platform is aimed at simplifying the process of selling on multiple marketplaces, allowing businesses to expand their reach by crosslisting to new sales channels. Key Features: Listing Mirror Best for: Since a significant part of Listing Mirror's functionalities are additional paid addons, it's best suited for sellers who need very basic functionality from their crosslisting app, or those who don't mind paying a monthly fee for features such as Amazon MCF (FBA) integration. Pricing: Listing Mirror's pricing is tailored to each customer and works on a volume basis. Its base plan, List & Launch, is priced based on how many SKUs you manage with the app. Its first addon, Inventory Connect, which manages and syncs multichannel inventory, is priced based on the number of orders imported into the app. The second optional addon, Smart Stock, which creates stock forecasts and auto-generates supplier purchase orders, is priced per client on an onboarding call. Pros: Listing Mirror Listing Mirror is primarily geared towards Amazon sellers who want to take their ecommerce business beyond Amazon, and with the addition of paid addons, it can be a great tool for that type of seller. Its inventory forecasting, available via the Smart Stock addon subscription package, can be a great tool for sellers who need help managing their inventory and don't currently outsource their logistics to Amazon FBA, since much of this addon's functionality is available within Amazon. Cons: Listing Mirror Listing Mirror can be a handy tool for certain Amazon sellers looking to expand to new sales channels, but its obscure pricing and the fact that it requires three different complementary plans in order to achieve full crosslisting functionality are more trouble than they're worth for many sellers. Furthermore, since pricing is directly tied to order volume, high-volume sellers or those who wish to expand to a significant number of sales channels find that, due to its cost, it simply doesn't make sense for them as a crosslisting solution. ‍ 5. Vendoo Vendoo is a multichannel listing and inventory management software aimed primarily at secondhand fashion sellers. It's designed to help these sellers cross-list their products to various online marketplaces, including eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, Depop, and others. Vendoo's features include bulk listing creation, inventory tracking, and automatic cross-posting. Vendoo also offers tools for order management, sales tracking, and analytics to help sellers grow their businesses and maintain accurate stock levels across platforms. Key Features: Vendoo Best for: Vendoo is the first crosslisting app on our list that's aimed specifically at resellers who sell secondhand goods. Its integrations include slightly more niche secondhand luxury fashion marketplaces like Vestiaire Collective and Grailed, making it ideal for sellers who wish to list on these marketplaces. Pricing: Of all the apps listed here, Vendoo's pricing is by far the most complex. Its most basic plan starts at $199 per year. This plan allows you to list up to 25 products every month, and remove the background from a product image up to 25 times each month. To get actual crosslisting functionality, however, you'll need to purchase a monthly subscription of the \"Importing\" addon, which costs $4.99 per month. If you want to take advantage of that crosslisting functionality on more than 3 marketplaces (i.e. crosslist to and integrate with more than three sales channels) you'll need to purchase the \"All Marketplaces\" subscription package, priced at $4.99 per month. Finally, in order to bulk actions, you'll need to purchase the \"Bulk Delist & Relist\" package, which costs an additional $4.99 per month. These three subscription packs can also be purchased together at a discounted rate of $11.99 per month. Pros: Vendoo As an app aimed at secondhand fashion resellers, Vendoo's strengths lie in tools for fashion reselling on niche marketplaces. For starters, Vendoo makes its bulk offers feature available in every plan, which helps sellers send out offers to interested shoppers more easily. Furthermore, Vendoo has a mobile app, making it easy to check in on your secondhand item listings on the go. Cons: Vendoo Once you manage to make sense of its convoluted pricing, it becomes abundantly clear that Vendoo is pretty expensive, especially for the target seller audience it aims to attract. To get actual crosslisting done with Vendoo, you'll need to purchase a monthly subscription addon to your plan; to get integration for more than 3 sales channels, you'll need to purchase another subscription; and to enjoy basic bulk actions, you'll have to purchase yet another one. Vendoo is also extremely lacking in the realm of multichannel integration. Its inventory sync available for just five of its 11 possible sales channel integrations, putting you at risk of overselling, which has the potential to significantly harm your selling accounts due to seller-initiated cancellations and the inevitable negative feedback that will result. ‍ 6. OneShop OneShop is a platform for creating listings and them on secondhand-oriented ecommerce marketplaces. It has integrations for eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, and Depop. It offers a way to create listings and publish them to these marketplaces, and includes automatic delisting for products that have been sold. Its main selling point is its automatable relisting feature, which automatically takes down and relists items to make them appear new on marketplaces, which can help with listing visibility in some cases. It also has automations for listing promotion features, like sending offers, listing bumping, and sharing listings. Key Features: OneShop Best for: As is evident by its features and marketplace integrations, OneShop is a solution aimed at secondhand sellers, primarily those who sell secondhand fashion. As such, OneShop is best for sellers who exclusively sell secondhand fashion, and who only need to integrate with eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, and Depop. Pricing: OneShop's pricing is simple and straightforward: $45 per month, no matter how much – or how little – you list and sell. Pros: OneShop As an app focused on secondhand selling, its main strengths lie in features for secondhand sellers. For starters, OneShop offers a mobile app for both iPhone and Android phones, making it easy for sellers to manage things on the go. Additionally, aside from offering a listing and order management platform, OneShop's app also has a built-in forum that connects all of its sellers, where they can communicate with each other to ask for tips, advice, and help. Finally, OneShop can automatically delist and relist items, allowing sellers to automatically refresh stale listings. Cons: OneShop OneShop is a platform aimed at secondhand resellers, which makes the lack of Etsy integration all the more problematic. Etsy is a major marketplace with a thriving vintage community, and sellers who use OneShop simply won't be able to list on Etsy. Furthermore, OneShop doesn't actually have any crosslisting functionality – you will need to create listings in OneShop in order to list to your integrated channels, and won't have the option of cross listing from one sales channel to another. For the limited integrations it offers, OneShop is also one of the more expensive options on our list. With a flat subscription rate of $45 per month, OneShop's pricing simply doesn't make sense for a large chunk of ecommerce sellers, especially those who sell primarily secondhand fashion. Finally, relisting and delisting is a risky SEO approach, which can very easily backfire. Allowing an app to manage this entirely automatically without very extensive customization is dangerous, and can even result in the suspension of your selling accounts if something goes wrong. ‍ 7. List Perfectly List Perfectly is a cross-listing tool that helps online sellers manage their product listings across select shopping carts and primary secondhand-focused marketplaces. Its sales channel integrations include eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, Etsy, and Shopify, among others. It allows users to import and post listings in bulk, cross-post to various platforms, and delist items once sold. It is intended for resellers who want to sell on multiple channels and manage listings in a more consolidated manner. Key Features: List Perfectly Best for: Like our previous app, List Perfectly is designed primarily for secondhand resellers, and its integrations reflect that. It offers a single shopping cart integration – Shopify – and multiple marketplace integrations for used- and secondhand-oriented selling: eBay, Grailed, Mercari, Vestiaire, Poshmark, Facebook Marketplace, Etsy, the now-defunct Kidizen, and their own closed seller community/potential sales channel called Listing Party. Pricing: List Perfectly offers plans starting at $29 per month, although this tier doesn't offer crossposting to several key sales channels, like Instagram and Shopify. Each subscription tier offers more functionalities and unlocks more product attributes you can include in your product listings. This means that, in order to reach the most basic functionality and attributes you need as a secondhand seller (i.e. include item condition in your listing, crosslist to major sales channels, and bulk actions), you'll need to purchase the Pro subscription, which costs $69 per month. Pros: List Perfectly List Perfectly has a unique seller community and closed marketplace known as Listing Party. It borrows elements from many secondhand selling marketplaces to create a seller community, with live events hosted by and for sellers, and a 24-hour seller chat. Cons: List Perfectly List Perfectly is a niche crosslisting app aimed at resellers, which makes the limited product attribute support on the basic tiers all the more problematic. Resellers simply can't list secondhand or vintage items without a product attribute for their condition. Furthermore, making bulk actions unavailable except on more expensive tiers makes it practically impossible to list on multiple marketplaces. List Perfectly limits many functions, making it far more expensive in practice than it initially seems. ‍ 8. Crosslisting Crosslisting is a tool designed to help online sellers crosslist and manage their product listings on ecommerce platforms such as eBay, Poshmark, and Mercari. Crosslisting offers features like inventory synchronization and bulk listing management, and is aimed primarily at resellers who want to crosslist on secondhand-oriented sales channels. Key Features: Crosslisting Best for: Crosslisting is a cross-listing app aimed specifically at resellers, and that's who it would work best for. Its integrations cover secondhand selling marketplaces, and its plans are tiered in such a way that resellers of all levels can find a plan that works for them. Pricing: Crosslisting works on a monthly subscription model, and offers many pricing tiers. Its first tier, Lite, costs $9.99 per month, and allows for up to 50 cross posts. Realistically, since a cross post is effectively a listing on a given sales channel, most sellers will need to use the Standard tier, which costs $29.99 per month and allows for up to 150 cross posts. Pros: Crosslisting One of the main features of Crosslisting is that it allows sellers to relist products to boost their visibility. This feature is great for resellers in particular, since it's most effective on reselling sites like Depop and Mercari. Another handy feature that Crosslisting has is a mobile app, which makes it easy to manage listings on the go. Cons: Crosslisting Although Crosslisting aims to provide a solution for resellers, even in this realm its integrations are limited. It only has integration for six marketplaces: Poshmark, Depop, eBay, Grailed, Vinted and Mercari, not counting the integration for the now-defunct Kidizen, which is still listed on its site. Etsy, a major marketplace for vintage items, is missing, as is Facebook Marketplace and ThreadUp, to name a few. Additionally, one of its main selling points, relisting, is not included in any of its crosslisting subscription tiers. Instead, it must be purchased monthly as an addon in packages of 10, 15, or 20 relists. Finally, true crosslisting functionality – that is, cross listing from one marketplace to another – is hindered by the 20-listing limit on bulk listing imports across all plans. This, makes Crosslisting a less than ideal choice for sellers who actually want an app to crosslist their existing listings to new marketplaces. ‍ 9. PrimeLister PrimeLister is an app for managing and listing products across secondhand selling marketplaces, including eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, and Etsy, as well as on Shopify, which is a shopping cart platform for creating standalone webstores. It provides features for bulk listing, inventory management, and automatic delisting for cross-platform inventory synchronization. PrimeLister aims to help sellers save time by centralizing the process of listing and managing inventory on multiple sales channels. Key Features: PrimeLister Best for: While PrimeLister bills itself as a crosslisting app, its crosslisting functionality is limited, and its multichannel integration functionality is sub-par. As such, it's best for resellers who only need to relist items (i.e. take down listings in order to republish them) on marketplaces like Mercari or Depop every once in a while to keep them fresh. Pricing: PrimeLister offers two subscription plans: Basic and Pro. The former costs $29.99 per month, but offers no crosslisting functionality at all. The latter costs $49.99 per month and includes crosslisting functionality, as well as inventory management and \"tags & groups,\" a backend organization feature. Pros: PrimeLister PrimeLister offers a steep 30% discount for subscribers who are willing to commit for a year, which is more than the commonly offered discount of 15-20%. Cons: PrimeLister PrimeLister has many drawbacks – a lack of integrations, a pricey subscription, and limited features – but its biggest drawback is its complete lack of automatic delisting. As of writing, this feature is not available on either one of the plans, which means that even if you shell out almost $50 per month just to get basic crosslisting functionality, you will still very likely find yourself with orders cancelled due to overselling items you no longer have. ‍ How to Choose the Right Cross Listing App for Your Online Store Now that we've gone over nine popular crosslisting apps, you might be feeling a little overwhelmed. There are so many features and functionalities beyond simply cross-listing from one sales channel to another, that it's not always easy to decipher what makes a good crosslisting app and what just sounds useful in theory. In this section, we'll go over how you can analyze the crosslisting apps available on the market and see how well they meet your needs, so you can choose the best crosslisting app for your ecommerce business and expand to new sales channels easily. Identify Your Needs and Goals While it may sound obvious, it's not always the first thing that goes through a seller's mind when selecting a crosslisting app. But just like not all crosslisting apps are created equal, not all crosslisting apps are designed for the same type of ecommerce seller. Some are best for resellers, while others appeal to a broader range of sellers with a wide array of sales channel integrations; some have built-in crosslisting functionality, while others offer it only as an extra addon feature. With so many options, it's important to take a moment to assess exactly what it is you need from a cross-listing app before beginning your search. Do you sell primarily mid-range secondhand fashion, or is luxury vintage fashion something you need to be able to sell too? Do you not sell secondhand goods at all, and only need integration for handmade-oriented marketplaces like Etsy and Amazon Handmade? How many products will you realistically want to cross-list, today and as your business grows? Do you hold inventory, or are you a dropshipper? These are just some of the questions you need to ask yourself before you start looking for an app, so you know right off the bat which ones are irrelevant to your needs. If you don't plan on selling secondhand fashion, several of the crosslisting apps on our list are already crossed out! Consider Your Budget Just like any business expense, the cost of your cross listing app of choice is a major consideration that cannot be overlooked. Ideally, your crosslisting app should offer a selection of plans that can grow with your business, ones that make sense for your bottom line at every step of the way. Some apps do this better than others, but the most important thing is to be honest with yourself about how much you can justifiably spend on a crosslisting app with the funds you have available to you now, not what you could potentially make in the future. Read Reviews and Ask for Recommendations Analyzing an app's features on paper is all well and good, but nothing beats the experience of sellers like you. It's only when you start working with a crosslisting app do you truly understand how it helps – or even harms – your ecommerce business. Does it delist items to prevent overselling in time? Does it integrate your inventory across all your selling channels? Can you optimize your cross-listed products for each marketplace and platform? All these are just a handful of things are truly important to multichannel sellers, and they'll be sure to come up in reviews if one of them is lacking. ‍ Final Thoughts: The Importance of Cross Listing for eCommerce Sellers Cross listing is the single best thing ecommerce sellers to can do to increase their reach and maximize their earning potential. Listing to new sales channels not only multiplies your pool of potential buyers instantly, it also establishes your credibility through better visibility across platforms. Just like anything worth doing, crosslisting must be done right to reap its benefits; done wrong, the damage to your business can be irreparable. With every new sales channel you cross list to, you'll have the responsibility of not only integrating your inventory responsibly and delisting items when they're sold, but also optimizing for both compliance and visibility. It's never enough to just copy and paste your listings from one channel to another, and it all boils down to choosing the best crosslisting app for your ecommerce business' unique selling needs. Make sure to choose the app that works for your selling needs, and make the most of the features it offers to not only list on more channels, but to successfully sell on them, too.

As the sector continues to grow, one thing has become abundantly clear: in order to successfully sell anything online, you need to sell it on more than one sales channel. While that sounds simple and straightforward in theory, it becomes increasingly more apparent how challenging cross listing can be the deeper your dive into the practical details. How do you avoid selling the same unit twice? How can you ensure that each product listing is perfectly compliant and optimized for every selling channel? How do you decide which items to cross-list and which to list only on certain channels? These challenges only multiply with each item you add to your selection and every sales channel you include in your selling repertoire, making it practically impossible to sell on multiple channels without the help of a good crosslisting app. But choosing the best cross listing app for your selling needs can be challenging, especially when there are just so many crosslisting apps on the market touting themselves as the best app for crosslisting to certain channels or the best crosslisting app for resellers. The truth is that finding the best crosslisting app for your business will depend heavily on your specific crosslisting needs, both now and in the future. In this guide, we'll teach you how to find the best crosslisting app for your unique ecommerce business by helping you understand what to look for in a cross listing app. Keep reading to learn what ecommerce cross listing is, what its benefits are, and how to determine which crosslisting app is the best choice for your selling needs. ‍ What is eCommerce Cross Listing? In ecommerce, the term \"cross listing\" or \"crosslisting\" refers to listing an item on more than one selling channel. The idea behind crosslisting is simple: reach more buyers on more platforms, and raise your chances of a successful sale. Crosslisting is used by virtually all successful ecommerce sellers, no matter on which sales channels they started their online selling journey or what they're selling. The reason for this is that crosslisting works – it's the single simplest way to instantly multiply your pool of potential buyers, raise your brand awareness, and drive sales. ‍ What are the Benefits of Cross Listing? Crosslisting is an incredibly powerful approach to online commerce, with a multitude of benefits that range from better reach to a more robust and resilient ecommerce business. The main benefits of crosslisting include: Increased Visibility and Reach: Crosslisting to new channels allows you to instantly increase the visibility of your listings by getting them in front of new buyers who would never have seen them on their original sales channel. Saved Time and Effort: When done with a crosslisting app, the experience of multichannel selling is closer to running one large store rather than a selection of smaller ones in terms of product data and listing management. That's because crosslisting a product to a new channel is far faster and easier than creating a new product listing from scratch, making for a more efficient listing experience. Diversified Sales Channels: Crosslisting gives you the ability to diversify your sales channels and make your ecommerce business more robust in the face of challenges like account suspensions. If one of your marketplace stores is suspended for review, for example, you don't have to worry about losing your sole revenue stream. ‍ Essential Features to Look for in a Cross-Listing App While the concept of crosslisting is simple, its application is far from, which is why getting the implementation right is essential to successful multichannel cross selling. In other words, choosing the best crosslisting app for your needs will be a defining factor for how successful your crosslisting endeavors will be. To help you get it right, we'll go over the five essential features to look for when choosing a crosslisting app for your ecommerce business, and explain the significance of each one in day-to-day multichannel selling. Multi-Channel Integrations Not all crosslisting apps are created equal, and that is most evident by the number of channel integrations each one offers. As a general rule, better crosslisting apps will offer a wider selection of multichannel integrations. That said, quantity does not equal quality, and it's important to go over the actual sales channel integrations offered to see if they're relevant to your selling needs. If you sell car parts, for example, an Etsy integration will be of no use to you, but an eBay integration will be non-negotiable. Furthermore, it's wise to choose a crosslisting app that constantly has new integrations in the works, so you don't find yourself lacking integration for a key sales channel a few years down the line. Inventory Management A key component of successful multichannel selling is the ability to manage inventory across channels. If you update an item's attributes on your primary sales channel, you'll want your crosslisting app to update that item's corresponding listings on all your other sales channels too. Likewise, if you make changes to an item's quantity or delist it, your crosslisting app needs to reflect those changes in every channel where that item is crosslisted. Automated Syncing and Listing One of the biggest challenges of multichannel selling is ensuring that all your sales channels are on the same page in terms of listing and item synchronization. As such, the ability to automatically sync products and listings across channels is an essential part of any crosslisting app. In practice, this means that if a unit sells on one channel, your crosslisting app needs to be able to update all your other sales channels and delist it, so you don't end up selling an item you no longer have in stock. Furthermore, any changes you make to inventory, such as adding new products or adjusting stock levels, must be updated on all your selling channels. Listing Optimization Another major challenge of selling on multiple channels is ensuring that each listing is optimized for every sales channel it's crosslisted to. This means not only ensuring platform-specific compliance, but also sales-channel-specific search engine optimization, image optimization, and more. If your crosslisting app doesn't give you the tools you need to tweak and optimize product listings for each sales channel, it's not going to give you the results you need – that is, sales – when you use it to cross list products to new channels. In other words, a crosslisting app should offer you more than just copy-and-paste for your listings; it needs to have customizable and automatable optimizations that can be applied to your products when they're crosslisted to new channels. Order Management Multichannel selling means multichannel orders, and those can quickly get overwhelming without a good way to view and manage them, so a good crosslisting app should enable you to do just that. Make sure that the crosslisting app you choose doesn't just allow you to cross list products to new channels, but also gives you a way to manage the resulting multichannel orders in a single integrated interface, so you won't have to log into each channel multiple times a day to check if a new order has come in. ‍ Top 9 Cross Listing Apps for eCommerce Sellers Now that we gone over crosslisting is and understood the essential features of a good cross listing app, we'll use these criteria to take a look at 9 of the leading cross listing apps for online sellers. We'll go over the key features of each one, understand what kind of ecommerce seller they'd be most suitable for, take a look at their pricing structure, and review some of the main pros and cons of each one. ‍ 1. ExportYourStore ExportYourStore is a crosslisting app that boasts an impressive array of integrations, for both mainstream and niche sales channels. It's accessible in terms of pricing, offers widely customizable automations, and has an integrated order management platform for simple multichannel order management. Its unique approach to multichannel integration enables sellers to largely maintain their current workflows by allowing them to designate a \"source store,\" which acts as the source of truth store for everything from new items to product data edits. In addition to this unique approach, ExportYourStore offers sellers a wide variety of customizable rules and automations, in-depth analytics via a centralized dashboard, built-in FBA automation for seamless and hands-off multichannel fulfillment, bulk listing capabilities, automatic inventory synchronization, and an interface for creating custom product data feeds that can be used for anything from PPC advertising to product optimization. Key Features: ExportYourStore Best for: ExportYourStore is ideal for ecommerce sellers who want to try out multichannel selling without having to commit to learning the ins and outs of each new platform. It's perfect for sellers of all sizes, and comes with attractively-priced plans that can scale with your business as you grow and expand to new channels. Pricing: Pricing starts at just $23 per month, making ExportYourStore accessible to sellers at every stage of their ecommerce journey. Even on the Starter plan you'll be able to link an unlimited number of sales channels to your source store and manage an unlimited number of orders. Plus, you can also try out all of ExportYourStore's features with a free 7-day trial. Pros: ExportYourStore ExportYourStore is a unique crosslisting and multichannel selling tool that allows sellers to set up new sales channels by linking them to their main ecommerce store. This means sellers can continue managing their ecommerce business in the way they're used to, from their current ecommerce store, while still reaping the benefits of multichannel selling. ExportYourStore's unique approach to cross-listing and multichannel selling means that sellers no longer need to commit to learning exactly how to create and publish a listing on every new channel and platform they wish to sell on just to get started, making it a great choice for sellers who want to start selling on new channels but don't have the time to study each one in depth beforehand. ExportYourStore enables sellers to export their listings to a wide variety of online marketplaces, shopping cart platforms, and social media channels, including eBay, Amazon, Walmart, Shopify, WooCommerce, Mercari, Depop, Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram. It allows for seamless multichannel integration, and provides a way for sellers to expand their reach by crosslisting products with channel-specific optimizations for titles, descriptions, images, and even pricing. ExportYourStore also simplifies the process of multichannel selling with features like automatic cross-channel inventory synchronization, auto delisting, custom and automatable listing optimizations, bulk actions, an integrated multichannel order management interface, and even fully automatable Amazon MCF using FBA inventory for all selling channels. ‍ 2. Sellbrite Sellbrite is a multichannel selling app designed to help online retailers manage and sell their products across multiple sales channels, including eBay, Amazon, Walmart, and Shopify. Sellbrite works via a centralized dashboard that requires users to upload their products in order to list and manage inventory and orders on multiple marketplaces. Sellbrite separates its plans into plans for Shopify sellers and all other sellers. Sellers who wish to use FBA, whether for Amazon fulfillment or for multichannel fulfillment, will need to purchase additional expansions on top of Sellbrite's standard subscription packages. Key Features: Sellbrite Best for: Sellbrite is a good choice for sellers who have predictable and relatively limited order volumes, since each subscription tier places a limit on how many monthly orders you can have across channels. It's also a good choice for sellers who only want to expand their business to marketplaces and shopping carts. Pricing: Sellbrite's first paid subscription tier starts at $29 per month, and allows for up to 100 monthly orders. FBA integration costs an additional $19 per month. For sellers who sell on Shopify or Shopify Plus and need Shopify integration, the first paid subscription tier costs $19 per month. Pros: Sellbrite Along with multichannel listing capabilities, Sellbrite's features include bulk listing tools, inventory synchronization, order management, and reporting capabilities. Furthermore, Sellbrite has integrations for some third-party tools, including research tools like Algopix and fulfillment tools like Flexport. Sellbrite also offers a free plan for very small sellers, whose multichannel sales do not exceed 30 order per month, although this plan cannot support FBA integration. Cons: Sellbrite Sellbrite's subscription tiers are relatively convoluted, and it can be difficult for sellers to understand what subscription will work for their selling needs. Furthermore, Sellbrite effectively caps your earnings by limiting the number of orders you can have based on your subscription tier. On top of that, FBA integration, a backbone of many successful multichannel ecommerce operations, carries an additional cost every month. Sellbrite's channel integrations are also relatively limited, with only a handful of marketplaces available, and no integrations available at all for lucrative social commerce channels like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. ‍ 3. Rithum Rithum is a business management and automation tool designed to help ecommerce sellers consolidate their multichannel operations, manage inventory, and optimize their listings across various sales channels. It offers features such as bulk product uploading, inventory synchronization, order management, and reporting. Rithum supports integration with an unbeatably wide array of ecommerce platforms from all over the world, enabling enterprise-level businesses to manage, scale, and expand their operations more efficiently. Key Features: Rithum Best for: Rithum is best suited for sellers who have very large sales volumes, who require an extensive selection of third-party integrations, and who wish to expand to many multinational sales channels. It's aimed at enterprise-level sellers, with its pricing and toolset reflecting the needs of its target audience. ‍Pricing: Unlike ExportYourStore and Sellbrite above, Rithum does not have tiered subscription plans. Instead, Rithum's pricing works on a commission-based model, in which Rithum agrees on a price with each individual seller. Pricing is subject to change over time as the agreement with Rithum is renewed. Pros: Rithum Rithum is not just a cross-listing app; it's a massive and multifaceted ecommerce tool that offers solutions for a variety of ecommerce needs. It offers practically every ecommerce solution under the sun, and aims to fulfill every one of its clients' ecommerce needs, in the present and in the future. Cons: Rithum While Rithum can be used by small and midsize sellers, it's aimed primarily at enterprise level commerce, so its features – and pricing – reflect that. The latter is not transparent, and is tailored to each client with a unique contract. Rithum also has a huge ecosystem of ecommerce tools, so even if you only use some of them, it's very difficult to understand what tools you actually need for your current and projected selling needs, especially if you're just starting out with multichannel selling. ‍ 4. Listing Mirror Listing Mirror is a multichannel ecommerce listing and inventory management tool designed to help online sellers manage their product listings across multiple marketplaces, such as eBay, Amazon, Walmart, and Shopify, from a single platform. It offers features like bulk listing creation, inventory synchronization, and order management. The platform is aimed at simplifying the process of selling on multiple marketplaces, allowing businesses to expand their reach by crosslisting to new sales channels. Key Features: Listing Mirror Best for: Since a significant part of Listing Mirror's functionalities are additional paid addons, it's best suited for sellers who need very basic functionality from their crosslisting app, or those who don't mind paying a monthly fee for features such as Amazon MCF (FBA) integration. Pricing: Listing Mirror's pricing is tailored to each customer and works on a volume basis. Its base plan, List & Launch, is priced based on how many SKUs you manage with the app. Its first addon, Inventory Connect, which manages and syncs multichannel inventory, is priced based on the number of orders imported into the app. The second optional addon, Smart Stock, which creates stock forecasts and auto-generates supplier purchase orders, is priced per client on an onboarding call. Pros: Listing Mirror Listing Mirror is primarily geared towards Amazon sellers who want to take their ecommerce business beyond Amazon, and with the addition of paid addons, it can be a great tool for that type of seller. Its inventory forecasting, available via the Smart Stock addon subscription package, can be a great tool for sellers who need help managing their inventory and don't currently outsource their logistics to Amazon FBA, since much of this addon's functionality is available within Amazon. Cons: Listing Mirror Listing Mirror can be a handy tool for certain Amazon sellers looking to expand to new sales channels, but its obscure pricing and the fact that it requires three different complementary plans in order to achieve full crosslisting functionality are more trouble than they're worth for many sellers. Furthermore, since pricing is directly tied to order volume, high-volume sellers or those who wish to expand to a significant number of sales channels find that, due to its cost, it simply doesn't make sense for them as a crosslisting solution. ‍ 5. Vendoo Vendoo is a multichannel listing and inventory management software aimed primarily at secondhand fashion sellers. It's designed to help these sellers cross-list their products to various online marketplaces, including eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, Depop, and others. Vendoo's features include bulk listing creation, inventory tracking, and automatic cross-posting. Vendoo also offers tools for order management, sales tracking, and analytics to help sellers grow their businesses and maintain accurate stock levels across platforms. Key Features: Vendoo Best for: Vendoo is the first crosslisting app on our list that's aimed specifically at resellers who sell secondhand goods. Its integrations include slightly more niche secondhand luxury fashion marketplaces like Vestiaire Collective and Grailed, making it ideal for sellers who wish to list on these marketplaces. Pricing: Of all the apps listed here, Vendoo's pricing is by far the most complex. Its most basic plan starts at $199 per year. This plan allows you to list up to 25 products every month, and remove the background from a product image up to 25 times each month. To get actual crosslisting functionality, however, you'll need to purchase a monthly subscription of the \"Importing\" addon, which costs $4.99 per month. If you want to take advantage of that crosslisting functionality on more than 3 marketplaces (i.e. crosslist to and integrate with more than three sales channels) you'll need to purchase the \"All Marketplaces\" subscription package, priced at $4.99 per month. Finally, in order to bulk actions, you'll need to purchase the \"Bulk Delist & Relist\" package, which costs an additional $4.99 per month. These three subscription packs can also be purchased together at a discounted rate of $11.99 per month. Pros: Vendoo As an app aimed at secondhand fashion resellers, Vendoo's strengths lie in tools for fashion reselling on niche marketplaces. For starters, Vendoo makes its bulk offers feature available in every plan, which helps sellers send out offers to interested shoppers more easily. Furthermore, Vendoo has a mobile app, making it easy to check in on your secondhand item listings on the go. Cons: Vendoo Once you manage to make sense of its convoluted pricing, it becomes abundantly clear that Vendoo is pretty expensive, especially for the target seller audience it aims to attract. To get actual crosslisting done with Vendoo, you'll need to purchase a monthly subscription addon to your plan; to get integration for more than 3 sales channels, you'll need to purchase another subscription; and to enjoy basic bulk actions, you'll have to purchase yet another one. Vendoo is also extremely lacking in the realm of multichannel integration. Its inventory sync available for just five of its 11 possible sales channel integrations, putting you at risk of overselling, which has the potential to significantly harm your selling accounts due to seller-initiated cancellations and the inevitable negative feedback that will result. ‍ 6. OneShop OneShop is a platform for creating listings and them on secondhand-oriented ecommerce marketplaces. It has integrations for eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, and Depop. It offers a way to create listings and publish them to these marketplaces, and includes automatic delisting for products that have been sold. Its main selling point is its automatable relisting feature, which automatically takes down and relists items to make them appear new on marketplaces, which can help with listing visibility in some cases. It also has automations for listing promotion features, like sending offers, listing bumping, and sharing listings. Key Features: OneShop Best for: As is evident by its features and marketplace integrations, OneShop is a solution aimed at secondhand sellers, primarily those who sell secondhand fashion. As such, OneShop is best for sellers who exclusively sell secondhand fashion, and who only need to integrate with eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, and Depop. Pricing: OneShop's pricing is simple and straightforward: $45 per month, no matter how much – or how little – you list and sell. Pros: OneShop As an app focused on secondhand selling, its main strengths lie in features for secondhand sellers. For starters, OneShop offers a mobile app for both iPhone and Android phones, making it easy for sellers to manage things on the go. Additionally, aside from offering a listing and order management platform, OneShop's app also has a built-in forum that connects all of its sellers, where they can communicate with each other to ask for tips, advice, and help. Finally, OneShop can automatically delist and relist items, allowing sellers to automatically refresh stale listings. Cons: OneShop OneShop is a platform aimed at secondhand resellers, which makes the lack of Etsy integration all the more problematic. Etsy is a major marketplace with a thriving vintage community, and sellers who use OneShop simply won't be able to list on Etsy. Furthermore, OneShop doesn't actually have any crosslisting functionality – you will need to create listings in OneShop in order to list to your integrated channels, and won't have the option of cross listing from one sales channel to another. For the limited integrations it offers, OneShop is also one of the more expensive options on our list. With a flat subscription rate of $45 per month, OneShop's pricing simply doesn't make sense for a large chunk of ecommerce sellers, especially those who sell primarily secondhand fashion. Finally, relisting and delisting is a risky SEO approach, which can very easily backfire. Allowing an app to manage this entirely automatically without very extensive customization is dangerous, and can even result in the suspension of your selling accounts if something goes wrong. ‍ 7. List Perfectly List Perfectly is a cross-listing tool that helps online sellers manage their product listings across select shopping carts and primary secondhand-focused marketplaces. Its sales channel integrations include eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, Etsy, and Shopify, among others. It allows users to import and post listings in bulk, cross-post to various platforms, and delist items once sold. It is intended for resellers who want to sell on multiple channels and manage listings in a more consolidated manner. Key Features: List Perfectly Best for: Like our previous app, List Perfectly is designed primarily for secondhand resellers, and its integrations reflect that. It offers a single shopping cart integration – Shopify – and multiple marketplace integrations for used- and secondhand-oriented selling: eBay, Grailed, Mercari, Vestiaire, Poshmark, Facebook Marketplace, Etsy, the now-defunct Kidizen, and their own closed seller community/potential sales channel called Listing Party. Pricing: List Perfectly offers plans starting at $29 per month, although this tier doesn't offer crossposting to several key sales channels, like Instagram and Shopify. Each subscription tier offers more functionalities and unlocks more product attributes you can include in your product listings. This means that, in order to reach the most basic functionality and attributes you need as a secondhand seller (i.e. include item condition in your listing, crosslist to major sales channels, and bulk actions), you'll need to purchase the Pro subscription, which costs $69 per month. Pros: List Perfectly List Perfectly has a unique seller community and closed marketplace known as Listing Party. It borrows elements from many secondhand selling marketplaces to create a seller community, with live events hosted by and for sellers, and a 24-hour seller chat. Cons: List Perfectly List Perfectly is a niche crosslisting app aimed at resellers, which makes the limited product attribute support on the basic tiers all the more problematic. Resellers simply can't list secondhand or vintage items without a product attribute for their condition. Furthermore, making bulk actions unavailable except on more expensive tiers makes it practically impossible to list on multiple marketplaces. List Perfectly limits many functions, making it far more expensive in practice than it initially seems. ‍ 8. Crosslisting Crosslisting is a tool designed to help online sellers crosslist and manage their product listings on ecommerce platforms such as eBay, Poshmark, and Mercari. Crosslisting offers features like inventory synchronization and bulk listing management, and is aimed primarily at resellers who want to crosslist on secondhand-oriented sales channels. Key Features: Crosslisting Best for: Crosslisting is a cross-listing app aimed specifically at resellers, and that's who it would work best for. Its integrations cover secondhand selling marketplaces, and its plans are tiered in such a way that resellers of all levels can find a plan that works for them. Pricing: Crosslisting works on a monthly subscription model, and offers many pricing tiers. Its first tier, Lite, costs $9.99 per month, and allows for up to 50 cross posts. Realistically, since a cross post is effectively a listing on a given sales channel, most sellers will need to use the Standard tier, which costs $29.99 per month and allows for up to 150 cross posts. Pros: Crosslisting One of the main features of Crosslisting is that it allows sellers to relist products to boost their visibility. This feature is great for resellers in particular, since it's most effective on reselling sites like Depop and Mercari. Another handy feature that Crosslisting has is a mobile app, which makes it easy to manage listings on the go. Cons: Crosslisting Although Crosslisting aims to provide a solution for resellers, even in this realm its integrations are limited. It only has integration for six marketplaces: Poshmark, Depop, eBay, Grailed, Vinted and Mercari, not counting the integration for the now-defunct Kidizen, which is still listed on its site. Etsy, a major marketplace for vintage items, is missing, as is Facebook Marketplace and ThreadUp, to name a few. Additionally, one of its main selling points, relisting, is not included in any of its crosslisting subscription tiers. Instead, it must be purchased monthly as an addon in packages of 10, 15, or 20 relists. Finally, true crosslisting functionality – that is, cross listing from one marketplace to another – is hindered by the 20-listing limit on bulk listing imports across all plans. This, makes Crosslisting a less than ideal choice for sellers who actually want an app to crosslist their existing listings to new marketplaces. ‍ 9. PrimeLister PrimeLister is an app for managing and listing products across secondhand selling marketplaces, including eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, and Etsy, as well as on Shopify, which is a shopping cart platform for creating standalone webstores. It provides features for bulk listing, inventory management, and automatic delisting for cross-platform inventory synchronization. PrimeLister aims to help sellers save time by centralizing the process of listing and managing inventory on multiple sales channels. Key Features: PrimeLister Best for: While PrimeLister bills itself as a crosslisting app, its crosslisting functionality is limited, and its multichannel integration functionality is sub-par. As such, it's best for resellers who only need to relist items (i.e. take down listings in order to republish them) on marketplaces like Mercari or Depop every once in a while to keep them fresh. Pricing: PrimeLister offers two subscription plans: Basic and Pro. The former costs $29.99 per month, but offers no crosslisting functionality at all. The latter costs $49.99 per month and includes crosslisting functionality, as well as inventory management and \"tags & groups,\" a backend organization feature. Pros: PrimeLister PrimeLister offers a steep 30% discount for subscribers who are willing to commit for a year, which is more than the commonly offered discount of 15-20%. Cons: PrimeLister PrimeLister has many drawbacks – a lack of integrations, a pricey subscription, and limited features – but its biggest drawback is its complete lack of automatic delisting. As of writing, this feature is not available on either one of the plans, which means that even if you shell out almost $50 per month just to get basic crosslisting functionality, you will still very likely find yourself with orders cancelled due to overselling items you no longer have. ‍ How to Choose the Right Cross Listing App for Your Online Store Now that we've gone over nine popular crosslisting apps, you might be feeling a little overwhelmed. There are so many features and functionalities beyond simply cross-listing from one sales channel to another, that it's not always easy to decipher what makes a good crosslisting app and what just sounds useful in theory. In this section, we'll go over how you can analyze the crosslisting apps available on the market and see how well they meet your needs, so you can choose the best crosslisting app for your ecommerce business and expand to new sales channels easily. Identify Your Needs and Goals While it may sound obvious, it's not always the first thing that goes through a seller's mind when selecting a crosslisting app. But just like not all crosslisting apps are created equal, not all crosslisting apps are designed for the same type of ecommerce seller. Some are best for resellers, while others appeal to a broader range of sellers with a wide array of sales channel integrations; some have built-in crosslisting functionality, while others offer it only as an extra addon feature. With so many options, it's important to take a moment to assess exactly what it is you need from a cross-listing app before beginning your search. Do you sell primarily mid-range secondhand fashion, or is luxury vintage fashion something you need to be able to sell too? Do you not sell secondhand goods at all, and only need integration for handmade-oriented marketplaces like Etsy and Amazon Handmade? How many products will you realistically want to cross-list, today and as your business grows? Do you hold inventory, or are you a dropshipper? These are just some of the questions you need to ask yourself before you start looking for an app, so you know right off the bat which ones are irrelevant to your needs. If you don't plan on selling secondhand fashion, several of the crosslisting apps on our list are already crossed out! Consider Your Budget Just like any business expense, the cost of your cross listing app of choice is a major consideration that cannot be overlooked. Ideally, your crosslisting app should offer a selection of plans that can grow with your business, ones that make sense for your bottom line at every step of the way. Some apps do this better than others, but the most important thing is to be honest with yourself about how much you can justifiably spend on a crosslisting app with the funds you have available to you now, not what you could potentially make in the future. Read Reviews and Ask for Recommendations Analyzing an app's features on paper is all well and good, but nothing beats the experience of sellers like you. It's only when you start working with a crosslisting app do you truly understand how it helps – or even harms – your ecommerce business. Does it delist items to prevent overselling in time? Does it integrate your inventory across all your selling channels? Can you optimize your cross-listed products for each marketplace and platform? All these are just a handful of things are truly important to multichannel sellers, and they'll be sure to come up in reviews if one of them is lacking. ‍ Final Thoughts: The Importance of Cross Listing for eCommerce Sellers Cross listing is the single best thing ecommerce sellers to can do to increase their reach and maximize their earning potential. Listing to new sales channels not only multiplies your pool of potential buyers instantly, it also establishes your credibility through better visibility across platforms. Just like anything worth doing, crosslisting must be done right to reap its benefits; done wrong, the damage to your business can be irreparable. With every new sales channel you cross list to, you'll have the responsibility of not only integrating your inventory responsibly and delisting items when they're sold, but also optimizing for both compliance and visibility. It's never enough to just copy and paste your listings from one channel to another, and it all boils down to choosing the best crosslisting app for your ecommerce business' unique selling needs. Make sure to choose the app that works for your selling needs, and make the most of the features it offers to not only list on more channels, but to successfully sell on them, too.

TechRound Team December 25, 2024 Imagine this: you’re an e-commerce seller that has many listings across multiple platforms. It can become a mad rush every day to update the inventory, iron out the discrepancies, respond to inquiries, and rush to correct information or prices. It only takes one slip-up, say, an overstocked sale by mistake or at the wrong prices to hurt your reputation. Frustrated customers leave reviews, and you begin to miss out on sales. It can be very exhausting and you may have wondered, “Is there a better way to manage it all?” Cross-listing can help you find the proper tools and strategy to forget the chaos from your manual management and drive e-commerce success. What Is Cross-Listing? Cross-listing means that you can list the product/s you’re selling on several different online marketplaces. If you’re making and selling handmade jewelry, and you decide to sell your products on different platforms, you can very well sell that exact necklace on Etsy, eBay, and Poshmark. Your products are able to reach more potential buyers. Every marketplace has its niche audience, and cross-listing ensures that your items come into the view of the largest audience possible. This automatically means that there are going to be more selling opportunities. One buyer might have missed your listing on one platform but ended up coming across it on another platform. Why Selling on Only One Platform Isn’t Enough Marketplaces change their algorithms from time to time. And when this happens, it could very likely mean that your products can disappear from the search. Worse, account suspension or bans from a platform can shut down all your income streams altogether. So Cross-listing will decrease the impact of site-specific problems. Diversification of sales channels allows the potential to reach an even larger audience and tap into different buyer demographics. You’ll have a much stronger business model that relies on no single marketplace since each platform has different strengths and you can take advantage of each unique audience. How Cross-Listing Platforms Save You Time and Headaches Handling all the sites by hand is impossible, while cross-listing tools can do everything for you very quickly: Automated uploads: They can create one listing and distribute it across multiple marketplaces instantly, saving you hours of having to do the same thing over and over Inventory syncing: It can help to automatically update stock levels to avoid overselling your products and disappointing customers Bulk editing: Change the prices, photos, or descriptions of any product across all platforms within just a few clicks to maintain consistency The right cross-listing platform is going to make all the difference when it comes to simplifying your workflow. For sellers looking to simplify their workflow, finding the right cross-listing platform is essential. If you’re seeking a primelister alternative, there are tools like Crosslist that cater to diverse business needs. Choosing the Right Cross-Listing Tool Not all cross-listing platforms are created equal: Ease of use: Go with a platform that has an easy and user-friendly interface and will simplify your workflow, saving you time and reducing the learning curve Cost vs. value: Determine if the price is worth the tool’s functionality. Sometimes, a slightly higher price is well worth it because it increases efficiency and sales Specific features: Choose one that best suits your needs, whether it is providing customizable templates or giving comprehensive options for specific product categories Real Results: How Cross-Listing Can Boost Your Sales For example, a seller selling only on eBay and may be having a hard time increasing sales. Items may perform well, but there may not be enough growth and progress. By cross-listing on Etsy, Facebook Marketplace and other platforms, a seller may be able to increase their sales significantly. At the heart of it all is automation: cross-listing inventory, managing listings across platforms with a cross-listing tool, and thereby eliminating any chance of overselling, drastically reducing workloads. This can allow sellers to have time to make new products and market their business. Cross-listing has been one way to grow an e-commerce business. It can save you time, avoid a lot of manual errors, and increases your reach across more people. The right tool in your hands helps you focus on the bottom line: great products and good service.

I'm the founder of ListingToFreedom.com where I teach people just like you how to make money flipping used items on online platforms like eBay, Mercari, and Poshmark. 1 comments if you're trying to manage selling across multiple platforms trying to juggle all of your listings then this video is for you I'm going to be diving into what I believe to be the very best cross-listing tool for resellers in 2025 hey there my name is Lee Meyer I'm the founder of listing the freedom and the empowered reseller.com and I'm on a mission to help 1,000 resellers make $100,000 in the next 12 months if you're new here welcome to the channel my name is Lee Meer and I've made well over $100,000 flipping used Goods on sites like eBay Poshmark and merari and a big piece of My Success has been selling across multiple platforms with the help of a cross Lister now when I first started reselling there were not any cross listing tools on the market no help available you had to manually go and crosspost your items to multiple platforms if you wanted to be able to sell in multiple places it just was not feasible but shortly after after I got started with reselling cross-listing tools started coming on the market and there's several out there you might be looking into and in this video I'm going to share with you why I chose the one that I did and why I continue to believe that it is the best choice for resellers now the cross listing tool and app that I use and recommend is called vendue down here in the description below this video you'll find a link that will get you 25% off of your first month you're also able to get a free trial where you get five free listings each and every month to be able to try it out for yourself and see if it is right for you again you'll find a link down here with an affiliate code this is at no additional cost to you and helps me keep this channel running and helps me to be able to bring you more amazing reseller content and I'm going to let you in on a little secret if you're watching this video in the month of January 2025 you can actually get 40% off of your first month using the link below as well as the coupon code thrive in 25 now there are three broad reasons why I believe this to be the best cross Lister but I'm going to be also getting into specifics in this video first up this platform has updated features and integrates with all major reselling platforms secondly it has an easy to use interface as well as a responsive customer service and thirdly it's being Contin updated to stay ahead of Industry Trends and real quick before we get into the specifics let me explain what cross listing is and what a cross-listing tool can help you do cross-listing just means that you are listing your items out to multiple platforms and having a cross-listing tool means that you don't have to do it manually if you were to manually cross list which you can certainly do you're essentially going to be copying and pasting that same listing over and over again to the different marketplaces that you want to be selling on a cross listing tool can save you tons of time because it can give you one place to be able to create your listing and have that broadcast out to multiple platforms and it also gives you a way for those listings to actually be connected so that if it sells on one platform it's going to get delisted across those other platforms so that you don't end up with duplicate sales and a cross-listing tool is really all about saving you time so I spoiled things a little bit there but let's go ahead and jump on into the seven reasons why I believe that vendue is the best tool for you to be using in 2025 number one since I just touched on is that Auto Sales detect feature this is a GameChanger because it allows you to be able to go about your day without having to worry about ending up with duplicate sales vendue will actually take care of this for you in the back end where you don't have to be at your computer or on your phone constantly checking on your sales and then going in and delisting so what the auto sales detect feature will do you do need to actually have this toggle turned on for it to work but when you have that turned on what it's going to do is it's going to detect any sales that happen in real time and as soon as a sale comes in let's say you have a sale come in on merari and you have that item listed to depop eBay and Poshmark what vendu is actually going to do is remove those listings from those other platforms so that you don't end up with duplicate sales number two with the user interface you can actually get your items listed out to multiple Platforms in just a few clicks you'll create your listing right inside of vendue and then it takes just a couple of clicks to get it listed over to eBay couple clicks to get it listed to merari couple clicks to get it listed to Poshmark whatever platforms that you want to be selling on all of that information is going to be pulled into those specific platforms is going to take just a couple of things like maybe entering size maybe entering shipping and then you'll click to get that item listed and from experience this is infinitely faster than trying to manually do this yourself number three is Inventory management capabilities if you are not using a cross Lister and trying to sell in multiple places it's going to be very difficult to manage your inventory and track your sales coming in vendue gives you one place but it also gives you a way to be able to manage that inventory through things like tags that are specific to to the vendue platform there are also all other kinds of capabilities such as being able to sort and different filters that you can apply to be able to manage your inventory and speaking of sorting you can actually sort your items by how stale they are and that brings me to number four which vendue has the capability to actually delist and relist your sale items for you you're going to Simply sort your items by how stale they are you're going to select which items that you want to D list and relist and you're going to click for vendue to go ahead and complete this for you what this is going to do is it's actually going to remove your listings from the platforms where you want it removed from and then it's going to relist them as fresh brand new items and this is going to boost your sales because it's going to push your listings to the top of search results so that they actually get seen and sold and this is just one of the reasons why I believe vendue to be the best for 2025 because it is so much more more than just a cross listing tool number five vendue actually gives you the capability to have one place to send out offers from if you've tried to sell items across multiple places before it can be a nightmare pulling hair of trying to go to each and every platform manage your inventory along with sending out offers vendue gives you one place to be able to go to and actually get your offers sent out from just that one platform without having to log in to multiple places and this is just another example of how vendue not only saves you time but helps you make more sales number six is having custom templates you can actually go in and set these templates up I recommend setting templates up for each and every category that you're going to be listing into frequently and what these templates do is allow you to drastically speed up the listing process because it's going to prefill that information into all of your listing for you and this is a huge timesaver for you and number seven is the analytics dashboard this is the place where you can access all of your data so you can make informed decisions about your business I hope you found this video helpful and then it shows you just how easy it is to be able to sell across multiple platforms get more eyes on your items and make more sales if you tried vendue before or if you're looking to level up your reselling game let me know in the comments below and don't forget about that link down there to get you 25% off of your first month with vendue and if you're needing more help with getting started with vendue I will leave a link up here with the playlist that will walk you through step byep how to use bendu thanks for watching and I'll see you soon [Music] [Music]",

The Card Collector’s Conundrum Pricing Blog Help Center FAQ Docs Contact Login Sign Up Tips, Tricks and Guides A Comprehensive Guide To Multi-Channel Listing Management For Resellers UpdatedDecember 14, 2024 Reading Time: 8 minutes Raise your hands if you’re a reseller who can relate to lamenting over the time-consuming process of creating and managing product listings across multiple e-commerce platforms. 🖐️ Just imagine how much time you would have to work on scaling up your business if only someone could take care of the listing management process for you. Enter: cross listing apps (like Crosslist) that help you streamline the entire process, saving you loads of time and energy. Let’s take a look at what cross-channel listing management is for resellers and how it can help you! What is multichannel listing management for resellers? As a reseller, you likely have a presence in several online marketplaces such as Etsy, eBay, Poshmark, Depop, and so on. You’re probably selling the same products across each platform, too. (Multichannel selling increases product visibility and sales, so good job on that!) But the problem comes in when you find yourself having to rewrite each product listing on every platform. That’s well over hundreds of listings, which is simply not feasible even if you just copy and paste. To help simplify this process, resellers often use multichannel listing management tools like Crosslist to save time. These software tools have many wonderful functions, with the most important of all being the ability to cross list your product listings across multiple platforms. This means you need to create just a single listing for each product and, with the click of a few buttons, you can cross post this listing to all the different platforms you’re selling that product on! Pretty convenient, right? But this is just the beginning. Let’s dive into all the different ways in which multichannel listing management tools help your business. How cross listing management software can help your business With the help of Crosslist, you can truly make your business life easier. 1. Save time by automating the listing process The #1 selling point of multichannel listing management tools is that they decrease your manual workload by automating the listing and inventory process for you. Whether you’re selling a jacket on two marketplaces or ten, you only need to create a single listing for it. With software like Crosslist, that listing can then be posted across up to nine different supported marketplaces. You don’t have to limit yourself to cross-posting a single product listing, though. You can bulk post several product listings on multiple platforms at the same time with Crosslist! Another cool Crosslist feature is that it allows you to crosslist your listings directly from one marketplace to another. Let’s say you started out on Mercari. After a year, you decide to start selling the same products on other places like Etsy and Poshmark. Now, instead of creating a new listing on Crosslist, you can just use our application to cross-post your Mercari inventory to Etsy and Poshmark (either directly from website to website, or by importing the inventory in bulk and then cross listing everything together). The best part is that this entire process only takes seconds! Our app will automatically post all the listings in the background. You won’t need to take any more action after you click the Post button. 2. Increases operational efficiency Picture having a big computer screen that gives you all the important information about your reselling business at a glance. Now, picture a personal assistant along with this, who makes the day-to-day business operations easier for you to handle. Multichannel listing management tools act as both of these with features like inventory management, bulk actions, and template-based help. Here’s what these features look like on Crosslist: Inventory management and tracking Who needs a central command center when you have Crosslist? If you head to My Listings after logging in, you’ll see all of your product listings in one place. At a glance, you can see details such as photo preview, title, price, date created, and all the marketplaces you have posted this listing to–all on a single dashboard. You can also sort out this inventory according to where it’s listed! Super convenient. Keep in mind that with Crosslist, you can also manage your inventory and create or prepare listings directly from a mobile device. AI-generated listings Having trouble coming up with a title and description for your product? Crosslist’s newest feature–our state-of-the-art AI algorithm add-on–will get the job done for you. Based on the cover image you upload, the AI will detect the details of the product and automatically populate all the fields in the product listing form. This includes title, description, product type, brand, color, condition, tags, and so on. But, our favorite Crosslist AI feature is the fact that it will browse through price trends on the internet and suggest an optimal pricing for your product! This will save you loads of time from doing market research. Bulk relist and delist Sold out of a particular product and want to remove the product listing from all the platforms you posted it on? Doing this is as easy as looking up that product listing and selecting the button named Bulk delist. The same goes for relisting a product after a while. Relisting is useful as it gives you a temporary boost in the search results of the marketplaces you’re listing on. Listing templates and tags When selling two or more products that share several common characteristics, Crosslist makes your entire listing process even more efficient by letting you create templates beforehand. Templates allow you to fill in and save part of the product information (this should be the info that’s common to all the products you’re creating a template for). You can even select which platforms the template is for. So, when the time comes to create a listing, you can just use the template, fill up the rest of the info, and you’re good to go! The custom tag feature offered by Crosslist allows users to organize and categorize their listings more efficiently. With custom tags, you can add specific labels to your products, making it easier to track and manage your inventory across multiple marketplaces. Incorporating strategies like category management can take this one step further, ensuring that products are grouped effectively to meet customer needs and drive sales growth. These tags help streamline searches, sorting, and filtering, providing better control and visibility over your listings. Whether it’s tracking seasonal items, sale statuses, or specific product categories, custom tags enhance the overall listing management experience. Image editor and unlimited background removals Crosslist offers an image editor that allows you to make adjustments to your product photos directly within the platform. You can easily crop, resize, and enhance your images without needing any third-party software, ensuring your listings look polished and professional. In addition to the image editor, Crosslist also provides unlimited background removals. This feature lets you quickly remove distracting backgrounds from your product images, giving them a clean, professional appearance that can help attract more buyers and improve the overall presentation of your listings. Shipping profiles Each e-commerce marketplace has a different shipping method. Some offer several shipping options, while others do not. For instance, when selling on Poshmark, your only option is to use the prepaid shipping labels offered by the platform. Depop, on the other hand, offers two choices: use their prepaid shipping, or ship it yourself. It can be very time-consuming to decide a shipping method for each platform, remember it, and add it to each product listing. So, at Crosslist, we came up with the wonderful idea of creating shipping profiles! Just select your preferred shipping method for each online platform once, and it’ll automatically be applied to every single listing you create. 3. Helps you maintain brand consistency Your personal brand is a very important thing. It distinguishes you from others, and becomes the way in which customers perceive you. This makes it very significant to keep your brand image consistent across all the marketplaces. But when you’re creating and uploading product listings manually, it becomes very easy for your listings to have inconsistencies. E.g., different descriptions by marketplace, different images and so on. With a single dynamic listing form and a centralized experience, Crosslist enables you to maintain a consistent brand image across all marketplaces where you sell. This uniformity not only enhances customer trust but also makes it easier for potential buyers to recognize and find your products across multiple platforms. Tip: Have a brand logo that you’d like to add to each of your listings? Simply add it to your templates for a smoother process. 4. Helps you make data-driven decisions Most cross-listing platforms analyze your sales across all platforms and provide charts and reports on your performance. This way, you can see which seasons and platforms are favorable to each of your products and where your customers are coming from and tweak your reselling strategy accordingly to the insights. 5. Increases accuracy We talked about how each marketplace has different shipping options. The same goes for product descriptions and listing formats. Trying to cross-check the required fields for each listing is super frustrating, not to mention error-prone. But, with multi-channel listing management tools like Crosslist, you simply have to fill all the required fields (for all the platforms combined) once. Depending on where you want to post your listings, our app will automatically gather and post only the required info! Is Crosslist safe to use? Yes, it is! Since Crosslist works as a browser extension, it only extends the capabilities of your browser to transfer listings between marketplaces. There’s no direct connection between our servers and the marketplaces you use, and, as such, our software can’t disrupt your profiles. Moreover, since everything is routed through your computer, we neither ask for nor use any of your marketplace login info. If you’re worried about any of your data having leaked, you can use a tool such as Albine DeleteMe to trawl through the internet and delete any personal information. But, rest assured, absolutely no data leaks will happen because of Crosslist! We promise. 🙂 Questions or just say hello! Well, congratulations to you for making it this far!

Just select your preferred shipping method for each online platform once, and it’ll automatically be applied to every single listing you create. 3. Helps you maintain brand consistency Your personal brand is a very important thing. It distinguishes you from others, and becomes the way in which customers perceive you. This makes it very significant to keep your brand image consistent across all the marketplaces. But when you’re creating and uploading product listings manually, it becomes very easy for your listings to have inconsistencies. E.g., different descriptions by marketplace, different images and so on. With a single dynamic listing form and a centralized experience, Crosslist enables you to maintain a consistent brand image across all marketplaces where you sell. This uniformity not only enhances customer trust but also makes it easier for potential buyers to recognize and find your products across multiple platforms. Tip: Have a brand logo that you’d like to add to each of your listings? Simply add it to your templates for a smoother process. 4. Helps you make data-driven decisions Most cross-listing platforms analyze your sales across all platforms and provide charts and reports on your performance. This way, you can see which seasons and platforms are favorable to each of your products and where your customers are coming from and tweak your reselling strategy accordingly to the insights. 5. Increases accuracy We talked about how each marketplace has different shipping options. The same goes for product descriptions and listing formats. Trying to cross-check the required fields for each listing is super frustrating, not to mention error-prone. But, with multi-channel listing management tools like Crosslist, you simply have to fill all the required fields (for all the platforms combined) once. Depending on where you want to post your listings, our app will automatically gather and post only the required info! Is Crosslist safe to use? Yes, it is! Since Crosslist works as a browser extension, it only extends the capabilities of your browser to transfer listings between marketplaces. There’s no direct connection between our servers and the marketplaces you use, and, as such, our software can’t disrupt your profiles. Moreover, since everything is routed through your computer, we neither ask for nor use any of your marketplace login info. If you’re worried about any of your data having leaked, you can use a tool such as Albine DeleteMe to trawl through the internet and delete any personal information. But, rest assured, absolutely no data leaks will happen because of Crosslist! We promise. 🙂 Questions or just say hello! Well, congratulations to you for making it this far!

Sales vs. Marketing: Understanding the Key Differences Table of Contents Sales and Marketing are like two seemingly inseparable twins – forever entwined in the world of business, similar, yet with their own distinct personalities. While they are just like two peas in a pod, working harmoniously towards a common goal – generating revenue, their approaches are as different as chalk and cheese. Understanding these differences is important not only for the effective operation of a company but also for unlocking its full potential. It’s as if you had a bike instead of a business. There are two wheels of the same size but different functions, and it is better to leave them like that. If they are treated as the same thing, or one is ignored, the bicycle loses its balance, making it difficult to ride smoothly and efficiently. Of course, there are statistics to back it up. In 2020 LinkedIn conducted a study and found that a whopping 87% of Sales and Marketing experts believe that teamwork between their departments helps businesses grow. Not only that, but 85% of them also think that getting Sales and Marketing on the same page is the golden ticket to boosting their overall business performance. Sales vs. Marketing By definition, the sales process is about selling products or services, and there is no money without it. Sometimes, “sales” can also refer to the money made or the quantity of items sold. It’s a crucial part of any company’s success, in both action and measurement, but we will be talking about the former.
