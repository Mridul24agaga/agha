But it can surely write good software! :) How Generative AI is About to Shake Up the Entire Software Development Process (Yes, Even the Boring Parts) Report this article Abhishek Vanamali Abhishek Vanamali Creative Marketing Leader Obsessed with Business Growth Published Sep 3, 2024 + Follow Unless you have been living under a rock, you probably have generative AI coming out of your ears. More importantly, in all probability, you have already played around with a chatbot or watched in awe as an AI-generated image of a cat riding a unicorn popped up on your screen. But did you know that this tech isn’t just for party tricks? It’s actually poised to change the entire lifecycle of software development—from those first brainstorms to the nitty-gritty of maintenance. When my awe for the Unicorn-riding-cat wears out, I shift my focus on to the brilliant engineering teams at Publicis Sapient. I am like this wide-eyed 5th grader who is looking at these brilliant men and women from the future, doing magical stuff; and all I can do is clap my hands with glee! And maybe capture some of that in 5th grade lingo. Here is what I have learned from them... 1. Starting with the Idea: Requirements Gathering Imagine this: You’ve got a killer app idea. But when it comes to explaining it to the tech team, you’re speaking in two different languages. Enter Generative AI, your new translator extraordinaire. This AI can take your vision (even if it’s a bit fuzzy) and turn it into a detailed blueprint that developers can actually work with. It’s like having a magical bridge between your big idea and the technical specs needed to make it a reality. 2. Design and Architecture: Where Creativity Meets Code Designing software is a bit like putting together a giant puzzle where the pieces keep changing shape. But AI? It’s like having a cheat sheet. It can suggest design patterns, propose architecture tweaks, and even whip up prototypes faster than you can say, “Is this thing on?” Suddenly, that daunting design phase looks a lot less scary. 3. Let’s Get Coding: Implementation Here’s where things get really interesting. Generative AI can actually help write the code. Yep, you heard that right. Tools like GitHub Copilot can generate code snippets just from your natural language prompts. It’s like having a super-smart assistant who never sleeps and always knows the right answer (and never complains about the coffee). Plus, it can spot errors and bugs before they even have a chance to mess things up. Talk about a time-saver! 4. Testing, Testing… Is This Thing On? Testing has a reputation for being, well, a bit of a snooze fest. But AI is about to change that. Imagine AI generating all those test cases and frameworks automatically. It can even simulate weird edge cases that you might not think of until it’s too late. Plus, it’s great at spotting anomalies that might otherwise slip through the cracks. So, you can sleep better at night knowing your software is as close to bulletproof as it gets.

Deployment: The Final Countdown Deploying software is like launching a rocket. You hope everything goes off without a hitch, but there’s always that underlying fear of a crash landing. With AI in your corner, you can optimize deployment processes, predict server loads, and scale resources like a pro. It’s like having a ground control team that’s always one step ahead. 6. Keeping the Lights On: Maintenance and Operations Once your software is out in the wild, it’s all about keeping it running smoothly. AI doesn’t just monitor things—it predicts issues before they become problems. And when it’s time to clean up the code, AI can refactor it like a digital Marie Kondo, ensuring everything is neat, tidy, and sparking joy (or at least not causing headaches). 7. Documentation: The Necessary Evil Let’s be honest: nobody likes writing documentation. But it’s a necessary evil, like flossing or filing taxes. The good news? AI can take over here too. It generates and updates documentation automatically, keeping everything in sync with your code changes. So, no more scrambling to update docs after the fact. 8. The Customer is Always Right: Feedback and Support After your software is out there, you’ll start getting feedback—some good, some not-so-good, and some downright weird. AI can help here by analyzing user feedback and suggesting new features or improvements. Plus, AI-driven support bots can handle those routine questions, leaving your team free to tackle the big stuff. So, What’s the Big Picture? Generative AI isn’t just a fancy buzzword—it’s about to become the MVP of software development. It takes the grunt work off developers’ plates, speeds up the process, and helps create better software. Whether you’re in the tech industry or just curious about the future, it’s clear that AI is more than just a passing trend. It’s the future, and it’s here to make life a whole lot easier (and maybe even a bit more fun). Ready to embrace the AI revolution? Buckle up—because it’s going to be a game-changer!

This AI can take your vision (even if it’s a bit fuzzy) and turn it into a detailed blueprint that developers can actually work with. It’s like having a magical bridge between your big idea and the technical specs needed to make it a reality. 2. Design and Architecture: Where Creativity Meets Code Designing software is a bit like putting together a giant puzzle where the pieces keep changing shape. But AI? It’s like having a cheat sheet. It can suggest design patterns, propose architecture tweaks, and even whip up prototypes faster than you can say, “Is this thing on?” Suddenly, that daunting design phase looks a lot less scary. 3. Let’s Get Coding: Implementation Here’s where things get really interesting. Generative AI can actually help write the code. Yep, you heard that right. Tools like GitHub Copilot can generate code snippets just from your natural language prompts. It’s like having a super-smart assistant who never sleeps and always knows the right answer (and never complains about the coffee). Plus, it can spot errors and bugs before they even have a chance to mess things up. Talk about a time-saver! 4. Testing, Testing… Is This Thing On? Testing has a reputation for being, well, a bit of a snooze fest. But AI is about to change that. Imagine AI generating all those test cases and frameworks automatically. It can even simulate weird edge cases that you might not think of until it’s too late. Plus, it’s great at spotting anomalies that might otherwise slip through the cracks. So, you can sleep better at night knowing your software is as close to bulletproof as it gets.

Deployment: The Final Countdown Deploying software is like launching a rocket. You hope everything goes off without a hitch, but there’s always that underlying fear of a crash landing. With AI in your corner, you can optimize deployment processes, predict server loads, and scale resources like a pro. It’s like having a ground control team that’s always one step ahead. 6. Keeping the Lights On: Maintenance and Operations Once your software is out in the wild, it’s all about keeping it running smoothly. AI doesn’t just monitor things—it predicts issues before they become problems. And when it’s time to clean up the code, AI can refactor it like a digital Marie Kondo, ensuring everything is neat, tidy, and sparking joy (or at least not causing headaches). 7. Documentation: The Necessary Evil Let’s be honest: nobody likes writing documentation. But it’s a necessary evil, like flossing or filing taxes. The good news? AI can take over here too. It generates and updates documentation automatically, keeping everything in sync with your code changes. So, no more scrambling to update docs after the fact. 8. The Customer is Always Right: Feedback and Support After your software is out there, you’ll start getting feedback—some good, some not-so-good, and some downright weird. AI can help here by analyzing user feedback and suggesting new features or improvements. Plus, AI-driven support bots can handle those routine questions, leaving your team free to tackle the big stuff. So, What’s the Big Picture? Generative AI isn’t just a fancy buzzword—it’s about to become the MVP of software development. It takes the grunt work off developers’ plates, speeds up the process, and helps create better software. Whether you’re in the tech industry or just curious about the future, it’s clear that AI is more than just a passing trend. It’s the future, and it’s here to make life a whole lot easier (and maybe even a bit more fun). Ready to embrace the AI revolution? Buckle up—because it’s going to be a game-changer!

And there’s good reason for them to do so, as Forrester’s most recent Developer Survey indicates that 49% of developers are expecting to use or are already using a genAI assistant in the coding phase of software development. Forrester refers to genAI coding assistants as TuringBots, and we feel that genAI will become a pervasive force through all phases of software delivery, not just coding. But AI assistants are only the beginning of the genAI software development revolution. In our report, The Rise Of Application Generation Platforms, we explain how genAI will change the very definition of what software development is over the next 10 years. For the near term in 2025 we’ve kept our predictions real and as actionable as possible so that leaders can be prepared for the genAI reality that awaits them. In the area of software development for 2025, we predict that: At least one organization will try to replace 50% of its developers with AI and fail. In Forrester’s Developer Survey, 2024, developers indicated that they spend about 24% of their time coding; the remaining time is spent doing designs, writing tests, fixing bugs, and meeting with stakeholders. So even though we expect developer productivity to improve with the usage of genAI coding assistants, it’s easy to see that developers are doing a lot more than just writing code. That’s why leaders need to take a step back from the hype and consider what’s really going on at the developer’s desk to see how realistic the hype is. Even with copilots, developers are the human in the loop making sure that the coding suggestions are correct, that the code actually performs the intended operations, and that when bad suggestions come back (and they will), the developer is there to make sure they don’t get placed into production. Don’t let genAI reality bite you, and set expectations accordingly. Fifty percent of enterprises will abandon individual best-of-breed tools for DevOps platforms. Platforms continue to gain on best-of-breed tools. Platform engineering is all the rage with users, and selling platforms are all the rage with software tools vendors. In fact, you can look at any of the once-niche markets for software development tools and see that many of the vendors that were once best of breed have been merging and acquiring each other for years. And it’s not just continuous integration and continuous delivery; it’s application portfolio management all the way down the line to application performance management. No one is satisfied with a slice of the pie; they want the whole pie. Rust will enter the top 10 of the TIOBE Index while C and C++ drop in rank. This year, we believe (or perhaps, really hope) that organizations will finally factor risk into their choice of programming language. With talk of genAI, who has time for worrying about programming language selection? Yet security-minded software engineers realize that the selection of programming language is a relevant and core concern. Until recently, getting everyone on board with this concern has been difficult. That is, until the White House issued a memo on the importance of using memory-safe languages. Forrester views this as a necessary “kick in the pants” for software delivery leaders to wake up and get moving in the right direction.
