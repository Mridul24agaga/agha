  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, so let’s dive into what I think you’d find on a site called Foundertoolkit.org. Just from the name alone, it sounds like it’s geared towards entrepreneurs and those looking to start their own businesses. First off, I’d bet there’s a ton of resources for budding founders—like guides, templates, and maybe even some cool tools designed to help navigate the chaotic waters of startups. You know, the kind of stuff that would make your life a bit easier when you’re trying to figure out things like business plans, funding options, or marketing strategies. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’ve got articles or blog posts featuring success stories from other founders. You know the drill—people sharing their journeys, the ups and downs, and all those valuable lessons they learned along the way. It’s always nice to hear that you're not alone in this hustle, right? Then there’s probably a section dedicated to networking or community-building. I can imagine a forum or maybe even some virtual meetups where people can connect, share ideas, and maybe even find co-founders or partners. The whole “it takes a village” vibe seems spot on for a site like this. They might also have some recommendations for books, podcasts, or other resources that can help new entrepreneurs sharpen their skills. I mean, everyone’s always on the lookout for the next best thing that can give them an edge, right? Oh, and let’s not forget about the funding side of things. There’s a good chance they’ve got info on different types of investors, pitching tips, and maybe even some lists of grants or funds specifically for startups. It’s definitely a jungle out there when it comes to raising money, so any help is probably welcome! And if they’re really on top of their game, they could even have some tools for tracking progress or managing projects. Think along the lines of spreadsheets, checklists, or performance metrics to keep everything organized while you’re juggling a million things at once. I wouldn’t rule out some killer visual content either—infographics or maybe even video tutorials—because sometimes, seeing something in action beats reading a long article, right? Overall, I imagine Foundertoolkit.org is like that friend who always has your back when you’re trying to launch your dream. They probably serve up practical advice, real-world experiences, and all the support that can help you turn that idea into a successful venture. Cheers to that!",

Without tools, he is nothing, with tools he is all.” Tools lie at the heart of our business and personal lives; without them, life would be much harder. If you need to manage your business and personal finances, Quicken Classic Business & Personal offers both in one convenient package — see them separately, with the convenience of managing all your money in one place. For everything else, let’s take a look at the best small business tools you can use today in 10 different categories. Business tool and app categories Customer relationship management (CRM) Email marketing Social media management Project management Team communication and collaboration Marketing automation E-commerce Design and productivity Analytics and SEO tools Accounting and bookkeeping Let’s take a closer look at these tools and how you can use them to help you in your business endeavors! Tools for customer relationship management (CRM) Before the convenience of storing information and contacts on our computers, some of you may recall the Rolodex, a rotating card-filing device whose very job it was to manage the many numbers, names, and miscellaneous everyday information in a person’s life. A CRM is your business’s hub for managing customer relationships. It’s like having a supercharged version of that old Rolodex, not only storing contact info but also tracking interactions, sales progress, and customer satisfaction. Think of it as a tool that helps you nurture leads, close deals efficiently, and build lasting customer loyalty. Here are a few options: Salesforce Forbes magazine calls Salesforce the best solution “for large or scaling businesses and sales teams that need a very customizable solution.” Having been out there in the trenches for over 20 years, it has an amazing number of integrations that’ll make your business life better. HubSpot The new version of Hubspot is powerful — and has a great free version to try out — but the truly unique features are on the higher tiers so you do pay a premium. Great for mid-sized businesses, it’s in the running as one of the best solutions out there. Zoho For a unique and robust feature set for a lower price, Zoho could win you over with its customizable interface and fantastic tools. But, like HubSpot, it hides its best features, including AI, in the higher-priced tiers, where smaller businesses might hesitate to tread if they’re on a budget. Apptivo This tool received an “Outstanding! 4.5 Stars” from PCMag. Hailed as a solid example of an “all-around CRM solution that anticipates and meets the needs of SMBs,” its powerful features, affordable pricing, and intuitive interface make it a natural top choice in CRMs. Monday.com One of the newer players, it has a well-designed interface with customizable workflows, integrations, and dashboards. There are so many great ways to collaborate and communicate right in the app. Expect to hear great things from them in the future! Back to top ⬆️ Email marketing tools Imagine having a direct line to your customers’ inboxes and being able to offer a personal touch that traditional marketing can only sometimes achieve. Email marketing is targeted and tailored, allowing you to send specific messages to specific audiences. This is a focused approach that helps build stronger relationships, keeps your brand at the top of the customer’s mind, and often leads to higher engagement and conversions. It’s marketing, but with a twist that uses more intelligence and heart and a little less old-school bravado. Top email service providers: Kit (formerly ConvertKit) A powerhouse for creating newsletters and all your other email marketing needs, you can also sell subscriptions, automate multiple email marketing sequences, and monetize your content. Kit has long been among the elite of email marketing tools, with all the features you need to believe that this truly is one of the best. Features: Landing pages Email designer Integrations Mailchimp One of the first pieces of software that springs to mind when you think of email marketing, Mailchimp is easy to use and has a slick, user-friendly interface. One of the most full-featured of the list, you will no doubt find all the tools you need for your email marketing efforts. Features: Email automation Reporting & analytics Audience management Constant Contact This software has been around in the email marketing arena since 1995 and seems to cater mostly to a few very niche markets. It still has quite a few flashy features that will appeal to some. Features: SMS marketing Social media marketing Event marketing Mailerlite Free for up to 1000 email addresses, this no-frills solution may be what you’re looking for if you’re just starting out in email marketing. It may be one of the cheaper solutions, but its features help it keep up with the others, at least for a while. Features Website and blog builder Newsletters Email verifier EmailOctopus An affordable, intuitive service that offers great customer service and some great marketing tools. It truly is email marketing made easy. Offers some of the same features that the more expensive packages do. Features: Build beautiful emails Tailor your messages Connect and integrate with your favorite apps Back to top ⬆️ Social media management tools These tools can help your small business by making it easy to post content on various social media platforms and guiding people to engage with your posts. They save you time by automating boring and repetitive tasks, allowing you to focus on creating powerful and fulfilling connections with your customers. Popular platforms include: Sprout Social Sprout Social is great for most if not all, social media management tasks. It also offers excellent analytics and reporting options. Sprout Social is one of the most robust offerings we’ve included in our list. Hootsuite Hootsuite has been around a long time and has developed into a powerful suite of tools for social media management. It integrates with Canva and Grammarly and has stock photos available for your social media posts. Buffer Behind a simple user interface lies a powerhouse that helps boost your social media management potential. Allows you to create social media content using their content library or even their AI tools. Then you can analyze the data and create reports that will help your future campaigns. HubSpot Built alongside its powerful CRM, this suite of social management tools may be all you need to run and maintain your social media campaigns. Zoho Social Zoho Social’s real-time monitoring dashboard helps business owners discover what’s being said about their brands and products. Easily search and track a keyword, and respond when you need to. Zoho Social is ultimately a robust solution from a powerful suite of tools, including CRM and social media management. Back to top ⬆️ Project management software These software solutions help your business stay organized, meet deadlines, and keep everyone on the same page. They create project workflows by letting you assign tasks and track progress on those tasks. Most importantly, they make communication central to the project, which offers smoother and more efficient teamwork. Leading project management tools: Asana Consistently rated the best project management software with a very capable free version. Business owners who live and breathe productivity love Asana for its ease of use and powerful standard features. Trello A long-time favorite of web developers back in the day, Trello helps you plan and maintain massive websites and build new ones. It’s still a great option for any kind of small business in need of tracking productivity. Monday.com A new favorite among content teams, Monday.com has become a favorite for its powerful ability to trim massive workloads and create customizable boards to keep track of projects and tasks. Jira Jira is project management software developed by Atlassian for Agile teams and has been great for managing difficult workloads in many ways since 2002. The software uses Scrum and Kanban boards to visualize workflows and run Agile sprints. If you use the Agile system, this could be a great tool for you. Notion I mention Notion because it offers both free and paid versions, and it has a massive army of followers creating templates you can use for whatever type of productivity problem you’re confronted with. I’ve used it for years in my personal and business products, and it’s powerful enough to scale to even bigger businesses. One of the most unique uses of Notion is to create a second brain for yourself. Back to top ⬆️ Team communication and collaboration tools At this point, who hasn’t used Zoom for business conferencing? These types of tools improve your business by making communication seamless, whether your team is remote or in the office. They help with scheduling meetings with prospective clients and setting up projects. They bring everyone together in real time, making it easier to collaborate and make quick decisions. Popular tool options: Slack Slack is the workhorse of many organizations, helping to keep teams on the same page and communicating through text, with the option to add images and other files too. It’s also a great collaboration tool, allowing teams to share documents in chats with colleagues, or even to organize them for yourself. A massive number of integrations make it worth its weight in gold. Zoom Zoom is the G.O.A.T. for video communications. With its new workspace, you can arrange and set up meetings and even use AI to help users improve productivity and work together more effectively. Google Workspace This list wouldn’t be complete without Google Workspace. Emails, meetings, and document collaboration — it has everything a growing business needs to stay afloat, supplemented by the easy consonancy of the specific Google apps for your needs. Microsoft Teams This is Microsoft’s offering in the communications space, a suite of tools that also includes messaging, file sharing, and more. If you already use Microsoft for your other needs, it may be a good idea to stay within the ecosystem. Discord You may think Discord is only for YouTubers and gamers, but it’s actually a powerful suite of tools to help you stay connected to your team, collaborate, and share files. It has easy-to-navigate channels that you can create to organize discussions and topics, without overcrowding a space or losing track of information/details. Back to top ⬆️ Marketing automation tools Marketing automation tools are all-in-one solutions for repetitive tasks that run across more than one marketing function, such as email campaigns, social media posting, and customer segmentation. They help organizations save time, personalize outreach, and nurture leads more effectively. Popular marketing automation platforms: HubSpot HubSpot offers everything for your business, from CRM and social media management tools to operations management and list segmentation. This tool is expensive but powerful enough to run every part of your small-to-medium-sized company. ActiveCampaign It almost feels like everyone, from SaaS & tech companies to online creators and influencers, is using ActiveCampaign. It’s no surprise when you realize that this service offers businesses 900+ app integrations, like Instagram or even DocuSign and Google Sheets for the technical aspects of your business, improving an owner’s clientele reach and engagement across email marketing, content creation, and audience management, with the added utility of ActiveCampaign’s built-in AI for more help. Marketo Adobe Marketo Engage — also referred to as simply Marketo — is, according to them, the “world’s largest marketing automation platform.” It’s a suite of tools for creative businesses that will help in their marketing efforts. It’s backed by Adobe, but expect to pay a premium for their help. A powerful option with its profiles, audiences, and personalized content. Drip Drip is a niche email marketing platform for online sellers geared toward e-commerce. If you sell online, you should check out their pricing, features, usability, and support. GetResponse Not only does GetResponse help with email marketing and automation, but it takes care of SMS marketing and paid ads as well. It’s a powerful and robust platform for a reasonable price. Back to top ⬆️ E-commerce platforms The best e-commerce platforms share a few key features: they’re user-friendly, offer customization options, and provide secure payment processing. They also support seamless integration with other tools like marketing automation and inventory management, and they have strong customer support to help businesses succeed online. Top e-commerce platforms: Shopify Shopify is the leader in e-commerce. Easy to set up and run, you can open a store in minutes and start earning money. The interface is intuitive and easy to use, and the platform is powerful through its use of integrations. WooCommerce WooCommerce made a name for itself by helping businesses create online stores on their WordPress websites. A powerful plugin that can help bloggers, business owners, and service-based businesses add products and services to their existing websites. eBay eBay is a selling powerhouse that’s been around for more than 25 years, helping regular people and various businesses to sell online even without paying for a custom website. eBay boasts more than 1.3 billion visits per month, so there’s no shortage of customers looking to place their bids. Amazon Everyone knows Amazon, but what many people don’t know is that people and small businesses can sell their own products under the umbrella of Amazon. With more than 2 billion monthly visits, anyone can be a successful seller on the platform. Etsy Etsy is known for supporting creative businesses and offering items like T-shirts, stickers, posters, jewelry, clothing, and templates. If you sell creative products, you can leverage Etsy’s 500 million monthly visitors and turn them into customers. Back to top ⬆️ Design and productivity tools If you’re a graphic designer, you already know what tools like Photoshop and Illustrator can do for your business. But other businesses can harness the power of design tools too, helping them create a brand, documents, and graphic elements for their websites. Popular options: Adobe Suite Adobe Creative Cloud has long been known for software like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premier Pro. They also have an awesome selection of stock images online. Industry-standard software that works flawlessly and will always be cutting-edge. Expect to pay a premium for quality. Canva Canva is quickly becoming a tool in the arsenal of many businesses that can’t do without it. A free-to-use graphic design tool, you can build your brand, brochures, social media assets, and templates all online. Powerful and multi-faceted, if you want ease of use here as opposed to the learning curve of some of the more professional offerings at hand, this is the software for you. Google Drive & Workspace Since Google is so accessible and an incredible cross-functional tool, it’s quickly become the go-to for many businesses that want to keep all their documents and information in one place. Add to this a cloud drive to store every asset and document, and you have a powerful, complete suite of tools for your business. Microsoft Office If you know Microsoft, you might remember when it offered a unique user experience and software support with Clippy, the ever-eager paperclip. While he’s no longer a part of Microsoft Office, Microsoft has since adapted to offer users what they really need: a suite of powerful productivity tools that can help every aspect of your business, from creating PDFs to slide decks, and from email writing to database configuration. Microsoft can do it all for one low subscription price (and one less virtual paperclip’s critique of your choices as you create and design.) Back to top ⬆️ Analytics and SEO tools Analytics and SEO are powerful tools for staying ahead of your competition. They provide insights into customer behavior, website performance, and market trends, helping businesses make informed choices. Essential analytics and SEO tools: Google: Search Console, Analytics, Trends Google Search Console is used to improve website performance, giving your business insight into how Google sees your site in the search results. Google Analytics tracks website traffic and user behavior with precise data about your audience and content performance, as well as providing you with reports of your business needs. Google Trends can help you see which products and services are trending, helping you navigate the market in the future. SEMrush This is a paid tool that goes a bit deeper than Google. It provides helpful insights into keywords and your competition. SEMrush breaks everything down into data that can be used to make critical decisions for your company. Moz A similar tool to SEMrush, Moz can help you target your content marketing, digital PR, and local marketing efforts. AHREFs AHREFs is best for creating backlinks and, more specifically, for its backlink authority checker and backlink analysis. It also implements a keyword explorer tool and a site audit tool, giving rise to strategic insight into competitors. Back to top ⬆️ Accounting and bookkeeping software Accounting and bookkeeping tools keep track of where your money is going and where it’s coming from. These tools help you manage income, expenses, and taxes by automating the most difficult tasks, giving you more time to focus on running and growing your business. With everything in your business organized and accurate, you’ll have a clear picture of your finances and be ready for tax time without the usual headaches.

Microsoft can do it all for one low subscription price (and one less virtual paperclip’s critique of your choices as you create and design.)

While running a startup comes with a lot of challenges, winning the race is only possible when you choose to stay not just one but countless steps ahead (at least you can try to, like I do 😝). From cut-throat marketing competition to keeping up with uncertain business demands and dynamics, making your way out of the whirlpool of challenges is tough, I know. But it’s not impossible. Life presents problems continually. The more you solve, the more you learn. – Priya Gokhale To help you dilute the threats to your existence and keep it secure from derailing, investing in startup tools is the wisest decision you can make, I believe. However, no matter whether you are an entrepreneur just starting out or are in the early stages of your venture, discovering the best startup tools and choosing one can be an overwhelming task. But not to worry. After months of research and reviewing various options, I’m here to share my insights with you. I want to help you analyze what can work wonders for your growing business and what might not be the best fit. Considering the plethora of options available out there, I have put together a list of essential tools for startups so that you don’t have to put in much effort and waste your valuable time looking in different places. So, without further ado, let’s get started. Best business tools for startups list 2025 As I was looking for the best tools for startups, I found it better to categorize them into categories. So that your hunt for startup tools isn’t a big hustle and narrows down to better decide the right tool for your budding business. My reviewed list of 7 best categories for startups includes: 1. Productivity and Collaboration tools 2. Communication tools 3. Marketing and sales 4. Design & Development Tool 5. CRM & Launch Tools 6. Human resource 7. Analytics and Reporting Let’s get into the detail. Productivity and collaboration tools 📈 1. ProofHub ProofHub is an intuitive all-in-one project management and team collaboration tool to manage tasks effectively and streamline your business operations by bringing everyone on the same page. To thrive in the era of remote and distributed teams, effective management, collaboration, and teamwork are crucial for the success of any startup project. However, facilitating productivity and effective employee engagement can be challenging. To tell you the truth, it was the foundation of ProofHub, providing a suite of tools to help startups manage projects, collaborate on tasks, and communicate effectively. ProofHub eliminates even the slightest scope of misunderstanding by making everyone accountable for their tasks, as you can understand that juggling multiple things together can be a bit overwhelming at times. 🤹 Key features 👌 Effective task management to stay on top of work ⚡ ProofHub makes task management feel as light as a feather. With this project management software for startups, you can easily create & assign tasks and set deadlines all from one place without switching the tabs. You can even add task descriptions, set priorities, add custom roles, and create subtasks to further enhance the effectiveness at an even granular level. With ProofHub’s intuitive and flexible table view, you can effortlessly organize and manage tasks in bulk. Stay updated on the task progress when on the go ⚡ Limited resources and tight timelines are the reality of startups. And managing and prioritizing tasks efficiently to meet deadlines and achieve goals is a significant challenge. With four different task views to choose from – Table, Calendar, kanban board, and Gantt chart – you can keep track of the task progress, status & assignee of the task, dependencies, and more, even when you are on the go. Communicate and collaborate quickly ⚡ Collaboration is key for startups, and ProofHub excels in fostering teamwork. With features like discussions, file sharing, and real-time updates with built-in chat, team members can communicate effectively, share ideas, and collaborate seamlessly. This promotes synergy and ensures everyone stays aligned. Speed up communication by directly engaging with your team and clients, either one-on-one or in group settings. Centralized Information ⚡ Startups rely heavily on the quick and efficient flow of information and knowledge all across the organization. However, without a proper system in practice, important information may get lost or not reach the relevant team members, hindering productivity. With ProofHub, you can bid farewell to those hours wasted searching for files across multiple applications. Instead, you can centralize everything on ProofHub itself. So there is no need to spend hours searching for that one crucial file, you can focus on what matters—growing your startup and making meaningful progress. Effective time management to stay on track ⚡ Get a clear vision of where most of the team time is invested by adding estimated time to every task. You can even automatically track the time spent and compare it later on with the estimated time to know the reason and prospect behind the delay. Make a clear time analysis by creating timesheets and easily track the recurrence of any task from the calendar. Get real-time updates and notifications ⚡ Do you and your team struggle to be in sync with the progress of the project with so much on the table? Well, ProofHub gets you covered here with its robust notifications and alerts for task assignments, mentions, updates, and deadlines. This ensures every team member is aware of any modification or new information promptly, reducing even the slightest chance of delay and miscommunication. Pros 🟢 Seamless communication with built-in chat that doesn’t take much of your screen space. Track and manage projects from emails. No need to log in to the tool again and again. Cost-effective for startups due to unlimited users and project access at flat fee pricing. User-friendly interface to adapt with a minimal learning curve. Multiple views to have ultimate control and track of projects & tasks, teams, and clients. All-in-one platform with all features in one place to save you time. Online proofing to preview, review, proof, and share feedback on files and designs to get things done without any confusion. Cons 🔴 Not ideal for individuals and freelancers. Rapid notifications might overwhelm you a bit. Pricing 💸 After a 14-day free trial, you can get yourself registered for either of the two plans. The ‘Essential Plan’ starts at $45 per month and the ‘Ultimate Control’ plan at $89 per month. Both are offered at flat pricing and billed annually. Add as many users as you want and trust me. There is no hidden cost at all. 😉 But let me be honest here, you may get overwhelmed by the notifications. Effortlessly manage your teams and clients from one place. Start using ProofHub today! 2. Asana Asana, introduced in 2018, is recognized as a robust product management tool for startups, with more focus on task management. Startups can make the most of this easy-to-navigate interface to meet their goals and objectives. From providing multiple task views to tracking the status of tasks to gauging the productivity levels of teams, the tool promotes flexibility and eases your way to innovation and growth. However, Asana breaks the deal as you can not assign one task to multiple people. Does ProofHub address this concern? A big YES! 😌 ProofHub is aware that occasionally more than one person’s involvement is needed to complete a task. So, delegating tasks to multiple people is possible with ProofHub.

It has been observed for many years that 9 out of the 10 startups fail their ‘race to survival’ in the chaotic world of the corporate. Reason? Because many aspiring professionals underestimate the importance of staying updated with technology to keep their businesses running smoothly (Well, I’ve come across many of these kinds). Here are a few points I would like to mention to insist you get either of these tools to your rescue. ➡️ Tools bring efficiency to business operations by allowing you to focus on things that matter the most ➡️ You save more time and resources to invest in your business’s growth activities and thrive in the dynamic business environment ➡️ Focus on your business core by letting all the data-driven tedious work to tools ➡️ Bring collaboration to your doorsteps by bringing everyone on the same page ➡️ Enhance your productivity levels by organizing your workflow and introducing functionalities efficiently ➡️ Tracking the performance of marketing campaigns while attracting and engaging new customers is no more rolling a load on the cliff ➡️ Flexibility is not a concern with tools, regardless of how the company dynamics change How to choose the best startup tool for your business? To make your way through the wave of tools out there while bringing the best one along with you doesn’t require you to learn some new skills. All you need is to evaluate certain things before making a vow. How to choose the best startup tool for your business? 👉 Identify your needs – To keep an alignment between your goals and the technology, I will highly advise you to recognize your business requirements, goals, and expectations first and then compare them with the functionalities and features of the tool. It is a great way to avoid welcoming any unnecessary complexities, expenses, and challenges. 👉 User reviews and recommendations – No one could give you a better suggestion than the people who have been the users of the tools themselves. The insights and perspectives you can get from the review and recommendations section can be highly valuable for your decision-making process. So, make sure to be all ears to the unbiased opinion of firsthand experience holders. 👉 Test tools – Many tools (not all) provide free plans that you can make the most of. By testing the freemium features of the tools you can get hands-on experience and better assess the tools’ functionality, features, performance, and more. Otherwise, be sure to read the reviews of the products that don’t offer free plans to make an informed decision. 👉 Ease of use – Technology that introduces complications instead of bringing simplicity and user-friendliness to your business – trust me – is of no use even if it is a treasure filled with features. So, before adopting any tool for your startup, make sure to evaluate it on the ease it brings to hit the ground running. 👉 Consider budget – Budget can surely be a constraint for your shooting business, but not to worry. Many tools are available in the market that can serve you best in making a perfect balance between affordability and functionality. So, evaluating the tools that best fit your budget is necessary not to strain your finances but to fix the drip. 👉 Check scalability – Investing in a product that grows alongside your startup is beneficial to save yourself from incurring significant costs. Getting yourself a tool that needs multiple and rapid upgrades or replacements as you scale is a surefire way to get sucked into a spiral of costs. But the right tool will promise you long-term value. Scale your startup with ProofHub With over 25 years of experience in the industry, I have seen many businesses come and go.

While running a startup comes with a lot of challenges, winning the race is only possible when you choose to stay not just one but countless steps ahead (at least you can try to, like I do 😝). From cut-throat marketing competition to keeping up with uncertain business demands and dynamics, making your way out of the whirlpool of challenges is tough, I know. But it’s not impossible. Life presents problems continually. The more you solve, the more you learn. – Priya Gokhale To help you dilute the threats to your existence and keep it secure from derailing, investing in startup tools is the wisest decision you can make, I believe. However, no matter whether you are an entrepreneur just starting out or are in the early stages of your venture, discovering the best startup tools and choosing one can be an overwhelming task. But not to worry. After months of research and reviewing various options, I’m here to share my insights with you. I want to help you analyze what can work wonders for your growing business and what might not be the best fit. Considering the plethora of options available out there, I have put together a list of essential tools for startups so that you don’t have to put in much effort and waste your valuable time looking in different places. So, without further ado, let’s get started. Best business tools for startups list 2025 As I was looking for the best tools for startups, I found it better to categorize them into categories. So that your hunt for startup tools isn’t a big hustle and narrows down to better decide the right tool for your budding business. My reviewed list of 7 best categories for startups includes: 1. Productivity and Collaboration tools 2. Communication tools 3. Marketing and sales 4. Design & Development Tool 5. CRM & Launch Tools 6. Human resource 7. Analytics and Reporting Let’s get into the detail. Productivity and collaboration tools 📈 1. ProofHub ProofHub is an intuitive all-in-one project management and team collaboration tool to manage tasks effectively and streamline your business operations by bringing everyone on the same page. To thrive in the era of remote and distributed teams, effective management, collaboration, and teamwork are crucial for the success of any startup project. However, facilitating productivity and effective employee engagement can be challenging. To tell you the truth, it was the foundation of ProofHub, providing a suite of tools to help startups manage projects, collaborate on tasks, and communicate effectively. ProofHub eliminates even the slightest scope of misunderstanding by making everyone accountable for their tasks, as you can understand that juggling multiple things together can be a bit overwhelming at times. 🤹 Key features 👌 Effective task management to stay on top of work ⚡ ProofHub makes task management feel as light as a feather. With this project management software for startups, you can easily create & assign tasks and set deadlines all from one place without switching the tabs. You can even add task descriptions, set priorities, add custom roles, and create subtasks to further enhance the effectiveness at an even granular level. With ProofHub’s intuitive and flexible table view, you can effortlessly organize and manage tasks in bulk. Stay updated on the task progress when on the go ⚡ Limited resources and tight timelines are the reality of startups. And managing and prioritizing tasks efficiently to meet deadlines and achieve goals is a significant challenge. With four different task views to choose from – Table, Calendar, kanban board, and Gantt chart – you can keep track of the task progress, status & assignee of the task, dependencies, and more, even when you are on the go. Communicate and collaborate quickly ⚡ Collaboration is key for startups, and ProofHub excels in fostering teamwork. With features like discussions, file sharing, and real-time updates with built-in chat, team members can communicate effectively, share ideas, and collaborate seamlessly. This promotes synergy and ensures everyone stays aligned. Speed up communication by directly engaging with your team and clients, either one-on-one or in group settings. Centralized Information ⚡ Startups rely heavily on the quick and efficient flow of information and knowledge all across the organization. However, without a proper system in practice, important information may get lost or not reach the relevant team members, hindering productivity. With ProofHub, you can bid farewell to those hours wasted searching for files across multiple applications. Instead, you can centralize everything on ProofHub itself. So there is no need to spend hours searching for that one crucial file, you can focus on what matters—growing your startup and making meaningful progress. Effective time management to stay on track ⚡ Get a clear vision of where most of the team time is invested by adding estimated time to every task. You can even automatically track the time spent and compare it later on with the estimated time to know the reason and prospect behind the delay. Make a clear time analysis by creating timesheets and easily track the recurrence of any task from the calendar. Get real-time updates and notifications ⚡ Do you and your team struggle to be in sync with the progress of the project with so much on the table? Well, ProofHub gets you covered here with its robust notifications and alerts for task assignments, mentions, updates, and deadlines. This ensures every team member is aware of any modification or new information promptly, reducing even the slightest chance of delay and miscommunication. Pros 🟢 Seamless communication with built-in chat that doesn’t take much of your screen space. Track and manage projects from emails. No need to log in to the tool again and again. Cost-effective for startups due to unlimited users and project access at flat fee pricing. User-friendly interface to adapt with a minimal learning curve. Multiple views to have ultimate control and track of projects & tasks, teams, and clients. All-in-one platform with all features in one place to save you time. Online proofing to preview, review, proof, and share feedback on files and designs to get things done without any confusion. Cons 🔴 Not ideal for individuals and freelancers. Rapid notifications might overwhelm you a bit. Pricing 💸 After a 14-day free trial, you can get yourself registered for either of the two plans. The ‘Essential Plan’ starts at $45 per month and the ‘Ultimate Control’ plan at $89 per month. Both are offered at flat pricing and billed annually. Add as many users as you want and trust me. There is no hidden cost at all. 😉 But let me be honest here, you may get overwhelmed by the notifications. Effortlessly manage your teams and clients from one place. Start using ProofHub today! 2. Asana Asana, introduced in 2018, is recognized as a robust product management tool for startups, with more focus on task management. Startups can make the most of this easy-to-navigate interface to meet their goals and objectives. From providing multiple task views to tracking the status of tasks to gauging the productivity levels of teams, the tool promotes flexibility and eases your way to innovation and growth. However, Asana breaks the deal as you can not assign one task to multiple people. Does ProofHub address this concern? A big YES! 😌 ProofHub is aware that occasionally more than one person’s involvement is needed to complete a task. So, delegating tasks to multiple people is possible with ProofHub. Key features 👌 Real-time reporting to get in-depth work insights Automate recurring tasks to save time 100+ third-party integrations to create a centralized space Extraordinary admin control Workflow builder and tracker Pros 🟢 Effective task management to prioritize task progression with ease. Affordable project management software for teams on a tight budget. Facilitates coordination between team members Cons 🔴 Pricing can become expensive for large teams due to per-user fees Complex to understand for beginners specifically No multiple assignees can be subscribed for a single task Pricing 💸 You can go for this if you are a team of 15 or below, as it would cost you nothing. However, the cost falls on the more expensive side with $6.92 per user per month (Premium) and $15.74 per user per month (Business) for businesses running at large scale. Why I picked Asana 🤔 Asana made its spot in my list of startup tools for startups due to its tremendous task management capability and reporting mechanism. 3. Bonsai Bonsai is an all-in-one business management platform tailored specifically for agencies and small businesses. Designed to meet the varying needs of growing teams and businesses that require a stable and scalable solution, Bonsai enables startups to streamline workflows, project management, client interactions, and financial activities under one roof.

Trello Next on the list of best startup tools is Trello, which has served multiple businesses all around considering its existence for more than two decades. The platform is known for its spectacular task management in Kanban style. Using drag-and-drop Kanban boards, you can organize tasks with ease and keep an eye on the progress of each work. Its simplicity makes it the best platform out there for small businesses. The platform, however, lacks the task view variation in terms of analyzing the work progress. Does ProofHub offer multiple views? Yes, ProofHub allows multiple views like Board, Calendar, Gantt, and Table to monitor the stages of your workflow. Key features 👌 Categorized Trello templates to collaborate in no time. Visually appealing boards to see the project progress. Multiple app integrations with Trello to power up the game. Pros 🟢 An amazing visual interface that is easy to use. Workflow automation to save you time. Customized card and board buttons to ease the work process. Cons 🔴 No designated Notepad section to jot down ideas, notes, and important points. More power-ups are required for more integrations. No Gantt chart view is available. Pricing 💸 Getting the free plan of Trello for personal use is highly advisable, while for 1000 Workspace commands and more, opting for advanced pricing plans is beneficial. Why I picked Trello 🤔 Trello’s task management expertise in its Kanban view allows startups to define priorities and check progress. 5. ONLYOFFICE DocSpace ONLYOFFICE DocSpace is an open-source collaborative platform that is designed to make document collaboration easier and more controllable by allowing users to create and co-edit office files in customizable rooms. The platform comes with a powerful online office suite, ONLYOFFICE Docs, which provides professional tools for real-time document editing, such as audio and video calls via the Jitsi and Zoom plugins, two co-editing modes, version history, track changes mode, and comments. DocSpace is compatible with multiple file formats, including text documents, digital forms, spreadsheets, presentations, e-books, PDFs, and multimedia files. In ONLYOFFICE DocSpace, users collaborate in rooms where different access permissions are given to streamline the collaboration process.

Collaboration rooms for traditional real-time co-authoring and custom rooms with more access permissions for specific tasks, like form filling. System of flexible access permissions for more secure document collaboration. ChatGPT integration, which allows users to generate and analyze texts with ease, summarise key points, translate to other languages and find synonyms. Pros Local and cloud-based deployment. Advanced security tools, such as the AES-256 encryption algorithm, HTTPS, JWT, etc. Branding options and customization. Access from desktop and mobile apps. Unlimited number of users in rooms even in the free tariff plan. Cons Some security features are only available in paid tariff plans. The self-hosted version of DocSpace only runs on Linux servers. Pricing The cloud-based version of DocSpace has a free tariff plan, Startup, which implies up to 12 rooms, 2 GB of disc space, and an unlimited number of users. The Business tariff plan starts at $20 per admin/power user and its total price depends on the required number of admins and power users. The self-hosted DocSpace offers a free community edition and a scalable enterprise version. The cost of the Enterprise Edition starts from $6550 as a one-time payment for 100 simultaneous connections. Why I picked ONLYOFFICE DocSpace ONLYOFFICE DocSpace deserves its spot on my list due to its outstanding document collaboration capabilities, which can help startups to boost their productivity while interacting with third parties. Communication tools 💬 6. Slack With massive popularity across businesses of all sizes, Slack is a must-to-have business messaging tool for startups. Despite being well-known for setting the table to have smooth communication, sharing files, documents, and designs from your device is possible too. With customization to offer, Slack allows you to mute channels as well as mute notifications for a specific set of hours. No matter whether in the office or remotely, Slack lets you reach out to team members in no minutes. 🔃 Key features Real-time collaboration and sharing with team members. Thread conversations to keep everyone in the loop. Encrypted data ensure data protection. Pros 🟢 Cater to the needs of teams of any size. Highly customization and secured platform.

Pricing 💸 With the limited features to offer in its free plan, it Pro and Business+ plan start at the cost of USD 6/month to USD 12.50/month respectively. Why I picked Slack 🤔 Slack fosters a culture of teamwork by centralizing conversations, reducing email dependency, and quick information sharing. The platform is truly a great option to be in the team’s message section in no time. But is it truly the great option out there? 7. Microsoft Teams Another solid option in the list of startup tools for team communication is Microsoft Teams. The startup tool is highly effective for businesses at the initial stages of their career due to seamless collaboration features. It is a great option I believe that promotes real-time communication with its instant messaging, and audio/video calls features – regardless of the geographical location. With solid security to offer, Microsoft Team offers over 700 third-party app integrations. Key features 👌 Call recording to share late on with non-attendees. Blur, choose or create your own virtual backgrounds. Suggested replies to mindless routine texts in one click. Pros 🟢 Multiple chat addition support from available apps. Setting up team meetings is not difficult. Screen sharing during meetings to collaborate better. Cons 🔴 Awkward and unrealistic visuals with visual backgrounds. Adding outside users to the meeting is challenging. Pricing 💸 Teams offer a free plan with up to 5 GB of cloud storage. However, for 10 GB of cloud storage, you just need to pay a mere price of $4 per user/month. Why I picked Microsoft Teams 🤔 With the numerous productivity tools to accelerate growth, Microsoft Teams provides free access to a plethora of development tools like Open AI, Bubble, LinkedIn, and more. 8. Zoom The user-friendly interface and robust features of the Zoom application made it surefire during the pandemic. It is the most popular video conferencing application even now. Apart from this you also get a screen-sharing option to collaborate better with your clients, investors, and team members worldwide. Designed to suit the needs of various individuals, Zoom facilitates both internal and external communication allowing you to create a professional atmosphere virtually.

Why I picked Zoom 🤔 From my experience, I personally would recommend startups with a scattered workforce to choose Zoom due to its user-friendly video conferencing, screen sharing, recording features, and more. And you have nothing to pay. 🤑 Marketing and Sales tools 🏅 9. Hootsuite Boasting the trust of many startups, Hootsuite is a popular social media marketing tool that enables startup teams to manage various social media networks from a single interface.

The cost varies at $99 per month, $249 per month, respectively. Why I picked this Hootsuite 🤔 Hootsuite’s free plan, according to my observations, is great for startups starting to pave their path on social media. 10. Mailchimp If you are considering emails a thing of the past, then let me tell you that you are missing a great deal of business for you right there. It is a critical marketing strategy to adopt initially and Mailchimp is a well-known name in the email marketing sphere. 📧 Mailchimp makes creating email campaigns a breeze for startups by providing templates, subscriber management, campaign options, and more.

The three plans are Essentials, Standard, and Premium at $34.31/per month, $44.95 per month, and $136.05 per month respectively. Why I picked Mailchimp 🤔 To be honest, I was in doubt to include Mailchimp on the list or not. 🤷 Despite me being personally in favor of project management tools to collaborate, Mailchimp is a great option for businesses relying on emails. The platform offers splendid templates, AI-assisted suggestions and more making this a robust option to run effective email marketing campaigns. 11.

Why I picked Canva 🤔 If your startup relies heavily on visual content creation, then look no further. Canva is the next important thing in my perspective that should be a part of your business.

It has been observed for many years that 9 out of the 10 startups fail their ‘race to survival’ in the chaotic world of the corporate. Reason? Because many aspiring professionals underestimate the importance of staying updated with technology to keep their businesses running smoothly (Well, I’ve come across many of these kinds). Here are a few points I would like to mention to insist you get either of these tools to your rescue. ➡️ Tools bring efficiency to business operations by allowing you to focus on things that matter the most ➡️ You save more time and resources to invest in your business’s growth activities and thrive in the dynamic business environment ➡️ Focus on your business core by letting all the data-driven tedious work to tools ➡️ Bring collaboration to your doorsteps by bringing everyone on the same page ➡️ Enhance your productivity levels by organizing your workflow and introducing functionalities efficiently ➡️ Tracking the performance of marketing campaigns while attracting and engaging new customers is no more rolling a load on the cliff ➡️ Flexibility is not a concern with tools, regardless of how the company dynamics change How to choose the best startup tool for your business? To make your way through the wave of tools out there while bringing the best one along with you doesn’t require you to learn some new skills. All you need is to evaluate certain things before making a vow. How to choose the best startup tool for your business? 👉 Identify your needs – To keep an alignment between your goals and the technology, I will highly advise you to recognize your business requirements, goals, and expectations first and then compare them with the functionalities and features of the tool. It is a great way to avoid welcoming any unnecessary complexities, expenses, and challenges. 👉 User reviews and recommendations – No one could give you a better suggestion than the people who have been the users of the tools themselves. The insights and perspectives you can get from the review and recommendations section can be highly valuable for your decision-making process. So, make sure to be all ears to the unbiased opinion of firsthand experience holders. 👉 Test tools – Many tools (not all) provide free plans that you can make the most of. By testing the freemium features of the tools you can get hands-on experience and better assess the tools’ functionality, features, performance, and more. Otherwise, be sure to read the reviews of the products that don’t offer free plans to make an informed decision. 👉 Ease of use – Technology that introduces complications instead of bringing simplicity and user-friendliness to your business – trust me – is of no use even if it is a treasure filled with features. So, before adopting any tool for your startup, make sure to evaluate it on the ease it brings to hit the ground running. 👉 Consider budget – Budget can surely be a constraint for your shooting business, but not to worry. Many tools are available in the market that can serve you best in making a perfect balance between affordability and functionality. So, evaluating the tools that best fit your budget is necessary not to strain your finances but to fix the drip. 👉 Check scalability – Investing in a product that grows alongside your startup is beneficial to save yourself from incurring significant costs. Getting yourself a tool that needs multiple and rapid upgrades or replacements as you scale is a surefire way to get sucked into a spiral of costs. But the right tool will promise you long-term value. Scale your startup with ProofHub With over 25 years of experience in the industry, I have seen many businesses come and go.

Social Media Management Most entrepreneurs will tell you that without the right tools, managing several social media accounts turns into a juggling act. Thatâs why you need HootSuite, a social media management system for brand guidance and growth. With Hootsuite, you can: WordPress blogs The basic service is free, but youâll only be able to schedule one post at a time and youâre limited to three social media profiles.
