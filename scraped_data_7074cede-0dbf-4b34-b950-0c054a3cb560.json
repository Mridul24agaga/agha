  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, let‚Äôs dive into this URL - https://playpickups.app/. From the look of the name, \"Play Pickups,\" it‚Äôs got that vibe of being something related to games or interactive fun. I mean, \"play\" is right there in the title, and when you throw in \"pickups,\" you could be talking about a couple of things. Could it be a gaming platform where you pick up new games to play, or maybe some cool mechanics where you grab or collect items? I could see it being a space where players can engage with each other, maybe swapping games or even collectibles. It might have a social aspect where you connect with friends, discuss strategies, and maybe even engage in tournaments or challenges. The term \"pickups\" could also hint at something about grabbing in-game items or rewards, which all adds to that competitive edge gamers love. If it‚Äôs an app, it probably has a sleek interface and something that keeps users engaged‚Äîlike daily challenges, quick play options, or even a leaderboard. The app might cater to casual gamers looking for a quick session or hardcore gamers who want to strategize and level up. And let‚Äôs not forget that modern apps are all about community, so I can imagine some chat features, forums, or even a way to stream gameplay right from the app. Maybe it‚Äôs leaning into the whole \"mobile gaming\" scene too, considering the trend of gaming on the go. It could be a way to get into games without needing a whole console setup. And you know, with the rise of esports, it might even play into that world, allowing players to connect for friendly competitions or just to find others to play with. Overall, I'm guessing Play Pickups is a chill spot for gamers to connect, collect, and play, all while keeping that competitive spirit alive. It sounds like a fun place to discover new games, meet new people, and have some good old-fashioned fun. So grab a drink and check it out‚Äîwho knows what treasures you might find in there!",

hope you guys are enjoying the new year uh sorry I didn't get this video out on New Year's Day but I wanted to add a couple more games to it make it extra special for you guys but I'm really looking forward to 2025 very excited to show you guys what's in this video I think you guys are getting a little spoiled we got a pickups video on Jason's Channel this weekend and now I'm throwing you guys some more on mine but anyways guys hope you enjoy let's check it out here is Shinobi NR hopefully I pronounced that right uh this is a strictly limited release this game obviously I think it's related to Shinobi it should be because of the name but who knows uh but this game takes place in feudal Japan and I love the 8-Bit style this game uses it reminds me of Legend of KAG arcage which a lot of us call It in America uh definitely reminds me of the backgrounds of that game you play as a ninja who is a Demon Slayer and you have quite a few moves at Your Arsenal you got your sword you got your shukan you got a chain you have good old shotgun which saved me out of some crazy situations with bosses and you got a Dodge roll that's very helpful to get out of a crazy situations what's stood out to me the most in this game were the bosses you fight like when you fight the first boss you think you you're done with the first level but the level keeps going on it kind of tricks you with the result screen but um I fought four bosses before the um first level was over with and um I was hooked because as I got through the to the last bosses they did get a bit harder and I got killed killed but um it was my fault and it was just a lot of fun it made me want to go back and try again so definitely I think this this game like on the first level will show what it's going to bring to you and I think a lot of people will be happy with that I wasn't really interested in the game story as of right now I just interested in the game play but I might look into it a little bit later hopefully if it's good or not but with these type of games I don't think really people really care unless they're like showing cinematics like something like ninja giden but anyways guys um if you like retro games definitely keep this one one on your list IG arcade classic collection so uh I kind of ignored this game when this collection of games when it first came out until I saw that one game was on this list and this is a game that Jason has talked about on his channel before and that is demon front so if you play games like um Metal Slug uh demon front is pretty much I don't want to say it's a ripoff of metal slug but it's defin definitely like what people would call like uh inspired by it another game I was interested on this collection was martial arts Masters uh this is a Sprite base a fighting game that looks like it just kind of got overshadowed uh during this time in the arcades but um all these games look pretty good and I definitely thought that this was worth having you know in the collection of beat them UPS I wish it was on PS4 but I'm fine with it being on the switch as well eight games in this collection and they all look good so definitely worth picking this one up guys here's unicorn Overlord this is a strategy RPG uh created by vanillaware and you guys know how we feel about vanillaware games I think I have most of their yeah I have all their games that was released as physical but um this is their latest and this came out I believe earlier this year and I'm just now kind of getting into it well I say kind of is because I just got it out of a massive RPG which I shouldn't say it's massive but I beat ease 10 so after playing RPG like that are just putting quite quite a few hours into it I put like 40 hours into it you need a little break from RPGs but I did start this one just to see if I'd be interested in it and I got to admit I was hooked uh from the beginning when you're try to help the queen escape the castle uh and you're going through the battles I thought it was great how the battles play out so this is definitely the next RPG I'm going to be playing and I think um if you haven't played this game yet guys I think you should keep it on your radar but just wanted to show it on the list it's another RPG I'm going to get into a little bit later press yourself Crush does this shoot you witness the Royal me and my friend Ron went to a local GameStop recently which I haven't been to in a while and I found this game faith on Holy Trinity um this I believe was public by yeah fan gamer and this is like a 8 bit survival horror game that consists of three chapters uh one Faith uh chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 now as you can see this is a pixelated 8bit game and it kind of reminds me of like old school games like like even though it doesn't look the same but like something like the last half of Darkness but um it looks like it might be pretty scary so um RNG gamer really liked it so uh because of him I'm going to check it out but obviously going to check it out cuz I own it but uh yeah if you guys have played this game um let me know uh what you think about it and I know about the issue where it's um they say like the game needs to be patched because there's some part in the game they didn't fix before they made it physical uh that makes the game like unplayable but um as long as say it's patched I'm fine with this physical copy I hear they're going to make more physical copies where you know the patch is already implemented but at this point I don't really care I just already got the game I got a couple extras with it so I'm happy here's raging bites um this game took me by surprise I had no idea this game existed and um when I found out it got a physical release I decided to give it a try uh what I was told is it's a mix of survival horror with a little bit of RPG element so it'll it'll it kind of reminded me when I was playing it a little bit of Resident Evil Guiden but just like more polished the game definitely starts out strong but there was a little bit too much dialogue for me I just want to kind of get into the game play but uh when you get to the first chapter uh it starts off like The Walking Dead the first episode of The Walking Dead where Rick W wakes up in the hospital the same thing happens to you but this game takes place in the 1970s and um when you wake up you you're trying to find out what's going on there's zombies already in the hospital it's pretty insane but it really pulled me in and it has some jump scares I guess that's like the the horror part I would say of the game uh nothing really too scary that we like oh my God I'm scared to go around this corner but it's more like jump scares in this game now as you play through the game you'll meet other characters that are join you I think you could have up to four people in your party you'll collect items like guns you know baseball bats axes and things like that to kind of help you get through the game and survive you're trying to get out of the city at least from the part I'm at I'm about halfway through the game I would say like I think I'm halfway through and it really just pulls you in I love the fact this game has that Survivor horror feeling to it you know it you have the sense of unnerving this you know like you don't know what's going to happen next and I I just like that type of stuff so I'm glad they were able to Implement that into a like a somewhat RPG but uh definitely I think a game that people should look at here's guilt now this game actually I believe came out quite a few years ago like I think believe back in 201920 but it was a stadia exclusive if you guys remember that system uh thank goodness the developers decide to expand the game because I don't think a lot of people would know about it if it just stayed on the stadia and of course now has a fiscal release now you play as a young girl named Sally who's looking for a missing cousin Emily now Emily I Believe been missing for a month when the game starts and prettyy much the game starts with you putting up posters letting everybody know that she's missing but unfortunately during the search your character gets bullied by neighborhood kids ends up getting lost and um you're trying to find your way back home when you go to the train station that you find you see this weird conductor and the conductor says hey you got to buy this ticket to go home you buy the ticket and all of a sudden you go to this jacked up looking City that's just it's like a mirror image of I believe where um Sally goes to school at but uh it's just it's just pretty twisted and I F found the game to be pretty Eerie as I played through it it really gave me an unnerving feeling about what was around the corner because you're playing as a child in this game she's only 11 years old and she's going through a school like at night time and other parts of the city it's just like it just looks very eerie and the monsters in this game are just like terrifying looking you know I just feel like I just feel bad for but mostly in the beginning of the game you'll be kind of like playing stealth like trying to hide from your enemies until you figure out how to take them out or if you need to take them out some some enemies you could just walk past some enemies are patrolling so you to be very careful and some enemies are just like they pretty much stalk you so you have to be quiet when you can and run if you have to now I wanted to mention also that I have played this game on live streams and those videos are up so if you want to check those videos out and see how it is you know definitely give those a watch I might actually start doing more live streams but anyways going back into the game I like how it gives you that sense of what's around the corner it just feels like I know I say this term a lot it just feels unnerving just like a survival horror game should be oh also I did want to mention that the has multiple endings so depending on how you play the game you'll get a different ending there's a a good ending a bad ending and a really a selfish ending I would say so anyways guys definitely check out guilt let me know what you think about it hey Sally you still looking for your cousin what' you do to her Sally we know you're here you can't hide from us oh God [Music] me there's still a chance for you to make things right Sally you must find Emily she is the key to ending this nightmare [Music] [Music] Atari 50th the anniversary celebr ation Expanded Edition um Jason was had been telling me to get this for a while and um you know I wasn't really a big Atari guy you know back in the day obviously but um I do like some of the games they put out and I was really interested in seeing more of the history with them so one of the main reasons I got this because of the interviews of the developers talking about the games and what they did to get them released I love little things like that because it reminds me of the sixth and even the fifth generation um of games where you know stuff like that was included like sometimes on the game or as a demo disc you know like interviews and things like that so and also too I'm looking more forward to the 7800 games that's more of my style when it comes to Atari so hope hoping I see something out like on there but either way I think this collection worth to have just for the novelty of you know the history of gaming the King of Fighters 94 the first game in the series and a spin-off of fatal Fury now I picked this game up more as a novelty you know a lot of people that have played the King of Fighters game they probably won't go back to 94 or even 95 but this was just more of a novelty pickup you know see where the game came from you know where it route started and you know I do like this game but it's just hard to go back to but I just wanted to kind of get it as a novelty to the series so I have them all um you can't even edit teams in this game so that's how crazy it is but it does have one of the coolest Final Bosses in the series for G and um yeah that's pretty much all I have to say about it you know you'll probably like only play this game if it's in a compilation of the King of Fighters series but uh play a game Solo or it's just probably not for most fighting fans these days all right so here is a shoot them up collection called irm collection now this consists of horizontal and vertical shoot them UPS now just to let you all know this collection for each game they usually come with a variation game what I mean by that is like their console counterparts except for image Fight 2 I believe but anyways uh going to the first game in this Collection image fight part one I didn't like this game when I played it a few months ago I was getting tore up on the first level and then when I played it again recently I figured out you know some what the mechanic of the game pretty much is and that is you got to speed up and slow down at certain points so you have a a button you push to kind of like make the the craft go faster and slower and that's going to help you out on a lot of parts in this game you're going to have to like vigorously use it at all times depending on the situation now before I knew that with this game you know I couldn't get past the first few seconds but now uh I gotten better is at the game and I got to the boss and I beat the boss but the second level I kind of messed up on it's one of those games you have to really pay attention to at all times you can't stray you got to remember what to do in certain situations if you don't react fast enough it's over for you image Fight 2 I feel like like it's more of the same now this was a console only game so what they did is they added story to it and that was already a plus with me now originally I believe game was only in Japanese but now it's been translated in English so you can understand the story if you're interested in that I like the space setting in this game you know when like when I first started playing Sho notes back in the day uh most of the games I played like had a space level in it so that just brings that Nostalgia for me I felt this game was more intense than the first game so make sure you get those powerups ASAP because this game as you can see you got to be shooting and moving at all times now finally we have uh X multiply now this one I remember back in the day I was going to actually buy this game on the Playstation system it was very expensive and I had a chance to get a good deal and thankfully I didn't pull the trigger on it because that version of the game is one of the worst versions out there the game reminds me a lot of gradius just like I feel like it's more faster Pace at least more faster action on screen you get these snake armed powerups that help you deflect enemy attacks during the game which I thought was pretty unique but where this game really took off for me is when I got this laser power up I feel like this is the best weapon in the game even though it's like one of the first two weapons in my opinion um definitely made the game a lot more like interesting for me so with that said I believe strictly limited is putting this on a physical for everybody to collect so hopefully that's out by now if not hopefully it'll be out soon but the digital is available right now I bought a box from GG retro box recently and it came with Marvel versus Capcom 3 now if you haven't seen that cover before that is the special edition 10 case uh that came with like the two extra characters at time and um yeah this is the vanilla version of the game before we got ultimate still a great version of the game to play um they did change a lot in the newer version but I think this one's still worth going after so um if you like three on three chaotic action you know hey try this one out here's the last hope so initially I played this game years ago and I didn't really care for it because I didn't really like too many horizontal Shooters like rtip but over time I've come to like the game and I could really appreciate it you know if you if you're into horizontal Shooters it's definitely something that's up there I don't I won't say it's as hard as our type it may be be even harder than that game um but still uh sh UPS like these are pretty unique I would say and I wasn't really used to like you know well I I I didn't really like like like where shooting where you get killed with one hit or whatever like that you know then you have to start over at a checkpoint I like when you can respawn at the same point but this one I feel like it's really self-rewarding uh once you get used to it and get good at it so uh definitely keep your eyes out on this one it's pretty old now but definitely something worth your [Music] while here's forgotten Realms demon Stone now this game did come out to America which I own that version I bought that when it first came out but I love the European versions cover art I think this is a much better cover art than we got and I think if we used they had used this cover the game would have sold a lot better but um this game is a hacking slash it's very similar to if you had played games like you played like Lord of the Rings The Two Towers back in the day from the same developers that did that game plays exactly the same but this one's more refined I would say I want to go over the story too much because uh I'll be here all night like going through it man it really is a story that that'll pull you into the lore of Dungeons and Dragons now one of the things that stands out is the voice acting I mean they went all out on it uh Patrick Stewart is in here even the late Michael Clark Duncan is in here as a one of the characters but um going into game play once you get your characters you can switch between them at any times and you have to switch to them at at certain parts of the game to get through certain areas so you're always fighting together you can switch between them which is great I wish the game would have had like a two two player mode but I understand why it wasn't put into it like a the Lord of the Rings game The Two Towers game that actually has a two-player mode no it does not now that I'm thinking about it one player mode but anyways guys uh definitely a game you want to add on your radar and don't worry about it being expensive the game is like less than like 10 bucks maybe just slightly over but either way make sure you add this game to your collection and shout out to Jason for picking this up for me you know when he was in Norway he knew I was looking for this and he grabbed it for me so good looking out brother appreciate you but yeah guys leave you with that pick this game up if you're a PS2 and also it's on the Xbox as well if you want to play it on the Xbox instead not sure about backwards compatibility but uh yeah Xbox or PS2 or even PC pick this one up in Bruno's name you will not cross this door die I got another Mario gaming watch my buddy Ron tried to fix this and he didn't get it to where he wanted it to be but I think it works well enough and this shell is way better than one I have so very nostalgic for this game out of the gaming Watch series I recently acquired a new Nintendo 3DS XL um I always wanted one of these but they seem very limited at the time they came out so never really got one and I think there's only maybe a handful of exclusive games that really use the feature of the system but still I wanted the best version of the 3DS and I believe this is it uh but yeah I haven't really looked up the games that are exclusive to it so maybe you guys can let me know in the comments but I know the next game I'm going to be playing on it and that is radiant Historia which everybody needs to play immediately stop what you're doing right now and play this game it is amazing Prince of Persia the Lost Crown so this game was kind of iffy for me because I remember it was overpriced when it first came out and uh a lot of people were complaining about the price for it and it got good ratings but it didn't sell well and we know why it didn't sell well cuz it was over priced after finding this game on sale for 20 bucks I played it and I'm really enjoying it I think the game is uh on point still not worth the price they were originally asking for Ubisoft you got to chill with these prices for everything you can't charge like 50 to 60 bucks for everything I'm liking it so far now I haven't got too much into it you know I played the first level beat the boss I'm still playing some other games right now I'm trying to beat Kalisto protocol I was actually going to quit that game because it was pissing me off um but I'm halfway through so I can't back out now but after after I get done playing that I'm going to go all in this and uh I'll probably talk about it in a future video but definitely worth 20 bucks here's topand arcade 3 uh this consists of a lot of shoot them ups for the evercade now um this one was hard to find for a while and people were trying to charge like a crazy amount of money for it but luckily it was reprinted it's not a legacy cart just of yet but I feel like a lot of people should go after these arcade cards from evercade because I feel like those are the most unique ones now the games I really wanted on this collection uh obviously uh truck in part two you know this is its first uh home release since I think uh it was released on the F towns Marty or whatever that system called and then Batu gun I definitely wanted that but U I feel like uh every game on this collection is definitely worth having I love the fact that arcade games are getting uh physical home release on a system so uh that's why I really support a lot of the stuff that ever Kade is doing so yeah uh definitely worth having this here's Silent Hill 2 beats of Rage Edition now um I originally was trying to go for a solid Hill 2 remake during the sales during Black Friday and some of the holiday sales and it was unfortunately stolen out of my cart so I settled for this version of the game and uh it's actually pretty fun now you get to pick through a bunch of the protagonists through the Silent Hill games and also some of the villains as well I have a feeling that a lot of people are going to go for some of the villain characters but honestly there's nothing really else to say about this game you know if you wanted to ever go through Silent Hill with your be hands this is the best game to do it no weapons it's your bare Fist and a bunch of special moves and it actually turns out it's pretty good but uh yeah sit down with a friend and try this one out [Music] here's them fighting herds so this is was originally supposed to be a My Little Pony fighting game but it got turned down so the developers decide to make their own game now as you can see the characters consist of animals and it has cows ponies unicorns and other animals as well now immediately I tried to go online with the game but nobody was waiting for me so I went against the AI the AI gave me a pretty good challenge you know me not being used to the game but I feel like I could adapt and get used to it you know I just got find the right character to use but overall I think this is a pretty solid fighting game just from the start so it definitely has some cool features in it has a little story mode but I just went to the arcade mode because I just want to go through the battles and fight the characters see how I do and I got to say playing through this game and looking through the characters the levels and the combinations and things like that I think the developers did a really good job I mean I think most people could take this as a serious fighting game if they could get past the look heck maybe we can even see this game in fighting tournaments I don't know we'll see how it plays out but uh if you see it around there for 14 well 15 20 bucks I think it's definitely worth picking up not a [Music] scratch standing trick here's Far East of Eden Kabuki Clash this game I've been looking forward to play for years and now it's finally in my hands and I am ecstatic about it now this is one of those underlooked fighting games that was well done with it Sprite work I mean it looks beable even to this day now the game doesn't have that many characters to choose from but I think that's a good thing especially when it comes to balancing issues this game is definitely a throwback to the old school fighting games I love you know Sprite VES I feel is like where it's at you know it's beautiful it's a lost art to this day there are some people still trying to do it but um you know just what they were back then I really feel like uh just are something special and a lot of people need to get to play games like this uh to this day hopefully this game will get released eventually on Modern consoles but until then you could get it on the Neo Geo CD and if you're a baller or money is no object to you you get it on a Neo Geo AES or mvs I know for sure it's on mvs but AES I not too sure about but it it should be anyways check this one out [Music] guys yes [Music] all right guys so another pickup video out of the way hope you enjoyed uh yeah that's all I got for you guys I'm just enjoying the New Year I hope you guys are too the radical one and I will see you all later [Music] [Music]",

physical copy I hear they're going to make more physical copies where you know the patch is already implemented but at this point I don't really care I just already got the game I got a couple extras with it so I'm happy here's raging bites um this game took me by surprise I had no idea this game existed and um when I found out it got a physical release I decided to give it a try uh what I was told is it's a mix of survival horror with a little bit of RPG element so it'll it'll it kind of reminded me when I was playing it a little bit of Resident Evil Guiden but just like more polished the game definitely starts out strong but there was a little bit too much dialogue for me I just want to kind of get into the game play but uh when you get to the first chapter uh it starts off like The Walking Dead the first episode of The Walking Dead where Rick W wakes up in the hospital the same thing happens to you but this game takes place in the 1970s and um when you wake up you you're trying to find out what's going on there's zombies already in the hospital it's pretty insane but it really pulled me in and it has some jump scares I guess that's like the the horror part I would say of the game uh nothing really too scary that we like oh my God I'm scared to go around this corner but it's more like jump scares in this game now as you play through the game you'll meet other characters that are join you I think you could have up to four people in your party you'll collect items like guns you know baseball bats axes and things like that to kind of help you get through the game and survive you're trying to get out of the city at least from the part I'm at I'm about halfway through the game I would say like I think I'm halfway through and it really just pulls you in I love the fact this game has that Survivor horror feeling to it you know it you have the sense of unnerving this you know like you don't know what's going to happen next and I I just like that type of stuff so I'm glad they were able to Implement that into a like a somewhat RPG but uh definitely I think a game that people should look at here's guilt now this game actually I believe came out quite a few years ago like I think believe back in 201920 but it was a stadia exclusive if you guys remember that system uh thank goodness the developers decide to expand the game because I don't think a lot of people would know about it if it just stayed on the stadia and of course now has a fiscal release now you play as a young girl named Sally who's looking for a missing cousin Emily now Emily I Believe been missing for a month when the game starts and prettyy much the game starts with you putting up posters letting everybody know that she's missing but unfortunately during the search your character gets bullied by neighborhood kids ends up getting lost and um you're trying to find your way back home when you go to the train station that you find you see this weird conductor and the conductor says hey you got to buy this ticket to go home you buy the ticket and all of a sudden you go to this jacked up looking City that's just it's like a mirror image of I believe where um Sally goes to school at but uh it's just it's just pretty twisted and I F found the game to be pretty Eerie as I played through it it really gave me an unnerving feeling about what was around the corner because you're playing as a child in this game she's only 11 years old and she's going through a school like at night time and other parts of the city it's just like it just looks very eerie and the monsters in this game are just like terrifying looking you know I just feel like I just feel bad for but mostly in the beginning of the game you'll be kind of like playing stealth like trying to hide from your enemies until you figure out how to take them out or if you need to take them out some some enemies you could just walk past some enemies are patrolling so you to be very careful and some enemies are just like they pretty much stalk you so you have to be quiet when you can and run if you have to now I wanted to mention also that I have played this game on live streams and those videos are up so if you want to check those videos out and see how it is you know definitely give those a watch I might actually start doing more live streams but anyways going back into the game I like how it gives you that sense of what's around the corner it just feels like I know I say this term a lot it just feels unnerving just like a survival horror game should be oh also I did want to mention that the has multiple endings so depending on how you play the game you'll get a different ending there's a a good ending a bad ending and a really a selfish ending I would say so anyways guys definitely check out guilt let me know what you think about it hey Sally you still looking for your cousin what' you do to her Sally we know you're here you can't hide from us oh God [Music] me there's still a chance for you to make things right Sally you must find Emily she is the key to ending this nightmare [Music] [Music] Atari 50th the anniversary celebr ation Expanded Edition um Jason was had been telling me to get this for a while and um you know I wasn't really a big Atari guy you know back in the day obviously but um I do like some of the games they put out and I was really interested in seeing more of the history with them so one of the main reasons I got this because of the interviews of the developers talking about the games and what they did to get them released I love little things like that because it reminds me of the sixth and even the fifth generation um of games where you know stuff like that was included like sometimes on the game or as a demo disc you know like interviews and things like that so and also too I'm looking more forward to the 7800 games that's more of my style when it comes to Atari so hope hoping I see something out like on there but either way I think this collection worth to have just for the novelty of you know the history of gaming the King of Fighters 94 the first game in the series and a spin-off of fatal Fury now I picked this game up more as a novelty you know a lot of people that have played the King of Fighters game they probably won't go back to 94 or even 95 but this was just more of a novelty pickup you know see where the game came from you know where it route started and you know I do like this game but it's just hard to go back to but I just wanted to kind of get it as a novelty to the series so I have them all um you can't even edit teams in this game so that's how crazy it is but it does have one of the coolest Final Bosses in the series for G and um yeah that's pretty much all I have to say about it you know you'll probably like only play this game if it's in a compilation of the King of Fighters series but uh play a game Solo or it's just probably not for most fighting fans these days all right so here is a shoot them up collection called irm collection now this consists of horizontal and vertical shoot them UPS now just to let you all know this collection for each game they usually come with a variation game what I mean by that is like their console counterparts except for image Fight 2 I believe but anyways uh going to the first game in this Collection image fight part one I didn't like this game when I played it a few months ago I was getting tore up on the first level and then when I played it again recently I figured out you know some what the mechanic of the game pretty much is and that is you got to speed up and slow down at certain points so you have a a button you push to kind of like make the the craft go faster and slower and that's going to help you out on a lot of parts in this game you're going to have to like vigorously use it at all times depending on the situation now before I knew that with this game you know I couldn't get past the first few seconds but now uh I gotten better is at the game and I got to the boss and I beat the boss but the second level I kind of messed up on it's one of those games you have to really pay attention to at all times you can't stray you got to remember what to do in certain situations if you don't react fast enough it's over for you image Fight 2 I feel like like it's more of the same now this was a console only game so what they did is they added story to it and that was already a plus with me now originally I believe game was only in Japanese but now it's been translated in English so you can understand the story if you're interested in that I like the space setting in this game you know when like when I first started playing Sho notes back in the day uh most of the games I played like had a space level in it so that just brings that Nostalgia for me I felt this game was more intense than the first game so make sure you get those powerups ASAP because this game as you can see you got to be shooting and moving at all times now finally we have uh X multiply now this one I remember back in the day I was going to actually buy this game on the Playstation system it was very expensive and I had a chance to get a good deal and thankfully I didn't pull the trigger on it because that version of the game is one of the worst versions out there the game reminds me a lot of gradius just like I feel like it's more faster Pace at least more faster action on screen you get these snake armed powerups that help you deflect enemy attacks during the game which I thought was pretty unique but where this game really took off for me is when I got this laser power up I feel like this is the best weapon in the game even though it's like one of the first two weapons in my opinion um definitely made the game a lot more like interesting for me so with that said I believe strictly limited is putting this on a physical for everybody to collect so hopefully that's out by now if not hopefully it'll be out soon but the digital is available right now I bought a box from GG retro box recently and it came with Marvel versus Capcom 3 now if you haven't seen that cover before that is the special edition 10 case uh that came with like the two extra characters at time and um yeah this is the vanilla version of the game before we got ultimate still a great version of the game to play um they did change a lot in the newer version but I think this one's still worth going after so um if you like three on three chaotic action you know hey try this one out here's the last hope so initially I played this game years ago and I didn't really care for it because I didn't really like too many horizontal Shooters like rtip but over time I've come to like the game and I could really appreciate it you know if you if you're into horizontal Shooters it's definitely something that's up there I don't I won't say it's as hard as our type it may be be even harder than that game um but still uh sh UPS like these are pretty unique I would say and I wasn't really used to like you know well I I I didn't really like like like where shooting where you get killed with one hit or whatever like that you know then you have to start over at a checkpoint I like when you can respawn at the same point but this one I feel like it's really self-rewarding uh once you get used to it and get good at it so uh definitely keep your eyes out on this one it's pretty old now but definitely something worth your [Music] while here's forgotten Realms demon Stone now this game did come out to America which I own that version I bought that when it first came out but I love the European versions cover art I think this is a much better cover art than we got and I think if we used they had used this cover the game would have sold a lot better but um this game is a hacking slash it's very similar to if you had played games like you played like Lord of the Rings The Two Towers back in the day from the same developers that did that game plays exactly the same but this one's more refined I would say I want to go over the story too much because uh I'll be here all night like going through it man it really is a story that that'll pull you into the lore of Dungeons and Dragons now one of the things that stands out is the voice acting I mean they went all out on it uh Patrick Stewart is in here even the late Michael Clark Duncan is in here as a one of the characters but um going into game play once you get your characters you can switch between them at any times and you have to switch to them at at certain parts of the game to get through certain areas so you're always fighting together you can switch between them which is great I wish the game would have had like a two two player mode but I understand why it wasn't put into it like a the Lord of the Rings game The Two Towers game that actually has a two-player mode no it does not now that I'm thinking about it one player mode but anyways guys uh definitely a game you want to add on your radar and don't worry about it being expensive the game is like less than like 10 bucks maybe just slightly over but either way make sure you add this game to your collection and shout out to Jason for picking this up for me you know when he was in Norway he knew I was looking for this and he grabbed it for me so good looking out brother appreciate you but yeah guys leave you with that pick this game up if you're a PS2 and also it's on the Xbox as well if you want to play it on the Xbox instead not sure about backwards compatibility but uh yeah Xbox or PS2 or even PC pick this one up in Bruno's name you will not cross this door die I got another Mario gaming watch my buddy Ron tried to fix this and he didn't get it to where he wanted it to be but I think it works well enough and this shell is way better than one I have so very nostalgic for this game out of the gaming Watch series I recently acquired a new Nintendo 3DS XL um I always wanted one of these but they seem very limited at the time they came out so never really got one and I think there's only maybe a handful of exclusive games that really use the feature of the system but still I wanted the best version of the 3DS and I believe this is it uh but yeah I haven't really looked up the games that are exclusive to it so maybe you guys can let me know in the comments but I know the next game I'm going to be playing on it and that is radiant Historia which everybody needs to play immediately stop what you're doing right now and play this game it is amazing Prince of Persia the Lost Crown so this game was kind of iffy for me because I remember it was overpriced when it first came out and uh a lot of people were complaining about the price for it and it got good ratings but it didn't sell well and we know why it didn't sell well cuz it was over priced after finding this game on sale for 20 bucks I played it and I'm really enjoying it I think the game is uh on point still not worth the price they were originally asking for Ubisoft you got to chill with these prices for everything you can't charge like 50 to 60 bucks for everything I'm liking it so far now I haven't got too much into it you know I played the first level beat the boss I'm still playing some other games right now I'm trying to beat Kalisto protocol I was actually going to quit that game because it was pissing me off um but I'm halfway through so I can't back out now but after after I get done playing that I'm going to go all in this and uh I'll probably talk about it in a future video but definitely worth 20 bucks here's topand arcade 3 uh this consists of a lot of shoot them ups for the evercade now um this one was hard to find for a while and people were trying to charge like a crazy amount of money for it but luckily it was reprinted it's not a legacy cart just of yet but I feel like a lot of people should go after these arcade cards from evercade because I feel like those are the most unique ones now the games I really wanted on this collection uh obviously uh truck in part two you know this is its first uh home release since I think uh it was released on the F towns Marty or whatever that system called and then Batu gun I definitely wanted that but U I feel like uh every game on this collection is definitely worth having I love the fact that arcade games are getting uh physical home release on a system so uh that's why I really support a lot of the stuff that ever Kade is doing so yeah uh definitely worth having this here's Silent Hill 2 beats of Rage Edition now um I originally was trying to go for a solid Hill 2 remake during the sales during Black Friday and some of the holiday sales and it was unfortunately stolen out of my cart so I settled for this version of the game and uh it's actually pretty fun now you get to pick through a bunch of the protagonists through the Silent Hill games and also some of the villains as well I have a feeling that a lot of people are going to go for some of the villain characters but honestly there's nothing really else to say about this game you know if you wanted to ever go through Silent Hill with your be hands this is the best game to do it no weapons it's your bare Fist and a bunch of special moves and it actually turns out it's pretty good but uh yeah sit down with a friend and try this one out [Music] here's them fighting herds so this is was originally supposed to be a My Little Pony fighting game but it got turned down so the developers decide to make their own game now as you can see the characters consist of animals and it has cows ponies unicorns and other animals as well now immediately I tried to go online with the game but nobody was waiting for me so I went against the AI the AI gave me a pretty good challenge you know me not being used to the game but I feel like I could adapt and get used to it you know I just got find the right character to use but overall I think this is a pretty solid fighting game just from the start so it definitely has some cool features in it has a little story mode but I just went to the arcade mode because I just want to go through the battles and fight the characters see how I do and I got to say playing through this game and looking through the characters the levels and the combinations and things like that I think the developers did a really good job I mean I think most people could take this as a serious fighting game if they could get past the look heck maybe we can even see this game in fighting tournaments I don't know we'll see how it plays out but uh if you see it around there for 14 well 15 20 bucks I think it's definitely worth picking up not a [Music] scratch standing trick here's Far East of Eden Kabuki Clash this game I've been looking forward to play for years and now it's finally in my hands and I am ecstatic about it now this is one of those underlooked fighting games that was well done with it Sprite work I mean it looks beable even to this day now the game doesn't have that many characters to choose from but I think that's a good thing especially when it comes to balancing issues this game is definitely a throwback to the old school fighting games I love you know Sprite VES I feel is like where it's at you know it's beautiful it's a lost art to this day there are some people still trying to do it but um you know just what they were back then I really feel like uh just are something special and a lot of people need to get to play games like this uh to this day hopefully this game will get released eventually on Modern consoles but until then you could get it on the Neo Geo CD and if you're a baller or money is no object to you you get it on a Neo Geo AES or mvs I know for sure it's on mvs but AES I not too sure about but it it should be anyways check this one out [Music] guys yes [Music] all right guys so another pickup video out of the way hope you enjoyed uh yeah that's all I got for you guys I'm just enjoying the New Year I hope you guys are too the radical one and I will see you all later [Music] [Music]"

Key Market Takeaways for Sports Pickup Game Apps According to GrandViewResearch, the overall sports app market was valued at USD 3.66 billion in 2022 and can easily grow 11% annually until 2030. This growth is fueled by the increasing need for platforms that support social interaction and foster community involvement in sports.

Collaborations, such as Chelsea FC‚Äôs partnership with hospitality apps, offer exclusive deals and fan engagement features that promote local sports activities. ** 100% Developer Skill Guarantee; Or Your Money Back. FREE CONSULTATION Free Consultation ** Business Model of Pickup Sports The business model of the Pickup Sports app focuses on facilitating local pickup sports games for children while providing an easy-to-use platform for parents. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of its components: Event Participation Fees Similar platforms typically charge between $5 to $10 per player per event. For instance, groups running 3-7 pickup games weekly can generate monthly revenues ranging from $3,600 to $20,000 depending on attendance (20-60 players per event) . Membership Models The app may offer various membership options, such as: Punch Passes: For example, 10 sessions for $80. Annual Memberships: Options could include a yearly fee of $960 or monthly payments of $80. These memberships can provide discounts for drop-in rates for members compared to non-members. Transaction Fees: The app can integrate payment systems like Stripe, which charges a transaction fee (typically around 5.9% + $0.30 per transaction) . This fee structure helps maintain revenue while ensuring secure payment processing. Advertising and Sponsorships As the user base grows, there may be opportunities for local businesses to advertise within the app or sponsor events, creating additional revenue streams. Market Positioning The Pickup Sports app targets busy families looking for convenient and affordable ways to engage their children in sports without the commitment of traditional leagues. By focusing on community-building and flexibility in scheduling, it aims to attract parents who value social interaction and physical activity for their children. How Profitable are Sports Pickup Game Apps? The profitability of a sports app like Pickup Sports hinges on several factors, including revenue generation, customer lifetime value, and the unique value propositions it offers to users. The competitive landscape includes various similar apps, each employing different strategies to attract and retain users while maximizing profitability. Sports pickup game apps typically utilize multiple revenue streams to enhance profitability: 1. Subscription Models Many apps offer premium memberships that provide users with additional features, such as advanced matchmaking, exclusive access to certain games, and ad-free experiences. For instance, if an app charges $10 per month for a premium subscription and retains customers for an average of 12 months, this could generate significant recurring revenue. This model is similar to apps like TeamSnap, which charges teams for management tools but also offers features for finding pickup games. 2. Advertising Free versions of these apps often rely on advertising revenue. Businesses targeting sports enthusiasts can advertise their products or services within the app, providing a steady income stream without charging users directly. Apps like Meetup utilize this model effectively by allowing local businesses to promote their services to users interested in sports activities. 3. Event Fees Some platforms charge fees for organizing or participating in events, tournaments, or leagues. This model not only generates direct revenue but also fosters community engagement among users who are willing to pay for organized play. Customer Lifetime Value Customer lifetime value is critical for assessing the long-term profitability of an app. CLV can be calculated using the formula: CLV=Average Revenue per User ARPU √óAverage Customer Lifespan CLV\\=Average Revenue per User ARPU √óAverage Customer Lifespan For sports pickup game apps, ARPU can vary significantly based on user engagement and monetization strategies. For example: If a user subscribes for $10 per month and remains active for 12 months, the CLV would be 10√ó12=120 In contrast, a free version that generates $3 per user per month from ads and retains users for 24 months would yield a CLV of 3√ó24=7 Key Features of Sports Pickup Game App like Pickup Sports Here are some key features for a sports pickup game app like PickupSports, 1. Streamlined Game Creation Simplifying the game creation process is crucial for getting new users and keeping existing ones engaged. By allowing users to easily set up games with details like location, time, sport, skill level, and maximum participants, companies can streamline the process and encourage more frequent game creation. 2.

This allows users to pay game fees, equipment rentals, or other charges directly within the app, eliminating the need for external transactions. 5.

By allowing users to search for games based on their location, preferred sports, and skill level, companies can ensure users find games that match their interests. A map-based interface can further simplify the process, providing a clear visual representation of available games in the vicinity. Features that Can Enhance a Sports Pickup Game App like Pickup Sports The sports pickup game app market is highly competitive, and businesses must innovate continuously to stand out.

Development Steps for a Sports Pickup Game App like Pickup Sports Developing a sports app like Pickup Sports requires a strategic and iterative approach. Here are nine unique developmental steps to guide your project: 1. Define Target Audience and Sports Focus The first step involves clearly identifying the target audience, including their demographics, interests, and preferences. This information helps businesses determine which sports to include in the app. By understanding the audience, companies can tailor the app‚Äôs features and design to meet user expectations better and enhance overall engagement. 2. Prioritize Location-Based Development Location-based services are crucial for a sports pickup game app. Utilizing GPS technology and mapping APIs enables users to find nearby games and players. This feature enhances user experience by making it easier to join or organize games in their local area. Companies should focus on integrating robust location-based functionalities to provide a seamless experience for users. 3. Build a Dynamic Team Formation System A key component of the app is the team formation system. This system allows users to create teams, invite friends, and find other players. Features such as team messaging, captain roles, and team rankings should be included. 4. Create a Real-Time Communication Platform Effective communication is essential for coordinating games and sharing updates. Developing a real-time messaging and communication platform within the app allows users to discuss game details, rules, and other relevant information. Features such as group chats, private messaging, and voice or video calls enhance user interaction and coordination. 5. Integrate Sports-Specific Functionalities Each sport has unique requirements and features that can enhance the user experience. For instance, a basketball app might include functionalities for tracking scores, fouls, and player statistics. Companies should focus on integrating sports-specific features that cater to the needs of each sport to provide a more tailored experience for users. 6. Offer Customizable User Profiles Customizable user profiles are important for personalizing the app experience. Users should be able to set their preferences, skill levels, and playing times.

Let‚Äôs dive in and show you how to make an app that really shines! Key Market Takeaways for Sports Pickup Game Apps According to GrandViewResearch, the overall sports app market was valued at USD 3.66 billion in 2022 and can easily grow 11% annually until 2030.

Collaborations, such as Chelsea FC‚Äôs partnership with hospitality apps, offer exclusive deals and fan engagement features that promote local sports activities. ** 100% Developer Skill Guarantee; Or Your Money Back. FREE CONSULTATION Free Consultation ** Business Model of Pickup Sports The business model of the Pickup Sports app focuses on facilitating local pickup sports games for children while providing an easy-to-use platform for parents. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of its components: Event Participation Fees Similar platforms typically charge between $5 to $10 per player per event. For instance, groups running 3-7 pickup games weekly can generate monthly revenues ranging from $3,600 to $20,000 depending on attendance (20-60 players per event) . Membership Models The app may offer various membership options, such as: Punch Passes: For example, 10 sessions for $80. Annual Memberships: Options could include a yearly fee of $960 or monthly payments of $80. These memberships can provide discounts for drop-in rates for members compared to non-members. Transaction Fees: The app can integrate payment systems like Stripe, which charges a transaction fee (typically around 5.9% + $0.30 per transaction) . This fee structure helps maintain revenue while ensuring secure payment processing. Advertising and Sponsorships As the user base grows, there may be opportunities for local businesses to advertise within the app or sponsor events, creating additional revenue streams. Market Positioning The Pickup Sports app targets busy families looking for convenient and affordable ways to engage their children in sports without the commitment of traditional leagues. By focusing on community-building and flexibility in scheduling, it aims to attract parents who value social interaction and physical activity for their children. How Profitable are Sports Pickup Game Apps? The profitability of a sports app like Pickup Sports hinges on several factors, including revenue generation, customer lifetime value, and the unique value propositions it offers to users. The competitive landscape includes various similar apps, each employing different strategies to attract and retain users while maximizing profitability. Sports pickup game apps typically utilize multiple revenue streams to enhance profitability: 1. Subscription Models Many apps offer premium memberships that provide users with additional features, such as advanced matchmaking, exclusive access to certain games, and ad-free experiences. For instance, if an app charges $10 per month for a premium subscription and retains customers for an average of 12 months, this could generate significant recurring revenue. This model is similar to apps like TeamSnap, which charges teams for management tools but also offers features for finding pickup games. 2. Advertising Free versions of these apps often rely on advertising revenue. Businesses targeting sports enthusiasts can advertise their products or services within the app, providing a steady income stream without charging users directly. Apps like Meetup utilize this model effectively by allowing local businesses to promote their services to users interested in sports activities. 3. Event Fees Some platforms charge fees for organizing or participating in events, tournaments, or leagues. This model not only generates direct revenue but also fosters community engagement among users who are willing to pay for organized play. Customer Lifetime Value Customer lifetime value is critical for assessing the long-term profitability of an app. CLV can be calculated using the formula: CLV=Average Revenue per User ARPU √óAverage Customer Lifespan CLV\\=Average Revenue per User ARPU √óAverage Customer Lifespan For sports pickup game apps, ARPU can vary significantly based on user engagement and monetization strategies. For example: If a user subscribes for $10 per month and remains active for 12 months, the CLV would be 10√ó12=120 In contrast, a free version that generates $3 per user per month from ads and retains users for 24 months would yield a CLV of 3√ó24=7 Key Features of Sports Pickup Game App like Pickup Sports Here are some key features for a sports pickup game app like PickupSports, 1. Streamlined Game Creation Simplifying the game creation process is crucial for getting new users and keeping existing ones engaged. By allowing users to easily set up games with details like location, time, sport, skill level, and maximum participants, companies can streamline the process and encourage more frequent game creation. 2. Precise Skill Level Filtering Catering to players of various skill levels is essential for a healthy and inclusive user base. By implementing robust skill-level filtering functionalities, companies can ensure a balanced playing experience for everyone. 3. Based Recommendations Integrating location-based services provides immense value to users. When users open the app, suggesting games or sports venues in their vicinity can significantly improve engagement. 4. Seamless In-App Payments Offering secure in-app payment options can significantly enhance user convenience and create new revenue streams for businesses. This allows users to pay game fees, equipment rentals, or other charges directly within the app, eliminating the need for external transactions. 5. Enhanced Game Discovery A user-friendly game discovery experience is paramount for app success. By allowing users to search for games based on their location, preferred sports, and skill level, companies can ensure users find games that match their interests. A map-based interface can further simplify the process, providing a clear visual representation of available games in the vicinity. Features that Can Enhance a Sports Pickup Game App like Pickup Sports The sports pickup game app market is highly competitive, and businesses must innovate continuously to stand out. Incorporating the following features can enhance user experience and drive sustainable growth: 1. Social Media Integration Linking with popular social media platforms can broaden the app‚Äôs reach and attract new users. This feature helps app users to connect with friends, share game updates, and explore new sports communities. 2. Gamification Elements Adding gamification elements such as badges, leaderboards, and achievements can inspire competition and motivation. This encourages frequent use and boosts user engagement. 3. Real-time Analytics Providing real-time analytics, including game statistics, performance metrics, and player rankings, enhances the user experience. Users can track their progress, refine their skills, and make informed decisions. 4. Equipment Rentals and Purchases Integrating options for equipment rentals or purchases can streamline the process for users and generate additional revenue streams. This is especially useful for users lacking the necessary gear. 5. Group Chat and Event Planning Features for group chat and event planning improve communication and coordination among players. Users can discuss game details, organize team events, and strengthen community ties. 6. Virtual Reality Integration Incorporating VR technology can offer a more immersive experience. This is particularly beneficial for sports like golf, tennis, or basketball, where users can practice their skills in a virtual setting. 7. Personalized Recommendations Using AI and ML to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences can enhance the experience. This feature can suggest suitable games, teammates, or sports venues, boosting engagement and satisfaction. Development Steps for a Sports Pickup Game App like Pickup Sports Developing a sports app like Pickup Sports requires a strategic and iterative approach. Here are nine unique developmental steps to guide your project: 1. Define Target Audience and Sports Focus The first step involves clearly identifying the target audience, including their demographics, interests, and preferences. This information helps businesses determine which sports to include in the app. By understanding the audience, companies can tailor the app‚Äôs features and design to meet user expectations better and enhance overall engagement. 2. Prioritize Location-Based Development Location-based services are crucial for a sports pickup game app. Utilizing GPS technology and mapping APIs enables users to find nearby games and players. This feature enhances user experience by making it easier to join or organize games in their local area. Companies should focus on integrating robust location-based functionalities to provide a seamless experience for users. 3. Build a Dynamic Team Formation System A key component of the app is the team formation system. This system allows users to create teams, invite friends, and find other players. Features such as team messaging, captain roles, and team rankings should be included. 4. Create a Real-Time Communication Platform Effective communication is essential for coordinating games and sharing updates. Developing a real-time messaging and communication platform within the app allows users to discuss game details, rules, and other relevant information. Features such as group chats, private messaging, and voice or video calls enhance user interaction and coordination. 5. Integrate Sports-Specific Functionalities Each sport has unique requirements and features that can enhance the user experience. For instance, a basketball app might include functionalities for tracking scores, fouls, and player statistics. Companies should focus on integrating sports-specific features that cater to the needs of each sport to provide a more tailored experience for users. 6. Offer Customizable User Profiles Customizable user profiles are important for personalizing the app experience. Users should be able to set their preferences, skill levels, and playing times. This customization helps match users with suitable games and partners. Companies that offer this level of personalization can improve user satisfaction and engagement. 7. Implement Safety and Security Measures The app should incorporate features like background checks, emergency contact details, and reporting tools. These safeguards help foster a secure environment for users, which is crucial for maintaining satisfaction within the app. Cost of Developing a Sports Pickup Game App like Pickup Sports Development PhaseTasksCost RangeResearch and PlanningMarket Analysis: Understanding the target audience and competitors.$1,000 ‚Äì $3,000Feature Prioritization: Identifying key app features.$1,000 ‚Äì $2,000Frontend DevelopmentUI Design: Crafting a simple, intuitive user interface.$3,000 ‚Äì $8,000UX Design: Ensuring a basic user-friendly experience.$2,000 ‚Äì $5,000Backend DevelopmentServer Setup: Lightweight server setup for hosting the app.$3,000 ‚Äì $8,000Database Development: Creating a simple database for user and game data.$3,000 ‚Äì $7,000API Development: Building basic APIs for frontend-backend communication.$3,000 ‚Äì $8,000App FeaturesCore Features: User profiles, game creation, location-based search, and messaging.$5,000 ‚Äì $15,000Advanced Features: Real-time tracking and basic social features.$5,000 ‚Äì $10,000Testing and Quality AssuranceUnit and Integration Testing: Ensuring smooth functionality.$2,000 ‚Äì $5,000User Acceptance Testing: Validating with real users.$2,000 ‚Äì $4,000UI/UX DesignIterative Design Process: Refining UI/UX based on feedback.$2,000 ‚Äì $5,000Usability Testing: Ensuring ease of use.$2,000 ‚Äì $4,000 Total Estimated Cost ‚Äì $10,000 ‚Äì $100,000 Developing a sports pickup game app like Pickup Sports involves various factors that can significantly impact the overall development cost.

#vlogmas2024 16 comments [Music] good morning happy day 22 holy cow I can't believe that this is almost over I'm kind of sad I'm also actually I'm feeling really good today cuz I'm getting the sense of things like coming to a close for the year I am looking at doing some planning stuff for next year today I'm finishing up projects today as I'm filming this is a Friday and then I'm heading to the weekend before Christmas I'm planning to take some time off which is really great so things are feeling really nice and like getting wrapped up into a bow I am good morning Kent I am just about to have my morning vlogmas time and I think I'll probably select one of these colors cuz I've got two of this like Bluey green left and then one purple and one pink wild I finished my Square so early yesterday that it almost felt like I didn't even make a square yesterday so I think I'll get that started for the day and then I have a final sakas IG live later and yeah today's going going to be a good [Music] day I have had a very productive morning as far as work goes and also with knitting since we did an Instagram live our last Instagram live for socas today I was knitting the entire time on my sock Miss socks and then I just watched through two different videos and I was also knitting on socks for that I was watching through videos that K had edited so I am now repeating colors I've made it through my 24 that was my 24th stripe and so let's see I started at the top with this really light green into this like bright green and that's exactly where I am down here and then same thing I'm actually a little bit further on this sock here and I am into my third set of 20 rows on my foot I usually do about 60 is rows on my foot it depends on what type of heel I'm doing so with a fish lips kiss heel I usually do like 60 to 65 rows I actually need to look at my patterns because I can't or at my rivalry notes because I can't remember I haven't done a sock like that's kind of vanilla in a little while so I need to look and check but I am getting a lot of progress done I've done at least two stripes today which was my goal so if I don't touch those the rest of the day that's totally fine I think I'll be good to do two stripes today uh done with two stripes today but do two stripes tomorrow about and then do the toes the following day and I'll be done before Christmas and before vlogmas is over which is like yes super super great so I am about to pack up my things and I am going to take myself to a coffee shop and do some planning for next year there I kind of like to do this for like big planning types of things because it just makes it feel a little bit special and I know this is a task that I would maybe continue to put off for a while if I was doing it at home just because it feels kind of big and overwhelming and also like not quite necessary yet because it's not next year yet but I know that if I take the time to do some brainstorming I'm going to be thinking about like what kinds of make aongs I want to do for the next year things I might want to do in the love and stitches membership um events that I want to make sure that I go to for next year and just kind of mapping that out is is going to help me so much more to reach those goals and if I had no plan at all so I'm very much looking forward to this I've been looking forward to it all week long and I decided um I picked out a coffee shop that I've never been to before they make crepes so I'm hoping they still make crepes all day long because I haven't had lunch yet so that's my plan for lunch so I'm going to get packed up and head out of here it is freezing cold outside so so chilly even though I drove home with heated seats on in my mom's car I'm still freezing but luckily it's nice and warm inside the house okay let's open up our Advent for today I've now got my e.l.f and my hot springs one all in the same box everything that I've already opened is sitting on this dresser and hopefully later on I will get with Kent to do the Beauty and the Beast he's still working right now so I don't want to interrupt him day 22 this one is from fantasy fibers yarn company and it is called snowball fight it's interesting we didn't go chronologically throughout the movie we kind of were at first and now it's kind of bopping around I wonder if that was intentional for the color placement I'm kind of excited to get all of these laid out these ones especially are so nice cuz they're labeled and I've been writing on them every single day with the number so I don't have to like stress if I you know throw them all out on a bed or on the floor and I start to like play with the order of them because I will still be able to find the original order hot springs fiberco that is a stunning blue and some little peppermints okay I'm going to go add this to the rainbow of yarn that is on my dresser here and I have a little bit of downtime before Pilates tonight so I was thinking about watching some vlogmas and then I thought nah I'm actually feeling kind of social tonight so I'm going to see if any of my members are on Zoom right now to hang out I'm going to work on my little square and then that's kind of it for the day I am hoping that when I get home later after I get showered and settled and everything that Kent and I can watch a Christmas movie I am really feeling like it's now Christmas time with it being the 20 what is it 22nd no 20 yeah 22nd um actual day 20th so we're still really really close to Christmas so yeah I am like ready to get into some Christmas movie marathoning I have two things to tell you before we open this okay they're both about Pilates okay have I was making sure my microphone so tonight was a jumping class so you like lay and you like jump off this board you dunked dunked what does that even mean kind a a hoop no it's not that exciting normally you're just jumping jumping jumping but today was called Jingle jump and they gave us little Jingle Bells to put around our wrist that's fun and we're like and the other exciting thing is I brought you a cookie they gave cookies at Pilates well um this this studio has been there for a long time like I think more than 10 years so a lot of the people know each other so one of the ladies made these cookies and they're like brown butter chocolate chip cookies and they said take as many as you want so I took one for each of us they're both for me don't they look so good they're both for me now we can open up day 202 2022 22 Look Away W don't look I'm really really loving this color okay I would say like two distinct colors pink one is pink white nope brown blue yellow gold yeah like a golden yellow it's different tones and shades and like a little bit of brown but it's really pretty right yep but like mostly pink there's a little purple there's a lot going on mhm okay so I don't even know where to start because I don't know if we're skipping around again or uh it's a spoken line okay from a song I think right after a song or maybe in a song but does Belle say it no does Mrs pot say it yep guess to who to cup to Cup oh my God what is wrong with me cup to CH to C that's wow wildly disrespectful don't know what's wrong with me my brain not working I used all my brain cells on Pilates to coordinate yeah um does she say it to chip yes is it what we were discussing yesterday yep that oh no it's not that line oh okay um she says it to chit and it's around the same time I think so because he says what's there mama and she says what tell you when you're older yeah and then she says one something at like the very end is like the music's coming down yeah see it's so funny because it's like I can totally see the scene especially because we watch that so video um does she say something like come here love or something like that like uh no let's go or like let's go upstairs sort of where where would they be going back to the kitchen where do they where do they live the cabinet the it's another name cupboard let's go to the cupboard basically you're right there okay what is it it's a into the cupboard with you now a that's where little cup lives poor cup poor cup okay it's a really pretty color I don't know what I'm going to make with this a cup cozy just like 24 cup cozies [Music] nah [Music]",
