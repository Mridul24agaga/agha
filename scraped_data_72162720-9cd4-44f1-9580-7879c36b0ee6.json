Also, I started this blog, Growth Marketing Pro and built it into a 7-figure marketing agency in 24 months. Before that, I was the Head of Marketing for a startup called PlushCare, which sold for $450 million.

And they’re a necessary part of any good search engine optimization (SEO) strategy. In fact, backlinks are the #1 way we leapfrogged all of our competition and grew Growth Marketing Pro into the biggest growth marketing blog on the internet — in under 18 months. It’s how we get 14,543 visitors to our Best Webinar Software post every month. It’s also how we consistently drive 50,000 visitors to this blog every month. When I left my day job at a telemedicine company, I became a cofounder at blog called ManlyWellness. When I came on board, I grew that blog to 116,961 organic visitors/month in just a couple months! No joke. Why are backlinks so important? To answer the question succinctly: Are you more apt to trust a website that is cited by 50,000 other sources or one that is cited by only one or two other sources? Google relies on complex algorithms that weigh hundreds of factors to determine rankings, so that Googlers see the best, most appropriate search results. Backlinks are one of the most important ranking factors because backlinks indicate a website is trusted by others. More quality backlinks = a more reputable website. Pages that rank #1 on Google have on average 2.7x as many backlinks as those in position #2. In a murky internet, backlinks talk. They cut through the noise and help Google surface content that is most valuable and trusted. Google has a vested interest in showing you the best results. They know if their results stink, you’ll go use Yahoo or Bing instead. Table of Contents How to Get Backlinks to Your Site: 1. Conduct email outreach 2. Guest posting 3. PR 4.

Help a Reporter Out (HARO) 5 Tools to Get Backlinks to Your Site Final Thoughts How to Get Backlinks to Your Site: While Google likes “natural” backlinks — ones that arise organically over time, you can definitely speed up the process by using any one of the following tactics. As with everything, it takes time and effort to get the job done right. This list will help you focus on the most effective strategies. Word to the wise: Not all backlinks are created equal. It’s best to focus on authoritative sites that have many backlinks themselves and/or a high domain authority (a measure of a site’s repute). Use an SEO software tool to see which sites are worth pursuing. On a budget? Just use your best judgement. 1. Conduct email outreach Email outreach is the process of reaching out to key figures and site owners via email and requesting a backlink. In a survey of our Growth Marketing Pro readers, a majority — 37.5% — said that link outreach was the best way to get backlinks. I agree. Connecting with your industry peers and getting placement on their blog or site is a great way to generate backlinks fast. May, 2020 GMP Survey Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Compile a list of contacts First, you need a list of people to reach out to. Use a tool like BuzzStream to find influencers and manage relationships. Feel free to leverage your network on LinkedIn. Heck, even use the “contact us” form on the website! I recommend compiling your list in Google Sheets to stay organized. Sleuth the internet for the email addresses of the contacts. Or, hire a virtual assistant on Upwork to help you find their contact information. Step 2: Reach out Personalize each email to each prospect. Get straight to the point. Request a link to your website in a relevant place on their site. Make it really easy for them but showing them exactly where they should link to you. Here’s a template you can use: Hi [webmaster]! I’m [name] and I write for [your site]. I’m reaching out to you because I saw your article [their article URL] and believe a link to [your article] would be perfect in the sentence [the sentence you want your link in]. Would you be willing to add it? I’d be extremely grateful! Thanks! [name] Step 3: Follow up Follow up if you don’t hear back. Sending multiple sales prospecting emails results in higher response rates. So you can’t afford not to follow up. 2. Guest posting Guest posting is the practice of writing an article and publishing it on another website. It can help you build high quality backlinks and reach a new audience online. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Use Google to find sites that accept guest posts Type in the following queries on Google: Your keyword + “Write for us” Your keyword + “Become an author” Your keyword + “Guest post” Compile a list of potential sites you can write for. I recommend compiling your list in Google Sheets to stay organized. Dig around on the internet for the email addresses of the contacts. Or, hire a virtual assistant on Upwork to help you find their contact information. Step 2: Reach out Here’s a template you can use: Hi [webmaster]! I’m [name] and I write for [your site]. I’m reaching out to you because I would like to contribute a post to your blog. Here are some topics I think your readers would love: –[post idea #1] –[post idea #2] –[post idea #3] Please let me know if you’re interested in any of these. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thanks! [name] Follow up in a few days if you don’t hear back. Step 3: Submit your article Focus on providing value. Don’t be overly promotional. 79% of editors say that guest content they receive is too promotional. Pro tip: You can reach out to the same websites for backlinks and for guest post opportunities. It never hurts to ask another blog if they’re willing to accept a guest post (even if they don’t explicitly say they do). 3. PR Press is one incredible way to garner backlinks. Think about how many times you or your business generate small nuggets of news. Perhaps you redesigned your site, came up with a new product, or hired a noteworthy executive. All of those moments are opportunities to create buzz and get some backlinks. If you’re serious about SEO, it’s important you take advantage of those opportunities. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Come up with the story Think about your product roadmap or the plans for your business over the next weeks and months. Consider all the great work you’re doing and narrow down to a few interesting stories. Some ideas: A redesign of your site A brand new product A new partnership A pivot in business model An acquisition of a smaller company An interesting survey or proprietary data insight Step 2: Create a press release Write a press release. Typically, releases are a few hundred words and follow AP format. It’s important to cover who you are, why the news is important, the particulars of the news, and anything else interesting. Put the release out on Newswire and distribute your release. You will get backlinks just from that proliferation of your piece. Step 3: Find other editors and bloggers who might be interested Make a list of industry publications that might be interested in your news. Enrich the list with their email addresses or LinkedIn profiles. If the news is big, you should reach out to 30-50 relevant editors. If it’s small news you can either skip this step or reach out to 5-10 friendlies. After all, this is about maximizing your effort and time. Don’t spend days pitching editors about your site rebrand — it will probably fall on deaf ears. 4. Reverse guest blogging Reverse guest blogging is when you get influencers in your industry to write guest posts for your blog. Getting others to write for your blog can boost your credibility. 62.96% of readers perceive blogs with multiple contributors as more credible. More importantly, if you allow someone to guest post on your site, you should definitely request they link to their guest post from their site… or at least their social media. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Compile a list of contributors Use Google or LinkedIn to find contributors. Don’t aim too high. Start with blogs and influencers with small to medium followings. If you’re not a big publication, the big guys might not be interested in the exposure on your site. Step 2: Reach out to them Let them know what’s in it for them. Exposure and backlinks to their site of course! Step 3: Publish the content Don’t forget to thank your contributors. 5. Create a blog A blog is a site that gets regularly updated with new content. Publishing great content can help you build brand awareness, get content indexed in Google, and get backlinks… particularly if you’re writing really insightful, professional stuff. Read: How to Write a Blog Post to Increase SEO Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Create a blog Starting a blog only takes about 10 minutes. Read our article about How to Start a WordPress Blog to get the step by step instructions. Because WordPress is a super Google-friendly platform, it’s usually considered the best for SEO. Step 2: Write your content Use tools like GrowthBar to find relevant keywords to write about. Go in-depth with your content. List posts generate more links and shares than other content formats. But again, if you publish well-written, engaging content, you will inevitably garner natural backlinks as others discover it. Step 3: Publish and promote Get the word out promote your post on social to generate a traffic train! I’ve found time and time again, if you write about 15 blog posts about topics related to your product offering, you will make sales online. 6. Publish an ultimate guide An ultimate guide is a comprehensive article that covers everything on a particular topic. They take more work to write than a standard blog post, but they generate more backlinks. That’s because they’re more discoverable than other posts, given the number of long-tail keywords, plus they simply have more opportunity to garner backlinks, given all the great information contained in the post. I would consider this post an ultimate guide on backlinking. In general, ultimate guides should be 3,000+ words long and should be extremely well researched. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Research potential topics Again, use a keyword tool like GrowthBar to uncover all the long-tail search terms your audience is searching for. Try and weave them into your piece. Step 2: Write your content Analyze other pages that are ranking for your target keyword. You’ll want to look at the word count and content of the #1 and #2 results in the Google search engine results page (SERP). Make your content even better. Try GrowthBar >> 7. Create tangential content Are you in a “boring” niche or industry? You can still get quality backlinks. Tangential content is content on a topic that is related to a brand. An example might be a furniture company publishing content on interior design. Tangential content leads to 77% more social shares than on-brand content. Why? Because it looks less overtly promotional. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Brainstorm related topics Consider trending topics that are related to your brand (e.g., upcoming events). Use Google News, Quora, and GrowthBar to find the other nuggets users want to hear. Step 2: Write your content Research and write your content. Tangential content often performs best with click-bait headlines and grandiose (but accurate) statistics and claims. Be hyperbolic. You’re going for clicks and shares. Step 3: Publish to your site Or offer it as a guest post to another site. 8. Publish an expert roundup An expert roundup is a compilation of tips from recognized authorities. It’s a great way to build relationships and leverage the credibility of others to build your own. You can also parlay those relationships into guest posts or link exchanges. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Choose a topic Research topics that are relevant to your business. It’s best to ask a very specific question. Step 2: Find and reach out to experts Send a short prompt and ask for their thoughts. It’s easiest if you use a tool like Google Forms to collect answers. It makes it really easy for the responder and you. Step 3: Compile and publish the roundup Don’t forget to thank each person who contributed and ask them to share on their social media or blog! 9. Curate a list of resources Content curation is the process of gathering existing content around a specific topic. It creates a helpful resource for your readers, which in turn can attract quality links. The end result is usually some sort of listical that’s packed full of information. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Compile a list of resources Search for the best resources on a particular topic. Find the top 20+. Step 2: Organize your links Put them into sections to make them readable. Readability is key. Nobody wants to sift through a dry list of resources or a copy and pasted encyclopedia. Your list should be curated. 10. Publish a whitepaper A whitepaper is an in-depth report that breaks down a complex topic. Publishing these can build your authority and attract tons of quality backlinks. It’s particularly effective in niches that require serious expertise like technology, healthcare, or education. This whitepaper from Cisco has 2,592 links. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Research a topic What are pressing issues in your industry now? Search Google News for the juicy stuff everyone is buzzing about. Step 2: Write your whitepaper Use a whitepaper template to create an eye-catching report. Make it comprehensive and include images. Make sure to cite your sources to build maximum credibility. Step 3: Publish and promote Publish your whitepaper to your site. 11. Post on social media Social networks are another channel you can leverage to get backlinks to your site. While social media links are technically no-follow links (they don’t pass any SEO juice), I think there’s enough evidence out there to make a case that they do show signals to Google that increase domain authority. A case study was conducted where a website link was shared over 130,000 times on Facebook and the site shot up to first position pertaining to the keywords. So while social media is a weak signal, it certainly helps. There are an estimated 3.81 billion social media users in the world. This is a huge pie. So don’t ignore it! (Source) Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Create social media profiles Start with the popular networks—Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Completely fill out your profiles and include a link to your site. Step 2: Share engaging content Facebook posts with images see 2.3x more engagement. Step 3: Engage with your audience Interact with your followers and key figures to build a following. If you or people you know have large followings, make sure to get them to post. It certainly can’t hurt. 12. Create an infographic Infographics present data and other information into a visual graphic that’s easy to understand. A well-made infographic has the potential to go viral and become a backlink magnet. This post has several infographics that I’ve cited throughout… garnering backlinks for the owners of the infographics. It has almost a thousand backlinks. That’s a lot for a graphic that probably cost a couple hundred dollars in design resources to make. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Compile your data Gather raw data. Compile your sources. You can survey your own audience, post polls on Facebook or LinkedIn, or even email friends and family. As long as you cite your source, you should feel free to gather data however you can. Step 2: Create your infographic Use Canva to create your infographic. Choose a template and add interactive charts. Step 3: Publish to your site Publish on other platforms to spread the word and begin distribution: Visual.ly Daily Infographic Infographics Showcase Cool Infographics Flickr 13. Submit videos Videos are a great way to showcase your expertise and get more backlinks. YouTube is bigger than Yahoo, Bing, and AOL combined. It’s a search engine in its own right. So if you can create video content, by all means do it! And in general, YouTube SEO is untapped. In the same survey of our audience, 89% of Growth Marketing Pro readers say they haven’t tried YouTube SEO. That is absolutely staggering! May, 2020 Growth Marketing Pro survey Not only does a video help you with your YouTube SEO, it helps with your website’s SEO if you embed it in your site. That’s because videos keep users on page longer, which is a signal to Google that your site has valuable content. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Create a video Research a topic your audience would be interested in. Record and edit your video. Step 2: Post to video platforms Start on YouTube. Share to other sites like Vimeo and Dailymotion. If it’s comical, throw it on Reddit and Imgur. There’s a whole distribution network for videos on the internet. Step 3: Send your embed code Share your video to get the word out. Send bloggers who might be interested your embed code. 14. Find broken backlinks Broken backlink building involves finding broken backlinks on the web and getting them replaced with a link to your site. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Compile a list of sites Search for your target keywords. Put together a list of sites in your niche. Step 2: Look for broken links Use the free Broken Link Checker tool from Ahrefs. The goal is to find sites with broken links and have them replace their broken links with links to your site. Step 3: Reach out Here’s a template you can use: Hi [name], I came across your page here: [link] I noticed the link to [broken link] is no longer working. I recently published a new piece of content here that I think would be a good replacement: [new link] Hope this helps! [your name] The site owner should be pretty happy that you reached out to help them correct their broken link… so happy that you may have luck getting them to replace the broken link with one to your site! 15. Build local citations Local citations are online mentions of a business. Citation signals are an important ranking factor for local SEO. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Submit your site to local directories Start with Google My Business. Here’s a list of the top local citations by country. Step 2: Completely fill out all profiles Google appreciates when local businesses create local citations. Keep NAP consistent for each site. NAP stands for Name, Address, and Phone Number. 16. Spy on your competitors Your competitors are a goldmine of even more link building opportunities. Use any of the techniques on this list once you have a big list of competitors’ backlinks. After all, if they’re writing about your competitors, they’ll probably be inclined to write about you. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Compile a list of competing sites Search for your target keywords. Compile a list of the top ranking sites. Also, use your brain! You probably know a bunch of the competitors in the space. Step 2: Analyze their backlink profiles Use the backlink checker from SEMrush, Ahrefs, Moz, or GrowthBar. These tools will allow you to see all the backlinks of a particular website and the domain authority of those backlinks — so you can prioritize your outreach. Step 3: Replicate those links Analyze and replicate the links. You won’t be able to copy all of them, but you’ll find more link building opportunities. If you’re feeling really feisty, you can reach out to the webmaster and ask them to replace the link to your competitor with a link to your site. 17. Post on question and answer sites Question and answer sites allow users to post a question and anyone can respond with an answer. They tend to be a goldmines for producing traffic. Here’s an example from Quora: Quora links are no-follow and while there isn’t a direct SEO benefit (according to Google), there is some overwhelming evidence that those links do in fact help. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Search for your keyword Use Quora or Yahoo Answers to find questions. But also look for sites in your niche that have forums or Q&A sections. Step 2: Post an in-depth answer Post a thoughtful answer. See how other answers look on those sites. They’re generally well written and comprehensive. This strategy takes work. It’s like keeping another blog! So make sure to make your words count and respond only to topics related to your offering. Step 3: Include a link back to your site Mention your site as an additional resource. 18. Create a quiz Quizzes are a fun way to engage directly with your visitors. They also get tons of shares and backlinks. This quiz from BuzzFeed has over 400 backlinks: Quizzes, like videos, also have direct SEO benefit in that they keep readers on page longer — a signal to Google that your content is valuable. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Make a quiz Use a quiz maker to create your quiz. Make it fun and engaging. You can even be a bit controversial or hyperbolic in your quiz. Your goal is to get backlinks, not make friends! Step 2: Share your quiz Post your quiz to your social media profiles and embed it into your site. WordPress has a bunch of quiz plugins to make this easy. Ask your followers to share their results. Step 3: Invite influencers Invite influencers to take your quiz or share it with their audience. 19. Reclaim unlinked brand mentions A brand mention is an online reference of your brand, company, or product. Monitoring these can help you identify brand mentions that aren’t linking back to your site. For example, this is an unlinked brand mention to the –> Wall Street Journal <– Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Set up Google Alerts Set up Google Alerts to send emails whenever your brand or products are mentioned online. Google Alerts are pretty handy for following any number of topics or brands. Step 2: Send outreach emails Find sites that mention you, but don’t link back. Ask them to link to your site. 20. Submit to blog directories Blog directories are websites that categorize blogs into different categories. Submitting your blog to these directories can help you get more links. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Compile a list of directories Here’s a list of verified directories to help you out. Step 2: Submit your blog Create new accounts at each directory. Submit your blog to the relevant category. Step 3: Fill out your profile Some directories may require additional information. Add the name of your blog and a brief description. Easy, right? 21. Create an online tool This one is tough. But it can be hugely effective. Online tools are simply programs or applications that help users with a specific task. Building these tools and making them freely available is another powerful way to get links. This email signature generator from HubSpot has over 1,000 links. This tool is super simple and probably took one HubSpot engineer about a week to build. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Identify a common problem Brainstorm ideas of tools you can create. It needs to be relevant to your niche. After all, you want to acquire backlinks and users who might consider buying what you’re selling. It’s one of the reasons we made our SEO tool, GrowthBar! Step 2: Build a tool Hire a developer to build your online tool. You can find developers capable of building just about anything on Fiverr or Upwork. We made the first version of GrowthBar for only a couple thousand dollars. Step 3: Offer it on your site Make your tool available for free. Promote it to encourage others to use it. 22. Buy existing sites If you have the budget, you can acquire existing sites and add a link to your site. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Research domains Search on Google for your target keywords. Look for domains that haven’t been updated in a while. They may be interested in selling. Step 2: Use website marketplaces Alternatively, you can use marketplaces like Flippa. Step 3: Buy the website Finalize the sale. Add a link to your site. Be careful with this strategy. While it can be really effective, it’s not without risk. Google is aware of this strategy and can penalize you if the site is very unrelated to your offering. Many entrepreneurs start out by simply buying an old domain and building their new site on top of that site. This means you start from second base, with a few backlinks already — meaning you have some existing domain authority before ever writing a word of content! 23. Create a scholarship SEOs who have been around the block for a few years probably know this hack. Scholarships are financial awards that are granted to students who meet specific academic criteria. Creating a scholarship means you can help a student fund their education and build powerful .edu links. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Create a scholarship Make a sizable scholarship of at least $500. Step 2: Create a page Create a new page that lists details about your scholarship including any requirements. Step 3: Reach out to schools Use this search operator: Inurl: .edu + “outside scholarships” Reach out and let schools know about your scholarship. If you’re lucky enough to get a positive response, you can get .edu backlinks — some of the most powerful backlinks on the internet. 24. Sponsor an event Events aren’t cheap to organize. Organizers are always looking for sponsors to help them raise funds. Sponsoring an event like a local meetup or an industry conference can earn you backlinks. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Search for events Use this search string: “City” + “become a sponsor” Step 2: Reach out Find the event organizer’s email address. Send an email indicating your interest in sponsoring their event. Step 3: Send your donation Request a link on their site. 25. Help a Reporter Out (HARO) HARO is a free service that connects journalists and industry experts. By helping a reporter out, you’ll be able to earn quality links from major publications….Hopefully not Fox News, since it’s nothing more than a propaganda machine (oops did I say that?). Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Create an account You’ll receive several emails a day. Step 2: Send your pitch Bigger media outlets receive tons of responses. Send a personalized pitch with in-depth answers to make yours stand out. Step 3: Sign up for a paid account You can get even more out of HARO with a paid account—set up keyword alerts, search online, create profiles, and more. 5 Tools to Get Backlinks to Your Site You can do it yourself or you can use these tools to get backlinks to your site and grow your traffic. All of them will expedite your backlinking process! I’m partial to GrowthBar, of course. 1.

It enables you to find backlink targets and capitalize them. Plus, track your keyword rankings over time for only $29/month. 2.

Final Thoughts SEO is only getting more important. As Facebook and Google Ads get more expensive, SEO is one of the last “free and cheap” channels left. In fact, when we surveyed our audience, almost 78% of them said SEO will be more impactful in 2021 than it is in 2020! It’s a channel you can’t afford to sleep on. May, 2020 Growth Marketing Pro survey So if you’re going to take SEO seriously, you need to get serious about backlinks. Remember this: different strategies work better for different industries. You’d be smart to test out a few of these and see which of them webmasters react best to. Use these proven strategies to get backlinks to your site and outrank your competitors. God speed!

Also, I started this blog, Growth Marketing Pro and built it into a 7-figure marketing agency in 24 months. Before that, I was the Head of Marketing for a startup called PlushCare, which sold for $450 million.

And they’re a necessary part of any good search engine optimization (SEO) strategy. In fact, backlinks are the #1 way we leapfrogged all of our competition and grew Growth Marketing Pro into the biggest growth marketing blog on the internet — in under 18 months. It’s how we get 14,543 visitors to our Best Webinar Software post every month. It’s also how we consistently drive 50,000 visitors to this blog every month. When I left my day job at a telemedicine company, I became a cofounder at blog called ManlyWellness. When I came on board, I grew that blog to 116,961 organic visitors/month in just a couple months! No joke. Why are backlinks so important? To answer the question succinctly: Are you more apt to trust a website that is cited by 50,000 other sources or one that is cited by only one or two other sources? Google relies on complex algorithms that weigh hundreds of factors to determine rankings, so that Googlers see the best, most appropriate search results. Backlinks are one of the most important ranking factors because backlinks indicate a website is trusted by others. More quality backlinks = a more reputable website. Pages that rank #1 on Google have on average 2.7x as many backlinks as those in position #2. In a murky internet, backlinks talk. They cut through the noise and help Google surface content that is most valuable and trusted. Google has a vested interest in showing you the best results. They know if their results stink, you’ll go use Yahoo or Bing instead. Table of Contents How to Get Backlinks to Your Site: 1. Conduct email outreach 2. Guest posting 3. PR 4.

Help a Reporter Out (HARO) 5 Tools to Get Backlinks to Your Site Final Thoughts How to Get Backlinks to Your Site: While Google likes “natural” backlinks — ones that arise organically over time, you can definitely speed up the process by using any one of the following tactics. As with everything, it takes time and effort to get the job done right. This list will help you focus on the most effective strategies. Word to the wise: Not all backlinks are created equal. It’s best to focus on authoritative sites that have many backlinks themselves and/or a high domain authority (a measure of a site’s repute). Use an SEO software tool to see which sites are worth pursuing. On a budget? Just use your best judgement. 1. Conduct email outreach Email outreach is the process of reaching out to key figures and site owners via email and requesting a backlink. In a survey of our Growth Marketing Pro readers, a majority — 37.5% — said that link outreach was the best way to get backlinks. I agree. Connecting with your industry peers and getting placement on their blog or site is a great way to generate backlinks fast. May, 2020 GMP Survey Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Compile a list of contacts First, you need a list of people to reach out to. Use a tool like BuzzStream to find influencers and manage relationships. Feel free to leverage your network on LinkedIn. Heck, even use the “contact us” form on the website! I recommend compiling your list in Google Sheets to stay organized. Sleuth the internet for the email addresses of the contacts. Or, hire a virtual assistant on Upwork to help you find their contact information. Step 2: Reach out Personalize each email to each prospect. Get straight to the point. Request a link to your website in a relevant place on their site. Make it really easy for them but showing them exactly where they should link to you. Here’s a template you can use: Hi [webmaster]! I’m [name] and I write for [your site]. I’m reaching out to you because I saw your article [their article URL] and believe a link to [your article] would be perfect in the sentence [the sentence you want your link in]. Would you be willing to add it? I’d be extremely grateful! Thanks! [name] Step 3: Follow up Follow up if you don’t hear back. Sending multiple sales prospecting emails results in higher response rates. So you can’t afford not to follow up. 2. Guest posting Guest posting is the practice of writing an article and publishing it on another website. It can help you build high quality backlinks and reach a new audience online. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Use Google to find sites that accept guest posts Type in the following queries on Google: Your keyword + “Write for us” Your keyword + “Become an author” Your keyword + “Guest post” Compile a list of potential sites you can write for. I recommend compiling your list in Google Sheets to stay organized. Dig around on the internet for the email addresses of the contacts. Or, hire a virtual assistant on Upwork to help you find their contact information. Step 2: Reach out Here’s a template you can use: Hi [webmaster]! I’m [name] and I write for [your site]. I’m reaching out to you because I would like to contribute a post to your blog. Here are some topics I think your readers would love: –[post idea #1] –[post idea #2] –[post idea #3] Please let me know if you’re interested in any of these. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thanks! [name] Follow up in a few days if you don’t hear back. Step 3: Submit your article Focus on providing value. Don’t be overly promotional. 79% of editors say that guest content they receive is too promotional. Pro tip: You can reach out to the same websites for backlinks and for guest post opportunities. It never hurts to ask another blog if they’re willing to accept a guest post (even if they don’t explicitly say they do). 3. PR Press is one incredible way to garner backlinks. Think about how many times you or your business generate small nuggets of news. Perhaps you redesigned your site, came up with a new product, or hired a noteworthy executive. All of those moments are opportunities to create buzz and get some backlinks. If you’re serious about SEO, it’s important you take advantage of those opportunities. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Come up with the story Think about your product roadmap or the plans for your business over the next weeks and months. Consider all the great work you’re doing and narrow down to a few interesting stories. Some ideas: A redesign of your site A brand new product A new partnership A pivot in business model An acquisition of a smaller company An interesting survey or proprietary data insight Step 2: Create a press release Write a press release. Typically, releases are a few hundred words and follow AP format. It’s important to cover who you are, why the news is important, the particulars of the news, and anything else interesting. Put the release out on Newswire and distribute your release. You will get backlinks just from that proliferation of your piece. Step 3: Find other editors and bloggers who might be interested Make a list of industry publications that might be interested in your news. Enrich the list with their email addresses or LinkedIn profiles. If the news is big, you should reach out to 30-50 relevant editors. If it’s small news you can either skip this step or reach out to 5-10 friendlies. After all, this is about maximizing your effort and time. Don’t spend days pitching editors about your site rebrand — it will probably fall on deaf ears. 4. Reverse guest blogging Reverse guest blogging is when you get influencers in your industry to write guest posts for your blog. Getting others to write for your blog can boost your credibility. 62.96% of readers perceive blogs with multiple contributors as more credible. More importantly, if you allow someone to guest post on your site, you should definitely request they link to their guest post from their site… or at least their social media. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Compile a list of contributors Use Google or LinkedIn to find contributors. Don’t aim too high. Start with blogs and influencers with small to medium followings. If you’re not a big publication, the big guys might not be interested in the exposure on your site. Step 2: Reach out to them Let them know what’s in it for them. Exposure and backlinks to their site of course! Step 3: Publish the content Don’t forget to thank your contributors. 5. Create a blog A blog is a site that gets regularly updated with new content. Publishing great content can help you build brand awareness, get content indexed in Google, and get backlinks… particularly if you’re writing really insightful, professional stuff. Read: How to Write a Blog Post to Increase SEO Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Create a blog Starting a blog only takes about 10 minutes. Read our article about How to Start a WordPress Blog to get the step by step instructions. Because WordPress is a super Google-friendly platform, it’s usually considered the best for SEO. Step 2: Write your content Use tools like GrowthBar to find relevant keywords to write about. Go in-depth with your content. List posts generate more links and shares than other content formats. But again, if you publish well-written, engaging content, you will inevitably garner natural backlinks as others discover it. Step 3: Publish and promote Get the word out promote your post on social to generate a traffic train! I’ve found time and time again, if you write about 15 blog posts about topics related to your product offering, you will make sales online. 6. Publish an ultimate guide An ultimate guide is a comprehensive article that covers everything on a particular topic. They take more work to write than a standard blog post, but they generate more backlinks. That’s because they’re more discoverable than other posts, given the number of long-tail keywords, plus they simply have more opportunity to garner backlinks, given all the great information contained in the post. I would consider this post an ultimate guide on backlinking. In general, ultimate guides should be 3,000+ words long and should be extremely well researched. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Research potential topics Again, use a keyword tool like GrowthBar to uncover all the long-tail search terms your audience is searching for. Try and weave them into your piece. Step 2: Write your content Analyze other pages that are ranking for your target keyword. You’ll want to look at the word count and content of the #1 and #2 results in the Google search engine results page (SERP). Make your content even better. Try GrowthBar >> 7. Create tangential content Are you in a “boring” niche or industry? You can still get quality backlinks. Tangential content is content on a topic that is related to a brand. An example might be a furniture company publishing content on interior design. Tangential content leads to 77% more social shares than on-brand content. Why? Because it looks less overtly promotional. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Brainstorm related topics Consider trending topics that are related to your brand (e.g., upcoming events). Use Google News, Quora, and GrowthBar to find the other nuggets users want to hear. Step 2: Write your content Research and write your content. Tangential content often performs best with click-bait headlines and grandiose (but accurate) statistics and claims. Be hyperbolic. You’re going for clicks and shares. Step 3: Publish to your site Or offer it as a guest post to another site. 8. Publish an expert roundup An expert roundup is a compilation of tips from recognized authorities. It’s a great way to build relationships and leverage the credibility of others to build your own. You can also parlay those relationships into guest posts or link exchanges. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Choose a topic Research topics that are relevant to your business. It’s best to ask a very specific question. Step 2: Find and reach out to experts Send a short prompt and ask for their thoughts. It’s easiest if you use a tool like Google Forms to collect answers. It makes it really easy for the responder and you. Step 3: Compile and publish the roundup Don’t forget to thank each person who contributed and ask them to share on their social media or blog! 9. Curate a list of resources Content curation is the process of gathering existing content around a specific topic. It creates a helpful resource for your readers, which in turn can attract quality links. The end result is usually some sort of listical that’s packed full of information. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Compile a list of resources Search for the best resources on a particular topic. Find the top 20+. Step 2: Organize your links Put them into sections to make them readable. Readability is key. Nobody wants to sift through a dry list of resources or a copy and pasted encyclopedia. Your list should be curated. 10. Publish a whitepaper A whitepaper is an in-depth report that breaks down a complex topic. Publishing these can build your authority and attract tons of quality backlinks. It’s particularly effective in niches that require serious expertise like technology, healthcare, or education. This whitepaper from Cisco has 2,592 links. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Research a topic What are pressing issues in your industry now? Search Google News for the juicy stuff everyone is buzzing about. Step 2: Write your whitepaper Use a whitepaper template to create an eye-catching report. Make it comprehensive and include images. Make sure to cite your sources to build maximum credibility. Step 3: Publish and promote Publish your whitepaper to your site. 11. Post on social media Social networks are another channel you can leverage to get backlinks to your site. While social media links are technically no-follow links (they don’t pass any SEO juice), I think there’s enough evidence out there to make a case that they do show signals to Google that increase domain authority. A case study was conducted where a website link was shared over 130,000 times on Facebook and the site shot up to first position pertaining to the keywords. So while social media is a weak signal, it certainly helps. There are an estimated 3.81 billion social media users in the world. This is a huge pie. So don’t ignore it! (Source) Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Create social media profiles Start with the popular networks—Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Completely fill out your profiles and include a link to your site. Step 2: Share engaging content Facebook posts with images see 2.3x more engagement. Step 3: Engage with your audience Interact with your followers and key figures to build a following. If you or people you know have large followings, make sure to get them to post. It certainly can’t hurt. 12. Create an infographic Infographics present data and other information into a visual graphic that’s easy to understand. A well-made infographic has the potential to go viral and become a backlink magnet. This post has several infographics that I’ve cited throughout… garnering backlinks for the owners of the infographics. It has almost a thousand backlinks. That’s a lot for a graphic that probably cost a couple hundred dollars in design resources to make. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Compile your data Gather raw data. Compile your sources. You can survey your own audience, post polls on Facebook or LinkedIn, or even email friends and family. As long as you cite your source, you should feel free to gather data however you can. Step 2: Create your infographic Use Canva to create your infographic. Choose a template and add interactive charts. Step 3: Publish to your site Publish on other platforms to spread the word and begin distribution: Visual.ly Daily Infographic Infographics Showcase Cool Infographics Flickr 13. Submit videos Videos are a great way to showcase your expertise and get more backlinks. YouTube is bigger than Yahoo, Bing, and AOL combined. It’s a search engine in its own right. So if you can create video content, by all means do it! And in general, YouTube SEO is untapped. In the same survey of our audience, 89% of Growth Marketing Pro readers say they haven’t tried YouTube SEO. That is absolutely staggering! May, 2020 Growth Marketing Pro survey Not only does a video help you with your YouTube SEO, it helps with your website’s SEO if you embed it in your site. That’s because videos keep users on page longer, which is a signal to Google that your site has valuable content. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Create a video Research a topic your audience would be interested in. Record and edit your video. Step 2: Post to video platforms Start on YouTube. Share to other sites like Vimeo and Dailymotion. If it’s comical, throw it on Reddit and Imgur. There’s a whole distribution network for videos on the internet. Step 3: Send your embed code Share your video to get the word out. Send bloggers who might be interested your embed code. 14. Find broken backlinks Broken backlink building involves finding broken backlinks on the web and getting them replaced with a link to your site. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Compile a list of sites Search for your target keywords. Put together a list of sites in your niche. Step 2: Look for broken links Use the free Broken Link Checker tool from Ahrefs. The goal is to find sites with broken links and have them replace their broken links with links to your site. Step 3: Reach out Here’s a template you can use: Hi [name], I came across your page here: [link] I noticed the link to [broken link] is no longer working. I recently published a new piece of content here that I think would be a good replacement: [new link] Hope this helps! [your name] The site owner should be pretty happy that you reached out to help them correct their broken link… so happy that you may have luck getting them to replace the broken link with one to your site! 15. Build local citations Local citations are online mentions of a business. Citation signals are an important ranking factor for local SEO. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Submit your site to local directories Start with Google My Business. Here’s a list of the top local citations by country. Step 2: Completely fill out all profiles Google appreciates when local businesses create local citations. Keep NAP consistent for each site. NAP stands for Name, Address, and Phone Number. 16. Spy on your competitors Your competitors are a goldmine of even more link building opportunities. Use any of the techniques on this list once you have a big list of competitors’ backlinks. After all, if they’re writing about your competitors, they’ll probably be inclined to write about you. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Compile a list of competing sites Search for your target keywords. Compile a list of the top ranking sites. Also, use your brain! You probably know a bunch of the competitors in the space. Step 2: Analyze their backlink profiles Use the backlink checker from SEMrush, Ahrefs, Moz, or GrowthBar. These tools will allow you to see all the backlinks of a particular website and the domain authority of those backlinks — so you can prioritize your outreach. Step 3: Replicate those links Analyze and replicate the links. You won’t be able to copy all of them, but you’ll find more link building opportunities. If you’re feeling really feisty, you can reach out to the webmaster and ask them to replace the link to your competitor with a link to your site. 17. Post on question and answer sites Question and answer sites allow users to post a question and anyone can respond with an answer. They tend to be a goldmines for producing traffic. Here’s an example from Quora: Quora links are no-follow and while there isn’t a direct SEO benefit (according to Google), there is some overwhelming evidence that those links do in fact help. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Search for your keyword Use Quora or Yahoo Answers to find questions. But also look for sites in your niche that have forums or Q&A sections. Step 2: Post an in-depth answer Post a thoughtful answer. See how other answers look on those sites. They’re generally well written and comprehensive. This strategy takes work. It’s like keeping another blog! So make sure to make your words count and respond only to topics related to your offering. Step 3: Include a link back to your site Mention your site as an additional resource. 18. Create a quiz Quizzes are a fun way to engage directly with your visitors. They also get tons of shares and backlinks. This quiz from BuzzFeed has over 400 backlinks: Quizzes, like videos, also have direct SEO benefit in that they keep readers on page longer — a signal to Google that your content is valuable. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Make a quiz Use a quiz maker to create your quiz. Make it fun and engaging. You can even be a bit controversial or hyperbolic in your quiz. Your goal is to get backlinks, not make friends! Step 2: Share your quiz Post your quiz to your social media profiles and embed it into your site. WordPress has a bunch of quiz plugins to make this easy. Ask your followers to share their results. Step 3: Invite influencers Invite influencers to take your quiz or share it with their audience. 19. Reclaim unlinked brand mentions A brand mention is an online reference of your brand, company, or product. Monitoring these can help you identify brand mentions that aren’t linking back to your site. For example, this is an unlinked brand mention to the –> Wall Street Journal <– Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Set up Google Alerts Set up Google Alerts to send emails whenever your brand or products are mentioned online. Google Alerts are pretty handy for following any number of topics or brands. Step 2: Send outreach emails Find sites that mention you, but don’t link back. Ask them to link to your site. 20. Submit to blog directories Blog directories are websites that categorize blogs into different categories. Submitting your blog to these directories can help you get more links. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Compile a list of directories Here’s a list of verified directories to help you out. Step 2: Submit your blog Create new accounts at each directory. Submit your blog to the relevant category. Step 3: Fill out your profile Some directories may require additional information. Add the name of your blog and a brief description. Easy, right? 21. Create an online tool This one is tough. But it can be hugely effective. Online tools are simply programs or applications that help users with a specific task. Building these tools and making them freely available is another powerful way to get links. This email signature generator from HubSpot has over 1,000 links. This tool is super simple and probably took one HubSpot engineer about a week to build. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Identify a common problem Brainstorm ideas of tools you can create. It needs to be relevant to your niche. After all, you want to acquire backlinks and users who might consider buying what you’re selling. It’s one of the reasons we made our SEO tool, GrowthBar! Step 2: Build a tool Hire a developer to build your online tool. You can find developers capable of building just about anything on Fiverr or Upwork. We made the first version of GrowthBar for only a couple thousand dollars. Step 3: Offer it on your site Make your tool available for free. Promote it to encourage others to use it. 22. Buy existing sites If you have the budget, you can acquire existing sites and add a link to your site. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Research domains Search on Google for your target keywords. Look for domains that haven’t been updated in a while. They may be interested in selling. Step 2: Use website marketplaces Alternatively, you can use marketplaces like Flippa. Step 3: Buy the website Finalize the sale. Add a link to your site. Be careful with this strategy. While it can be really effective, it’s not without risk. Google is aware of this strategy and can penalize you if the site is very unrelated to your offering. Many entrepreneurs start out by simply buying an old domain and building their new site on top of that site. This means you start from second base, with a few backlinks already — meaning you have some existing domain authority before ever writing a word of content! 23. Create a scholarship SEOs who have been around the block for a few years probably know this hack. Scholarships are financial awards that are granted to students who meet specific academic criteria. Creating a scholarship means you can help a student fund their education and build powerful .edu links. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Create a scholarship Make a sizable scholarship of at least $500. Step 2: Create a page Create a new page that lists details about your scholarship including any requirements. Step 3: Reach out to schools Use this search operator: Inurl: .edu + “outside scholarships” Reach out and let schools know about your scholarship. If you’re lucky enough to get a positive response, you can get .edu backlinks — some of the most powerful backlinks on the internet. 24. Sponsor an event Events aren’t cheap to organize. Organizers are always looking for sponsors to help them raise funds. Sponsoring an event like a local meetup or an industry conference can earn you backlinks. Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Search for events Use this search string: “City” + “become a sponsor” Step 2: Reach out Find the event organizer’s email address. Send an email indicating your interest in sponsoring their event. Step 3: Send your donation Request a link on their site. 25. Help a Reporter Out (HARO) HARO is a free service that connects journalists and industry experts. By helping a reporter out, you’ll be able to earn quality links from major publications….Hopefully not Fox News, since it’s nothing more than a propaganda machine (oops did I say that?). Here’s how to get started: Step 1: Create an account You’ll receive several emails a day. Step 2: Send your pitch Bigger media outlets receive tons of responses. Send a personalized pitch with in-depth answers to make yours stand out. Step 3: Sign up for a paid account You can get even more out of HARO with a paid account—set up keyword alerts, search online, create profiles, and more. 5 Tools to Get Backlinks to Your Site You can do it yourself or you can use these tools to get backlinks to your site and grow your traffic. All of them will expedite your backlinking process! I’m partial to GrowthBar, of course. 1. GrowthBar GrowthBar is an SEO tool that delivers keyword suggestions, top backlinks, word counts, and more—right from the search engine results page. It enables you to find backlink targets and capitalize them. Plus, track your keyword rankings over time for only $29/month. 2.

Buzzstream Buzzstream makes it easy to manage your email outreach and link building efforts. You can even use the tool to quickly find email addresses. Final Thoughts SEO is only getting more important. As Facebook and Google Ads get more expensive, SEO is one of the last “free and cheap” channels left. In fact, when we surveyed our audience, almost 78% of them said SEO will be more impactful in 2021 than it is in 2020! It’s a channel you can’t afford to sleep on. May, 2020 Growth Marketing Pro survey So if you’re going to take SEO seriously, you need to get serious about backlinks. Remember this: different strategies work better for different industries. You’d be smart to test out a few of these and see which of them webmasters react best to. Use these proven strategies to get backlinks to your site and outrank your competitors. God speed!

You can’t focus on one important pillar only to neglect another, otherwise your efforts in one area might ultimately be for nothing. Necessary website SEO tasks are often broken down in terms of three major categories: Website technical structure: Ensuring that your website offers a straightforward user experience in terms of page speed, mobile responsiveness, navigation, use of HTTPS, and so on. Onpage SEO: Publishing quality content based on keyword research. Offpage SEO: Gaining authority for your website from other websites, passed on via backlinks. Those who don’t know much about SEO oftentimes underestimate the importance of backlinks. They shrug it off as unimportant because they don’t understand why backlinks matter and the impact they can have on your website’s ability to rank in relevant search results. Let’s change that. The Importance of Backlinks To properly understand the importance of backlinks, it’s necessary to first discuss two concepts: domain authority and keyword difficulty. Domain authority, a phrase coined by popular SEO tool MOZ (another popular SEO tool, Ahrefs, refers to the same concept as domain rating), measures the perceived authority of your website in terms of other websites linking to it. Put another way, Google makes decisions around what to display in search, in what order, based on how other websites lend their authority to a website via links. Domain authority is measured from a scale from 1 to 100, with it becoming increasingly more difficult to jump from one number to the next as your domain authority gets closer to 100. If you’ve ever signed up to get your Klout score (RIP) or played Pokemon Go, you’ll be familiar with this same leveling concept. Keyword difficulty works in much the same way as domain authority, as it is also measured from 1 to 100 (and it’s similarly harder to rank for keyword difficulties as they approach 100). This metric helps you determine how hard it would be to rank for a given keyword. The reason that it’s worth discussing keyword difficulty at the same time as domain authority is because your domain authority will have a direct impact on your ability to rank for target keywords. As such, it’s important to go into keyword research with an understanding of your domain authority. You don’t want to waste time trying to target keywords with a high difficulty unless you’re a top website in the industry. In order to increase your likelihood of ranking for the terms you’re targeting, you’ll want to proactively work to build your domain authority. The best way to do that involves building backlinks. How to Be Backlink-Worthy: 10 Ideas So here’s the thing about building backlinks: executing outreach tasks are not all that different from sending cold emails to prospects. As such, for those who are put off by salespeople, you may feel like the art of backlink building involves being pushy and essentially begging various outlets to give you a link. But it doesn’t have to be this way. The following tactics for backlink building primarily focus on creating quality content and making others in your industry aware of it. Here are 10 ideas for building backlinks without begging: #1: Create an In-Depth Industry Resource Create mega resources on topics of importance to your audience. For example, Ryan Robinson’s How to Start a Blog mega guide ranks high in search and generates tens of thousands of dollars in affiliate revenue for him each month. Offering in-depth, step-by-step guides make it easy to justify linking to your website’s content when people are looking for additional resources to share in related articles. Like our guide to how expensive it is to hire writers. #2: Publish Original Research Blog articles written for professional purposes often link to external statistics and studies to help validate points made. So why not put forth the effort to gather your own original research and publish this information for other people to use (and link to!)? Orbit Media Studio’s annual blogger study provides an excellent example of this tactic in action. It’s often quoted and linked to by many reputable industry publications once new findings are released. #3: Be Controversial Publish industry thought leadership that makes people think. Try writing from a perspective that other people haven’t heard yet or wouldn’t expect. For ideas to spark your creativity, see what’s getting shared on Medium via their weekly content roundup newsletter. #4: Publish Expert Roundups that Provide Value In other words, don’t ask super generic questions and don’t just publish people’s answers without weaving ideas together and clarifying takeaways for the reader. Databox regularly publishes useful expert roundups that act as a great example for this tactic. #5: Create Infographics to Complement Written Content Adding supplementary media, like infographics or video, can help add dimension to your content and convince people that it’s worth linking to. Platforms like Easel.ly and Visme provide affordable infographic design services that anyone can use. #6: Create a “Best of” List Featuring Industry Influencers People love sharing awards they’ve won and “best of” lists that they’re part of on their websites. By publishing your own “best of” list, you’re creating an easy opportunity for influencers to link back to you. One Woman’s Shop list of the best sites for solopreneurs provides a good example of this tactic to inspire your own efforts. #7: Suggest a Link from an Unlinked Mention Some people claim that journalists shouldn’t link to brands mentioned in news stories, so don’t expect to make a lot of headway if that’s the type of content creator you’re negotiating with. But everything else, like company blogs, is fair game with the right approach. Use a tool like Awario for general mention tracking, which starts at $24/month when paid yearly. #8: Sponsor a Charity or Conference Although it’s not begging, getting a backlink via sponsorship still requires setting a budget around your backlink building efforts. Google doesn’t always like that — in fact, it’s against their terms of service to pay for backlinks. As that’s not necessarily the main reason people sponsor initiatives, you shouldn’t worry that you’ll get in trouble for spending money to get this type of backlink. #9: Pitch Content Creators via Help A Reporter Out Help a Report Out (HARO) is a thrice-daily email newsletter where journalists, organized by the subject they’re reporting on, can ask for expert contributions to pieces they’re working on. Cision, a PR database software tool, is the parent company behind this offering. HARO is free to sign up and submit responses to queries but you’ll have to have a top million website (or write for one) in order to be able to request queries from others. To find success with this backlink building tactic, you have to offer truly thoughtful and useful advice. You also have to respond in a timely manner, as most content creators using the service have tight deadlines. In my experience, HARO is one of the most approachable ways for taking control around backlink building efforts. #10: Try Guest Blogging Another one of the most effective ways to take backlink building into your control is by pitching content ideas to popular industry outlets. It’s on you to do the due diligence necessary to determine if an outlet grants do-follow links (or, links that pass on authority to your website, versus no-follow links, which don’t) — otherwise this effort won’t directly help with backlink building (though your article could still attract links from readers). WPMU DEV shares a guide for approaching this aspect of backlink building. You’ll either want to place links in the body of the article copy or in the author bio. Note that most outlets will want to limit your backlink placements to your author bio. A similar tactic for sharing your insights while generating backlinks is being a podcast guest (and getting a link back from the show notes). If you don’t like writing, this may be a more natural fit for building backlinks. Still looking for more ideas? Backlinko shares advanced techniques for backlink building if you want to mix things up. Backlink Request Pitch Email Template Even once you’ve created the content, the work isn’t done. Great content will likely earn backlinks on its own, if you’ve done your due diligence around content promotion and distribution. But you will also need to do some email outreach around your backlink building efforts in order to continuously build domain authority. Though each of the aforementioned backlink building tactics requires a slightly different approach, you’ll want to create a basic process around your email outreach effort. Start with this template and customize it for these various types of pitches, as well as your own brand personality: Hello [Name], I really enjoyed [Company’s] last article about [Topic]. It’s a great resource for people in the [vertical] industry, so I shared it with my Twitter followers (add link to show that you’re not making this up). We recently published a resource that your readers might find complementary to your article: [Topic with link]. Would you be willing to reference this resource in your article — perhaps in this sentence?: [Share suggested copy] We set forth to create the best resource about [topic] and would be grateful if you could help us reach more people who are looking for answers to their questions. Please let me know how [Your company] can help you out in return! For example, we could [share it on company social channels, on your email newsletter, or offer free access to a resource]. I’m looking forward to chatting about this in more detail! Thanks, [Name] [Title/Your company] How to Get What You Want: Backlink Negotiation 101 Not all backlink emails are the same — in fact, some backlink requests are just annoying. To put your best foot forward when it comes to sending backlink request outreach emails, consider the following tips: Customize the template to be personal and seem thoughtful in terms of your recipient. It’ll be harder for them to ignore and harder for them to reject your request without a good reason. Suggest a specific page where the backlink should go and the written copy to go with it. This takes the guesswork out of someone’s job when it comes to placing your backlink. Answer, “What’s in it for me?” on behalf of the person who you’re asking to grant a favor. The next section of this article can help you figure out how best to approach this. How to Repay the Favor of Placing a Backlink Don’t suggest a backlink trade — it’s like asking for a testimonial on LinkedIn and automatically giving the other person one in return. What I’m trying to say is that it doesn’t look as authentic when you’re trading links. If you get into the habit, it will be easy for human visitors or Google spiders to see. Instead, offer to provide value in terms of something else you can help with, such as: Sharing the resulting article update with your social followers. This is only really compelling if you have a good/relevant following. Including the post in your email newsletter (if you have a decent-sized list). Giving free access to your products or services (like one year access to a software service your company offers). SEO Tools to Track Backlink Building Efforts If you’re going to put the effort into building backlinks, you might as well take the time to measure your effectiveness. You’ll want to invest in some tools to help make this job easier. The two most important functionalities you want out of a tool for measuring backlink building efforts are backlink tracking and keyword ranking tracking. Backlink tracking notifies you as you gain or lose backlinks and keyword ranking tracking helps you understand how your website is ranking for the keywords you’re targeting (which is important because of how your website’s domain authority impacts your ability to rank). Unless you’re an enterprise company with an enterprise budget, the best all-in-one SEO tools for the job will be Ahrefs or SEMrush. SEMrush will be a better fit if you also do a lot of PPC advertising. There’s also Majestic but it’s focused almost entirely on backlinks when compared with these other tools that offer all-in-one features at the same price. Ahrefs, SEMrush, and Moz each offer plans starting around $99/month. If you’re looking for a budget option, Serpstat (plans start at $55.20/month when paid yearly) and SE Ranking (plans start at $31/month when paid yearly) are your next best bets. Serpstat is a little more limited in that it offers keyword ranking tracking but does not track backlinks. SE Ranking offers rank tracking and manual backlink monitoring, which will be a more tedious process than what you’d get using Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Majestic. Note that both Serpstat and SE Ranking offer several all-in-one SEO tool features that make them useful for more than just backlink-related measurement. Besides using SEO tools to assist your efforts, you’ll also want to keep track of who you’ve been emailing and who you should follow up with. The low tech method? Use Gmail’s snooze functionality to resurface emails that may require follow up. A more organized option would be to create a backlink tracking spreadsheet on Google Sheets. Search Engine Journal offers additional suggestions for backlink tools and keyword rank tracking tools. Final Thoughts: How to Get Backlinks without Begging Understanding specific strategies for building backlinks can make the process feel a little less overwhelming. There’s no need to master them all — pick a few favorites and fine-tune your approach over time as you observe how recipients react.

Second, following relevant topics on Quora will help you stay up-to-date with industry news and trends. And third, commenting on questions and answers can help you get exposure for your business. Other benefits of using Quora for SEO include: Gaining exposure for your business One of the best things about using Quora for SEO is gaining exposure for your business. By answering questions and leaving comments, you’ll be able to reach a large audience of potential customers. Quora is an ideal platform for promoting your business because it has a large user base. With over 300 million users, you’ll be able to get in front of a wide range of people who might be interested in what you have to offer. In addition, Quora is used by people from all over the world. This makes it a great place to promote your business to a global audience. So if you’re looking for a way to get more exposure for your business, Quora is an excellent option for you. Driving traffic to your site Quora can also help drive more people to your website. If you answer relevant questions, you’ll give visitors an incentive to click on your profile and visit your website to learn more about what you have to offer. Plus, any time someone comments on one of the answers that you’ve given, they’ll be able to see your profile and website URL. Writing a question or answer that attracts a lot of comments can help boost your SEO. When you get more exposure for your business, it will increase the number of people that visit your site. And when you write good answers on Quora, you might even end up seeing your content shared on social media and other sites online. So by using Quora, you’ll be able to successfully grow your site and establish yourself as an industry leader. Getting in front of your target audience As a business owner, you’ll always be thinking about how to get in front of your target audience. One of the best parts of using Quora for SEO is that it allows you to reach people interested in what you have to offer. If someone asks a question about your industry on Quora, they’re probably already interested in what you have to offer. If you answer the question, not only will people see your profile and website URL, but they’ll be able to learn more about your brand as well. Quora users are looking for answers because they want the information to help them solve a problem. When you answer a question with valuable insight, you’ll give people a reason to check out your profile and website. And if someone doesn’t want your advice, they might even be willing to retweet the answer to their followers! Being exposed to new audiences Don’t worry about getting lost in the noise if you’re worried about trying new things on social media sites like Quora. Every time you answer a question or post new content, it’ll be seen by people who are already interested in your brand. This makes it easier to get more exposure without feeling overwhelmed by irrelevant users. And because Quora has such a large user base, you’re bound to find new customers that might not have heard of you before. Quora is a great way to boost your SEO because it can expose you to new audiences interested in your brand. Stay up-to-date with industry news and trends. Quora can also help keep you up-to-date on the latest industry news and trends, which is especially important for businesses that want to stay competitive. It’s a great way to see what questions and issues people in your industry are talking about, and it can also help you find new content ideas for your blog or website, generate leads, and get inspiration for new products and services that you could offer. Quora is a valuable tool for any marketing strategy because it allows you to connect with Influencers in your industry. You’ll be able to discuss ways to work together, and the person who started the discussion might even become a customer! Find out what works well for other businesses. Another great way Quora can help your business is by offering insights into how other companies are marketing their products or services. Use it to get inspiration for your marketing campaigns by learning what posts work well for other businesses in your industry. You can even ask questions about how they did it so that you can see the results first-hand! Quora allows you to get advice from companies that have already tried different tactics, which can be a great way to learn from their experiences. You can also use the site to get ideas for content and products you could offer. If other business owners are talking about a problem in your industry, then there’s probably a demand for it, which is something else that will help with your SEO. One of the best ways to see what works well for your competition is by doing a thorough competitor analysis. Contact us today to learn how we can reverse engineer your competition’s digital marketing tactics and beat them at their own game! Leverage influencers and partners Quora can also help you reach out to influencers and partners in your industry that might be willing to work with you. Not only can it help you get in touch with them, but it’s a great way to build relationships and establish yourself as an authority figure. Even if someone isn’t directly involved in marketing, they may have suggestions for you or want to retweet your content. Plus, influencers on Quora might even become customers! It’s a great way to find people willing to support you and your brand, making it easier to get more exposure while also building relationships with some of the biggest names in your industry. Influencer marketing is hot right now! Read our recent blog post to learn why! Building brand awareness Marketing your business on Quora can help you build brand awareness because it’s a place where people are already willing to listen to what you have to say. Quora users aren’t just looking for entertaining content; they’re looking for information that can help them out, which makes it the perfect place to get in front of potential customers. In fact, some of the site’s most popular users are CEOs and entrepreneurs who have a significant online following. If your company is new or you want to reach a specific niche market, it can easily get lost in the conversation on sites like Quora. But with so many users searching for information about each industry, being able to stand out from the crowd can be a great way to increase your SEO. Quora can show what makes your company different from others, which will help establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry. Plus, it’s easy to share your Quora content on other social media sites or include it in blog posts for even more exposure. Improving your search engine rankings. Another reason that Quora is so important for your business is because it can help with your SEO. The more you’re linked to on other sites, the better search rankings you’ll get through improved authority. Quora allows you to be linked to by influencers in your industry, so use this site as much as possible if you want to improve your search engine rankings. In addition to being linked to from other sites, Quora can also help build links directly. An easy way to do this is by making a reference or mentioning someone else’s content in one of your posts. Then you’ll be able to use the link-back feature so that their site will include a link to your site as well. It can also be helpful to use Quora’s question-and-answer format, which makes it easy to drive traffic. This will help you build more links without putting too much work into it. By strengthening these ties through mentions and questions, you’ll be able to improve your search engine rankings by getting more links back to your site. Many marketers use Quora in their link-building strategies, so it’s a great way to get free links from reputable sources. In addition, try to include links in all of your answers whenever possible because this will help Quora rank you higher as well. So what are the best ways to use Quora for SEO success? Here are some proven ways to make the most out of your Quora campaign. Ask questions related to your industry. Starting with something simple is an excellent way to get started on Quora, especially if you’re starting out. This includes asking questions directly related to your business or starting discussions about industry topics or problems that have already arisen in your company. This is a great way to establish yourself as an authority figure in your industry, and it will help you connect with people who might want to work with you or support your brand. Plus, Quora is a place where people go for information about their problems, which means you’re likely to get more visitors through questions alone. Answer relevant questions with your own content. One of the best things you can do is answer questions with a link back to a relevant blog post on your website. When you answer a question, look for an opportunity to include your blog post as part of the answer. This way, you’ll be able to drive traffic back to your site. Don’t just insert a link into your answer, though; make sure it’s relevant and interesting enough that people will actually want to click. Otherwise, you’re wasting an opportunity for both Quora and SEO success. When writing content for Quora, make sure that you include lots of details. Quora asks you to answer questions in a way that’s easy for readers who don’t know anything about your topic to understand. Because of this, it’s essential to make sure that there is no technical jargon or complicated language when sharing content on Quora. Give relevant answers in everyday language that different users can comprehend. Remember, the purpose of you answering Quora questions is to provide answers, not to impress people in your little online world! You can also use tools like Answer The Public, which will give you keyword ideas that you can use to answer questions effectively. Use keywords in your answers when possible. Keywords are essential on any website, but you need to use them in moderation. This is especially true with Quora, which is why it’s critical to be careful about how often you use keywords in your answers. There are two reasons for this: people like seeing diverse answers, and not everyone will read the whole answer. It’s essential to use keywords, but make sure they fit naturally into your answer. You can also consider using them more often where Quora shows related topics at the bottom of some answers, which is a great place to drop in one or two relevant keywords. Here is where keyword research is essential. It would be best to use a keyword research tool to look for how often each phrase is searched and related terms that people might be searching for. Keep a running keyword list and add to it whenever you come across a good keyword. Then, when you’re writing your answer, look for opportunities where each keyword or phrase might fit well. Complementary Link Building With Quora Start by using your favorite tools to find links pointing to a Quora answer related to a piece of content on your blog. Even if the piece is in a question-and-answer format, the article’s author may want to refer readers to a more comprehensive, properly formatted piece rather than a Quora answer. After all, descriptive high-quality content trumps a simple answer to a question in most cases. Then, locate the URL that the answer links to for sourcing. Sift through a bunch of results, and employ a tool like Ahrefs to find the best link opportunities. Once you’ve done that, search Google for the main URL of your link opportunity. If it appears in top-ranking articles along with links from other authoritative resources, then get ready to reach out to that page to try to get links or use that page to find even more relevant pages to get links. How to build backlinks using Quora: Quora is a goldmine for scaling up your broken link-building campaign. Like Wikipedia or other massive websites, it will inherently link out a lot. And many of those links will be broken. The simplest way to do this is to take your favorite premium backlink tool, drop-in Quora & export broken outgoing links. Once you have that massive list, you can use your spreadsheet skills to sift and sort relevant links – and go from there. Be aware that if your only aim in obtaining backlinks is to improve your SEO metrics (Domain Authority, Trust Flow, Citation Flow), the fact that Quora exclusively provides nofollow links would have turned you off. You may be losing interest in Quora backlinks at this time, but don’t give up yet. It’s true: all backlinks from Quora are nofollow. So, the sheer presence of these backlinks will not contribute to your website’s search engine rankings. But wait! There is more than one way SEO works, and you can take advantage of this by using Quora for off-site SEO. What if we told you that Nofollow backlinks have loads of benefits for your website. Why? We’re glad you asked. Here are some ways that nofollow backlinks matter for your digital marketing campaign. Even though these links are nofollow, there is still some value because: Nofollow links can help build your brand awareness. This value is magnified even more when Quora users share their knowledge on other social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. Quick research tip.. Use Quora to find what your customers need. – Go to quora(dot)com – Go in the search bar and type in the keyword related to your niche ( Seo, relationship, health, saas, etc) – Filter by questions. – Thank me later — Uche (@I_AmUche) February 9, 2022 Nofollow links can drive traffic to your website. Nofollow links can help your website grow in the long run. For example, say you wrote a quality answer to an important question that many people are searching for on Quora. This could result in hundreds of visitors each day over time, especially if your article is popular and gets high upvotes or goes viral. And if you’ve linked back to your website in your answer, that’s one more visitor you can hope to add to your website’s ranks each day. Nofollow links can help with conversions. For e-commerce websites, it’s important to know that Quora users are often shopping around for the best deals and prices before they make their purchases online. So, if you have an amazing deal or price point on your site that is too good to pass up, Quora users may very well be coming to check it out. That’s because Quora users are experts in their fields, and they’re spending hours on Quora every day looking for the latest information. So, publishing your content or product on Quora can open you up to a huge audience. Is your website not getting you enough traffic? It’s possible that it just needs a little love. Or maybe you need a complete website redesign to get it ranking higher. Learn how we can help you fix that website! Nofollow links from Quora can generate new dofollow links. A lot of people use Quora when researching topics for their blog posts. Suppose you link back to your blog or website’s pages in your Quora answers. Now you’ve provided even more relevant pages for Quora users to check out, which has the potential to get them so interested in what you have to say that they may want to link back to you. Nofollow links from Quora can give your website credibility with Google and other search engines. While having dofollow links is critical to your backlink profile, it isn’t the only kind of backlink you’ll want to have to optimize your website. Google analyzes each of your backlinks on an individual basis, as well as your entire profile. When they notice that you have only dofollow links, this is a red flag for deceptive SEO tactics. This could result in penalties for your website. In a nutshell, every natural backlink profile should have a mix of nofollow and dofollow links. While it can’t provide you with link juice, Quora is a popular website. It has an Ahrefs rank of 562 and a domain rating of 91. Backlinks from Quora, while nofollow, will help improve your backlink profile. How to get the most out of your Quora campaign To get the best results from your Quora marketing campaign, you should first try to avoid spamming the site. If people see that your content is low-quality or irrelevant, it will hurt their view of you and your search rankings on Google. Every time you publish a piece of content on Quora, make sure that it’s high-quality and relevant to your audience. Try to ask questions that will help you learn more about what they want, which will make it easier for you to create content that appeals to them later on. If your answers are helpful and get people engaged, it should drive extra traffic to your site – but only if the content is valuable! If you’re not providing useful information, you won’t see any results from your marketing efforts. Use tools like Google Analytics to track your traffic and conversions. You’ll then be able to see which content performs best, and you can use that information to guide the direction of your efforts in the future. You’ll also want to track where your readers are coming from to know how well each campaign is doing. As long as you make sure that your content is high-quality and engaging, it should boost the amount of website traffic that you get. If people click through to find out more about what you have to offer, they’ll be more likely to become interested in your products or services. Not sure if you’re creating high-quality and engaging content? Read our recent blog post to learn how! You must link back to your social networks and website as often as possible since this will help you to get even more traffic. For example, linking to your Facebook profile can help people discover what else you have on offer through social media. Use Quora to build up your reputation. Building a reputation on Quora can also help you to boost your search rankings. You should take the time to answer questions relevant to your industry and always try to provide accurate and well-informed answers. Don’t just stop at your niche, either. Find relevant industries you think you can provide appropriate answers for and answer questions there. For example, suppose you’re a web developer. You can ask questions to more experienced professionals and learn from their insights. If you want to, you can also help other developers who may be lacking in your niche and offer some of your guidance. Maintaining a healthy balance is key to building up your reputation while staying on track for success in your industry. It’s not always easy, but it will be worth all of the effort you put into it if you can succeed. Conclusion Do you want to see your business grow? Quora is a unique marketing tool that you should use to learn more about your target audience and get in touch with some of the most influential people online.

But no need to fear! Clint will teach you about why you need to focus on all that stuff - he'll put it in terms for you to understand. He walked me through everything and was patient when I didn't understand something. They'll try to do every goal you have and do it in the easiest way possible. I think at one point Clint sang, \"\"You can have whatever you like\"\" to my CEO and me in a meeting! Hahahah! We got everything we wanted and more. He made our website better than what I thought it would be. I especially liked that they were easy to talk to - it's more of a partnership achieving the same goal instead. They were easy to reach and very responsive. . Then you'll wrap your head around all of it at the end and realize that you know a ton more about websites. I now see all the value in everything they did and we are already reaping the benefits...and we just launched yesterday. I'm SO glad we didn't go with the other people we were considering. BlakSheep Creative is affordable and you get more than what you paid for in my opinion. Our SEO is off the charts now because of their input and suggestions. Listen to them, they know what they're talking about. They also networked for us! That's so cool. So now we have a partnership with BR Soldier Outreach. I would not have found them if weren't for Clint. They were easy to work with- we are now asking for two apps and some other projects with them because we liked them so much.

Other benefits of using Quora for SEO include: Gaining exposure for your business One of the best things about using Quora for SEO is gaining exposure for your business. By answering questions and leaving comments, you’ll be able to reach a large audience of potential customers. Quora is an ideal platform for promoting your business because it has a large user base. With over 300 million users, you’ll be able to get in front of a wide range of people who might be interested in what you have to offer. In addition, Quora is used by people from all over the world. This makes it a great place to promote your business to a global audience. So if you’re looking for a way to get more exposure for your business, Quora is an excellent option for you. Driving traffic to your site Quora can also help drive more people to your website. If you answer relevant questions, you’ll give visitors an incentive to click on your profile and visit your website to learn more about what you have to offer. Plus, any time someone comments on one of the answers that you’ve given, they’ll be able to see your profile and website URL. Writing a question or answer that attracts a lot of comments can help boost your SEO. When you get more exposure for your business, it will increase the number of people that visit your site. And when you write good answers on Quora, you might even end up seeing your content shared on social media and other sites online. So by using Quora, you’ll be able to successfully grow your site and establish yourself as an industry leader. Getting in front of your target audience As a business owner, you’ll always be thinking about how to get in front of your target audience. One of the best parts of using Quora for SEO is that it allows you to reach people interested in what you have to offer. If someone asks a question about your industry on Quora, they’re probably already interested in what you have to offer. If you answer the question, not only will people see your profile and website URL, but they’ll be able to learn more about your brand as well. Quora users are looking for answers because they want the information to help them solve a problem. When you answer a question with valuable insight, you’ll give people a reason to check out your profile and website. And if someone doesn’t want your advice, they might even be willing to retweet the answer to their followers! Being exposed to new audiences Don’t worry about getting lost in the noise if you’re worried about trying new things on social media sites like Quora. Every time you answer a question or post new content, it’ll be seen by people who are already interested in your brand. This makes it easier to get more exposure without feeling overwhelmed by irrelevant users. And because Quora has such a large user base, you’re bound to find new customers that might not have heard of you before. Quora is a great way to boost your SEO because it can expose you to new audiences interested in your brand. Stay up-to-date with industry news and trends. Quora can also help keep you up-to-date on the latest industry news and trends, which is especially important for businesses that want to stay competitive. It’s a great way to see what questions and issues people in your industry are talking about, and it can also help you find new content ideas for your blog or website, generate leads, and get inspiration for new products and services that you could offer. Quora is a valuable tool for any marketing strategy because it allows you to connect with Influencers in your industry. You’ll be able to discuss ways to work together, and the person who started the discussion might even become a customer! Find out what works well for other businesses. Another great way Quora can help your business is by offering insights into how other companies are marketing their products or services. Use it to get inspiration for your marketing campaigns by learning what posts work well for other businesses in your industry. You can even ask questions about how they did it so that you can see the results first-hand! Quora allows you to get advice from companies that have already tried different tactics, which can be a great way to learn from their experiences. You can also use the site to get ideas for content and products you could offer. If other business owners are talking about a problem in your industry, then there’s probably a demand for it, which is something else that will help with your SEO. One of the best ways to see what works well for your competition is by doing a thorough competitor analysis. Contact us today to learn how we can reverse engineer your competition’s digital marketing tactics and beat them at their own game! Leverage influencers and partners Quora can also help you reach out to influencers and partners in your industry that might be willing to work with you. Not only can it help you get in touch with them, but it’s a great way to build relationships and establish yourself as an authority figure. Even if someone isn’t directly involved in marketing, they may have suggestions for you or want to retweet your content. Plus, influencers on Quora might even become customers! It’s a great way to find people willing to support you and your brand, making it easier to get more exposure while also building relationships with some of the biggest names in your industry. Influencer marketing is hot right now! Read our recent blog post to learn why! Building brand awareness Marketing your business on Quora can help you build brand awareness because it’s a place where people are already willing to listen to what you have to say. Quora users aren’t just looking for entertaining content; they’re looking for information that can help them out, which makes it the perfect place to get in front of potential customers. In fact, some of the site’s most popular users are CEOs and entrepreneurs who have a significant online following. If your company is new or you want to reach a specific niche market, it can easily get lost in the conversation on sites like Quora. But with so many users searching for information about each industry, being able to stand out from the crowd can be a great way to increase your SEO. Quora can show what makes your company different from others, which will help establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry. Plus, it’s easy to share your Quora content on other social media sites or include it in blog posts for even more exposure. Improving your search engine rankings. Another reason that Quora is so important for your business is because it can help with your SEO. The more you’re linked to on other sites, the better search rankings you’ll get through improved authority. Quora allows you to be linked to by influencers in your industry, so use this site as much as possible if you want to improve your search engine rankings. In addition to being linked to from other sites, Quora can also help build links directly. An easy way to do this is by making a reference or mentioning someone else’s content in one of your posts. Then you’ll be able to use the link-back feature so that their site will include a link to your site as well. It can also be helpful to use Quora’s question-and-answer format, which makes it easy to drive traffic. This will help you build more links without putting too much work into it. By strengthening these ties through mentions and questions, you’ll be able to improve your search engine rankings by getting more links back to your site. Many marketers use Quora in their link-building strategies, so it’s a great way to get free links from reputable sources. In addition, try to include links in all of your answers whenever possible because this will help Quora rank you higher as well. So what are the best ways to use Quora for SEO success? Here are some proven ways to make the most out of your Quora campaign. Ask questions related to your industry. Starting with something simple is an excellent way to get started on Quora, especially if you’re starting out. This includes asking questions directly related to your business or starting discussions about industry topics or problems that have already arisen in your company. This is a great way to establish yourself as an authority figure in your industry, and it will help you connect with people who might want to work with you or support your brand. Plus, Quora is a place where people go for information about their problems, which means you’re likely to get more visitors through questions alone. Answer relevant questions with your own content. One of the best things you can do is answer questions with a link back to a relevant blog post on your website. When you answer a question, look for an opportunity to include your blog post as part of the answer. This way, you’ll be able to drive traffic back to your site. Don’t just insert a link into your answer, though; make sure it’s relevant and interesting enough that people will actually want to click. Otherwise, you’re wasting an opportunity for both Quora and SEO success. When writing content for Quora, make sure that you include lots of details. Quora asks you to answer questions in a way that’s easy for readers who don’t know anything about your topic to understand. Because of this, it’s essential to make sure that there is no technical jargon or complicated language when sharing content on Quora. Give relevant answers in everyday language that different users can comprehend. Remember, the purpose of you answering Quora questions is to provide answers, not to impress people in your little online world! You can also use tools like Answer The Public, which will give you keyword ideas that you can use to answer questions effectively. Use keywords in your answers when possible. Keywords are essential on any website, but you need to use them in moderation. This is especially true with Quora, which is why it’s critical to be careful about how often you use keywords in your answers. There are two reasons for this: people like seeing diverse answers, and not everyone will read the whole answer. It’s essential to use keywords, but make sure they fit naturally into your answer. You can also consider using them more often where Quora shows related topics at the bottom of some answers, which is a great place to drop in one or two relevant keywords. Here is where keyword research is essential. It would be best to use a keyword research tool to look for how often each phrase is searched and related terms that people might be searching for. Keep a running keyword list and add to it whenever you come across a good keyword. Then, when you’re writing your answer, look for opportunities where each keyword or phrase might fit well. Complementary Link Building With Quora Start by using your favorite tools to find links pointing to a Quora answer related to a piece of content on your blog. Even if the piece is in a question-and-answer format, the article’s author may want to refer readers to a more comprehensive, properly formatted piece rather than a Quora answer. After all, descriptive high-quality content trumps a simple answer to a question in most cases. Then, locate the URL that the answer links to for sourcing. Sift through a bunch of results, and employ a tool like Ahrefs to find the best link opportunities. Once you’ve done that, search Google for the main URL of your link opportunity. If it appears in top-ranking articles along with links from other authoritative resources, then get ready to reach out to that page to try to get links or use that page to find even more relevant pages to get links. How to build backlinks using Quora: Quora is a goldmine for scaling up your broken link-building campaign. Like Wikipedia or other massive websites, it will inherently link out a lot. And many of those links will be broken. The simplest way to do this is to take your favorite premium backlink tool, drop-in Quora & export broken outgoing links. Once you have that massive list, you can use your spreadsheet skills to sift and sort relevant links – and go from there. Be aware that if your only aim in obtaining backlinks is to improve your SEO metrics (Domain Authority, Trust Flow, Citation Flow), the fact that Quora exclusively provides nofollow links would have turned you off. You may be losing interest in Quora backlinks at this time, but don’t give up yet. It’s true: all backlinks from Quora are nofollow. So, the sheer presence of these backlinks will not contribute to your website’s search engine rankings. But wait! There is more than one way SEO works, and you can take advantage of this by using Quora for off-site SEO. What if we told you that Nofollow backlinks have loads of benefits for your website. Why? We’re glad you asked. Here are some ways that nofollow backlinks matter for your digital marketing campaign. Even though these links are nofollow, there is still some value because: Nofollow links can help build your brand awareness. This value is magnified even more when Quora users share their knowledge on other social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. Quick research tip.. Use Quora to find what your customers need. – Go to quora(dot)com – Go in the search bar and type in the keyword related to your niche ( Seo, relationship, health, saas, etc) – Filter by questions. – Thank me later — Uche (@I_AmUche) February 9, 2022 Nofollow links can drive traffic to your website. Nofollow links can help your website grow in the long run. For example, say you wrote a quality answer to an important question that many people are searching for on Quora. This could result in hundreds of visitors each day over time, especially if your article is popular and gets high upvotes or goes viral. And if you’ve linked back to your website in your answer, that’s one more visitor you can hope to add to your website’s ranks each day. Nofollow links can help with conversions. For e-commerce websites, it’s important to know that Quora users are often shopping around for the best deals and prices before they make their purchases online. So, if you have an amazing deal or price point on your site that is too good to pass up, Quora users may very well be coming to check it out. That’s because Quora users are experts in their fields, and they’re spending hours on Quora every day looking for the latest information. So, publishing your content or product on Quora can open you up to a huge audience. Is your website not getting you enough traffic? It’s possible that it just needs a little love. Or maybe you need a complete website redesign to get it ranking higher. Learn how we can help you fix that website! Nofollow links from Quora can generate new dofollow links. A lot of people use Quora when researching topics for their blog posts. Suppose you link back to your blog or website’s pages in your Quora answers. Now you’ve provided even more relevant pages for Quora users to check out, which has the potential to get them so interested in what you have to say that they may want to link back to you. Nofollow links from Quora can give your website credibility with Google and other search engines. While having dofollow links is critical to your backlink profile, it isn’t the only kind of backlink you’ll want to have to optimize your website. Google analyzes each of your backlinks on an individual basis, as well as your entire profile. When they notice that you have only dofollow links, this is a red flag for deceptive SEO tactics. This could result in penalties for your website. In a nutshell, every natural backlink profile should have a mix of nofollow and dofollow links. While it can’t provide you with link juice, Quora is a popular website. It has an Ahrefs rank of 562 and a domain rating of 91. Backlinks from Quora, while nofollow, will help improve your backlink profile. How to get the most out of your Quora campaign To get the best results from your Quora marketing campaign, you should first try to avoid spamming the site. If people see that your content is low-quality or irrelevant, it will hurt their view of you and your search rankings on Google. Every time you publish a piece of content on Quora, make sure that it’s high-quality and relevant to your audience. Try to ask questions that will help you learn more about what they want, which will make it easier for you to create content that appeals to them later on. If your answers are helpful and get people engaged, it should drive extra traffic to your site – but only if the content is valuable! If you’re not providing useful information, you won’t see any results from your marketing efforts. Use tools like Google Analytics to track your traffic and conversions. You’ll then be able to see which content performs best, and you can use that information to guide the direction of your efforts in the future. You’ll also want to track where your readers are coming from to know how well each campaign is doing. As long as you make sure that your content is high-quality and engaging, it should boost the amount of website traffic that you get. If people click through to find out more about what you have to offer, they’ll be more likely to become interested in your products or services. Not sure if you’re creating high-quality and engaging content? Read our recent blog post to learn how! You must link back to your social networks and website as often as possible since this will help you to get even more traffic. For example, linking to your Facebook profile can help people discover what else you have on offer through social media. Use Quora to build up your reputation. Building a reputation on Quora can also help you to boost your search rankings. You should take the time to answer questions relevant to your industry and always try to provide accurate and well-informed answers. Don’t just stop at your niche, either. Find relevant industries you think you can provide appropriate answers for and answer questions there. For example, suppose you’re a web developer. You can ask questions to more experienced professionals and learn from their insights. If you want to, you can also help other developers who may be lacking in your niche and offer some of your guidance. Maintaining a healthy balance is key to building up your reputation while staying on track for success in your industry. It’s not always easy, but it will be worth all of the effort you put into it if you can succeed. Conclusion Do you want to see your business grow? Quora is a unique marketing tool that you should use to learn more about your target audience and get in touch with some of the most influential people online.

Dustin Hayes  Red, White, and Badass Brews Look no further if you are looking for a badass company for your website and SEO needs. This is a business that will excel your expectations. Suppose you don't believe me; check out Red White & Badass Brew page. Super stoked to have them on my side. Keep up the great work, guys. Renee Dupre  La Maison Mortgage Black Sheep's team went above and beyond my expectations for a website but most of all was their service. I was so nervous about getting a team of people to build something for me that I knew nothing about. I was taking a leap with this team and let me tell you I am one happy customer. This team made me feel confident (as a non tech friendly gal I appreciate this) in every part of the process. When I didn't know what something meant they never made me feel silly about asking any questions. As far as their product I think that speaks for itself. My website and social media pages are amazing thanks to them. SO VERY lucky I found this company, I am never leaving! :) Lisa M. Gale  Lisa M. Gale Digital Marketing and Website Design I found the Blaksheep Creative team when I was overloaded with work and didn't have enough hours in the day. As an agency owner, I had tried several avenues to outsource website work. Each one was a miss. Then when I started to miss deadlines I decided to try one more time. Clint and BlakSheep came highly recommended and I contracted to work with them on a website project and quickly followed that up with a giant website build. It's so easy to work with them. Quick response time (even at my odd hours!) and more than just design help. No only is the design on point, but you get so much more. Recommendations, complete SEO knowledge, all the backend technical stuff that needs to be setup, and so much more. 10/10, highly recommend and I'm excited to work with them on our next project! Carly Peterson  Settled In Style BlakSheep was everything we needed and then some. They built us an amazing website, replied quickly to every question, and went above and beyond to get our site up and running as fast as possible. I would recommend them to anyone looking for an experienced, innovative marketing team. David Annison  The Way Church DS BlakSheep Creative rocks! Clint was super helpful in putting together our website and offered suggestions that really put us on the right track. If you are looking for help with any of your \"creative\" needs look no further. Greg Parker  Fort Smith Industrial Supply From day one of meeting the team at Blaksheep, I knew our website and digital marketing was in good hands. The team was relentless in the pursuit of our success. I tried my hardest to throw problem after problem at them, but the conquered the task every time without any issues. Their prices are very reasonable for the level of service provided. If you want it done right the first time, choose Blaksheep. TKL Supply LLC  Our website build with BlakSheep was the type of experience that you want to share and brag about. Very responsive, organized, to the point with our design. The creativeness of Clint provided us exactly what we wanted and needed. Would definitely use them again and recommend them! Garrett Penn  Starting up our business was a little bit daunting, and my business partner and I were very worried about our business image falling short of our vision. Thankfully, the staff at Blaksheep were communicative, prompt, creative, and VERY easy to work with. We're obsessed with our new logos, and strongly look forward to working with Blaksheep again in the future. Logos aren't all that they make though, so check out their website. You won't regret it. Professionalism to the nines. Kelley Stein  1031 Consortium Clint and the BlakSheep Creative team are so detailed, organized and strategic in their approach to building websites. They consider your entire digital footprint beyond just your website. BlakSheep is a great asset and addition to our marketing efforts!

Helen Kelley  If you want a top notch job, choose this Guy. He does top notch work R. Clyde  Billy Zachary  Amazingly good work for the money.

Aaron V.  \"Clint, is one of the most knowledgeable, capable & easy to work with people I have ever had the pleasure to have done business with. His can-do attitude was a breath of fresh air, and the results were amazing and completely blew us away. I could not recommend him MORE!!!! If you need a project done, get this man on it, YESTERDAY!!!\" Alec Daniel  I am project manager on a large ecommerce build and needed a fresh perspective on design. The team @ Blaksheep not only helped us with conceptualization, but also integration of design. This website iteration is more successful than the previous, no doubt with the help of Clint and the team at Blaksheep. Thank you for all of your insight and guidance. Angelle  Great team, very professional and fun to work with. Drifter Toby  It’s been a blessing working with Clint over the years on website projects. He always makes it look better than I had pictured in my mind. Corrina Dickinson  Great designs, excellent service. I was very difficult to make a logo for and he still worked with me. Would definitely recommend! Cyndi Overton  BlakSheep Creative has been a huge blessing to our podcast website. Clint has gone above and beyond to produce an amazing custom website. Not only did Clint work night and day, he had a quick turn around time. He connected 3 different websites into 1 seamless site, he connected all of our social media, itunes reviews, Patreon account, shop and collected analytic (SEO) information. I really will not do justice in describing what all he did for because there are many words and skills I definitely do not understand. What I do understand is his level of professionalism, knowledge and dependability. BlakSHeep Creative is highly recommended by Real Life Real Crime. Thank you for everything! Jessica Sullivan  Working with Clint is an absolute delight! He is very knowledgable, a great communicator, has wonderful and creative ideas, and is so easy to collaborate with. 10/10 would recommend working with BlakSheep Creative!! Tonya Sanchez  The BlakSheep Creative team built a website and handles all of the digital marketing for The Way PDO and preschool in Denham Springs, LA. We could not be happier, Rico T.  \"So we've been working with Clint & Alec from Blaksheep Creative for a few months now. They created our main website for us. I worked with them first hand and had no idea what I was getting into! Let me explain. They have all this knowledge about making your website found on google...and they'll use big words and probably overwhelm you at first. Website development is second nature to them. But no need to fear! Clint will teach you about why you need to focus on all that stuff - he'll put it in terms for you to understand. He walked me through everything and was patient when I didn't understand something. They'll try to do every goal you have and do it in the easiest way possible. I think at one point Clint sang, \"\"You can have whatever you like\"\" to my CEO and me in a meeting! Hahahah! We got everything we wanted and more. He made our website better than what I thought it would be. I especially liked that they were easy to talk to - it's more of a partnership achieving the same goal instead. They were easy to reach and very responsive. . Then you'll wrap your head around all of it at the end and realize that you know a ton more about websites. I now see all the value in everything they did and we are already reaping the benefits...and we just launched yesterday. I'm SO glad we didn't go with the other people we were considering. BlakSheep Creative is affordable and you get more than what you paid for in my opinion. Our SEO is off the charts now because of their input and suggestions. Listen to them, they know what they're talking about. They also networked for us! That's so cool. So now we have a partnership with BR Soldier Outreach. I would not have found them if weren't for Clint. They were easy to work with- we are now asking for two apps and some other projects with them because we liked them so much. I was happy to write this google review for them! Good luck on your website development to whoever reads this! Here are some pics of the website they did for us. theincreasehunters.com is the site if you want to check out their work!\" Dane Arnold  Clint at BlakSheep Creative is incredible! His proactiveness and service are such a rarity in his business category! I can't wait to see how his business and mine both grow in 2021! Cheryl Carter  Blaksheep picked up an unfinished project for us mid-stream and was able to turn it around and see to completion. They made multiple design changes and gave us a great end result. Michael Bacigalupi  Absolutely the best to work with. Very kind and responsive. They were very patient with me especially when I have no technical vocabulary. The team explained to me in terms that I could understand. I highly recommend them. Cyndi Overton  Real Life Real Crime / Bloody Angola Podcasts Best creative team ever!! Clint built our website from scratch and so much more. I cannot begin to describe all that he has done for our company! Levi McCammon  One of the easiest guys I've ever had the pleasure of working with. Great feedback on the personalization of your ideas and has some awesome creativity to throw in if you give him the go-ahead. Very prompt and my number one stop for Imaging. 10/10👌 Sean Hebert  BlakSheep did some amazing work for me he helped me get my work done and up and running the speed he was able to work was AMAZING!!!! Curt Monte  Baton Rouge Fire Department Professional work at its best. Creative in every fashion. Highly recommended Billy Zachary  Baton Rouge Fire Department Blaksheep did just a fantastic job on my nonprofit website. From logo design to webpage layout and functionality it was an easy process. Clint does a great job of communicating and producing exactly what we needed. Highly recommended. Michael Aaron Corona  The Way Church DS BlakSheep Creative is an absolute genius when it comes to your internet website needs. The owner is extremely creative and very easy to communicate with.

Scott Davenport  Davenport Offshore Services Very professional. Reasonable prices. Quality work. Veteran owned!

Johnathan Grant  Dude! This company is the real deal.. Fastest turnaround I’ve ever experienced.. Not to mentioned it came out better than I expected. I’ve used Clint and his company on more than one occasion and was beyond pleased with the outcome. Give them a try, you will NOT be dissatisfied!! Brett Alello  Clint has gone beyond what was asked of him to do. He took our idea and bought it to life. He designed our logo, always gave some of his own flair to it, and made it happen. We will use him and Blacksheep for any future designs and the construction of our website. Thanks for everything Clint, and couldn’t ask for a better person to handle our business. Karina Alvarez  Alvarez Tree Service Great service and very patient with me until I got what I was looking for!

In fact, as far as local optimization goes, link signals have been shown time and time again to be the most influential organic ranking factor. That’s why many marketers turn to email marketing to get links— oftentimes epically failing. They ping your contact@mycompany email with annoying, impersonal link exchange proposals: “Hey, my name is Bobby and I thought you might like this article I wrote. Will you link to it in your article? I’ll link back on my website!” It’s because of these lazy, mass-sent messages that link-building emails get deleted. But when utilized correctly, email marketing can be a powerful tool for building backlinks. Email outreach is not going to produce the instant rewards that buying backlinks does. It’s time-consuming. Those who purchase “$1,000 backlinks for $10!” don’t do any work themselves. They set aside five minutes to find an overseas SEO “expert” on Fiverr. In order to get backlinks without seeing spammy, you will need to do your own research and execution. Before You Start Link Building Via Email All these things sound challenging, but here’s the silver lining: With all that being said, let’s explore some ways you can leverage email to gain quality inbound links. How to Get High-Quality Backlinks With Emails Step 1: Choose Your Share-Worthy Content Your email campaign will require something of value to offer a potential linker. Use amazing pieces of content like your super in-depth pillar pages, top-performing articles, a helpful video, new infographics, or anything really! Start off by looking at your proudest content— the pieces which have received a lot of feedback and traffic. Confirm their popularity with SEMRush, narrowing your list down to the ones with the highest number of inbound links. Decide to Go Broad or Get Specific Once you have some content you’d be confident sending to potential linkers, look at how each piece addresses its topic. Is it broad, like an article explaining the basics of your topic, or is it specific? For example, if your business sells sheds, do you want to email a generic infographic about different shed styles— or, do you want to hyper-focus on people who are considering converting their sheds into “man caves” with a slideshow of inspirational ideas? If, after a lot of thought, you realize you need to create the right content for your plan, that’s okay! Make sure you crank out something you yourself would link to, or keep creating more content until it’s truly remarkable. Step 2: Do Some Cherry-Picking on the SERPs Now you have to find your targets, which you can do with a few strategic Google searches. Open up an Excel or Sheets spreadsheet and make a column for Domain Name, URL, Contact Person Name, Contact Person Email/Phone, Date Contacted, and Notes. Hop over to Google and start searching for related keywords by clicking on sites on page one and two of the SERPs. If you decided to focus on man cave shed ideas, look up keywords around designs, DIY inspiration, creative uses for sheds, etc. Dig through each ranked page and look for a way to leverage it. If you think they might be interested in your content, add these ideas to your Notes tab with the site’s domain, exact URL, and contact method. Remember, a generic email sent to a company’s “contact” email will likely be transported immediately to a spam folder or reviewed by someone who’s answering direct inquiries and doesn’t care about link building. Look for someone in marketing and send it directly to them! Search a handful of keywords until you’ve compiled a list of maybe 25-50 probable contacts. Next, use SEMRush (or the MozBar plug-in while you’re on each website) to look up their individual domain authorities (DA), the individual page authority, and their number of backlinks, to help you narrow down your list. Aim for DAs higher or close to your website’s own score. Again, it’s better to have a short, highly-qualified list of 25 really promising targets than 100 shot-in-the-dark prospects. Make Friends with Your Competitors, When Appropriate We understand that not all competitors are going to be thrilled about the idea of promoting you on their website, but supporting one another could be a mutual exchange, so try to leverage these competitive relationships whenever possible. If your service complements theirs, instead of directly rivaling it, even better! For example, if you sell sheds and are sending out your man cave article, reach out to a bar installer who would be able to help them organize your clients’ liquor cabinets inside their caves. Get creative! Step 3: Crafting Your Link-Building Email Template Remember, even via email, you want to facilitate a human-to-human interaction with someone. Here are a few ways to personalize your message: Try something like this: “Good morning, Gloria! My name is Jenn, and I wanted to thank you for sharing all these incredible photos of the man cave shed conversion you did for your husband. I’m so glad you recommended putting a big cork board behind the dart board. I would have nicked up the whole back wall! One of my clients actually added a pool table inside their shed, and I don’t think they realized how much space those things take up. He actually wrote an article that includes all the measurements and techniques for getting it inside with the least hassle. Would you want to see it? It might be something that you could reference in your piece to or consider as your next upgrade! Let me know if you want me to send it over! Again, thanks for the advice.

You ever heard about it? It’s the kind of thing that makes your head spin faster than a bar stool after a couple of drinks. Link building has always been a cornerstone of SEO, but with automation now throwing its hat in the ring, we’re looking at something that could change the game forever—or could it? Now, before we get rolling, let’s clear the air. I’m not saying automated link building is the golden ticket to SEO success. I mean, sure, you can use a tool like GetMoreBacklinks and watch the backlinks roll in, but it’s not all rainbows and butterflies. You gotta know the ins and outs, or you might end up knee-deep in a mess of low-quality links. Ever tried this?

Now, onto the bad: Not all backlinks are created equal, my friend. You could end up with links from sites that are about as reputable as that one friend who always borrows money but never pays it back. If you're relying solely on automation, you could inadvertently harm your SEO instead of helping it. Think of it like ordering a pizza and getting a salad—you’re not gonna be satisfied. And then there’s the ugly: Ever heard of Google’s algorithms? They’re like that bouncer at the bar who decides who gets in and who gets",
