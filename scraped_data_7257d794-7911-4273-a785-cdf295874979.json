Today, we're going to look at seven of the best AI tools and you could try them all for free. You can automate repetitive tasks, find information more effectively, cut down on the time it takes you to respond to email and so many more. Let's dive in. First up, I partnered with Zapier to show you how you can eliminate all of those annoying and repetitive tasks by automating them. That way, you could focus on what really matters like, I don't know, baking cookies. Zapier is free to start using. I have a Google feedback form that customers at the Kevin Cookie Company can fill out. Once a customer submits their feedback, it'd be nice if they would receive a personalized response, preferably without involving me. Sign into Zapier, then type in what you would like to automate and all the different apps that you use. I'll type in my workflow. Zapier suggests a Zap, that's their word for workflow automation. Then you can click in and customize the details for each step in the process. Now, whenever new feedback comes in, Zapier automatically sends a personalized response to the customer. This is just one example. You can connect thousands of different apps like Gmail, Notion, Excel, Slack, and the list goes on and on. If you want a step-by-step guide that shows you how to get started with and how to use Zapier, check out the video link in the description. At number two, we have Google AI Studio. This AI can analyze your screen in real time and provide step-by-step guidance on various tasks. For example, let's say you're not sure how to do something in Microsoft Excel. AI Studio can help you with that. On the left, click on stream real time. Then at the bottom, share your microphone and your screen. Now, you could start asking questions. Yeah, I'd like to see the units sold by location. How do I do that? You can use a pivot table to see the units sold by location. First, select all of your data, including headers. Then go to the insert tab on the ribbon and click on pivot table. In the window that appears, click okay to create a pivot table on a new sheet. Then in the pivot table build- Hold on a second. Okay, so I have my new sheet, I have my pivot table. What do I do here? Okay, now in the pivot table fields pane, you should drag location to the rows area and units sold to the values area. This will show you the total units sold for each location in your pivot table. Nice, that is incredible. This shows the true power of AI and how it can help us all learn. To take it to the next level, it'd be nice if it could actually just do the steps on your screen with you in charge. I don't know, maybe next month? Next, we have ChatGPT, one of the most advanced and popular AI assistants available. Chances are you've used it before, but you may not know about all of the advanced functionality. Let's take a look. First, click this icon to open something called the Canvas. This is an interactive space where you can create, edit, and iterate on long form text or code. You can highlight one paragraph to request changes to just that paragraph. You can even view version history, so you know what ChatGPT has changed. You can click on this icon to activate a reasoning model. This is ideal for logical thinking, complex problem solving and multi-step analysis. For example, how many cookies should I bake in December given this sales data from past years? You can also set up what's called a project. You can upload documents and provide context, and it'll use all of that when responding to your prompts. There's also multi-modal support or image and file analysis. As an example, I can upload this image of the Kevin Cookie Company retail locations around the world. And when I ask it to give me a list of all the locations, it's able to do that. Lastly, there's a new offering called Sora, which can generate high quality videos from text descriptions. It does a lot more than just chat. Maybe it should be called everything GPT. Fourth, we have a tool called Udio, which is an AI powered music creation tool. With it, you can pull together songs like these. You simply describe the song that you would like to create. Of course, the more descriptive, the better. It then generates two songs. You can also write the lyrics yourself and call out the structure of the song, like the verse, the chorus, the bridge or the hook. You can also customize the length and also the prompt strength. Once you're happy with your song, you can download it and share it with the world. At number five, we have ElevenLabs. ElevenLabs produces incredibly realistic AI voices that sound just like real people. Chances are you've heard many of their voices before, whether on a YouTube video or maybe even on a commercial. Once you sign in, on the left-hand side, click on Text to Speech. Let's paste in some text. On the right, you can change the voice, set the model as well as adjust various settings. Then click on Generate. Hello, you should buy cookies at the Kevin Cookie Company. Not bad. They also offer a number of other tools like Voice Changer. You can use AI to make sound effects, and they even have an option to dub or translate audio into other languages. Next, we have Perplexity AI. If you feel like Google's search quality has gone downhill, Perplexity may be the search engine that you've been looking for. In the center of the screen, you have a text box where you can enter in your prompt or your query. One of the big differentiators from Google, you can set where you want Perplexity to source its answer from, the web, academia, or social, which basically means Reddit. I'll turn on Academic. Perplexity provides the answer as well as the sources. You'll notice citations throughout the answer, all from published scientific papers. You can click on any source to browse the original paper. You can also remove a source and then rerun your search. It's really perfect for research, fact checking, and AI powered insights, all while minimizing possible hallucinations. It's free to use and there's also a paid plan that gives you even more functionality. Last, if you're a content creator like me, Descript is a game changer for editing videos and podcasts. You could edit your video just like you would a Word document. For example, these dots let me know that there's a long pause. I can simply click on them and then delete the pause and that cuts them out of the video. You can also add new text or voice using something called overdub. You'll need to train the AI to use your voice. Then it'll generate the new speech using your voice. There are also lots of other AI features that'll make your video even more professional. For example, Studio Sound will improve the sound quality and make it more consistent. You can separate yourself from the background just by clicking on a button. You can automatically generate captions for your video in English and even in other languages. This is one of the best AI tools for streamlining content production and making video editing as easy as editing a document. Let me know which one's your favorite. Please consider subscribing and I’ll see you in the next video.",

By addressing the core challenge of video uploads, Ritz7 has developed a robust platform that streamlines the process, saving time and resources for businesses of all sizes. The Challenge: Overcoming Manual Intervention in Digital Clips Uploads Uploading visual content to YouTube can be a long and frustrating process. Businesses often face problems like: Spending too much time: Uploading visual content can take hours out of a workweek. This steals time away from creating new visual content or doing other important tasks. Making mistakes: It's easy to accidentally type the wrong visual content title or description. This can confuse viewers and make them less likely to watch the visual content. For example, funny visual content with a serious title might mislead people. Unorganized work: The steps to make and share media files can be messy and slow down the whole process. Teams might waste time waiting for media files to be ready, or files might get lost in the shuffle. Time of posting: Not posting visual content at regular times can make it hard to build an audience. Viewers like to know when to expect new content. Needing special skills: You might need to know how to use fancy computer programs to make good visual content. Not everyone has these skills, which can hold back content quality. Making upload errors: Mistakes in visual content details can hide your posts from people searching for it. This can hurt how popular your visual content becomes. These problems make it hard for businesses to use YT effectively to reach and connect with their audience.

By addressing the core challenge of video uploads, Ritz7 has developed a robust platform that streamlines the process, saving time and resources for businesses of all sizes. The Challenge: Overcoming Manual Intervention in Digital Clips Uploads Uploading visual content to YouTube can be a long and frustrating process. Businesses often face problems like: Spending too much time: Uploading visual content can take hours out of a workweek. This steals time away from creating new visual content or doing other important tasks. Making mistakes: It's easy to accidentally type the wrong visual content title or description. This can confuse viewers and make them less likely to watch the visual content. For example, funny visual content with a serious title might mislead people. Unorganized work: The steps to make and share media files can be messy and slow down the whole process. Teams might waste time waiting for media files to be ready, or files might get lost in the shuffle. Time of posting: Not posting visual content at regular times can make it hard to build an audience. Viewers like to know when to expect new content. Needing special skills: You might need to know how to use fancy computer programs to make good visual content. Not everyone has these skills, which can hold back content quality. Making upload errors: Mistakes in visual content details can hide your posts from people searching for it.

Short Summary: YouTube introduces new features to aid emerging creators in content creation and audience engagement. The platform focuses on enhancing analytics tools, enabling better strategy formulation. Collaborative features and innovative monetization options are designed to boost community building among creators. YouTube has long been a cornerstone for businesses and individual creators, providing a platform where imaginative content can flourish. As we continue to witness a dramatic increase in online video consumption, YouTube recognizes the need to empower emerging creators by introducing a suite of innovative tools and features in 2024. This move not only enhances the content creation process but also supports creators in establishing meaningful connections with their audiences. YouTube is set to unveil features focused on enhancing creativity, refining analytics, and diversifying monetization opportunities to propel creators’ growth in a fiercely competitive landscape. Enhancing Creativity Through Innovative Tools At the heart of YouTube’s 2024 strategy lies a commitment to fostering creativity among emerging creators. Enhanced content creation tools are vital to this effort, as they enable users to produce higher-quality videos effortlessly. One significant development is the introduction of streamlined video editing functionalities integrated directly into the platform. This feature will allow creators to edit videos without needing external software, reducing the barriers to entry for those less experienced in video production. “We’re making tools that unleash creativity. We want our creators to spend more time dreaming up their next project instead of grappling with technical challenges,” said Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube. In addition to editing tools, YouTube is introducing AI-powered assistance to support creators in scripting and developing video ideas. This innovation allows creators to harness artificial intelligence in content planning, aiding them in crafting narratives that resonate with their target audience. Furthermore, the platform’s user-friendly interface encourages creators to experiment with formats, camera angles, and visual styles, ultimately resulting in more dynamic content that captures audience attention. Analytics That Drive Strategy Understanding audience preferences is crucial for sustained growth on YouTube. Recognizing this, the platform is rolling out advanced analytics tools in 2024 that offer more in-depth insights into viewer engagement and channel performance. These analytics will be more intuitive, allowing creators to easily navigate and interpret complex data, so they can adapt their strategies accordingly. This enhancement enables creators to analyze viewer demographics, watch trends, and engagement metrics effectively. “Data should be your co-pilot,” explains YouTube’s Chief Product Officer, Neal Mohan. “With these analytics, we’re empowering creators to tailor their content and engage their audience more effectively.” As a result, creators can make data-driven decisions to optimize their content strategies, increasing relevance and significantly boosting audience retention. Fostering Community Through Collaboration Community building is an essential aspect of success on YouTube, and the platform understands this well. In response, YouTube is introducing collaborative features that encourage creators to work together, share expertise, and cross-promote content. One notable feature is the introduction of “collab playlists”, which allow multiple creators to co-curate a selection of their videos, providing audiences with a unique viewing experience. Additionally, the new “Project Together” initiative will allow groups of creators to collaborate on joint projects, streamlining the process of co-creation. This feature not only enhances engagement among creators but also extends reach to diversified audiences, introducing viewers to fresh content and innovative ideas. Diverse Monetization Options As creators focus on turning their passion into profitable ventures, YouTube is expanding its monetization options in 2024. This includes more avenues for creators to earn revenue through sponsored content, merchandising integrations, and exclusive memberships. By enhancing these revenue streams, YouTube aims to create an ecosystem that values and rewards a diverse range of content creators. Moreover, YouTube is launching a “Creator Fund” that provides financial support to emerging artists and innovators on the platform. This fund aims to invest in creators who demonstrate potential and creativity, allowing them to experiment with bold ideas without the financial burden. “Our goal is to fuel creativity with resources,” says Wojcicki. “We want emerging creators to know that we believe in their potential.” Empowering Global Voices YouTube’s innovations are not only limited to individual creators but also focus on amplifying diverse voices across the globe. The platform is expanding its initiatives to support creators from underrepresented backgrounds in 2024. This includes mentorship programs, workshops, and educational resources designed to equip creators with the skills and knowledge necessary for success. Furthermore, YouTube aims to foster inclusivity through features that support creators in different languages and regions, ensuring that diverse cultures and perspectives are celebrated on the platform. This initiative echoes the platform’s commitment to becoming a truly global space for sharing content and ideas. “Every voice matters, and YouTube is dedicated to ensuring that all creators have the opportunities they deserve,” mentions Mohan.

This includes enhanced moderation features, educational tools on online harassment, and greater support for creators facing safety issues. Additionally, YouTube is extending its user support to ensure that creators have access to the assistance they need, whether for technical challenges or channel management.

      "title": "Published Time: 2024-09-18T18:44:01+00:00 YouTube's New Features Set The Groundwork For 2025 - 9meters Skip to content Menu Menu Home Articles Games Movies Shows Phones Technology Social Media Streaming About Contact YouTube’s New Features Set The Groundwork For 2025 Jonathan Kao September 18, 2024 Streaming YouTube has been constantly evolving to enhance features for both creators and viewers; and as we head into 2025 the latest announcements this year will be pivotal for the future of video streaming. What’s new this year? Ai. The latest features both highlight YouTube’s commitment to leveraging AI and combatting the risks of it. YouTube wants to empower creators and improving accessibility. From AI-powered dubbing to redesigned interfaces, these innovations aim to make YouTube more inclusive, engaging, and user-friendly for everyone. YouTube is planning to introduce a wave of innovations for emerging creators to enhance their experience and growth on the platform, making it easier for them to thrive in the ever-changing landscape. These new features signify a transformative approach to content creation, with the incorporation of intuitive tools, enhanced analytics, collaborative opportunities, diverse monetization options, and a commitment to inclusivity and safety. YouTube is setting a promising stage for individuals looking to carve out a niche in the creator economy by recognizing the unique needs and challenges faced by creators and fostering a thriving community where creativity, connection, and opportunity abound. As we enter this new era of YouTube in 2024, creators from all walks of life are encouraged to embrace the opportunities presented. By leveraging these innovations, aspiring and established content creators alike can navigate the complexities of the modern digital landscape, ensuring their continued success and relevance in an evolving marketplace. Setting the Stage for 2025 and Beyond YouTube’s latest features not only enhance the current user experience but also lay the groundwork for the platform’s future. The emphasis on AI-powered tools and expanded accessibility features suggests a trajectory toward a more personalized, inclusive, and engaging platform in 2025 and beyond. AI-Driven Personalization: The “Ask” feature, still in its experimental phase, hints at a future where AI plays a more active role in understanding user intent and delivering tailored content recommendations and information. Global Reach and Accessibility: Multi-language audio tracks and expanded AI auto-dubbing demonstrate YouTube’s commitment to breaking down language barriers and making content universally accessible. Enhanced Creator Tools: The Community Hub and Podcast Shelf signal YouTube’s ongoing efforts to empower creators with more tools and resources to build and engage their communities. Seamless Viewing Experience: The redesigned Watch Page and Picture-in-Picture for Shorts aim to create a more immersive and convenient viewing experience across devices. These new features, combined with YouTube’s continuous innovation, paint a picture of a platform that’s poised for further growth and transformation in the years to come. As AI, accessibility, and creator tools continue to evolve, YouTube is likely to remain at the forefront of the online video landscape, shaping how we consume and interact with content in the future. YouTube’s Latest Innovations: The Future of Video Content YouTube has introduced new AI-powered tools to enhance creativity on its Shorts platform, including a major one called Veo. Veo utilizes Google’s DeepMind video generation model to allow creators to easily incorporate AI-generated backgrounds into their videos. With Veo, creators can use simple written prompts to generate standalone six-second video clips, expanding the possibilities for short-form content. This marks a significant improvement over the previous feature, Dream Screen, as Veo enables creators to produce dynamic visuals faster, fostering more creativity and flexibility in video production. The AI background functionality is set to be rolled out later this year, with the standalone clips expected to be launched in 2025. Additionally, YouTube is integrating AI-generated support within its Studio app, enabling creators to automatically generate titles, thumbnails, and video ideas using artificial intelligence. These features will streamline the production process, allowing creators to focus more on their creative vision while AI handles the more tedious tasks of content management. AI-Powered Features YouTube is harnessing the power of AI to enhance the platform for both creators and viewers. AI Auto-Dubbing: Expanding to more languages and creators, this feature breaks down language barriers, making content accessible to a global audience. AI-Powered Comment Replies: Creators can now receive AI-generated suggestions for comment replies, streamlining their interaction with viewers. “Ask” Feature (Experimental): Viewers can ask questions about videos and receive AI-generated answers without pausing playback, fostering deeper engagement with content. Creator-Centric Tools YouTube continues to empower creators with new tools and features: Multi-Language Audio Tracks: Creators can now upload multiple audio tracks in different languages, expanding their reach and impact. Community Hub in YouTube Studio: A revamped space in the YouTube Studio app offers creators deeper insights into their community and facilitates engagement. Podcast Shelf on Channel Pages: A dedicated section for podcasts helps creators showcase their audio content and attract new listeners. Viewer Experience Enhancements Several new features aim to improve the viewing experience on YouTube: Redesigned Watch Page (Experimental): The new watch page on web focuses on providing a smoother experience and easier navigation to related content. Picture-in-Picture for YouTube Shorts: This feature allows users to watch Shorts while using other apps on Android devices, enhancing multitasking capabilities. Feature Summary | Feature | Description | Availability | | --- | --- | --- | | Multi-Language Audio Tracks | Creators can upload multiple audio tracks in different languages. | Available now | | AI Auto-Dubbing | AI-powered dubbing for wider reach. | Expanding to more creators and languages | | AI-Powered Comment Replies | AI-generated suggestions for comment replies. | Available now | | Community Hub in YouTube Studio | Upgraded space for creator-community interaction. | Available now | | Podcast Shelf on Channel Pages | Dedicated section for showcasing podcasts. | Rolling out gradually | | “Ask” Feature | AI-powered Q&A about videos without interrupting playback. | Experimental, limited availability | | Redesigned Watch Page | Improved watch page design on web. | Experimental, limited availability | | Picture-in-Picture for YouTube Shorts | Watch Shorts while using other apps. | Available on Android | Despite the excitement surrounding these innovations, there have been concerns about how AI-generated content is created and whether it might contribute to a rise in spammy content or infringe upon intellectual property. YouTube has addressed these concerns by ensuring that all AI-generated content is watermarked and clearly labeled as such, preserving transparency for both creators and viewers. These new AI-powered tools exemplify YouTube’s ongoing effort to bridge technology with creativity, allowing Shorts creators to elevate their content while ensuring ethical usage and safeguarding originality. Short Summary: YouTube introduces new features to aid emerging creators in content creation and audience engagement. The platform focuses on enhancing analytics tools, enabling better strategy formulation. Collaborative features and innovative monetization options are designed to boost community building among creators. YouTube has long been a cornerstone for businesses and individual creators, providing a platform where imaginative content can flourish. As we continue to witness a dramatic increase in online video consumption, YouTube recognizes the need to empower emerging creators by introducing a suite of innovative tools and features in 2024. This move not only enhances the content creation process but also supports creators in establishing meaningful connections with their audiences. YouTube is set to unveil features focused on enhancing creativity, refining analytics, and diversifying monetization opportunities to propel creators’ growth in a fiercely competitive landscape. Enhancing Creativity Through Innovative Tools At the heart of YouTube’s 2024 strategy lies a commitment to fostering creativity among emerging creators. Enhanced content creation tools are vital to this effort, as they enable users to produce higher-quality videos effortlessly. One significant development is the introduction of streamlined video editing functionalities integrated directly into the platform. This feature will allow creators to edit videos without needing external software, reducing the barriers to entry for those less experienced in video production. “We’re making tools that unleash creativity. We want our creators to spend more time dreaming up their next project instead of grappling with technical challenges,” said Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube. In addition to editing tools, YouTube is introducing AI-powered assistance to support creators in scripting and developing video ideas. This innovation allows creators to harness artificial intelligence in content planning, aiding them in crafting narratives that resonate with their target audience. Furthermore, the platform’s user-friendly interface encourages creators to experiment with formats, camera angles, and visual styles, ultimately resulting in more dynamic content that captures audience attention. Analytics That Drive Strategy Understanding audience preferences is crucial for sustained growth on YouTube. Recognizing this, the platform is rolling out advanced analytics tools in 2024 that offer more in-depth insights into viewer engagement and channel performance. These analytics will be more intuitive, allowing creators to easily navigate and interpret complex data, so they can adapt their strategies accordingly. This enhancement enables creators to analyze viewer demographics, watch trends, and engagement metrics effectively. “Data should be your co-pilot,” explains YouTube’s Chief Product Officer, Neal Mohan. “With these analytics, we’re empowering creators to tailor their content and engage their audience more effectively.” As a result, creators can make data-driven decisions to optimize their content strategies, increasing relevance and significantly boosting audience retention. Fostering Community Through Collaboration Community building is an essential aspect of success on YouTube, and the platform understands this well. In response, YouTube is introducing collaborative features that encourage creators to work together, share expertise, and cross-promote content. One notable feature is the introduction of “collab playlists”, which allow multiple creators to co-curate a selection of their videos, providing audiences with a unique viewing experience. Additionally, the new “Project Together” initiative will allow groups of creators to collaborate on joint projects, streamlining the process of co-creation. This feature not only enhances engagement among creators but also extends reach to diversified audiences, introducing viewers to fresh content and innovative ideas.

Here's what's coming. Written by Sabrina Ortiz, Editor Feb. 12, 2025 at 1:05 p.m. PT Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images Despite the rise and fall of video platforms such as TikTok, Vine, and Musical.ly, YouTube has remained a top player in video streaming over the years. A key to that success has been constant updates to the platform, which make it easier for creators to produce and share videos and for audiences to enjoy them. Now, YouTube is sharing a road map for even more features. On Tuesday, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, in a blog post celebrating the platform's 20-year anniversary, highlighted major wins, identified several trends, and described what to expect from the platform in 2025 -- which unsurprisingly includes more AI. New in AI AI-powered features have been integral to the platform, powering video recommendations, caption production, and harmful content flagging. Last year, the company introduced additional AI features such as Dream Screen, soon getting Google's Veo 2 to improve how users generate images and video backgrounds for Shorts, and Dream Track, which allows users to create soundtracks for Shorts from a text prompt. Now, the company is turning its attention to incorporating AI for more practical, everyday applications. For example, Mohan shared that YouTube is investing in tools to help creators generate video ideas, titles, and thumbnails and optimize everyday workflows. YouTube will also expand its auto dubbing feature -- which uses AI to help creators translate their videos into multiple languages -- to all creators in the YouTube Partner Program. Also: Forget Sora: Adobe launches 'commercially safe' AI video generator. How to try it The platform is developing new tools to help creatives detect and control how AI depicts them on YouTube. In a pilot program, \"some of the world's most influential figures\" will get access to this early-stage technology. YouTube will use their feedback to refine the controls and build out the detection systems. AI will also be used to improve protections for younger viewers. Plans include using machine learning to help estimate a user's age and distinguishing younger viewers from adults to better cater content, experiences, and protections. YouTube on TV Here's a twist: According to Mohan, TV has surpassed mobile to become the primary device for YouTube viewing in the US by watch time. To better cater to these users, YouTube is improving its TV-watching options, starting with a second-screen experience that enables users to interact with the video they are watching on TV using their phones. YouTube is also experimenting with a Watch With feature that lets creators provide real-time commentary to events, such as games. Last year, the feature was available only for NFL games, but YouTube said it will continue to experiment with other sports and types of content. Podcasts are also having a moment on the platform, with YouTube becoming the most frequently used service for listening to podcasts in the US, according to Mahone. To further investment in podcasts, YouTube shared it will roll out more tools to support podcasters with improved monetization opportunities and audience discovery. Revenue streams YouTube has enabled many creators to make lucrative businesses based on the platform via leveraging ads, YouTube Premium, and shopping recommendations. To continue to bolster the creator economy, YouTube shared it will continue to support traditional revenue streams while introducing new ways for creators to partner with brands. Also: My 9 must-have gadgets for creating quality YouTube videos YouTube is also working on new ways for fans to engage with creators. For example, it is expanding its Hype feature that allows fans to go beyond liking and commenting on a video. By hyping a video that's been out less than seven days from a creator with under 500,000 subscribers, it climbs on hyped video leaderboards, giving creators an indicator of what content is really aligning with viewers, and top hyped accounts also get a special badge.

Also: My 9 must-have gadgets for creating quality YouTube videos YouTube is also working on new ways for fans to engage with creators. For example, it is expanding its Hype feature that allows fans to go beyond liking and commenting on a video. By hyping a video that's been out less than seven days from a creator with under 500,000 subscribers, it climbs on hyped video leaderboards, giving creators an indicator of what content is really aligning with viewers, and top hyped accounts also get a special badge.

craziest part they're doing it with simple educational videos that take less than an hour to make look at these numbers this channel aperture has grown to over 2.39 million subscribers their latest video The Man Who solved Life Hit 115,000 views in just 3 days and videos like brain rot doesn't have to control you are pulling in over 600,000 views if we go ahead and sort their videos by popular we can see an entire Library of videos that are getting Millions upon millions of views I spent 24 hours analyzing their entire Channel and what I discovered is absolutely gamechanging they're using AI Tools in a way I've never seen before and today I'm going to show you exactly how to recreate three of their most viral videos while other creators are spending weeks on research and editing you'll be able to create these videos in minutes I know it sounds impossible but watch this here's a video I made in just 15 minutes that's just as good as apertures viral hits in the vast expanse of the cosmos what defines the IAL of existence imagine a civilization so advanced IT defies our very understanding of life itself in this video I'll show you exactly how to create content like this from finding viral topics to generating professional videos with AI we're going to break down three specific videos that got them millions of views so before we get into creating the first video let me introduce the tool we are going to use to create these videos the tool I've been using is nid AI version 3 to get started open up their website I'll leave a link in the description below and make sure to select version 3.0 in the menu right here instead of version 2.0 once you've got that selected I want you to click on explore all flows right here once you do that you'll see all the possibilities open up and you can see that there's a lot to be done you've got AI shorts 15-second Clips script video screenplay animated ads Tik Tok Shop videos explainer videos anime style videos Minecraft animations now let's just start off simple let me show you how you can create a stoic Style video just like their most popular one so first we need to ensure the right mode is selected for that go to your text command and right below that click on workflows and now I will choose the one called documentary since I think it is the appropriate one for this topic now to keep things simple as we're just starting out I'll select 3 minutes for the duration of our video next up we need to describe our topic this is basically where you tell the AI what type of video you want to make now for this I've actually been using chat GPT basically I asked it to create a prompt for a video about a story that will be made about stoicism I will also mention the fact that I want this video to have dark Vibes as it perfectly fits the stoic Niche if you want to use that prompt structure too I will drop it below anyway I'm going to copy this paste that in right there and that's that now just know you can also just do the prompt yourself just in nid Ai and it will also create a story line and all of that good stuff for you I just prefer to have super accurate inputs and that's why I do this all right now next up you have to choose the style now by default if you came through one of the workflows that style will be selected so we've got clation however you can can obviously click on this drop- down menu here and choose any other style you want and then Additionally you can add all of these other things such as background music language captions and the list goes on whichever one you want to add you want to click on the plus icon so I'm going to click on language and make sure it's set in English if I want to change it to any other language just know that it's possible simply select the one you'd like to go with and that goes for any of the additional features you know what to have precise control over our final product I want to configure the voice over right away so click right here on voice voice actors button now I will set it to be male voice would be the one called heavy Northern English voice and then make sure you have the narrator selected now what is very important is that you click on media preference and then here you want to change only use stock media to only generated media by doing this you'll make sure that they're not taking any footage from their b-roll library but instead they're only going to use generative AI to get your movie done which is exactly what we want to do so I'm going to select that and there we go I'm just going to go with this and see what we get what the AI is now going to do is analyze are prompt as soon as all of that is done it's going to ask us some audience preferences and that looks like this I can now select the type of audience I want to create this video for now complete the remaining settings I will select the following options and now let's move on to see the result imagine for a moment you're standing amidst ancient Greek ruins at dawn the Golden Light washing over crumbling Stone what if I told you that right here over 2,000 years ago a philosophy was born that could change your life today must say that looks really good I mean let's analyze this there's an actual story line the overall aesthetic just looks really good the colors are absolutely amazing in my opinion this turned out just the way it should have however let's say that you're not happy with something that it created for example scene number one the opening in my opinion can be a lot better I want to actually replace this with something else and so what you would do is click on the edit button right there and then you want to select a clip that you would like to replace so I am going to select clip number one just like that I can then then click on generative media on the right hand side then check the duration of this clip which is 3 seconds click on generate media in the top left and then I'm going to describe a scene so just type in a prompt of your new shot and what you want to see once you've given it that prompt you want to click generate a clip just like that and it's then going to adjust the video and there we go so it actually did that and it's quite a cool shot I must say remember to click on replace and then save changes in order to actually apply these changes and just so you know you can customize every scene just like that and the same goes for music if you click on music script if you click on script and you've also got the settings button which is brand new this basically allows you to control anything there is to your video so you've got overlay presets transitions text the volumes everything there is including each voiceovers character it's all in here all right so that was fun we got a stoic video out of the way but let's do some more work let's go back to our model Channel I will scroll down a bit and I really love this video called Butterfly Effect if we click into it we can see that it's just a bunch of abstract B- rolls with with nature and random cinematic shots well this video got over 3 million views and I believe it has to do with its catchy title because obviously the butterfly effect is a famous concept but anyway let's go back to nid and for this topic I want to go with animated video the idea here is to create an educational video for kids that demonstrates the concept of a butterfly effect I want to create a story that vividly teaches that there are consequences to everything and essentially everything you do today will come back to you in the future and with that in mind we simply want to Pivot it into a lesson that teaches kids to be mindful and respectful in general I know it sounds dramatic but that's the point I really just want to get creative here and see what we can really come up with and so with that prompt done it's set to only use generated media I can now click on continue and actually generate the video but before we do it is going to give you these options as you can see so just watch me answering these should be pretty basic and let's click generate and see what we get have you ever heard of the butterfly effect it's the idea that one tiny action can change the whole world meet Lily she's about to learn how powerful her choices can be one morning Lily helps her little brother tie his shoes looks awesome however now I want to add captions and it is actually so simple after your video is generated you can just go in here and write add English captions at the bottom of the screen now click generate and let's see the updated result have you ever heard of the butterfly effect it's the idea that one tiny action can change the whole world all right now all of that was fun but now I actually want to put this AI tool to the test let's go big and see what it can actually do there is this workflow called hyper realistic film now let's again go back to our model Channel and there is a particular video they have which I think is just perfect for this case the video is called the most advanced civilization in the universe so with that in mind let's go back to our workflow and type out our idea then I'm going to choose that it should only use generated media and then I will keep the style as the one that is selected by default and so the language I will set to English the voiceover should be a male with a clear American voice and that is it I'm going to click continue so as you can see when it comes to generating movies and films it offers you whopping 10 minutes as Max duration but I will go with 1 and 1/2 minutes just to get the results faster I will also select science fiction for the audience obviously keep it YouTube and let's [Music] proceed in the vast expanse of the cosmos what defines the Pinnacle of existence imagine a civiliz ation so advanced IT defies our very understanding of life itself they harvest the energy of entire galaxies bending the fabric of SpaceTime to their will Stellar nurseries become their playgrounds black holes their tools their technology indistinguishable from Magic reshapes reality on a whim okay what an amazing video we just watched now let's say you want to enter International markets with your AI generated movies and produce it in multiple languages guess what you can simply type in translate The Voice over to Spanish and add Spanish captions as well now click generate and let's see the applied [Music] changes now let's just talk about pricing really quick you can try nid AI but if you do want to use this new AI generative capability it does have a monthly fee so I actually bought the one that is $96 a month this is the plan that allows you to make these generative AI fully animated videos and if you're already using nid AI for other projects that are not the AI animated ones you can actually just go to the add-on section and get generative seconds here this will save you hundreds of dollars that you would otherwise spend on editing animating and other production costs so go ahead and grab this deal while it's still around with my custom link down below and if you want to see even more ways to use inv video AI I actually made a video last month where I broke down eight different ways to use it in your content creation from crafting cinematic ads to creating clips that look like they're out of a Hollywood Blockbuster just click on the screen now to watch that next",

Co-published with Documented ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published. Project 2025, the controversial playbook and policy agenda for a right-wing presidential administration, has lost its director and faced scathing criticism from both Democratic groups and former President Donald Trump. But Project 2025’s plan to train an army of political appointees who could battle against the so-called deep state government bureaucracy on behalf of a future Trump administration remains on track. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement One centerpiece of that program is dozens of never-before-published videos created for Project 2025’s Presidential Administration Academy. The vast majority of these videos — 23 in all, totaling more than 14 hours of content — were provided to ProPublica and Documented by a person who had access to them. The Project 2025 videos coach future appointees on everything from the nuts and bolts of governing to how to outwit bureaucrats. There are strategies for avoiding embarrassing Freedom of Information Act disclosures and ensuring that conservative policies aren’t struck down by “left-wing judges.” Some of the content is routine advice that any incoming political appointee might be told. Other segments of the training offer guidance on radically changing how the federal government works and what it does. In one video, Bethany Kozma, a conservative activist and former deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Agency for International Development in the Trump administration, downplays the seriousness of climate change and says the movement to combat it is really part of a ploy to “control people.” “If the American people elect a conservative president, his administration will have to eradicate climate change references from absolutely everywhere,” Kozma says. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In the same video, Kozma calls the idea of gender fluidity “evil.” Another speaker, Katie Sullivan, who was an acting assistant attorney general at the Department of Justice under Trump, takes aim at executive actions by the administration of President Joe Biden that created gender adviser positions throughout the federal government. The goal, Biden wrote in one order, was to “advance equal rights and opportunities, regardless of gender or gender identity.” Sullivan says, “That position has to be eradicated, as well as all the task forces, the removal of all the equity plans from all the websites, and a complete rework of the language in internal and external policy documents and grant applications.” Trump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, falsely saying that he knew nothing about it and had “no idea who is behind it.” In fact, he flew on a private jet with Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, which leads Project 2025. And in a 2022 speech at a Heritage Foundation event, Trump said, “This is a great group and they’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do and what your movement will do when the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.” A review of the training videos shows that 29 of the 36 speakers have worked for Trump in some capacity — on his 2016-17 transition team, in the administration or on his 2024 reelection campaign. The videos appear to have been recorded before the resignation two weeks ago of Paul Dans, the leader of the 2025 project, and they are referenced on the project’s website. The Heritage Foundation said in a statement at the time of Dans’ resignation that it would end Project 2025’s policy-related work, but that its “collective efforts to build a personnel apparatus for policymakers of all levels — federal, state, and local — will continue.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Heritage Foundation and most of the people who appear in the videos cited in this story did not respond to ProPublica’s repeated requests for comment. Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign who features in one of the videos, said, “As our campaign leadership and President Trump have repeatedly stated, Agenda 47 is the only official policy agenda from our campaign.” Project 2025’s 887-page “Mandate for Leadership” document lays out a vast array of policy and governance proposals, including eliminating the Department of Education, slashing Medicaid, reclassifying tens of thousands of career civil servants so they could be more easily fired and replaced, giving the president greater power to control the DOJ and further restricting abortion access. Democrats and liberal groups have criticized the project’s policy agenda as “extreme” and “authoritarian” while pointing out the many connections between Trump and the hundreds of people who contributed to the project. “Trump’s attempts to distance himself from Project 2025 have always been disingenuous,” said Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “The discovery that the vast majority of speakers in Project 2025 training videos are alumni of the Trump administration or have other close ties to Trump’s political operation is unsurprising further evidence of the close connection there.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Several speakers in the videos acknowledge that the Trump administration was slowed by staffing challenges and the inexperience of its political appointees, and they offer lessons learned from their stumbles. Some of the advice appears at odds with conservative dogma, including a suggestion that the next administration may need to expand key government agencies to achieve the larger goal of slashing federal regulations. Rick Dearborn, who helped lead Trump’s 2016 transition team and later served in the Trump White House as deputy chief of staff, recalled in one video how “tough” it was to find people to fill all of the key positions in the early days of the administration. The personnel part of Project 2025 is “so important to the next president,” Dearborn says. “Establishing all of this, providing the expertise, looking at a database of folks that can be part of the administration, talking to you like we are right now about what is a transition about, why do I want to be engaged in it, what would my role be — that’s a luxury that we didn’t have,” referring to a database of potential political appointees. Dan Huff, a former legal adviser in the White House Presidential Personnel Office under Trump, says in another video that future appointees should be prepared to enact significant changes in American government and be ready to face blowback when they do. Advertisement Advertisement “If you’re not on board with helping implement a dramatic course correction because you’re afraid it’ll damage your future employment prospects, it’ll harm you socially — look, I get it,” Huff says. “That’s a real danger. It’s a real thing. But please: Do us all a favor and sit this one out.” “Eradicate Climate Change References” The project’s experts outline regulatory and policy changes that future political appointees should prepare for in a Republican administration. One video, titled “Hidden Meanings: The Monsters in the Attic,” is a 50-minute discussion of supposed left-wing code words and biased language that future appointees should be aware of and root out. In that video, Kozma says that U.S. intelligence agencies have named climate change as an increasingly dire threat to global stability, which, she says, illustrates how the issue “has infiltrated every part of the federal government.” She then tells viewers that she sees climate change as merely a cover to engage in population control. “I think about the people who don’t want you to have children because of the” — here she makes air-quotes — “impact on the environment.” She adds, “This is part of their ultimate goal to control people.” Advertisement Advertisement Later in the video, Katie Sullivan, the former acting assistant attorney general under Trump, advocates for removing so-called critical race theory from public education without saying how the federal government would accomplish that. (Elementary and secondary education curricula are typically set at the state and local level, not by the federal government.) “The noxious tenets of critical race theory and gender ideology should be excised from curriculum in every single public school in this country,” Sullivan says. (Reached by phone, Sullivan told ProPublica to contact her press representative and hung up. A representative did not respond.) Advertisement Advertisement In a different video, David Burton, an economic policy expert at the Heritage Foundation, discusses the importance of an obscure yet influential agency called the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The Trump administration used OIRA to help roll back regulations on economic, fiscal and environmental issues. Under Biden, OIRA took a more aggressive stance in helping review and shape new regulations, which included efforts to combat housing discrimination, ban the sale of so-called ghost guns and set new renewable fuel targets. Burton, in the Project 2025 video, urges future political appointees to work in OIRA and argues that the office should “increase its staffing levels considerably” in service of the conservative goal of reining in the so-called administrative state, namely the federal agencies that craft and issue new regulations. “Fifty people are not enough to adequately police the regulatory actions of the entire federal government,” Burton says. “OIRA is one of the few government agencies that limits the regulatory ambitions of other agencies.” (Burton confirmed in a brief interview that he appeared in the video and endorsed expanding OIRA’s staffing levels.) Expanding the federal workforce — even an office tasked with scrutinizing regulations — would seem to cut against the conservative movement’s long-standing goal of shrinking government. For anyone confused by Project 2025’s insistence that a conservative president should fill all appointee slots and potentially grow certain functions, Spencer Chretien, a former Trump White House aide who is now Project 2025’s associate director, addresses the tension in one video. Advertisement Advertisement “Some on the right even say that we, because we believe in small government, should just lead by example and not fill certain political positions,” Chretien says. “I suggest that it would be almost impossible to bring any conservative change to America if the president did that.” A Trump Government-in-Waiting The speakers in the Project 2025 videos are careful not to explicitly side with Trump or talk about what a future Trump administration might do. They instead refer to a future “conservative president” or “conservative administration.” But the links between the speakers in the videos and Trump are many. Most of those served Trump during his administration, working at the White House, the National Security Council, NASA, the Office of Management and Budget, USAID and the departments of Justice, Interior, State, Homeland Security, Transportation and Health and Human Services. Another speaker has worked in the Senate office of J.D. Vance, Trump’s 2024 running mate. Sullivan, the former DOJ acting assistant attorney general in charge of the department’s Office of Justice Programs, which oversees billions in grant funding, appears in three different videos. Leavitt, who is in a training video titled “The Art of Professionalism,” worked in the White House press office during Trump’s first presidency and is now the national press secretary for his reelection campaign. Advertisement Advertisement A consistent theme in the advice and testimonials offered by these Trump alums is that Project 2025 trainees should expect a hostile reception if they go to work in the federal government. Kozma, the former USAID deputy chief of staff, says in one video that “many” of her fellow Trump appointees experienced “persecution” during their time in government. In a video titled “The Political Appointee’s Survival Guide,” Max Primorac, a former deputy administrator at USAID during the Trump administration, warns viewers that Washington is a place that “does not share your conservative values,” and that new hires will find that “there’s so much hostility to basic traditional values.” In the same video, Kristen Eichamer, a former deputy press secretary at the Trump-era NASA, says that the media pushed false narratives about then-President Trump and people who worked in his administration. “Being defamed on Twitter is almost a badge of honor in the Trump administration,” she says. Outthinking “the Left” The videos also offer less overtly political tutorials for future appointees, covering everything from how a regulation gets made to working with the media, the mechanics of a presidential transition process to obtaining a security clearance, and best practices for time management. One recurring theme in the videos is how the next Republican administration can avoid the mistakes of the first Trump presidency. In one video, Roger Severino, the former director of the Office of Civil Rights in the Trump-era Department of Health and Human Services, explains that failure to meticulously follow federal procedure led to courts delaying or throwing out certain regulatory efforts on technical grounds. Severino, who is also a longtime leader in the anti-abortion movement, goes on to walk viewers through the ins and outs of procedural law and says that they should prepare for “the left” to use every tool possible to derail the next conservative president. “This is a game of 3D chess,” Severino says. “You have to be always anticipating what the left is going to do to try to throw sand in the gears and trip you up and block your rule.” (In an email, Severino said he would forward ProPublica’s interview request to Heritage’s spokespeople, who did not respond.) Operating under the assumption that some career employees might seek to thwart a future conservative president’s agenda, some of the advice pertains to how political appointees can avoid being derailed or bogged down by the government bureaucrats who work with them. Sullivan urges viewers to “empower your political staff,” limit access to appointees’ calendars and leave out career staff from early meetings with more senior agency officials. “You are making it clear to career staff that your political appointees are in charge,” Sullivan says. Other tips from the videos include scrubbing personal social media accounts of any content that’s “damaging, vulgar or contradict the policies you are there to implement” well before the new administration begins, as Kozma put it. Alexei Woltornist, a former assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, encourages future appointees to bypass mainstream news outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post. Instead, they should focus on conservative media outlets because those are the only outlets conservative voters trust. “The American people who vote for a conservative presidential administration, they’re not reading The New York Times, they’re not reading The Washington Post,” Woltornist says. “To the contrary, if those outlets publish something, they’re going to assume it’s false. So the only way to reach them with any voice of credibility is through working with conservative media outlets.” And in a video about oversight and investigations, a group of conservative investigators advise future appointees on how to avoid creating a paper trail of sensitive communications that could be obtained by congressional committees or outside groups under the Freedom of Information Act. “If you need to resolve something, if you can do it, it’s probably better to walk down the hall, buttonhole a guy and say, ‘Hey, what are we going to do here?’ Talk through the decision,” says Tom Jones, a former Senate investigator who now runs the American Accountability Foundation. Jones adds that it’s possible that agency lawyers could cite exemptions in the public-records law to prevent the release of certain documents. But appointees are best served, he argues, if they don’t put important communications in writing in the first place. “You’re probably better off,” Jones says, “going down to the canteen, getting a cup of coffee, talking it through and making the decision, as opposed to sending him an email and creating a thread that Accountable.US or one of those other groups is going to come back and seek.” Do you have any information about Project 2025 that we should know?

Project 2025, the controversial playbook and policy agenda for a right-wing presidential administration, has lost its director and faced scathing criticism from both Democratic groups and former President Donald Trump. But Project 2025’s plan to train an army of political appointees who could battle against the so-called deep state government bureaucracy on behalf of a future Trump administration remains on track. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement One centerpiece of that program is dozens of never-before-published videos created for Project 2025’s Presidential Administration Academy. The vast majority of these videos — 23 in all, totaling more than 14 hours of content — were provided to ProPublica and Documented by a person who had access to them. The Project 2025 videos coach future appointees on everything from the nuts and bolts of governing to how to outwit bureaucrats. There are strategies for avoiding embarrassing Freedom of Information Act disclosures and ensuring that conservative policies aren’t struck down by “left-wing judges.” Some of the content is routine advice that any incoming political appointee might be told. Other segments of the training offer guidance on radically changing how the federal government works and what it does. In one video, Bethany Kozma, a conservative activist and former deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Agency for International Development in the Trump administration, downplays the seriousness of climate change and says the movement to combat it is really part of a ploy to “control people.” “If the American people elect a conservative president, his administration will have to eradicate climate change references from absolutely everywhere,” Kozma says. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In the same video, Kozma calls the idea of gender fluidity “evil.” Another speaker, Katie Sullivan, who was an acting assistant attorney general at the Department of Justice under Trump, takes aim at executive actions by the administration of President Joe Biden that created gender adviser positions throughout the federal government. The goal, Biden wrote in one order, was to “advance equal rights and opportunities, regardless of gender or gender identity.” Sullivan says, “That position has to be eradicated, as well as all the task forces, the removal of all the equity plans from all the websites, and a complete rework of the language in internal and external policy documents and grant applications.” Trump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, falsely saying that he knew nothing about it and had “no idea who is behind it.” In fact, he flew on a private jet with Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, which leads Project 2025. And in a 2022 speech at a Heritage Foundation event, Trump said, “This is a great group and they’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do and what your movement will do when the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.” A review of the training videos shows that 29 of the 36 speakers have worked for Trump in some capacity — on his 2016-17 transition team, in the administration or on his 2024 reelection campaign. The videos appear to have been recorded before the resignation two weeks ago of Paul Dans, the leader of the 2025 project, and they are referenced on the project’s website. The Heritage Foundation said in a statement at the time of Dans’ resignation that it would end Project 2025’s policy-related work, but that its “collective efforts to build a personnel apparatus for policymakers of all levels — federal, state, and local — will continue.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Heritage Foundation and most of the people who appear in the videos cited in this story did not respond to ProPublica’s repeated requests for comment.
