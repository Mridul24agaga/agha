      "content": "How to find pickup soccer games | ENDALGO Blog Start a new group Listing Explore Support How to find pickup soccer games Oct 13th, 2022 - Soccer Among the active soccer player audience we conducted a study on, the data shows 54% of that player pool played pickup soccer the past year (with soccer league (40%) and club soccer (36.5%) coming in as second and third). This tells us how much pickup soccer is popular among soccer players as a medium to enjoy the sport. This was actually a higher number than we expected; considering the researched pool is a group of active players who most likely play more than twice a month, we expected more of the organized type of soccer, such as club soccer, leagues, and tournaments, would have more participation among the pool. It just confirms how pickup games make soccer accessible not only to casual players but also to more committed players. So, we went further into finding out how players find those games and why they even play pickup games. How games are found right now. How players have been finding pickup games has been traditionally and has stayed that way: word of mouth. When we asked the active soccer players how they find local pickup soccer games, 49% answered that they get information on games through word of mouth, followed by online community (45%) and social media (37%) (note that players were allowed to choose multiple options). Even in this era of digital prosperity, it is quite surprising that players still find pickup soccer through their friends' and teammates' networks. Why players want to find and play pickup games. As you might have expected, pickup games are usually far from trying to be competitive and playing to win a match. Hence, many people play to stay in shape and socialize. When the pool of active players was asked what their favorite thing about the player (pickup) soccer is, staying in shape consisted for 40.5%, and meeting new people (social life) consisted of 40%. Sports are fun because of the aspect of competing and striving to win, but pickup soccer was more of a stage that is casual among the types of soccer that are played. ENDALGO is the best pickup soccer app. Perhaps, finding a pickup game through friends can be the most effective way, but players without that network or newcomers to specific areas may not be able to leverage that channel of finding games through word of mouth. Also, pickup games can vary in styles and skill levels; as mentioned earlier, the majority of the audience may want to have a good time and socialize while trying to stay in shape, but that doesn’t mean some players want to play competitively and play more seriously. ENDALGO has the ability to list and recommend local soccer events and pickup games based on user location. Moreover, on the games that pickup groups, teams, and clubs host on ENDALGO, they can be specific on the type of games and events they are providing so that the audience can filter through their needs, benefiting both the players and the hosts. Conclusion Although the information we found was from active soccer players, the results seem fitting even for beginner and more casual soccer players. Pickup soccer is undeniably one of the most effective and fun ways for all soccer players and audiences to stay active and engage with the beautiful sport. Hope this information got more people to think that soccer is more approachable even without skills and experience. We recommend giving ENDALGO a try to see what’s happening in your area and, furthermore, RSVP’ing to a game to have fun and even meet new people to play soccer with.

Basketball? “Rabbit grabs the rebound but then can’t move with it, his body weighs a ton, his feet have lost their connection to his head. Tiger knifes in between him and the basket, leans right in his face with a violet snarl, then eases back a little so Rabbit feels a gap, a moment’s slackness in… By Craig Cox | Experience LifeJuly 10, 2009 “__Rabbit grabs the rebound but then can’t move with it, his body weighs a ton, his feet have lost their connection to his head. Tiger knifes in between him and the basket, leans right in his face with a violet snarl, then eases back a little so Rabbit feels a gap, a moment’s slackness in the other in which to turn the corner; he takes one slam of a dribble, carrying his foe on his side like a bumping sack of coal, and leaps up for the peeper. The hoop fills his circle of vision, it descends to kiss his lips, he can’t miss.” I was reminded last night of that scene in Updike’s novel Rabbit at Rest where the sixtysomething Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom, former high school basketball star, goes one-on-one with a young buck on a dirt court in Florida. He sinks the winner just as a massive heart attack levels him. My return to the hardwood last night after a long, self-imposed exile was not quite that dramatic (no myocardial infarction), but it did remind me how much I love the game — and what a great workout it is. To review: For more than 15 years, I played once a week with a bunch of guys at a local school gym. The two-hour session was, along with my bicycle commute, the only real exercise I did. Then, in 1998, I blew out my right knee. I came back several months later and played (tentatively) until 2002, when I figured I’d pretty much outlived my usefulness as a teammate. Recently, though, my knees have been feeling pretty OK, and in an effort to add some variety to my workout regimen I started thinking about getting back on the court again — just some casual shooting, maybe a game of HORSE, or something. And when my son, Martin, 18, who spends way too much time indoors, indicated an interest in the climbing wall at a suburban Life Time club, I figured it was a good time to take the leap (so to speak). So, last night after dinner, we climbed into the Crapmobile and headed to the Eagan club, where the basketball courts and climbing wall share a high ceiling. We grabbed a ball and started clanging shots off the backboard and rim when we weren’t throwing up airballs. (I’m stronger in the upper body than I was a couple of years ago, when I last did this, and my range was all off.) Eventually, though, we started to get the hang of it — Martin started to drain 3-pointers and I managed to rattle in a few short-range jumpers. It felt good. Martin went off to scale the Eagan version of el Capitan. I demurred, content to continue the search for my old shooting form, until three fresh-faced twentysomethings approached, looking for a game. “You wanna play?” they inquired. I looked around to locate whoever they might be talking to, but there was nobody but me in the vicinity. It’s really what any serious player wants to have happen — a little friendly competition to get the juices flowing — and though I haven’t played in years, I couldn’t resist. “You’ll take it easy on the old guy, right?” I asked, jokingly, but not really joking. “No posting up, right?” They thought that was pretty funny. Two other guys joined us and we shot for teams — first three to sink a shot from behind the arc would be on one team. The three twentysomethings each calmly buried a three. Hmmm, I thought. That put me on a team with a large, muscular fellow who I’ll call Shaq and a younger, more angular dude who seemed to model his game after Kobe. Our opponents were quick, but not tall, so I figured maybe Shaq would give us an edge inside, until I discovered he didn’t jump much, and every time I lobbed him the ball he kicked it back outside to Kobe, who would do a little shaking and baking but didn’t really know how to pass the ball. The young guys did know how to pass and set picks and drive and spot up for threes, plus they could rebound — especially when Shaq and Kobe neglected to block them off the boards. So we soon found ourselves on the short end of a 9-5 score. They were not great defenders, though, so Kobe eventually found his way into the lane for easy layups and even I was able to pick up a couple of easy assists on drive-and-dishes around the basket. Shaq hit a couple of threes and a layup, I turned a couple of steals into easy baskets, and we closed the gap. I wasn’t exactly channeling Magic Johnson out on the point, but I was distributing the ball and forcing some turnovers. Then, with us down by two, I lobbed it into Shaq on the left block. He kicked it back out to me. I gave my guy a little ball fake to get him up in the air, drove the lane, and shoveled it up off the glass and in. No big deal. Down 14-13, I inbounded to Shaq behind the arc, but his shot rattled out. They rebounded and hit an open jumper to win 15-13. I was sucking fumes, but my knees held out. I looked over at Martin, who had conquered the walls and had been watching the game for the past few minutes. He smiled in a way that might have been construed as a momentary sign of respect for his old man’s game, but I know him better than that. This morning, I awoke with a blister on my left big toe and some excellent stiffness in an impressive variety of muscle groups and joints. In other words, I’ve never felt better. Thoughts to share?

  "researchSummary": "How to find pickup soccer games | ENDALGO Blog Start a new group Listing Explore Support How to find pickup soccer games Oct 13th, 2022 - Soccer Among the active soccer player audience we conducted a study on, the data shows 54% of that player pool played pickup soccer the past year (with soccer league (40%) and club soccer (36.5%) coming in as second and third). This tells us how much pickup soccer is popular among soccer players as a medium to enjoy the sport. This was actually a higher number than we expected; considering the researched pool is a group of active players who most likely play more than twice a month, we expected more of the organized type of soccer, such as club soccer, leagues, and tournaments, would have more participation among the pool. It just confirms how pickup games make soccer accessible not only to casual players but also to more committed players. So, we went further into finding out how players find those games and why they even play pickup games. How games are found right now. How players have been finding pickup games has been traditionally and has stayed that way: word of mouth.
