So, you’ve got “playpickups.app” in the mix, and right off the bat, that screams something playful and maybe a bit sporty. It’s got that “pickups” vibe, which usually hints at grabbing something—likely in a casual, fun way. Now, “play” in the title suggests there’s some kind of game or interactive element involved. It could be a platform where you and your buddies can jump into some competitions or challenges. Maybe it’s a fantasy sports thing? You know, like drafting your own team and seeing how they perform in real-life games. That’s always a solid way for fans to engage more with their favorite sports. But let’s not stop there. “Pickups” could also hint at pickup games—think basketball at the park or casual football matches. If that’s the case, maybe this site is all about organizing those spontaneous games. You might find a way to connect with others in your area who are down to play. It’s like an app that helps you find your crew when you wanna shoot some hoops or kick a ball around. Then again, “playpickups” might be something entirely different, like a game where you pick up items or characters in a virtual world. Maybe it’s a mobile gaming app where you collect things to level up or unlock cool features. Could be a twist on the classic treasure hunt concept, where you’re competing against friends or strangers online. And hey, who knows? It might also involve social media aspects. Perhaps they’ve integrated a way to share your games and achievements with friends, adding that competitive edge. You could boast about your skills, share your latest win, or post epic plays. People love to show off a bit, right? So, you get the picture. It’s got this fun flair to it, likely connecting users through gameplay, sports, or some competitive spirit. The vibe feels pretty casual—like hanging out with friends, enjoying some banter, and getting a little competitive without taking it too seriously. At the end of the day, if you’re looking to connect with others, get involved in some games, or just enjoy a bit of playful competition, playpickups.app sounds like it could be your jam. Who knows? You might just find your new weekend hangout spot or that one app that makes you think, “Why didn’t I find this sooner?” Sounds like a good time, if you ask me!",

Upvote · Anne Swardson 9y Have you thought of taking up a new sport together, something neither of you knows how to do? Horseback riding, for instance, requires balance, agility and patience but you don't have to be terribly athletic or coordinated to do it. Skiing is pretty similar, and it's hard at the beginning for anyone, no matter how coordinated they are, so you'd have a lot in common if neither of you does it now. Cross-country skiing is easier and better for fitness. Rock-climbing, yoga (I know, not a sport) ,bicycling, exercise classes, and so.

It is one of the few sports where you can drink beer while playing. In disc golf, you walk between holes, and the only exertion is throwing a disc every minute or two. Ping pong requires a lot of exertion, but I included it because it is good exercise, and you can pace yourself in casual play if you are over-exerting. I played ping pong with wreckless abandon, and even knocked a hole in a garage wall once, but I never injured myself. I’m 65 years old at the time of this writing, and played ping pong with a buddy up until about 7 years ago when he moved out of his house and had to give up his ping pong table.

Cooking or Meal Prep: Spend time together preparing healthy meals. It’s a great way to bond and learn about nutrition. Board Games or Video Games: If your friend enjoys sports, consider sports-themed games that don’t require physical activity, allowing for engagement in a different way. Volunteer Together: Participate in community service projects that might involve light physical activity but are focused on giving back. These activities can foster camaraderie and allow for enjoyable experiences without putting pressure on the non-athletic person. Upvote · Anne Swardson 9y Have you thought of taking up a new sport together, something neither of you knows how to do? Horseback riding, for instance, requires balance, agility and patience but you don't have to be terribly athletic or coordinated to do it. Skiing is pretty similar, and it's hard at the beginning for anyone, no matter how coordinated they are, so you'd have a lot in common if neither of you does it now. Cross-country skiing is easier and better for fitness. Rock-climbing, yoga (I know, not a sport) ,bicycling, exercise classes, and so. Tennis is so fun that maybe she'd be interested in taking lessons Continue Reading Have you thought of taking up a new sport together, something neither of you knows how to do?

I'm very sporty and my husband not at all and we just take long walks together. Upvote · 94 Sponsored by State Bank of India Secure Your Future with PMJDY!

Also, it’s hard to seriously injure yourself in those two sports. In bowling, you usually spend your time between shots sitting down. It is one of the few sports where you can drink beer while playing. In disc golf, you walk between holes, and the only exertion is throwing a disc every minute or two. Ping pong requires a lot of exertion, but I included it because it is good exercise, and you can pace yourself in casual play if you are over-exerting. I played ping pong with wreckless abandon, and even knocked a hole in a garage wall once, but I never injured myself. I’m 65 years old at the time of this writing, and played ping pong with a buddy up until about 7 years ago when he moved out of his house and had to give up his ping pong table. Shuffleboard, archery, and skeet shooting should also be suitable sports. Upvote · 93 Related questions What are some sports non-athletic people can enjoy?

Here we look at 10 casual sports that we think you should check out if you fancy trying cannabis and physical activity together. 11 13 Oct 2024 Max Sargent Hallucinogens, cannabis research, mind Learn more about our editorial process By Max Sargent Contents: Understanding the effects of cannabis on sports performance The best casual sports to take part in while high Tips for playing casual sports while high The best sports to play high: let the games begin Bored of sitting on the sofa watching TV when you’re high? Fair enough! The stereotype of the lazy stoner is changing, and we believe rightly so. Cannabis is a drug that can be used alongside many activities, including certain sports. In this article, we look at a range of casual sports, from solo to team, that we think are worth a try under the influence of THC. Understanding the Effects of Cannabis on Sports Performance For a long time, enjoying cannabis and playing sports have been viewed as mutually exclusive activities. However, the reality is quite different to this. Some athletes use cannabis to help them stay in the zone while performing their sport, while others use cannabis (both THC and CBD) as a valuable part of the recovery process. Surprisingly, more than a few American football players have admitted to using cannabis not just for recovery, but even before games to help them focus and engage. Shaun Smith of the Dallas Cowboys even claimed to have smoked two blunts before every game he played during his professional career. Now, this is not to say that we encourage the use of cannabis while playing an admittedly dangerous full contact sport, but it shows just how influential cannabis is even in professional sport. Using cannabis for post-workout recovery is common among both professional athletes and amateurs alike. Some indulge in THC-rich cannabis, while others prefer to use the non-psychoactive CBD to recover. A surprising number of top athletes choose to smoke weed, but vaping and oils are often used by those who want to avoid smoking of all kinds. Casual Sports & Weed: Fun Above All Else If you're considering using cannabis when engaging in sport, the main factor is whether it adds to, or detracts from, the experience. Ultimately, it's about having fun and remaining safe, so always use your best judgement when combining the two. The Best Casual Sports to Take Part in While High We’ve taken it upon ourselves to create a list of the best sports to enjoy while high. Again, it's more about having fun than trying to break any personal records or dominate the competition. But who knows, maybe a toke or two will give you a new perspective on your sport of choice! 1. Trail Running Trail running is great fun when high. The benefit of trail running over urban running is that you get the added benefit of being in a soothing natural setting, rather than having to navigate traffic and stomp on the hard concrete. Now, if you’re about to go for a run, we’d suggest taking an edible of some sort, as the carbon monoxide in smoke will reduce your red blood cells' ability to bind to oxygen, so you may feel more out of breath if you run after smoking. 2. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu BJJ is a very fun and not too exhausting sport that nevertheless requires a lot of mental work—so it can be great fun when high. However, it’s also a combat sport that involves submissions and can potentially seriously hurt people, so always ensure that you’re practising responsibly if you use weed alongside BJJ. To be on the safe side, we suggest telling any training partners that you're high so that they can adapt to you, and so that they can consent (or not) to training with a high person. 3. Surfing Few sports go so well with weed as surfing—it’s almost a cliche. So why not pair the two together for an enjoyable day on the waves? If you’re going to do this, we’d suggest getting your bearings while sober before heading out under the influence. Again, surfing is inherently dangerous, as it’s in wild water, so it’s important to know a little about what you’re doing, otherwise you might find yourself stoned, panicking and out at sea. 4. Skiing & Snowboarding Snow sports are also closely associated with the stoner community. When it comes to skiing and snowboarding high, we recommend taking it easy, choosing some simpler routes, and enjoying the smoothness of the journey, rather than the adrenaline rush of a big slope. Depending on how weed affects you, your reaction time might slow down significantly when you’re high, so it can help to slow everything else down too. If not, you might quickly find that things are moving faster than you can handle! 5. Ultimate Frisbee Ultimate Frisbee is a joy to play when high, though we can't guarantee it'll improve your throw. Free from peril and usually quite a laugh, this team sport is still highly technical and can be very involved. If you’ve a group of friends who all fancy sporting while high, then this can be a hilarious team event, whether or not everybody gets stoned. 6. Beach Volleyball Get yourself out in the sun, beside some crashing waves, light up a spliff, and indulge in some beach volleyball. Again, this is a great option to play with friends during the summer months or while on vacation, and it’s sure to be as funny as it is energising. Once again, this sport is fairly free from jeopardy, so if you’re prone to paranoia when high, it’s a good option that should soothe your mind while giving your body something entertaining to do. 7. Dodgeball Few of us ever get to play dodgeball outside of school, which is a shame seeing as it’s such a fun sport. So why not bring it back and play it now? Even better, why not get high and play it? If you do, make sure you choose a soft enough ball so that it doesn’t hurt, as nobody wants to run around stoned while having a heavy, painful ball pelted at them. 8. Longboarding Longboarding is great for solo stoners who want to drift around the world while enjoying their high. If you’re somewhere it’s safe to do so, it can be particularly enjoyable to longboard while listening to music, although it will make you less aware. Or, you can just feel the wind in your hair and listen to the sounds of the world as you seamlessly glide through it under the influence of THC. 9. Golf Golf doesn’t scream cannabis. Usually it has pretty conservative connotations, and many golfers might not appreciate stoners invading the course—but who cares? A gentle game with little risk of danger, golf could lend itself to a few happy stoned hours of pottering around a course. Just be sure to let others overtake you if you’re taking too long to putt your ball! 10. Basketball A bit more intense than some of the previous entries, basketball can be a lot of fun. However, you may not want to play basketball if you’re the only one who’s stoned, as you might find events move faster than you can! But a casual game can be a lot of fun, and it’s a great way to get out of your head for a while! Tips for Playing Casual Sports While High Now, here are a few final tips to consider if you choose to do sports when high; they’re sure to improve your time! Bring Plenty of Snacks Both sports and cannabis can make you hungry, so it stands to reason that you’ll get doubly hungry when you enjoy the two together! So, bring yourself plenty of food so that you don’t get overwhelmed with hunger. A mix of carbs and fresh, energising snacks is probably the best. Classic stoner snacks may not go so well with physical activities, so consider this when shopping. Stay Hydrated Even more importantly, stay hydrated. Dehydration and physical exertion is not a nice combination, and it’s a surefire way to get cotton mouth if you’re high at the same time. So at the very least bring some water along, or better yet, an isotonic sports drink. Bring Company and Be Sensible Where possible, consider doing these activities in the company of others. If they're high too, then it can make for a fun few hours of group interaction; if they're not, then they can keep an eye on you while performing more dangerous solo pursuits, such as surfing. Regardless, whether solo or in the company of others, always be sensible when using cannabis while doing sports. THC will change your perception and reaction time, and you're arguably more likely to make mistakes that can cause serious damage in the worst circumstances. Take the welfare of yourself and others seriously, and you should be just fine. The Best Sports to Play High: Let the Games Begin Getting high and doing sports is by no means impossible. In fact, we’d highly recommend it—in the right circumstances. Take a look through our list (or draw up your own), pack your necessities, and gather a few mates, because you’re in for a novel experience that we hope you’ll want to repeat. Whatever you do, be careful and treat any risky activities with the respect they deserve.

But a casual game can be a lot of fun, and it’s a great way to get out of your head for a while! Tips for Playing Casual Sports While High Now, here are a few final tips to consider if you choose to do sports when high; they’re sure to improve your time! Bring Plenty of Snacks Both sports and cannabis can make you hungry, so it stands to reason that you’ll get doubly hungry when you enjoy the two together! So, bring yourself plenty of food so that you don’t get overwhelmed with hunger. A mix of carbs and fresh, energising snacks is probably the best. Classic stoner snacks may not go so well with physical activities, so consider this when shopping. Stay Hydrated Even more importantly, stay hydrated. Dehydration and physical exertion is not a nice combination, and it’s a surefire way to get cotton mouth if you’re high at the same time. So at the very least bring some water along, or better yet, an isotonic sports drink. Bring Company and Be Sensible Where possible, consider doing these activities in the company of others. If they're high too, then it can make for a fun few hours of group interaction; if they're not, then they can keep an eye on you while performing more dangerous solo pursuits, such as surfing. Regardless, whether solo or in the company of others, always be sensible when using cannabis while doing sports. THC will change your perception and reaction time, and you're arguably more likely to make mistakes that can cause serious damage in the worst circumstances. Take the welfare of yourself and others seriously, and you should be just fine. The Best Sports to Play High: Let the Games Begin Getting high and doing sports is by no means impossible. In fact, we’d highly recommend it—in the right circumstances. Take a look through our list (or draw up your own), pack your necessities, and gather a few mates, because you’re in for a novel experience that we hope you’ll want to repeat. Whatever you do, be careful and treat any risky activities with the respect they deserve.

Members Online • tamim1991 Fun sports that emphasize fun and low risk of injuries Hello, so I've always played football (or soccer for Americans) my whole life but I've recently reduced it to a recreational level after an injury sustained and also getting bored of it at the seriousness that my other friends play it at. I'm a 32 year old man now with a baby and a job that is a long drive away, I cannot afford an injuries and not do I want it to be serious. I enjoy playing football for fun, doing a bit of skill, encouraging others to practice skills and generally just have a bit of a laugh! Unfortunately most footballing communities are far too serious with reckless challenges, non-encouragment of just playing casually or you get screwed at if you mess up a skill you're trying to practice and just general bad moods when they end up losing a game. Like mate, you're not getting paid for this, come back to reality, enjoy it and go home to your family. So I'm a bit put off this sport in all honesty and looking for a sport that generally emphasizes a bit more relaxing fun regardless of winning/losing (although a bit of competitiveness is fun as trying go toe-to-toe with an opponent is fun and avoids it being boring) and also where people aren't going to go in hard to injure one another.

Spikeball, an easy-to-transport game that is kinda like volleyball and will have your friends asking you to bring it on every beach trip. My friends are OBSESSED with Spikeball. While I'm not super coordinated and prefer to be a cheerleader (I'm accident-prone, OK!), this game is one of the most fun beach activities I've seen in a minute. It has been described as \"if volleyball and foursquare had a baby\" and can be played in a variety of ways. Promising review: \"Our family has enjoyed playing Spikeball. It's a very quick paced game that keeps you moving! My kids are 9 and 11 and love playing. We also have adults fighting over who gets to play next. You don't have to be super athletic to play, so it's a good game for everyone!\" —mandasoup Get it from Amazon for $69.99. 2. BucketBall will quickly become your favorite beach game because it finally gives you an excuse to put your Beer Pong skills to use. The starter set comes with 12 buckets, two hybrid balls, a tote bag, and the instructions for play. You can also buy a ~more advanced~ set that comes with inflatable racks so you can even play in the water! Promising review: \"We ordered Bucket Ball before we went to the beach for our family vacation. It was such a great purchase! We played it in the yard one night and we played it on the beach 3 of the days. At the house, we filled the buckets up with water. At the beach, we filled them up with sand. The balls worked really well because we had some windy days at the beach and the balls are heavy enough that they were not impacted by the wind. Several families near us at the beach came by to watch and eventually jumped in for some games. Each family loved it --- kids & adults --- and they all said that they were going to buy the game as well. The carrying case is an extra bonus --- very durable and makes it super-easy to store the buckets and to carry the game to wherever you are headed to play. Great product --- I highly recommend it!\" —Michael Get it from Amazon for $49.99+ (also available in a combo pack or party pack). 3. TidalBall combines cornhole and bocce ball for a competitive game that'll keep you entertained for the whole day. To get started you'll need to dig a 4\" hole and 4\" trench on each side of the \"court.\" There will be two teams and six TidalBalls to play with. Each time you throw your ball into the hole, your team will receive three points while a ball in the trench is equal to one point. The first team to get to 21 points wins! Get it from Walmart for $29.99. 4. A portable cornhole set you can keep in the trunk of your car and break out just in time for ~beach szn~. Promising review: \"Great product! Bought to keep on our boat so we have a game to play while beached. Good quality, doesn't take up too much space, light weight, easy to pack up once you get the hang of it. We've played it several times now and it's just as good as day one.\" —Andy Get it from Amazon for $36.99 (clip the coupon on the product page to save 20%). 5. Or a ladder toss set that'll surprisingly bring out your most competitive side — just try not to make any kids cry, OK? Promising review: \"This was bought for my boyfriend's birthday, and it's exactly what we wanted! Very sturdy and easy to construct/take apart. Perfect for play in the yard or at the beach. The plastic frame is very thick and is very sturdy. The carrying bag seems to be well constructed as well and makes transport so much easier. We love going to the beach and this was the perfect addition to our collection of beach games.\" —Ciara Get it from Amazon for $39.59. 6. A Jazzminton set you'll love because you don't have to set up a pesky net but will still get the oceanside cardio workout you've been looking for. Hit the birdies back and forth — that's it! Make up your own rules for added fun! Promising review: \"Great game and easy for just about anyone to play! The paddles have a nice color and are comfy to hold. Everything fits just perfectly into the carry bag which is included. Very fun and it is so nice not to be concerned about having a net!! Highly recommend if you have kids and want to keep them occupied for a while and having fun!\" —Bada Get it from Amazon for $14.99. 7. A Bocce Ball set – it'll be the perfect addition to your next beach day...and it'll DEFINITELY make your grandpa happy. Promising review: \"I absolutely love this set. The balls have great weight to them so they don’t get blown by the wind at the beach. When they knock each other in play, the balls are not damaged beyond a minor scratch (which is par for the course!). The whole family had fun playing on vacation! My 9-year-old cousin had never played Bocce before, and not only did he catch on quickly... but he surprised us and totally dominated! A fun set of Bocce for the whole family. I absolutely recommend this set. Very good quality for a great price.\" —Sophie Jenkins Get it from Amazon for $26.98. 8. A Wave Runner waterproof football with a small, easy-to-grip design for anyone that wants to kick a game of \"beach catch\" up a notch. Promising review: \"My kids absolutely love this thing, in the water or on land. My daughter is always asking to play catch with it, and it's not hard to see why. It's soft enough to easily snag and firm enough to throw a good spiral. Great ball for the beach or backyard.\" –Beard Get it from Amazon for $15.95 (clip the coupon to save 10%). 9. A frisbee with over 3K positive reviews on Amazon, so you know it's a guaranteed good time. Promising review: \"These are made of light weight plastic not the heavy thick type I was expecting. However don't be fooled. They are AWESOME! They fly straight and far. THESE ALSO FLOAT. I bought them to take to the beach. Someone else at the beach warned us as we played frisbee that they had lost theirs in the ocean. Ours floated though so we had no problems. We even started a new game where we threw it into the surf and then tried to be the first one to find where it washed up. I would recommend these for any type of frisbee play but especially if you are taking them on a water vacation.\" —Julie Barker Get a two pack from Amazon for $14.99 (available in three color pairings). 10. Or a Bottle Bash kit that'll up the stakes on your usual frisbee toss, which typically involves aimless throwing and nosediving-into-the-sand catches. Promising review: \"This game is tons of fun. Bought it for a beach trip and everyone loved it. Nicely made and easy to pack.\" —Bashing Bottles Get it from Dick's Sporting Goods for $49.99. 11. An avocado float to give new meaning to the term \"ball pit.\" Plus, it will pair perfectly with that fresh batch of guac you were planning to bring to the beach. I mean, is there anything better than simply tossing a ball around in the sand? This avocado float is great because you can flip-flop between playing and lounging. And if you're looking for some other reviewer-favorite beach products, we've got you covered. Promising review: \"This is the best pool float! It holds people of all sizes and is hilarious to see floating around. I love the added touch of the avocado seed. I throw it at people while they are trying to relax.\" —Ciara Get it from Amazon for $19.79. 12. Waterproof playing cards, so you can get a fierce game of poker going (just maybe don't strip unless you're spending the day at a nude beach). Promising review: \"These playing cards are a HIT. I take them out with me for social events and when visiting people, even to the beach. We just play and play. So you can get them wet and they won't soggy up and tear it just become a little hard to shuffle. It is so cool that they look like you can see right straight through them but you can't.\" —Tabs Get them from Amazon for $6.90. 13. A standard volleyball net you can use to meet new people on the beach and get a pick-up game going. Promising review: \"My boys are getting into volleyball at school and have taken an interest in it at home. Bought this set so they and the neighborhood kids had a safe place to practice together. Typically, we have up to 11 kids out there from 5 to 17 playing. They can be aggressive at times, yet the net has held up very well. After a month of heavy use, it still looks new. However, my grass has taken a beating...This volleyball set is kid and parent-approved. Highly recommended.\" —MGG Get it from Amazon for $78.99+ (available in three styles). 14. A set of UNO Splash Cards for when you want to have fun with a nice, quiet game until you drop that first Wild Draw Four card. Then, all bets are off. Promising review: \"We love these! This is actually the second set I have bought because my extended family loves them too and has forever \"borrowed\" our last set. We take these everywhere and they have held up perfectly - in hot tubs, pools, beaches, boats, parks, you name it they have gone. We especially like that whenever we bring them, other folks want to play so it makes sharing a pool or hot tub a more social (read: less awkward) activity. The cards are well constructed and are definitely waterproof. They can be submerged because they are made out of thin plastic. We also haven't had any issues with the print coming off or showing wear and tear. The individual cards will float momentarily if placed horizontally but will sink if the water's surface tension is broken or they are vertical. So we don't use them directly in the lake/ocean water because there is nowhere to put the discard pile and the risk of losing cards is high but in the pool, hot tub, or beach this isn't a concern. I highly recommend these for anyone that loves UNO and water activities!\" —Samantha Get it from Amazon for $14.24. 15. A ring toss set that'll bring back fond memories of your childhood and encourage some ~friendly~ competition. Promising review: \"Who wouldn't love this ring toss game! It travels well, breaking down to fit in the included bag, so we can take it to the beach, camping or just in the backyard for fun. Each peg is color coded and each ring has a corresponding bead on it. The base itself is sturdy and comes with point values for scoring, but we just like to play for fun!! This will totally come in handy this summer!! Our family loves it!!\" —Cali Julz Get it from Amazon for $25.99. 16. A reversible rug with checkers on one side and tic-tac-toe on the other, a must-have for anyone who would rather exercise their brain muscle out on the sand. Promising review: \"This is a standard item in our beach bag. Gives people a chance to interact, have fun, and take a break from the water. I like that it has three different games. Weight of items is good for outdoor use. They don’t blow away in windy weather.\" —Mickey Get it from Amazon for $16.49. 17. A \"New York Times: Beach Blanket Crosswords\" book that is truly fun that the whole family can get in on, but in a much more let's-just-stay-put kind of way. Simply shout out some clues and just wait and see how eager your beach squad is to help you solve them! And if you're looking for the ideal beach-crossword-seat, head over to our list of the best beach chairs. Promising review: \"Bought this book years ago and have used it at the beach with the family. We have enjoyed doing the puzzles together. The perfect level for us, not too easy, not too hard. Just plain fun!\" –Joanne Wilson Get it from Amazon for $14.99, or from Bookshop (to support local bookstores) for $15.80. 18. Hydro Lacrosse so you can take your favorite sport to your favorite place: the beach. The soft foam handles make it easy for people of all ages to get in on the fun! This is a simple toss and catch game using lacrosse-style sticks. Get it from Amazon for $12.76+ (available in two colors). 19. A classic sticky velcro toss game that'll have everyone hopping out of their chairs to get in on the fun. Simply throw the ball and have someone else catch it on their velcro-ed mitt. Promising review: \"This play set is wonderful for kids to learn the skill of throwing and catching. The ball really sticks well to the mitt. Slow or hard, sticks perfectly. I highly recommend it.\" –Guy in CA Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in four colors and two packs). 20. A light-up flying disc, so you can keep playing even as the sun begins to set (or just on a super-bright day, where it might be hard to make out a piece of plastic that's landed in a dune...but these lights will help you find it every time). Promising review: \"My family purchased a green 360 and a red 360 for a trip to Rocky Point. These frisbees were a hit! I was impressed by their durability, not that I recommend testing their limits. 😂 Both discs took a dip in the ocean a couple of dozen times and smacked a couple of rocks pretty hard. They are still operating like new. It threw just like a regular 175g disc, and the molding of the electronics doesn’t hinder or feel weird in any way. These things are bright! The LEDs can be easily seen in the middle of a sunny day on the beach, but at night, the highest setting is blindingly bright. That being said I was also happy with the battery life but it seemed to need a couple cycles of use to reach the batteries full potential. Four families played with them and not a negative word was said, great frisbee.\" —Lincoln Get it from Amazon for $35.99+ (available in five colors).

Make up your own rules for added fun! Promising review: \"Great game and easy for just about anyone to play! The paddles have a nice color and are comfy to hold. Everything fits just perfectly into the carry bag which is included. Very fun and it is so nice not to be concerned about having a net!! Highly recommend if you have kids and want to keep them occupied for a while and having fun!\" —Bada Get it from Amazon for $14.99. 7. A Bocce Ball set – it'll be the perfect addition to your next beach day...and it'll DEFINITELY make your grandpa happy. Promising review: \"I absolutely love this set. The balls have great weight to them so they don’t get blown by the wind at the beach. When they knock each other in play, the balls are not damaged beyond a minor scratch (which is par for the course!). The whole family had fun playing on vacation! My 9-year-old cousin had never played Bocce before, and not only did he catch on quickly... but he surprised us and totally dominated! A fun set of Bocce for the whole family. I absolutely recommend this set. Very good quality for a great price.\" —Sophie Jenkins Get it from Amazon for $26.98. 8. A Wave Runner waterproof football with a small, easy-to-grip design for anyone that wants to kick a game of \"beach catch\" up a notch. Promising review: \"My kids absolutely love this thing, in the water or on land. My daughter is always asking to play catch with it, and it's not hard to see why. It's soft enough to easily snag and firm enough to throw a good spiral. Great ball for the beach or backyard.\" –Beard Get it from Amazon for $15.95 (clip the coupon to save 10%). 9. A frisbee with over 3K positive reviews on Amazon, so you know it's a guaranteed good time. Promising review: \"These are made of light weight plastic not the heavy thick type I was expecting. However don't be fooled. They are AWESOME! They fly straight and far. THESE ALSO FLOAT. I bought them to take to the beach. Someone else at the beach warned us as we played frisbee that they had lost theirs in the ocean. Ours floated though so we had no problems. We even started a new game where we threw it into the surf and then tried to be the first one to find where it washed up. I would recommend these for any type of frisbee play but especially if you are taking them on a water vacation.\" —Julie Barker Get a two pack from Amazon for $14.99 (available in three color pairings). 10. Or a Bottle Bash kit that'll up the stakes on your usual frisbee toss, which typically involves aimless throwing and nosediving-into-the-sand catches. Promising review: \"This game is tons of fun. Bought it for a beach trip and everyone loved it. Nicely made and easy to pack.\" —Bashing Bottles Get it from Dick's Sporting Goods for $49.99. 11. An avocado float to give new meaning to the term \"ball pit.\" Plus, it will pair perfectly with that fresh batch of guac you were planning to bring to the beach. I mean, is there anything better than simply tossing a ball around in the sand? This avocado float is great because you can flip-flop between playing and lounging. And if you're looking for some other reviewer-favorite beach products, we've got you covered. Promising review: \"This is the best pool float! It holds people of all sizes and is hilarious to see floating around. I love the added touch of the avocado seed. I throw it at people while they are trying to relax.\" —Ciara Get it from Amazon for $19.79. 12. Waterproof playing cards, so you can get a fierce game of poker going (just maybe don't strip unless you're spending the day at a nude beach). Promising review: \"These playing cards are a HIT. I take them out with me for social events and when visiting people, even to the beach. We just play and play. So you can get them wet and they won't soggy up and tear it just become a little hard to shuffle. It is so cool that they look like you can see right straight through them but you can't.\" —Tabs Get them from Amazon for $6.90. 13. A standard volleyball net you can use to meet new people on the beach and get a pick-up game going. Promising review: \"My boys are getting into volleyball at school and have taken an interest in it at home. Bought this set so they and the neighborhood kids had a safe place to practice together. Typically, we have up to 11 kids out there from 5 to 17 playing. They can be aggressive at times, yet the net has held up very well. After a month of heavy use, it still looks new. However, my grass has taken a beating...This volleyball set is kid and parent-approved. Highly recommended.\" —MGG Get it from Amazon for $78.99+ (available in three styles). 14. A set of UNO Splash Cards for when you want to have fun with a nice, quiet game until you drop that first Wild Draw Four card. Then, all bets are off. Promising review: \"We love these! This is actually the second set I have bought because my extended family loves them too and has forever \"borrowed\" our last set. We take these everywhere and they have held up perfectly - in hot tubs, pools, beaches, boats, parks, you name it they have gone. We especially like that whenever we bring them, other folks want to play so it makes sharing a pool or hot tub a more social (read: less awkward) activity. The cards are well constructed and are definitely waterproof. They can be submerged because they are made out of thin plastic. We also haven't had any issues with the print coming off or showing wear and tear. The individual cards will float momentarily if placed horizontally but will sink if the water's surface tension is broken or they are vertical. So we don't use them directly in the lake/ocean water because there is nowhere to put the discard pile and the risk of losing cards is high but in the pool, hot tub, or beach this isn't a concern. I highly recommend these for anyone that loves UNO and water activities!\" —Samantha Get it from Amazon for $14.24. 15. A ring toss set that'll bring back fond memories of your childhood and encourage some ~friendly~ competition. Promising review: \"Who wouldn't love this ring toss game! It travels well, breaking down to fit in the included bag, so we can take it to the beach, camping or just in the backyard for fun. Each peg is color coded and each ring has a corresponding bead on it. The base itself is sturdy and comes with point values for scoring, but we just like to play for fun!! This will totally come in handy this summer!! Our family loves it!!\" —Cali Julz Get it from Amazon for $25.99. 16. A reversible rug with checkers on one side and tic-tac-toe on the other, a must-have for anyone who would rather exercise their brain muscle out on the sand. Promising review: \"This is a standard item in our beach bag. Gives people a chance to interact, have fun, and take a break from the water. I like that it has three different games. Weight of items is good for outdoor use. They don’t blow away in windy weather.\" —Mickey Get it from Amazon for $16.49. 17. A \"New York Times: Beach Blanket Crosswords\" book that is truly fun that the whole family can get in on, but in a much more let's-just-stay-put kind of way. Simply shout out some clues and just wait and see how eager your beach squad is to help you solve them! And if you're looking for the ideal beach-crossword-seat, head over to our list of the best beach chairs. Promising review: \"Bought this book years ago and have used it at the beach with the family. We have enjoyed doing the puzzles together. The perfect level for us, not too easy, not too hard. Just plain fun!\" –Joanne Wilson Get it from Amazon for $14.99, or from Bookshop (to support local bookstores) for $15.80. 18. Hydro Lacrosse so you can take your favorite sport to your favorite place: the beach. The soft foam handles make it easy for people of all ages to get in on the fun! This is a simple toss and catch game using lacrosse-style sticks. Get it from Amazon for $12.76+ (available in two colors). 19. A classic sticky velcro toss game that'll have everyone hopping out of their chairs to get in on the fun. Simply throw the ball and have someone else catch it on their velcro-ed mitt. Promising review: \"This play set is wonderful for kids to learn the skill of throwing and catching. The ball really sticks well to the mitt. Slow or hard, sticks perfectly. I highly recommend it.\" –Guy in CA Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in four colors and two packs). 20. A light-up flying disc, so you can keep playing even as the sun begins to set (or just on a super-bright day, where it might be hard to make out a piece of plastic that's landed in a dune...but these lights will help you find it every time). Promising review: \"My family purchased a green 360 and a red 360 for a trip to Rocky Point. These frisbees were a hit! I was impressed by their durability, not that I recommend testing their limits. 😂 Both discs took a dip in the ocean a couple of dozen times and smacked a couple of rocks pretty hard. They are still operating like new. It threw just like a regular 175g disc, and the molding of the electronics doesn’t hinder or feel weird in any way. These things are bright! The LEDs can be easily seen in the middle of a sunny day on the beach, but at night, the highest setting is blindingly bright. That being said I was also happy with the battery life but it seemed to need a couple cycles of use to reach the batteries full potential. Four families played with them and not a negative word was said, great frisbee.\" —Lincoln Get it from Amazon for $35.99+ (available in five colors).

My palms were sweaty, my heart was racing, my brain was going crazy. After ten minutes, I finally mustered up my 20 seconds of courage, yelled at myself, got out of the car, and walked through the double doors. I was getting ready to try something I had always wanted to do but had been too scared. I attended my first swing dance class. An hour later, I left a sweaty mess…a sweaty mess with a giant smile on my face. With today marking the beginning of another 6-week challenge on Nerd Fitness, I want to discuss exercise that isn’t exercise, and another big excuse that we all hear too often. Cutting out all excuses “But I don’t like to exercise.” While some are like Odie and love to run around all day, others are like Garfield and feel like they must be allergic to exercise. I’ve heard this excuse more than I care to count, and I’m going to put a stop to it right now. That’s right. Today we’re going to eliminate the second most common excuse people have when it comes to exercise. The first? “I don’t have time” which I already DESTROYED in a previous post. You can’t use that one either. So, there. Let’s take a look at how to stop using it, and a bunch of different ways to stay healthy without actually realizing you’re exercising. The Truth About Exercise As stated in the Rules of the Rebellion, you can’t outrun your fork. Unless you’re Michael Phelps swimming for 8 hours a day at a Olympic level, there is no amount of exercise that can cancel out a diet full of processed foods, junk food, and liquid calories. For whatever reason, human beings are amazing at justifying and rationalizing the most ridiculous things. We use these rationalizations to justify horrible behavior, and then compound that decision by saying things like “well, I already made one bad decision, so today is ruined. I’ll start tomorrow.” In order for you to live a healthy life, you need to get your head straight and understand a few key facts: Exercising for an hour, burning 300-400 calories, and then saying “I earned this” to justify stuffing 1000 calories worth of junk food down your throat is a losing battle. We’re gonna stop doing this. Exercise does not mean “run on a treadmill for four hours and be miserable.” Exercise is anything that elevates your heart rate and takes your body outside of its normal comfort zone. Your diet is responsible for 80-90% of your success or failure when it comes to losing weight and getting healthier. If I could only tell you to fix one thing, your diet or exercising, it would be your diet. Every time. Every decision counts and every choice adds up. One bad decision does not ruin a day. One day off doesn’t ruin a week. One week off doesn’t ruin a month. EVERY SINGLE DECISION you make can take you closer or further away from your ultimate goal. Stop worrying about the decision you made 10 minutes ago or yesterday and focus on the next one. Combine these four facts, and we’re left with this: Exercise is a bonus. Exercise helps your heart get stronger, can help build muscle, usually gets you outside the house and absorbing vitamin D, and brings you a litany of other health benefits. Exercise is not an excuse to eat like crap. Instead, you need to reframe your mindset. Instead of “I earned this” start telling yourself: “If I’m going to exercise, I might as well make it worth it by eating right too.” Daily exercise is a constant reminder that you are leveling up your life – that you must continue to make other good choices or you’re practically wasting your time. Exercising Without Exercising When you say “but I don’t like exercising,” what you’re really saying is: “I don’t enjoy the particular type of exercise that I have in mind.” If you don’t like lifting weights in a gym, don’t do it. If you don’t like running, don’t do it. I have never run more than a 5k in my life and have zero plans to ever run more than that. Unless there are zombies that can run a 10 k…in which case I’ll run an 11k. My main goal with Nerd Fitness is to get you to enjoy exercise, find a way to do it every day, and combine that with making better decisions about the food you put in your body. So, we need to find a way to exercise every day because it KEEPS US THINKING HEALTHY, which leads to other healthier decisions made throughout the day (where the real big wins are). Here are my favorite ways to exercise that don’t feel like exercise: Hiking, especially with friends – This last week I went and hiked around Lake Radnor in Nashville with fellow entrepreneur Matt Bodnar. We hung out with deer, saw incredible scenery, and talked about life and business. I also happened to walk five miles over various elevations. Walking – No time to hike? Go for a walk. Even a 15-minute brisk walk is enough time to get close to a mile walked, which gets you one step closer to Mordor. Do you have a 30-minute meeting at work? Have a walking meeting instead. Steve Jobs was known for doing this. LARPING – Live Action Role Playing. Might seem silly to those on the outside, but to those playing, it’s an amazing adventure that reminds us how awesome our imaginations are. Also, depending on the game, you could be wearing a heavy costume, swinging heavy weaponry, and running for your life! Rock Climbing – I love rock climbing. It’s one of the best arm/back/forearm workouts in existence, you get to feel like a badass when you reach the top of the wall, and all climbing routes are graded so you can level up the challenge as you get stronger/fitter/better. It’s a fit nerd’s dream! Geocaching – If rock climbing is a fit-nerd’s dream, then geocaching is a adventure nerd’s dream brought to life. Become a real life treasure-hunter (Lara Croft? Nathan Drake? You decide!), and get a great workout in while you’re at it. Dancing – Ever tried serious swing dancing? You’ll be sweating within ten minutes. How about hip hop? Drenched in sweat, and sore as hell the next day. Zumba? Tango? Flamenco? You’d be surprised what you can sign up for and what will elevate your heart rate. Roughhousing with your kids. I don’t have kids, but when I do, you can bet your ass I’ll be the dad out rolling around in the back yard with them. Don’t forget what it’s like to be a kid – it keeps you young. I really enjoyed this article from Art of Manliness on the importance of roughhousing! Climbing on stuff – Last week on my hike at Midoricon, I was walking through the woods with NF Rebel Joe (No, not THAT Joe). It was awesome to see this guy, having lost 100 pounds since finding Nerd Fitness, explore the woods like it was no problem: climbing on stumps, balancing on fallen trees, climbing trees, and more. When was the last time you’ve done stuff like THAT? Hmmm? (Shout out toMovNat!) Martial arts – Be honest. You watched The Matrix, you heard Neo go “I know Kung Fu” and you wanted to be able to one day say the same thing. Whether it’s Kung Fu, Muay Thai, Tae Kwon Do, Karate or Capoeira, there’s a martial art out there that will make you feel like a badass. Build a standing desk – Although we all know that correlation does not prove causation, it’s no surprise that there’s a strong correlation between sitting all day and an early grave. Why not fix your posture, strengthen your legs, and spend the day being more productive with a standing desk? Stop meeting for coffee – Hat tip to Charlie Hoehn on this one. If somebody wants to meet up with you for coffee, suggest something active: throwing a baseball, tossing a frisbee, going for a hike – anything that gets you up and moving. I say yes to pretty much anybody that invites me to play golf. Wink wink. You know… – That thing that couples do? Yeah. Do more of that. Self-explanatory. Moving on… Clean – Ugh, nobody likes to clean the house/apartment. I certainly don’t. So I make a game out of it. I see how much I can accomplish with a single song blasting at max volume. Of course, after getting through one song, I figure “welp, I’ve already started, might as well keep going.” Do handstands – We have an article coming up teaching you how to do your first handstand, which I’m very excited about. This is a fun activity that builds up serious arm and core strength and will leave you sweating bullets after even a few minutes. Find a park, go do handstands, cartwheels, somersaults, and whatever else makes you feel young again. Parkour – Our beginner’s guide to Parkour is one of the most popular on Nerd Fitness. I don’t care how old you are, there’s no reason you can’t get started with rolling around in your hard and vaulting over picnic tables and bike racks. Playout – Is Parkour too serious for you? Try a playout! Spiderman was on to something – climbing walls, swinging from skyscrapers, and popping flips around the bad guys. You might not be able to swing between buildings, but you can definitely visit a playground in your area and get creative! Adult gymnastics – In the same vein as Parkour, gymnastics will help you build some of the BEST real world strength you can get with any type of exercise, and it’s all done in a playful way without a single weight being picked up. Swing from rings, somersault, flip onto pads, and more. There are gyms all over the country. Yoga – Build flexibility, strength, and learn to freaking relax. There are million kinds of yoga, so sign up for a few different kinds and see which one lines up the best with what you’re looking for. Play video games that make you be active – Wii Tennis, Wii Fit, Just Dance on Xbox Kinect, and whatever games actually exist for the Sony Move (does anybody actually have this?). OK, DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) counts too. I know an hour of that is exhausting. Playing a normal game like Grand Theft Auto V? Make a rule that you can only play while standing up. That’s what I do to keep myself from spending twelve hours on the couch in marathon gaming sessions! Play on a playground – Obviously not when kids are around. Preferably with pants on. Go down the slide, swing across the monkey bars, climb the rope all, balance on the balance beam. Create an obstacle course for yourself and see how quickly you can get through it. You can even work out on a playground too. Play a musical instrument – Did you know playing the violin for an hour burns about as many calories as walking around a track at a moderate pace for an hour? It turns out, our brains can burn boatloads of calories too. So challenge your brain! Join a Rec league – New in town? Want to be active and meet people? Join a kickball or softball league. You get to exercise AND it’s a great way to meet new people! Bike to work – I know there are a lot of Rebels in our community who dropped a bunch of weight by making one change: they biked to work, or biked to their friend’s house, or started biking generlaly. You get from Point A to Point B, you save money on gas, and you get a workout. That would make Michael Scott proud. Play a childhood game – What games did you play as a child? Capture the flag? Kick the can? Simple tag? Get a few friends together and give it a try – it will be the most fun you’ve had in a while! Challenge yourself Yesterday we launched a new Six-Week Challenge on the Nerd Fitness Message Boards. If you want to join a few thousand of the most supportive people you’ll ever meet and help yourself live a better life, we’d love to have you. For this challenge, I’d love for you to commit to trying something new at some point in the next six weeks. I committed to Swing Dance Lessons for the month of September. After my four weeks are up, I’ll move onto something equally terrifying and new like Krav Maga or Capoeira for the month of October. Here’s my advice to you: Say yes before you can say no. Stop saying “I don’t have time” and realize you do. Stop saying “I can’t afford it” and find a way to make it a priority. Do all of this before you can talk yourself out of it. The best way to do that? Commit in advance. I pre-paid my four weeks of swing lessons. Having already paid for it, I knew I’d be just throwing my money away if I didn’t attend. Put down a deposit and make an investment in yourself. Go with a friend. I went to my class alone, which forced me to further develop my social skills, but if you happen to be TOO afraid to attend a class, get a friend to drag you there. It’s amazing what we do to avoid ridicule from our buddies. Expect to suck. It was frustrating for me to not be good at swing dancing right away. After playing sports and lifting weights, it was a tremendous shift for me to stop trying to be the fastest, strongest, most perfect, and instead relax, let loose and enjoy myself. If you are learning a new skill, expect to suck at it. You’ll get better. As long as you remember to… Have fun. Remember, we could get hit by a bus tomorrow. Every day above ground is a blessing, so enjoy it! That one thing you always wanted to try but have been putting off? Today’s a good a day to get started. Just take that FIRST step. Google classes in your city. Find a site that focuses on beginners, and read about it. If there’s a place to pre-pay or make a deposit, do it. And then go. Use your beastmode skills if you have to. But suck it up, expect to not be good at the new activity immediately, and have some fun. What’s the one new thing you’re going to try this month? -Steve PS: Over 3,000 women have signed up for the Nerd Fitness Academy Women’s email list – we’ll be sending out an email in a few days asking a few important questions to make sure all students have a top notch experience. Make sure you’re signed up so we can hear from you! PPS: Our #HardHatChallenge is still going strong! How is your month going of filling up your calendar with X’s? I missed one day this past weekend, but that’s okay, because I got right back on track the next day. Today’s Rebel Hero: Joe (Anivair on the message boards) from Columbus, who drove down with his wife Tracie to hang out with me at MidoriCon two weeks ago! Since finding Nerd Fitness, Joe is down 100 freaking pounds, and hopes to one day become a MovNat trainer. I’ve known Joe through NF for years, so it was great to finally meet him in person. photo source: treadmill, treadmill fall, dog, jump, garfield Share this: Twitter Facebook Like Loading...

Climbing on stuff – Last week on my hike at Midoricon, I was walking through the woods with NF Rebel Joe (No, not THAT Joe). It was awesome to see this guy, having lost 100 pounds since finding Nerd Fitness, explore the woods like it was no problem: climbing on stumps, balancing on fallen trees, climbing trees, and more. When was the last time you’ve done stuff like THAT? Hmmm? (Shout out toMovNat!) Martial arts – Be honest. You watched The Matrix, you heard Neo go “I know Kung Fu” and you wanted to be able to one day say the same thing. Whether it’s Kung Fu, Muay Thai, Tae Kwon Do, Karate or Capoeira, there’s a martial art out there that will make you feel like a badass. Build a standing desk – Although we all know that correlation does not prove causation, it’s no surprise that there’s a strong correlation between sitting all day and an early grave. Why not fix your posture, strengthen your legs, and spend the day being more productive with a standing desk? Stop meeting for coffee – Hat tip to Charlie Hoehn on this one. If somebody wants to meet up with you for coffee, suggest something active: throwing a baseball, tossing a frisbee, going for a hike – anything that gets you up and moving. I say yes to pretty much anybody that invites me to play golf. Wink wink. You know… – That thing that couples do? Yeah. Do more of that. Self-explanatory. Moving on… Clean – Ugh, nobody likes to clean the house/apartment. I certainly don’t. So I make a game out of it. I see how much I can accomplish with a single song blasting at max volume. Of course, after getting through one song, I figure “welp, I’ve already started, might as well keep going.” Do handstands – We have an article coming up teaching you how to do your first handstand, which I’m very excited about. This is a fun activity that builds up serious arm and core strength and will leave you sweating bullets after even a few minutes. Find a park, go do handstands, cartwheels, somersaults, and whatever else makes you feel young again. Parkour – Our beginner’s guide to Parkour is one of the most popular on Nerd Fitness. I don’t care how old you are, there’s no reason you can’t get started with rolling around in your hard and vaulting over picnic tables and bike racks. Playout – Is Parkour too serious for you? Try a playout! Spiderman was on to something – climbing walls, swinging from skyscrapers, and popping flips around the bad guys. You might not be able to swing between buildings, but you can definitely visit a playground in your area and get creative! Adult gymnastics – In the same vein as Parkour, gymnastics will help you build some of the BEST real world strength you can get with any type of exercise, and it’s all done in a playful way without a single weight being picked up. Swing from rings, somersault, flip onto pads, and more. There are gyms all over the country. Yoga – Build flexibility, strength, and learn to freaking relax. There are million kinds of yoga, so sign up for a few different kinds and see which one lines up the best with what you’re looking for. Play video games that make you be active – Wii Tennis, Wii Fit, Just Dance on Xbox Kinect, and whatever games actually exist for the Sony Move (does anybody actually have this?). OK, DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) counts too. I know an hour of that is exhausting. Playing a normal game like Grand Theft Auto V? Make a rule that you can only play while standing up. That’s what I do to keep myself from spending twelve hours on the couch in marathon gaming sessions! Play on a playground – Obviously not when kids are around. Preferably with pants on. Go down the slide, swing across the monkey bars, climb the rope all, balance on the balance beam. Create an obstacle course for yourself and see how quickly you can get through it. You can even work out on a playground too. Play a musical instrument – Did you know playing the violin for an hour burns about as many calories as walking around a track at a moderate pace for an hour? It turns out, our brains can burn boatloads of calories too. So challenge your brain! Join a Rec league – New in town? Want to be active and meet people? Join a kickball or softball league. You get to exercise AND it’s a great way to meet new people! Bike to work – I know there are a lot of Rebels in our community who dropped a bunch of weight by making one change: they biked to work, or biked to their friend’s house, or started biking generlaly. You get from Point A to Point B, you save money on gas, and you get a workout. That would make Michael Scott proud. Play a childhood game – What games did you play as a child? Capture the flag? Kick the can? Simple tag? Get a few friends together and give it a try – it will be the most fun you’ve had in a while! Challenge yourself Yesterday we launched a new Six-Week Challenge on the Nerd Fitness Message Boards. If you want to join a few thousand of the most supportive people you’ll ever meet and help yourself live a better life, we’d love to have you. For this challenge, I’d love for you to commit to trying something new at some point in the next six weeks. I committed to Swing Dance Lessons for the month of September. After my four weeks are up, I’ll move onto something equally terrifying and new like Krav Maga or Capoeira for the month of October. Here’s my advice to you: Say yes before you can say no. Stop saying “I don’t have time” and realize you do. Stop saying “I can’t afford it” and find a way to make it a priority. Do all of this before you can talk yourself out of it. The best way to do that? Commit in advance. I pre-paid my four weeks of swing lessons. Having already paid for it, I knew I’d be just throwing my money away if I didn’t attend. Put down a deposit and make an investment in yourself. Go with a friend. I went to my class alone, which forced me to further develop my social skills, but if you happen to be TOO afraid to attend a class, get a friend to drag you there. It’s amazing what we do to avoid ridicule from our buddies. Expect to suck. It was frustrating for me to not be good at swing dancing right away. After playing sports and lifting weights, it was a tremendous shift for me to stop trying to be the fastest, strongest, most perfect, and instead relax, let loose and enjoy myself. If you are learning a new skill, expect to suck at it. You’ll get better. As long as you remember to… Have fun. Remember, we could get hit by a bus tomorrow. Every day above ground is a blessing, so enjoy it! That one thing you always wanted to try but have been putting off? Today’s a good a day to get started. Just take that FIRST step. Google classes in your city. Find a site that focuses on beginners, and read about it. If there’s a place to pre-pay or make a deposit, do it. And then go. Use your beastmode skills if you have to. But suck it up, expect to not be good at the new activity immediately, and have some fun. What’s the one new thing you’re going to try this month? -Steve PS: Over 3,000 women have signed up for the Nerd Fitness Academy Women’s email list – we’ll be sending out an email in a few days asking a few important questions to make sure all students have a top notch experience. Make sure you’re signed up so we can hear from you! PPS: Our #HardHatChallenge is still going strong! How is your month going of filling up your calendar with X’s? I missed one day this past weekend, but that’s okay, because I got right back on track the next day. Today’s Rebel Hero: Joe (Anivair on the message boards) from Columbus, who drove down with his wife Tracie to hang out with me at MidoriCon two weeks ago! Since finding Nerd Fitness, Joe is down 100 freaking pounds, and hopes to one day become a MovNat trainer. I’ve known Joe through NF for years, so it was great to finally meet him in person. photo source: treadmill, treadmill fall, dog, jump, garfield Share this: Twitter Facebook Like Loading...

Tanja Kropf|June 25, 2023 28 Sports For Adult Athletes Of Every Level To Try Sports Share it on So you’re interested in playing sports as an adult. Whether you’re new to the world of playing sports or you’re already a seasoned adult athlete, you’ll find a wealth of ideas in our comprehensive list of adult sports to try. And when you’re ready to check out some less mainstream sports, we’ve got you covered there, too. We’ve broken down the list into recommendations for newbie athletes, intermediate athletes, and competitive athletes. From adrenaline-pumping individual endeavors to exhilarating team experiences, we’ll explore a range of sports suitable for every level of competition. We’ll even include some pseudo-sports for those individuals who want the camaraderie of being part of a team but don’t actually like sports (cornhole, anyone?). Of course, most sports require some type of gear to play, so we’ll hook you up with recommendations for any equipment you might need for each sport in our list as well. (Note: As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.) Ready, set, here we go. Pickleball Pickleball has become America’s fastest-growing sport. It’s caught on like wildfire. What used to be considered a sport for retirees has also gained popularity among younger generations, and it’s no surprise why. Pickleball is super fun to play and is more accessible than tennis for newbies. The court is smaller than tennis, the nets lower, and it’s played with paddles instead of rackets. Because of the smaller court, older athletes don’t have to exert themselves as much as they would playing tennis but can still get their heart rates up. The beauty of pickleball is that you can play at a relatively fast pace, or you can slow the game down. The rules are a bit wonky to learn at first, but once you have them down, it’s fairly simple to grasp the play. Playing pickleball will work your legs, arms, and core, plus it can work up a sweat. Leagues abound everywhere these days, so finding a place to play should be a breeze. You can check out directory for pickleball near you. join the aps squad Get updates and exclusive special offers. No spam–just valuable content. subscribe Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced All athletic abilities will do well with pickleball as your sport of choice. Team or Individual Sport: Pickleball is played in singles or doubles, but primarily doubles. Gear Recommendations: A paddle and balls are the main gear necessities for pickleball. Your choices for paddles are endless, but a class-sized pickleball paddle is best for a newbie. The Paddletek paddle will perform well and won’t break the bank. Mountain Biking Mountain biking is a great sport for adult athletes to get their hearts pumping and adrenaline kicking, all while breathing in the fresh air of the outdoors. The name of the sport is a bit of a misnomer because MTB isn’t limited only to the mountains. Newbies can start on flat trails until they build up some level of comfort on a bike and then advance to more challenging switchback trails. More advanced bikers will traverse down steep rocky crags, climb dirt or rock hills, or brave narrow singletrack trails on the edge of a cliff. There are also various styles of mountain biking. A few of the more well-known MTB styles are singletrack, downhill, cross country, and enduro. Singletrack, as the name suggests, is mountain biking on a track or trail wide enough to fit a single bike. Singletracks are usually mixed in with wider tracks as well. Downhill MTB typically incorporates jumps and berms into a fast-paced downhill ride. Riders usually jump on a lift to get back uphill. Cross-country mountain biking incorporates jumps and obstacles like downhill, but they are spaced out further, requiring more pedal time. Enduro mountain biking combines the highly technical aspects of the sport with endurance, and enduro races can last several days. Mountain biking works everything from your core to your legs to your arms, so it’s a great sport for adult athletes who want to stay fit while also challenging themselves mentally. Recommended for: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced Mountain biking is best for the more intermediate and advanced adult athletes, but newbies can also give it a shot if they aren’t afraid of getting scraped up a bit. Team or Individual Sport: Individual sport, but often done in groups Gear Recommendations: Mountain biking requires a lot of gear besides just the bike. Since the risk for injury in mountain biking is higher than in a lot of sports, protective gear is imperative. The most essential piece of gear is a bike helmet (full-face or half-shell). You’ll also likely wantCamelBak. The bike you choose will depend on what type of riding you want to do. You can also choose a standard pedal mountain bike or an electric mountain bike (eMTB). Electric bikes don’t do the pedaling for you, but they can give you a boost on uphills if you prefer to focus more of your energy on the downhills. Specialized is a well-known and respected mountain bike brand for eMTBs and non-ebikes. For women, Liv designs bikes for smaller frames. Cycling While often used interchangeably, biking and cycling actually have different meanings. Biking is considered leisure riding, while cycling is considered a sport. So, depending on what level of competitiveness you’re looking for, biking or cycling can be suitable for newbies, intermediate athletes, and competitors alike. Since we’re focusing more on sports than leisure for this list, we’ll dig into cycling. The sport has been around since 1868 and remains popular today. Sport cyclists ride on a track or paved roads and compete for best time or distance. Cycling requires incredible endurance, so this is not the sport for you if you’re not fit (or don’t intend to get fit). But if you thrive on competition and constantly challenge yourself, cycling is a great sport to consider. Cycling is a great sport for cardiovascular fitness and will also work your quads, glutes, and calves. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced Newbies can start with biking and work their way up to the more intermediate and advanced sport of cycling. Team or Individual Sport: Cycling is an individual sport, although you may rely on working with a team of other riders. Gear Recommendations: Of course, the bike is the most important piece of gear, and the type you need will depend on the style of biking you want to do. You can select from tried and true brands like Cannondale, Giant, or Trek. Or, if you want to step it up a notch, try a high-end, precision-engineered brand like BMC. You’ll also need to add a helmet, eye protection, padded shorts/tights, bike shoes, gloves, and a moisture-wicking jersey to your shopping list. Triathlon Triathlon, as the name implies, combines three sports into one endurance race–swimming, cycling, and running. Triathlons require a significant level of fitness, and unless you already participate in one or more of the three sports triathlon entails, this isn’t a newbie sport. Triathletes compete for best time in each leg of the competition. Depending on the type of triathlon, the distances you swim, cycle, and run will vary. For sprint triathlons, it’s a half-mile swim, a 12.4-mile cycle, and a 3.1-mile run. Olympic triathlons are double that distance. Half-Ironman triathlons require a 1.2-mile swim, 56-mile cycle, and 13.1-mile run, while a full Ironman is exactly double. Triathletes, especially at Ironman levels, are some of the fittest. You’ll work nearly every muscle in your body in this sport. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced Conditioned athletes perform best in this sport. Team or Individual Sport: This is an individual sport, although there are some relay triathlons where each person on the team performs a different leg of the race. Gear Recommendations: You’ll need a comfortable pair of running shoes, like the ASICS Noosa TRIs, a bike, helmet and cycling shoes for the cycling portion, and a wetsuit and goggles for the swimming portion Soccer If you like a sport that gives you an intense workout, calls for a bit of strategy, and is built on teamwork, soccer might be a great fit. Soccer requires agility, coordination, endurance, and, depending on the position, speed. You can play soccer both outdoors and indoors (or enclosed in a field with walls). The objective is to work together with your team to dribble and pass the ball downfield to score the most goals. Play offensively if you like the idea of scoring goals. Play defensively if you like blocking goals. Soccer is a great sport if you have a competitive edge and aren’t afraid of some contact. Plus, you’ll get a cardiovascular workout that’ll rival most sports. Your glutes, quads, hamstrings, calves, and core will feel the burn after an intense game of soccer. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced While there are some beginner adult soccer leagues, you’ll mostly find leagues geared toward intermediate and advanced players. Team or Individual Sport: Soccer is definitely a team sport. A standard outdoor soccer team has 11 players on the field. Adult soccer leagues offer men’s, women’s, and co-ed teams. You can check our directory to find out what soccer leagues are near you. Gear Recommendations: Fortunately, soccer requires minimal gear. Most importantly, you’ll need cleats. Grass field cleats have longer studs on the bottom, while turf cleats have shorter, grippy rubber spikes on the bottom, which make for less slipping on artificial turf. The Adidas Mundial is a popular turf shoe for both men and women. IDA Sports recently came out with a soccer cleat designed specifically for a woman’s foot–wider toe bed, narrower heel, and cleat studs strategically placed to minimize ACL injuries. As a lifelong soccer player, I love the fit and performance of this cleat. So much so that I became an affiliate. If you want to check them out, use this link for a $10 discount. The only other gear you’ll need besides the field to play on and goals are shinguards and a soccer ball. The Nike Premier League soccer balls are a good choice with offerings of various price ranges. Baseball Baseball doesn’t exert as much energy as a lot of other popular sports, but it still requires athleticism, particularly hand-eye coordination. Short bursts of speed to round bases or catch balls are also part of the game. If you aren’t afraid of a high-speed baseball pitch coming at you and the feeling of cracking the bat on the ball (hopefully out of the field for a homerun), baseball might be the sport for you. You’ll get a full-body workout since baseball requires throwing, catching, swinging the bat, and running to bases. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced While beginner adult baseball leagues are out there, you’ll find most leagues are for intermediate and advanced players. Team or Individual Sport: Baseball is played as a team, and all players rely on each other to score points or to get the other team out. There are a multitude of adult baseball leagues to choose from, including senior leagues, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find women’s leagues. You can check our directory to find out what baseball leagues are near you. Gear Recommendations: Baseball only requires a handful of gear, most importantly gloves, cleats, and a bat. Rawlings and Wilson gloves are two of the most popular and long-running brands on the market. Easton makes a great composite bat at varying price points, while Louisville Slugger wood baseball bats are another solid choice. Basketball If you’re quick on your feet, agile, have good hand-eye coordination, and can handle a lot of quick sprinting, basketball is a great sport for adult athletes like you. While not technically a contact sport, there’s a tendency to get banged up a bit during play. If that worries you, sit this sport out. You’ll make quick sprints up and down the court, working with your teammates to get balls in the hoop–or block them from the opposing team. Your heart will pump playing basketball, so it’s best to be in decent cardiovascular shape. You’ll also work your legs, arms, and core as you twist, turn, run, and shoot. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced There are beginner leagues out there, but most are intermediate and advanced. Basketball does require a fair amount of coordination and athleticism, so if you aren’t inherently athletic, it’s probably not the best sport for you. Team or Individual Sport: Basketball is typically played with 5 players per team who work closely together to move the ball down the court. Gear Recommendations: Gear is minimal–a ball and proper shoes are your main requirements. Spalding and Wilson basketballs are used in professional and college basketball leagues. Nike Air Jordans are popular basketball shoes for men and women, in both high and low top versions. Surfing If you’re into the ocean and are a strong swimmer, surfing is a great sport of choice. The exhilaration of popping up on your board to ride a wave is an adrenaline rush that will keep you coming back for more. The sport of surfing has been around globally for centuries and remains popular today, obviously more so in coastal areas like California, Hawaii, and Florida. Surfing requires upper body strength and endurance since much of your time will be spent paddling out to catch the waves you want to surf. You’ll also need a good sense of balance to get up–and stay up–on the board. A good surf session will benefit your legs, back, arms, and core. Besides just being a sport, surfing tends to be a way of life, a culture. Surfers get up at the crack of dawn (or before) to catch great waves, but you can surf anytime there are optimal waves. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced If you have decent swimming skills, you can learn to surf as a newbie, but be patient, as there will be a bit of a learning curve. Intermediate and advanced surfers will get the most out of the sport as they brave the larger waves. Team or Individual Sport: Solo sport, but you sometimes have to compete for waves with other surfers in the water Gear Recommendations: A surfboard is the most important gear you’ll need. There are short and longboard options. Longboards are easier for beginners to pop up and balance on. Shortboards allow skilled surfers to maneuver and cut through waves. Depending on the water temperature, you may also need a wetsuit. A rash guard top will protect your skin from surfboard contact. Golf Golf is a highly-technical sport that requires patience, agility, and endurance (if you’re walking a large course). You’ll need power to launch balls a long distance. You’ll put your patience to the test as you try to maintain a straight drive of your golf ball down the fairway. The short putting and chipping game is also a mental test as you try to get your ball into the hole at or under par. Golf is a game of highs and lows—one hole, you’ll absolutely love it, the next, you’ll want to throw your club across the green. But the challenge of the game will keep you coming back for more. It’s a great sport for adult athletes of all ages, and being outside in the fresh air isn’t the worst way to spend a day. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced Golf is a sport where there’s always room for improvement, no matter your level of expertise. Taking lessons if you’re a beginner is highly recommended, which are readily available at most golf courses. Team or Individual Sport: While you play for score as an individual, golfers are usually grouped together in foursomes. Gear Recommendations: Golf requires a fair amount of gear and isn’t the most affordable sport for an entry-level athlete, but you can find a lot of great deals on used equipment. The necessities for gear include golf clubs, a glove, and you’ll likely want golf shoes. The Cobra XL golf clubs are a solid choice for women’s clubs, while the Callaway Strata is a good starter to mid-level golf set for men. Ancillary items include goofballs and tees. You might also want to invest in a GPS watch or binoculars so you can measure the distance of the ball from the hole. Swimming Swimming is a fantastic minimalistic sport choice–the only real essentials are a body of water and your ability to use your own body to swim through it. Adult athletes of all ages can partake in swimming since it’s especially gentle on the joints. You’ll use your full body when you swim, kicking your legs and propelling forward with your arms. You can swim in a variety of styles–freestyle, breaststroke, butterfly, just to name a few. Whether you prefer swimming in a pool or open water in an ocean or lake, you’ll get a good cardiovascular workout and test your endurance. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced If you aren’t afraid of water, many swim schools offer lessons for adults. Team or Individual Sport: Swimming is a solo sport, but you can also participate in relay teams. It’s a sport you can participate in competitively as a young adult into your senior years. Gear Recommendations: The primary pieces of gear for swimming are swimsuits and goggles. Skiing If you love the snow, have a good sense of balance, and crave a good rush, skiing down mountain slopes might be the sport you need in your life. Downhill skiing is the most well-known type of sport skiing. You’ll strap your boots into a pair of skis and use your body and a set of poles to maneuver yourself downhill. Ski slopes are rated green, blue, and black, representing the easiest to most difficult. More difficult slopes will be steeper and potentially have more obstacles, like trees and moguls. Skiing is a super full-body workout sport that involves a lot of core and leg work. If you have bad knees, skiing can be a bit rough. Skiiers experience an adrenaline rush flowing down a powdery slope as the beauty of nature surrounds them, keeping them returning again and again. There are Masters ski competitions for adults of all ages who love some competition in their lives. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced If you are athletic, taking up skiing as an adult is an option, but lessons are recommended. Many skiers started this sport when they were young and continued well into adulthood, making it more of an intermediate or advanced sport for adults. Team or Individual Sport: Individual, but typically done in groups Gear Recommendations: Skiing requires a fair amount of gear, ranging from skis to boots to helmet to googles to gloves. You’ll also need ski pants, a parka, and other layers of warm clothing. Snowboarding The little cousin of skiing, snowboarding involves strapping both feet into boots perpendicularly on a wide board, using only your body and the board to maneuver down the slopes. Snowboarding requires an incredible sense of balance and athleticism and has a steep learning curve. So if you don’t have patience, and are afraid of spending a lot of time falling on your rear as you learn, check out a different sport. If you do master the ability to get up on your snowboard, you are in for an exhilarating thrill as you use your body to traverse downhill. Snowboarding puts your lower body and your core to the test. While you won’t exert yourself too much cardiovascularly as you board downhill, you’ll require strength to get yourself back up when you fall. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced Adult athletes who want to learn to snowboard can take lessons, but most adult snowboarders are intermediate and advanced-level participants of the sport. Team or Individual Sport: This is a solo sport. Gear Recommendations: Snowboard, boots, googles, helmet, gloves, ski pants, parka, additional layers. Motocross Motocross is one of the more dangerous sports on our list, but also one of the most adrenaline-inducing ones. So if you like a rush and are fearless, check out motocross. Motocross is one level up from mountain biking–dirt trails and a bike. But this time, your bike is gas-powered and can reach much faster speeds than a mountain bike. If you’ve mastered mountain biking, it’ll be an easier segue into motocross. Check for motocross tracks in your area, and if you don’t already know how to ride a motocross bike, instruction is highly recommended. You’ll learn the ins and outs of riding properly, along with the most safe way to do it. Once you’re comfortable, you can soak up the thrilling feeling of racing around a track and eventually make jumps and catch air on your bike. If you’re into the competitive side of motocross, there are a ton of races you can enter. Motocross is a full-body workout, so you need to be in decent shape. Besides the physical aspect of the sport, mental focus is necessary to navigate the track–and the moves of other riders around you. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced Motocross is geared toward more experienced athletes, but if you excel at mountain biking, don’t be afraid to try this sport if you want even more of a thrill. Team or Individual Sport: You ride as an individual, but there are some races where you participate as a team. Gear Recommendations: You’re going to need a lot of gear for this sport, and it isn’t cheap. The motocross bike, of course, is the most important. Brands like Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki, Honda, and Husqvarna are pretty popular. Then you’ll need other gear like a helmet, boots, gloves, goggles. You’ll also need pants and a jersey. And, of course, since crashes are bound to happen, protecting your body is imperative. Back, chest, knee, and neck protection should be on your shopping list. Figure Skating If you’re one of those people who gets mesmerized by the grace and elegance of figure skaters at the Olympics and wish you could skate like they do–you can certainly try. There are a ton of adult figure skating lessons and classes around the country. You’re at an advantage if you already know how to ice skate. If you don’t, take a learn-to-skate lesson first. Balance is key for figure skating. You’ll also need strong coordination skills. As your skills improve, you’ll advance from skating across the ice to incorporating spins and jumps. Figure skating will work your core and lower body the most, but it’s generally a full-body workout. There are competitions for adult skaters if you really want to put your skills to the test. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced You can start figure skating as a newbie adult, but you should have some inherent athletic ability to do well at this sport. Team or Individual Sport: Figure skating is done both solo and in pairs for competition. Gear Recommendations: Ice skates will be your primary gear for this sport, with additional ancillary items like skate guards, gloves, and apparel ranging from form-fitting pants/leggings to skate dresses/skirts to tights. Martial Arts Martial arts cover a broad swath of disciplines, but a few stand out as popular sports. Jiu-Jitsu, Taekwondo, Muay Thai, Judo, Karate, and Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) are probably some of the better-known combat sport martial arts. If those aren’t your jam, you have about 150 other types to choose from. Martial arts require mental and physical strength, as well as endurance. You’ll learn both defensive and offensive maneuvers and as an adult athlete, you will have a wide selection of competitive meets and tournaments available to them. Most of the aforementioned martial arts are full-contact, so if you’re wary of person-to-person grappling, stick with another sport. Martial arts work your whole body, and most who participate in the sport are pretty physically fit. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced There are plenty of options from beginner to advanced to learn martial arts, so if you’re prepared to put in the work as a newbie, don’t be afraid to give this sport a try. Team or Individual Sport: You will compete individually, although you can also be part of a larger team. Gear Recommendations: Fortunately, gear is minimal for martial arts. The apparel recommendations will vary depending on the discipline you choose. Hockey Hockey is a fantastic sport for adult athletes since adult hockey leagues are widely available. Whether you played in high school or college and want to continue into adulthood, or if you’ve never played but are “hockey curious“, you’ve got options. Hockey combines speed, agility, endurance, and a healthy dose of competition. If that sounds like you, lace up some skates and get your game on. And if you don’t know how to skate, it’s kind of important, so take a lesson first. You’ll engage your core as you twist and turn on the ice. You’ll also work your legs, glutes, and arms as you skate, pass, shoot, and check opponents as you move down and across the rink. Hockey also requires a healthy dose of balance. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced While you should have some athletic ability to play hockey, there are plenty of opportunities for newbies to get into the sport as adults. Camps, clinics, and all-skill leagues are available. Team or Individual Sport: Hockey is definitely a team sport, where you work as a unit to score on opponents–or stop them from scoring on you. Gear Recommendations: Besides a comfortable pair of skates, you’ll need a hockey stick, a helmet, gloves, hockey pants, and protective gear. This can include elbow pads, shin pads, shoulder pads, a mouthguard, and a neck guard. Bowling Sometimes debatable as to whether it’s actually a sport, bowling is, in fact, a sport. The United States Bowling Congress governs it. Although not known to torch calories or elevate your heart rate (save for the excitement of getting a strike and knocking down all pins), bowling does require hand-eye coordination. Bowling is a solid option if you don’t like contact sports or working up a sweat but still enjoy some competition. Bowling has plenty of opportunities for those who want to compete, be it in a league or in a tournament. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate Team or Individual Sport: You can bowl individually or on a team. Gear Recommendations: If you’re a casual bowler, you can rent shoes and balls. If you plan to bowl often, invest in a comfortable pair of bowling shoes and your own bowling ball. Dexter rules the market for shoes, and you can find a style to suit your personality. Cornhole Yes, there are cornhole competitions, but whether it’s really a game or a sport is up for discussion. Cornhole (also called bags or some other name variation) entails tossing bean bags onto or into a slanted wooden board with a hole in it. You pair up in teams of two, with each person on the team taking turns tossing their bags to the board across from them in an attempt to score the most points by getting the bag into the hole (3 points) or onto the board (one point). Many social sports leagues offer cornhole as one of their sports since it’s accessible even to non-athletes, but there’s still some fun competition in the game. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate Cornhole is great for newbies, and intermediate players with good aim will do well at scoring points. Team or Individual Sport: Cornhole is played in teams of two. Gear Recommendations: If you play in a social sports league or at a bar, they’ll provide the cornhole set. If you want to play at home, you can grab an inexpensive one like the one below on Amazon. Dodgeball Most of us remember playing dodgeball as a kid. There’s nothing like standing in a line with zero protection waiting to get pelted with a red rubber ball. The nostalgia of dodgeball helps it remain a popular activity in social sports leagues today. While it helps if you have decent aim and quick reflexes, dodgeball doesn’t require immense athletic prowess. That makes it perfect for athletes and non-athletes alike to get a bit of cardiovascular activity while having fun. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate Dodgeball is a good choice for newbies who aren’t super sporty but still want to participate, and also good for intermediate athletes with solid aim and throwing skills. Team or Individual Sport: Dodgeball is played as a team. Check out our directory to find out where you can play dodgeball near you. Gear Recommendations: Nothing but a red rubber ball. Softball Adult softball leagues are easy to find. Whether they are competitive or office leagues, you can find one that’s at a pace of play from beginner to advanced. Softball is either fastpitch or slowpitch, but most adult recreational leagues are slowpitch. You can find a softball league near you in our sports directory, including senior leagues. Many softball leagues are co-ed, and there are adult female leagues as well, so there are more options for women to play softball than baseball as an adult. The workout you get from softball will depend on your level of play, but at the least, you’ll run around bases and snag balls in the infield and outfield. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced There are a lot of options for all skill levels. Team or Individual Sport: Team sport all the way. Gear Recommendations: If you’re a casual league player, your glove is the most important thing you’ll need. Wilson and Rawlings are popular glove brands. Bats, softballs, baseball cleats, and batting gloves should also be on your list. Kickball Courtesy: CLUBWAKA Another nostalgic sport from childhood, kickball is one of the most popular sports in social sports leagues. You play on what looks like a baseball diamond, kicking a ball instead of batting at one before you round bases, just like in baseball or softball. Most kickball leagues are co-ed and meant for fun, so you don’t need to be a superstar athlete to play, but it can help. Playing kickball will burn some calories from running the bases or trying to stop, catch, and throw the ball. You’ll work your legs, arms, and core. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate Team or Individual Sport: Kickball is a team sport. Gear Recommendations: There’s not much of a barrier to entry when it comes to kickball gear. The kickball is your main piece of equipment. Football An all-American sport, adult football leagues are all around the country (and even in other countries). Whether you’re looking for full tackle on the gridiron or the less dangerous flag version of the game, football is a high-intensity sport filled with competition. You’ll use your full body as you run, twist, and pivot on the field in an attempt to score–or block–touchdowns. While men have dominated football for decades, women’s leagues are cropping up in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere. You’ll get a full-body workout playing football, and the risk of injury increases with playing full tackle. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced There are some leagues that say they are open to newbies, but most are geared toward intermediate and advanced players. Newbies should have some inherent athletic skill. Team or Individual Sport: It’s all about the team for football. Gear Recommendations: If you’re playing full-contact football, you’ll definitely need more gear than flag football, including a helmet, pads, cleats, and gloves for some players. Schutt is a very well-known and popular helmet brand that comes in adult sizes. You can opt for varying styles of facemasks. Rugby Rugby is not for the faint of heart. The sport requires a lot of athleticism, endurance, and fearlessness. It is a full-contact sport that involves kicking, carrying, and passing an oval ball down a field (larger than a football) to score goals. Like football, players can tackle each other to stop the ball. Rugby will work pretty much every muscle group, and if you’re afraid of contact, skip this sport. But if you like competitive sports with no holds barred, check out rugby. There are both men’s and women’s adult rugby leagues, so access to the sport is readily available in most areas. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced There are leagues that say no experience is necessary, but you should probably have some athletic abilities if you want to play rugby as a newbie. Team or Individual Sport: Very much a team sport. Gear Recommendations: Your basic rugby gear list will include a ball and cleats (or boots). Besides that, you can opt for protective equipment like headgear, a mouthguard, and padding. Gilbert rugby balls are highly reputable and affordable. Volleyball The beauty of volleyball is that you can play indoors, outdoors, on hard surfaces, on sand, on grass–even in mud. The goal is to volley the ball over the net, with each team getting no more than three touches on the ball before having to volley–or spike–the ball back to the other side. Depending on the type of volleyball, there can be from two to eight players on a side. Volleyball requires good hand-eye coordination, agility, power, and speed. It’s a great workout for the arms, legs, quads, and core. Sand volleyball will add an additional burn to your calves. There’s no contact in volleyball, but balls can fly at high speeds, so if you’re fearful of getting hit, you might want to look into another sport. There are a ton of adult volleyball leagues around the country, so getting into the sport is no problem. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced Many social sports leagues offer volleyball, which is good for newbies, but most leagues are advanced and intermediate. Team or Individual Sport: Teams are part of volleyball, whether in twos, fours, sixes or eights. Gear Recommendations: Besides having a net, the ball is your most valuable piece of gear. You can’t go wrong with the iconic brand that Tom Hanks made famous in his film Castaway. Indoor volleyball players also need volleyball shoes and typically wear knee pads on hard court floors. Lacrosse Fun fact: lacrosse is the oldest organized sport in North America. This sport combines speed, agility, hand-eye coordination, and a fierce sense of competition. Lacrosse will pump your heart, legs, and arms since you use all of them playing this sport. The objective is to get the ball down the field and score goals by passing the ball to your teammates via a stick with a small net at the tip. Besides physical agility, you’ll need mental agility to play lacrosse, as it is a fast-paced game that requires quick thinking. Depending on whether you play men’s or women’s lacrosse will determine the level of contact. Women’s lacrosse prohibits physical contact, which is allowed in the men’s version of the game. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced While you might find some newbie leagues, lacrosse is a physically challenging sport better left to intermediate and advanced athletes. Team or Individual Sport: Lacrosse is a team sport. Gear Recommendations: Most importantly, you’ll need a stick and a ball to play lacrosse. Since men’s lacrosse is a contact sport, they’ll typically require more protective gear, like helmets, gloves, elbow and shoulder pads, and a helmet. Women’s protective gear usually only consists of a mouthguard and goggles. The footwear for both men’s and women’s lacrosse includes cleats. Field Hockey While field hockey is more popular with women than men, there are leagues for both. And, as its name implies, you essentially play hockey on a field, albeit with shorter sticks and a ball instead of a puck. The objective is to work with your teammates to score goals against your opponents–or block them. Field hockey is fast-paced, competitive, and requires speed and agility. You’ll work most of your muscle groups playing this sport. It requires good hand-eye coordination and some athleticism, so the uncoordinated non-athletic types should skip this sport. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced Since players should have some inherent athleticism, field hockey is best suited for intermediate and advanced athletes. Team or Individual Sport: Field hockey is definitely a team sport. There are men’s, women’s, and co-ed leagues. Gear Recommendations: The most critical piece of gear you’ll need is your stick, followed by the ball. STX is a reputable stick brand, but the style will depend on your position and style of play. Cleats for traction and stability will help your game and protective gear like shinguards and mouthguards are recommended. Tennis Tennis is a great competitive sport that requires agility, hand-eye coordination, and endurance. Depending on the level of play, ball speed can be crazy fast, and you’ll need to have a quick response to return the ball across the net. Tennis uses quick bursts of speed and power both to serve and return, and you’ll get a full-body workout, twisting your core, swinging at and serving the ball, and making short and fast lateral moves with your legs. If you aren’t coordinated to begin with, you might want to consider another sport. But if you’re athletic, have endurance, and a competitive streak, tennis could be for you. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced Since tennis requires some innate athleticism, it’s best suited for intermediate and advanced athletes. Team or Individual Sport: You can play tennis as an individual (singles) or with a teammate (doubles). Gear Recommendations: A tennis racket, balls, and tennis shoes are the essentials for this sport, and you can’t go wrong with a Wilson tennis racket. Wrap Up There you have it. While the list isn’t exhaustive, it covers every athletic level, so there is no doubt you can find a sport to suit your ability and your personality. What are you waiting for?

Tanja Kropf|June 25, 2023 28 Sports For Adult Athletes Of Every Level To Try Sports Share it on So you’re interested in playing sports as an adult. Whether you’re new to the world of playing sports or you’re already a seasoned adult athlete, you’ll find a wealth of ideas in our comprehensive list of adult sports to try. And when you’re ready to check out some less mainstream sports, we’ve got you covered there, too. We’ve broken down the list into recommendations for newbie athletes, intermediate athletes, and competitive athletes. From adrenaline-pumping individual endeavors to exhilarating team experiences, we’ll explore a range of sports suitable for every level of competition. We’ll even include some pseudo-sports for those individuals who want the camaraderie of being part of a team but don’t actually like sports (cornhole, anyone?). Of course, most sports require some type of gear to play, so we’ll hook you up with recommendations for any equipment you might need for each sport in our list as well. (Note: As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.) Ready, set, here we go. Pickleball Pickleball has become America’s fastest-growing sport. It’s caught on like wildfire. What used to be considered a sport for retirees has also gained popularity among younger generations, and it’s no surprise why. Pickleball is super fun to play and is more accessible than tennis for newbies. The court is smaller than tennis, the nets lower, and it’s played with paddles instead of rackets. Because of the smaller court, older athletes don’t have to exert themselves as much as they would playing tennis but can still get their heart rates up. The beauty of pickleball is that you can play at a relatively fast pace, or you can slow the game down. The rules are a bit wonky to learn at first, but once you have them down, it’s fairly simple to grasp the play. Playing pickleball will work your legs, arms, and core, plus it can work up a sweat. Leagues abound everywhere these days, so finding a place to play should be a breeze. You can check out directory for pickleball near you. join the aps squad Get updates and exclusive special offers. No spam–just valuable content. subscribe Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced All athletic abilities will do well with pickleball as your sport of choice. Team or Individual Sport: Pickleball is played in singles or doubles, but primarily doubles. Gear Recommendations: A paddle and balls are the main gear necessities for pickleball. Your choices for paddles are endless, but a class-sized pickleball paddle is best for a newbie. The Paddletek paddle will perform well and won’t break the bank. Mountain Biking Mountain biking is a great sport for adult athletes to get their hearts pumping and adrenaline kicking, all while breathing in the fresh air of the outdoors. The name of the sport is a bit of a misnomer because MTB isn’t limited only to the mountains. Newbies can start on flat trails until they build up some level of comfort on a bike and then advance to more challenging switchback trails. More advanced bikers will traverse down steep rocky crags, climb dirt or rock hills, or brave narrow singletrack trails on the edge of a cliff. There are also various styles of mountain biking. A few of the more well-known MTB styles are singletrack, downhill, cross country, and enduro. Singletrack, as the name suggests, is mountain biking on a track or trail wide enough to fit a single bike. Singletracks are usually mixed in with wider tracks as well. Downhill MTB typically incorporates jumps and berms into a fast-paced downhill ride. Riders usually jump on a lift to get back uphill. Cross-country mountain biking incorporates jumps and obstacles like downhill, but they are spaced out further, requiring more pedal time. Enduro mountain biking combines the highly technical aspects of the sport with endurance, and enduro races can last several days. Mountain biking works everything from your core to your legs to your arms, so it’s a great sport for adult athletes who want to stay fit while also challenging themselves mentally. Recommended for: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced Mountain biking is best for the more intermediate and advanced adult athletes, but newbies can also give it a shot if they aren’t afraid of getting scraped up a bit. Team or Individual Sport: Individual sport, but often done in groups Gear Recommendations: Mountain biking requires a lot of gear besides just the bike. Since the risk for injury in mountain biking is higher than in a lot of sports, protective gear is imperative. The most essential piece of gear is a bike helmet (full-face or half-shell). You’ll also likely wantCamelBak. The bike you choose will depend on what type of riding you want to do. You can also choose a standard pedal mountain bike or an electric mountain bike (eMTB). Electric bikes don’t do the pedaling for you, but they can give you a boost on uphills if you prefer to focus more of your energy on the downhills. Specialized is a well-known and respected mountain bike brand for eMTBs and non-ebikes. For women, Liv designs bikes for smaller frames. Cycling While often used interchangeably, biking and cycling actually have different meanings. Biking is considered leisure riding, while cycling is considered a sport. So, depending on what level of competitiveness you’re looking for, biking or cycling can be suitable for newbies, intermediate athletes, and competitors alike. Since we’re focusing more on sports than leisure for this list, we’ll dig into cycling. The sport has been around since 1868 and remains popular today. Sport cyclists ride on a track or paved roads and compete for best time or distance. Cycling requires incredible endurance, so this is not the sport for you if you’re not fit (or don’t intend to get fit). But if you thrive on competition and constantly challenge yourself, cycling is a great sport to consider. Cycling is a great sport for cardiovascular fitness and will also work your quads, glutes, and calves. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced Newbies can start with biking and work their way up to the more intermediate and advanced sport of cycling. Team or Individual Sport: Cycling is an individual sport, although you may rely on working with a team of other riders. Gear Recommendations: Of course, the bike is the most important piece of gear, and the type you need will depend on the style of biking you want to do. You can select from tried and true brands like Cannondale, Giant, or Trek. Or, if you want to step it up a notch, try a high-end, precision-engineered brand like BMC. You’ll also need to add a helmet, eye protection, padded shorts/tights, bike shoes, gloves, and a moisture-wicking jersey to your shopping list. Triathlon Triathlon, as the name implies, combines three sports into one endurance race–swimming, cycling, and running. Triathlons require a significant level of fitness, and unless you already participate in one or more of the three sports triathlon entails, this isn’t a newbie sport. Triathletes compete for best time in each leg of the competition. Depending on the type of triathlon, the distances you swim, cycle, and run will vary. For sprint triathlons, it’s a half-mile swim, a 12.4-mile cycle, and a 3.1-mile run. Olympic triathlons are double that distance. Half-Ironman triathlons require a 1.2-mile swim, 56-mile cycle, and 13.1-mile run, while a full Ironman is exactly double. Triathletes, especially at Ironman levels, are some of the fittest. You’ll work nearly every muscle in your body in this sport. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced Conditioned athletes perform best in this sport. Team or Individual Sport: This is an individual sport, although there are some relay triathlons where each person on the team performs a different leg of the race. Gear Recommendations: You’ll need a comfortable pair of running shoes, like the ASICS Noosa TRIs, a bike, helmet and cycling shoes for the cycling portion, and a wetsuit and goggles for the swimming portion Soccer If you like a sport that gives you an intense workout, calls for a bit of strategy, and is built on teamwork, soccer might be a great fit. Soccer requires agility, coordination, endurance, and, depending on the position, speed. You can play soccer both outdoors and indoors (or enclosed in a field with walls). The objective is to work together with your team to dribble and pass the ball downfield to score the most goals. Play offensively if you like the idea of scoring goals. Play defensively if you like blocking goals. Soccer is a great sport if you have a competitive edge and aren’t afraid of some contact. Plus, you’ll get a cardiovascular workout that’ll rival most sports. Your glutes, quads, hamstrings, calves, and core will feel the burn after an intense game of soccer. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced While there are some beginner adult soccer leagues, you’ll mostly find leagues geared toward intermediate and advanced players. Team or Individual Sport: Soccer is definitely a team sport. A standard outdoor soccer team has 11 players on the field. Adult soccer leagues offer men’s, women’s, and co-ed teams. You can check our directory to find out what soccer leagues are near you. Gear Recommendations: Fortunately, soccer requires minimal gear. Most importantly, you’ll need cleats. Grass field cleats have longer studs on the bottom, while turf cleats have shorter, grippy rubber spikes on the bottom, which make for less slipping on artificial turf. The Adidas Mundial is a popular turf shoe for both men and women. IDA Sports recently came out with a soccer cleat designed specifically for a woman’s foot–wider toe bed, narrower heel, and cleat studs strategically placed to minimize ACL injuries. As a lifelong soccer player, I love the fit and performance of this cleat. So much so that I became an affiliate. If you want to check them out, use this link for a $10 discount. The only other gear you’ll need besides the field to play on and goals are shinguards and a soccer ball. The Nike Premier League soccer balls are a good choice with offerings of various price ranges. Baseball Baseball doesn’t exert as much energy as a lot of other popular sports, but it still requires athleticism, particularly hand-eye coordination. Short bursts of speed to round bases or catch balls are also part of the game. If you aren’t afraid of a high-speed baseball pitch coming at you and the feeling of cracking the bat on the ball (hopefully out of the field for a homerun), baseball might be the sport for you. You’ll get a full-body workout since baseball requires throwing, catching, swinging the bat, and running to bases. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced While beginner adult baseball leagues are out there, you’ll find most leagues are for intermediate and advanced players. Team or Individual Sport: Baseball is played as a team, and all players rely on each other to score points or to get the other team out. There are a multitude of adult baseball leagues to choose from, including senior leagues, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find women’s leagues. You can check our directory to find out what baseball leagues are near you. Gear Recommendations: Baseball only requires a handful of gear, most importantly gloves, cleats, and a bat. Rawlings and Wilson gloves are two of the most popular and long-running brands on the market. Easton makes a great composite bat at varying price points, while Louisville Slugger wood baseball bats are another solid choice. Basketball If you’re quick on your feet, agile, have good hand-eye coordination, and can handle a lot of quick sprinting, basketball is a great sport for adult athletes like you. While not technically a contact sport, there’s a tendency to get banged up a bit during play. If that worries you, sit this sport out. You’ll make quick sprints up and down the court, working with your teammates to get balls in the hoop–or block them from the opposing team. Your heart will pump playing basketball, so it’s best to be in decent cardiovascular shape. You’ll also work your legs, arms, and core as you twist, turn, run, and shoot. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced There are beginner leagues out there, but most are intermediate and advanced. Basketball does require a fair amount of coordination and athleticism, so if you aren’t inherently athletic, it’s probably not the best sport for you. Team or Individual Sport: Basketball is typically played with 5 players per team who work closely together to move the ball down the court. Gear Recommendations: Gear is minimal–a ball and proper shoes are your main requirements. Spalding and Wilson basketballs are used in professional and college basketball leagues. Nike Air Jordans are popular basketball shoes for men and women, in both high and low top versions. Surfing If you’re into the ocean and are a strong swimmer, surfing is a great sport of choice. The exhilaration of popping up on your board to ride a wave is an adrenaline rush that will keep you coming back for more. The sport of surfing has been around globally for centuries and remains popular today, obviously more so in coastal areas like California, Hawaii, and Florida. Surfing requires upper body strength and endurance since much of your time will be spent paddling out to catch the waves you want to surf. You’ll also need a good sense of balance to get up–and stay up–on the board. A good surf session will benefit your legs, back, arms, and core. Besides just being a sport, surfing tends to be a way of life, a culture. Surfers get up at the crack of dawn (or before) to catch great waves, but you can surf anytime there are optimal waves. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced If you have decent swimming skills, you can learn to surf as a newbie, but be patient, as there will be a bit of a learning curve. Intermediate and advanced surfers will get the most out of the sport as they brave the larger waves. Team or Individual Sport: Solo sport, but you sometimes have to compete for waves with other surfers in the water Gear Recommendations: A surfboard is the most important gear you’ll need. There are short and longboard options. Longboards are easier for beginners to pop up and balance on. Shortboards allow skilled surfers to maneuver and cut through waves. Depending on the water temperature, you may also need a wetsuit. A rash guard top will protect your skin from surfboard contact. Golf Golf is a highly-technical sport that requires patience, agility, and endurance (if you’re walking a large course). You’ll need power to launch balls a long distance. You’ll put your patience to the test as you try to maintain a straight drive of your golf ball down the fairway. The short putting and chipping game is also a mental test as you try to get your ball into the hole at or under par. Golf is a game of highs and lows—one hole, you’ll absolutely love it, the next, you’ll want to throw your club across the green. But the challenge of the game will keep you coming back for more. It’s a great sport for adult athletes of all ages, and being outside in the fresh air isn’t the worst way to spend a day. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced Golf is a sport where there’s always room for improvement, no matter your level of expertise. Taking lessons if you’re a beginner is highly recommended, which are readily available at most golf courses. Team or Individual Sport: While you play for score as an individual, golfers are usually grouped together in foursomes. Gear Recommendations: Golf requires a fair amount of gear and isn’t the most affordable sport for an entry-level athlete, but you can find a lot of great deals on used equipment. The necessities for gear include golf clubs, a glove, and you’ll likely want golf shoes. The Cobra XL golf clubs are a solid choice for women’s clubs, while the Callaway Strata is a good starter to mid-level golf set for men. Ancillary items include goofballs and tees. You might also want to invest in a GPS watch or binoculars so you can measure the distance of the ball from the hole. Swimming Swimming is a fantastic minimalistic sport choice–the only real essentials are a body of water and your ability to use your own body to swim through it. Adult athletes of all ages can partake in swimming since it’s especially gentle on the joints. You’ll use your full body when you swim, kicking your legs and propelling forward with your arms. You can swim in a variety of styles–freestyle, breaststroke, butterfly, just to name a few. Whether you prefer swimming in a pool or open water in an ocean or lake, you’ll get a good cardiovascular workout and test your endurance. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced If you aren’t afraid of water, many swim schools offer lessons for adults. Team or Individual Sport: Swimming is a solo sport, but you can also participate in relay teams. It’s a sport you can participate in competitively as a young adult into your senior years. Gear Recommendations: The primary pieces of gear for swimming are swimsuits and goggles. Skiing If you love the snow, have a good sense of balance, and crave a good rush, skiing down mountain slopes might be the sport you need in your life. Downhill skiing is the most well-known type of sport skiing. You’ll strap your boots into a pair of skis and use your body and a set of poles to maneuver yourself downhill. Ski slopes are rated green, blue, and black, representing the easiest to most difficult. More difficult slopes will be steeper and potentially have more obstacles, like trees and moguls. Skiing is a super full-body workout sport that involves a lot of core and leg work. If you have bad knees, skiing can be a bit rough. Skiiers experience an adrenaline rush flowing down a powdery slope as the beauty of nature surrounds them, keeping them returning again and again. There are Masters ski competitions for adults of all ages who love some competition in their lives. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced If you are athletic, taking up skiing as an adult is an option, but lessons are recommended. Many skiers started this sport when they were young and continued well into adulthood, making it more of an intermediate or advanced sport for adults. Team or Individual Sport: Individual, but typically done in groups Gear Recommendations: Skiing requires a fair amount of gear, ranging from skis to boots to helmet to googles to gloves. You’ll also need ski pants, a parka, and other layers of warm clothing. Snowboarding The little cousin of skiing, snowboarding involves strapping both feet into boots perpendicularly on a wide board, using only your body and the board to maneuver down the slopes. Snowboarding requires an incredible sense of balance and athleticism and has a steep learning curve. So if you don’t have patience, and are afraid of spending a lot of time falling on your rear as you learn, check out a different sport. If you do master the ability to get up on your snowboard, you are in for an exhilarating thrill as you use your body to traverse downhill. Snowboarding puts your lower body and your core to the test. While you won’t exert yourself too much cardiovascularly as you board downhill, you’ll require strength to get yourself back up when you fall. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced Adult athletes who want to learn to snowboard can take lessons, but most adult snowboarders are intermediate and advanced-level participants of the sport. Team or Individual Sport: This is a solo sport. Gear Recommendations: Snowboard, boots, googles, helmet, gloves, ski pants, parka, additional layers. Motocross Motocross is one of the more dangerous sports on our list, but also one of the most adrenaline-inducing ones. So if you like a rush and are fearless, check out motocross. Motocross is one level up from mountain biking–dirt trails and a bike. But this time, your bike is gas-powered and can reach much faster speeds than a mountain bike. If you’ve mastered mountain biking, it’ll be an easier segue into motocross. Check for motocross tracks in your area, and if you don’t already know how to ride a motocross bike, instruction is highly recommended. You’ll learn the ins and outs of riding properly, along with the most safe way to do it. Once you’re comfortable, you can soak up the thrilling feeling of racing around a track and eventually make jumps and catch air on your bike. If you’re into the competitive side of motocross, there are a ton of races you can enter. Motocross is a full-body workout, so you need to be in decent shape. Besides the physical aspect of the sport, mental focus is necessary to navigate the track–and the moves of other riders around you. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced Motocross is geared toward more experienced athletes, but if you excel at mountain biking, don’t be afraid to try this sport if you want even more of a thrill. Team or Individual Sport: You ride as an individual, but there are some races where you participate as a team. Gear Recommendations: You’re going to need a lot of gear for this sport, and it isn’t cheap. The motocross bike, of course, is the most important. Brands like Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki, Honda, and Husqvarna are pretty popular. Then you’ll need other gear like a helmet, boots, gloves, goggles. You’ll also need pants and a jersey. And, of course, since crashes are bound to happen, protecting your body is imperative. Back, chest, knee, and neck protection should be on your shopping list. Figure Skating If you’re one of those people who gets mesmerized by the grace and elegance of figure skaters at the Olympics and wish you could skate like they do–you can certainly try. There are a ton of adult figure skating lessons and classes around the country. You’re at an advantage if you already know how to ice skate. If you don’t, take a learn-to-skate lesson first. Balance is key for figure skating. You’ll also need strong coordination skills. As your skills improve, you’ll advance from skating across the ice to incorporating spins and jumps. Figure skating will work your core and lower body the most, but it’s generally a full-body workout. There are competitions for adult skaters if you really want to put your skills to the test. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced You can start figure skating as a newbie adult, but you should have some inherent athletic ability to do well at this sport. Team or Individual Sport: Figure skating is done both solo and in pairs for competition. Gear Recommendations: Ice skates will be your primary gear for this sport, with additional ancillary items like skate guards, gloves, and apparel ranging from form-fitting pants/leggings to skate dresses/skirts to tights. Martial Arts Martial arts cover a broad swath of disciplines, but a few stand out as popular sports. Jiu-Jitsu, Taekwondo, Muay Thai, Judo, Karate, and Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) are probably some of the better-known combat sport martial arts. If those aren’t your jam, you have about 150 other types to choose from. Martial arts require mental and physical strength, as well as endurance. You’ll learn both defensive and offensive maneuvers and as an adult athlete, you will have a wide selection of competitive meets and tournaments available to them. Most of the aforementioned martial arts are full-contact, so if you’re wary of person-to-person grappling, stick with another sport. Martial arts work your whole body, and most who participate in the sport are pretty physically fit. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced There are plenty of options from beginner to advanced to learn martial arts, so if you’re prepared to put in the work as a newbie, don’t be afraid to give this sport a try. Team or Individual Sport: You will compete individually, although you can also be part of a larger team. Gear Recommendations: Fortunately, gear is minimal for martial arts. The apparel recommendations will vary depending on the discipline you choose. Hockey Hockey is a fantastic sport for adult athletes since adult hockey leagues are widely available. Whether you played in high school or college and want to continue into adulthood, or if you’ve never played but are “hockey curious“, you’ve got options. Hockey combines speed, agility, endurance, and a healthy dose of competition. If that sounds like you, lace up some skates and get your game on. And if you don’t know how to skate, it’s kind of important, so take a lesson first. You’ll engage your core as you twist and turn on the ice. You’ll also work your legs, glutes, and arms as you skate, pass, shoot, and check opponents as you move down and across the rink. Hockey also requires a healthy dose of balance. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced While you should have some athletic ability to play hockey, there are plenty of opportunities for newbies to get into the sport as adults. Camps, clinics, and all-skill leagues are available. Team or Individual Sport: Hockey is definitely a team sport, where you work as a unit to score on opponents–or stop them from scoring on you. Gear Recommendations: Besides a comfortable pair of skates, you’ll need a hockey stick, a helmet, gloves, hockey pants, and protective gear. This can include elbow pads, shin pads, shoulder pads, a mouthguard, and a neck guard. Bowling Sometimes debatable as to whether it’s actually a sport, bowling is, in fact, a sport. The United States Bowling Congress governs it. Although not known to torch calories or elevate your heart rate (save for the excitement of getting a strike and knocking down all pins), bowling does require hand-eye coordination. Bowling is a solid option if you don’t like contact sports or working up a sweat but still enjoy some competition. Bowling has plenty of opportunities for those who want to compete, be it in a league or in a tournament. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate Team or Individual Sport: You can bowl individually or on a team. Gear Recommendations: If you’re a casual bowler, you can rent shoes and balls. If you plan to bowl often, invest in a comfortable pair of bowling shoes and your own bowling ball. Dexter rules the market for shoes, and you can find a style to suit your personality. Cornhole Yes, there are cornhole competitions, but whether it’s really a game or a sport is up for discussion. Cornhole (also called bags or some other name variation) entails tossing bean bags onto or into a slanted wooden board with a hole in it. You pair up in teams of two, with each person on the team taking turns tossing their bags to the board across from them in an attempt to score the most points by getting the bag into the hole (3 points) or onto the board (one point). Many social sports leagues offer cornhole as one of their sports since it’s accessible even to non-athletes, but there’s still some fun competition in the game. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate Cornhole is great for newbies, and intermediate players with good aim will do well at scoring points. Team or Individual Sport: Cornhole is played in teams of two. Gear Recommendations: If you play in a social sports league or at a bar, they’ll provide the cornhole set. If you want to play at home, you can grab an inexpensive one like the one below on Amazon. Dodgeball Most of us remember playing dodgeball as a kid. There’s nothing like standing in a line with zero protection waiting to get pelted with a red rubber ball. The nostalgia of dodgeball helps it remain a popular activity in social sports leagues today. While it helps if you have decent aim and quick reflexes, dodgeball doesn’t require immense athletic prowess. That makes it perfect for athletes and non-athletes alike to get a bit of cardiovascular activity while having fun. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate Dodgeball is a good choice for newbies who aren’t super sporty but still want to participate, and also good for intermediate athletes with solid aim and throwing skills. Team or Individual Sport: Dodgeball is played as a team. Check out our directory to find out where you can play dodgeball near you. Gear Recommendations: Nothing but a red rubber ball. Softball Adult softball leagues are easy to find. Whether they are competitive or office leagues, you can find one that’s at a pace of play from beginner to advanced. Softball is either fastpitch or slowpitch, but most adult recreational leagues are slowpitch. You can find a softball league near you in our sports directory, including senior leagues. Many softball leagues are co-ed, and there are adult female leagues as well, so there are more options for women to play softball than baseball as an adult. The workout you get from softball will depend on your level of play, but at the least, you’ll run around bases and snag balls in the infield and outfield. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced There are a lot of options for all skill levels. Team or Individual Sport: Team sport all the way. Gear Recommendations: If you’re a casual league player, your glove is the most important thing you’ll need. Wilson and Rawlings are popular glove brands. Bats, softballs, baseball cleats, and batting gloves should also be on your list. Kickball Courtesy: CLUBWAKA Another nostalgic sport from childhood, kickball is one of the most popular sports in social sports leagues. You play on what looks like a baseball diamond, kicking a ball instead of batting at one before you round bases, just like in baseball or softball. Most kickball leagues are co-ed and meant for fun, so you don’t need to be a superstar athlete to play, but it can help. Playing kickball will burn some calories from running the bases or trying to stop, catch, and throw the ball. You’ll work your legs, arms, and core. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate Team or Individual Sport: Kickball is a team sport. Gear Recommendations: There’s not much of a barrier to entry when it comes to kickball gear. The kickball is your main piece of equipment. Football An all-American sport, adult football leagues are all around the country (and even in other countries). Whether you’re looking for full tackle on the gridiron or the less dangerous flag version of the game, football is a high-intensity sport filled with competition. You’ll use your full body as you run, twist, and pivot on the field in an attempt to score–or block–touchdowns. While men have dominated football for decades, women’s leagues are cropping up in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere. You’ll get a full-body workout playing football, and the risk of injury increases with playing full tackle. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced There are some leagues that say they are open to newbies, but most are geared toward intermediate and advanced players. Newbies should have some inherent athletic skill. Team or Individual Sport: It’s all about the team for football. Gear Recommendations: If you’re playing full-contact football, you’ll definitely need more gear than flag football, including a helmet, pads, cleats, and gloves for some players. Schutt is a very well-known and popular helmet brand that comes in adult sizes. You can opt for varying styles of facemasks. Rugby Rugby is not for the faint of heart. The sport requires a lot of athleticism, endurance, and fearlessness. It is a full-contact sport that involves kicking, carrying, and passing an oval ball down a field (larger than a football) to score goals. Like football, players can tackle each other to stop the ball. Rugby will work pretty much every muscle group, and if you’re afraid of contact, skip this sport. But if you like competitive sports with no holds barred, check out rugby. There are both men’s and women’s adult rugby leagues, so access to the sport is readily available in most areas. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced There are leagues that say no experience is necessary, but you should probably have some athletic abilities if you want to play rugby as a newbie. Team or Individual Sport: Very much a team sport. Gear Recommendations: Your basic rugby gear list will include a ball and cleats (or boots). Besides that, you can opt for protective equipment like headgear, a mouthguard, and padding. Gilbert rugby balls are highly reputable and affordable. Volleyball The beauty of volleyball is that you can play indoors, outdoors, on hard surfaces, on sand, on grass–even in mud. The goal is to volley the ball over the net, with each team getting no more than three touches on the ball before having to volley–or spike–the ball back to the other side. Depending on the type of volleyball, there can be from two to eight players on a side. Volleyball requires good hand-eye coordination, agility, power, and speed. It’s a great workout for the arms, legs, quads, and core. Sand volleyball will add an additional burn to your calves. There’s no contact in volleyball, but balls can fly at high speeds, so if you’re fearful of getting hit, you might want to look into another sport. There are a ton of adult volleyball leagues around the country, so getting into the sport is no problem. Athletic Ability: Newbie, Intermediate, Advanced Many social sports leagues offer volleyball, which is good for newbies, but most leagues are advanced and intermediate. Team or Individual Sport: Teams are part of volleyball, whether in twos, fours, sixes or eights. Gear Recommendations: Besides having a net, the ball is your most valuable piece of gear. You can’t go wrong with the iconic brand that Tom Hanks made famous in his film Castaway. Indoor volleyball players also need volleyball shoes and typically wear knee pads on hard court floors. Lacrosse Fun fact: lacrosse is the oldest organized sport in North America. This sport combines speed, agility, hand-eye coordination, and a fierce sense of competition. Lacrosse will pump your heart, legs, and arms since you use all of them playing this sport. The objective is to get the ball down the field and score goals by passing the ball to your teammates via a stick with a small net at the tip. Besides physical agility, you’ll need mental agility to play lacrosse, as it is a fast-paced game that requires quick thinking. Depending on whether you play men’s or women’s lacrosse will determine the level of contact. Women’s lacrosse prohibits physical contact, which is allowed in the men’s version of the game. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced While you might find some newbie leagues, lacrosse is a physically challenging sport better left to intermediate and advanced athletes. Team or Individual Sport: Lacrosse is a team sport. Gear Recommendations: Most importantly, you’ll need a stick and a ball to play lacrosse. Since men’s lacrosse is a contact sport, they’ll typically require more protective gear, like helmets, gloves, elbow and shoulder pads, and a helmet. Women’s protective gear usually only consists of a mouthguard and goggles. The footwear for both men’s and women’s lacrosse includes cleats. Field Hockey While field hockey is more popular with women than men, there are leagues for both. And, as its name implies, you essentially play hockey on a field, albeit with shorter sticks and a ball instead of a puck. The objective is to work with your teammates to score goals against your opponents–or block them. Field hockey is fast-paced, competitive, and requires speed and agility. You’ll work most of your muscle groups playing this sport. It requires good hand-eye coordination and some athleticism, so the uncoordinated non-athletic types should skip this sport. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced Since players should have some inherent athleticism, field hockey is best suited for intermediate and advanced athletes. Team or Individual Sport: Field hockey is definitely a team sport. There are men’s, women’s, and co-ed leagues. Gear Recommendations: The most critical piece of gear you’ll need is your stick, followed by the ball. STX is a reputable stick brand, but the style will depend on your position and style of play. Cleats for traction and stability will help your game and protective gear like shinguards and mouthguards are recommended. Tennis Tennis is a great competitive sport that requires agility, hand-eye coordination, and endurance. Depending on the level of play, ball speed can be crazy fast, and you’ll need to have a quick response to return the ball across the net. Tennis uses quick bursts of speed and power both to serve and return, and you’ll get a full-body workout, twisting your core, swinging at and serving the ball, and making short and fast lateral moves with your legs. If you aren’t coordinated to begin with, you might want to consider another sport. But if you’re athletic, have endurance, and a competitive streak, tennis could be for you. Athletic Ability: Intermediate, Advanced Since tennis requires some innate athleticism, it’s best suited for intermediate and advanced athletes. Team or Individual Sport: You can play tennis as an individual (singles) or with a teammate (doubles). Gear Recommendations: A tennis racket, balls, and tennis shoes are the essentials for this sport, and you can’t go wrong with a Wilson tennis racket. Wrap Up There you have it. While the list isn’t exhaustive, it covers every athletic level, so there is no doubt you can find a sport to suit your ability and your personality. What are you waiting for?
