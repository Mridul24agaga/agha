manage selling across multiple platforms trying to juggle all of your listings then this video is for you I'm going to be diving into what I believe to be the very best cross-listing tool for resellers in 2025 hey there my name is Lee Meyer I'm the founder of listing the freedom and the empowered reseller.com and I'm on a mission to help 1,000 resellers make $100,000 in the next 12 months if you're new here welcome to the channel my name is Lee Meer and I've made well over $100,000 flipping used Goods on sites like eBay Poshmark and merari and a big piece of My Success has been selling across multiple platforms with the help of a cross Lister now when I first started reselling there were not any cross listing tools on the market no help available you had to manually go and crosspost your items to multiple platforms if you wanted to be able to sell in multiple places it just was not feasible but shortly after after I got started with reselling cross-listing tools started coming on the market and there's several out there you might be looking into and in this video I'm going to share with you why I chose the one that I did and why I continue to believe that it is the best choice for resellers now the cross listing tool and app that I use and recommend is called vendue down here in the description below this video you'll find a link that will get you 25% off of your first month you're also able to get a free trial where you get five free listings each and every month to be able to try it out for yourself and see if it is right for you again you'll find a link down here with an affiliate code this is at no additional cost to you and helps me keep this channel running and helps me to be able to bring you more amazing reseller content and I'm going to let you in on a little secret if you're watching this video in the month of January 2025 you can actually get 40% off of your first month using the link below as well as the coupon code thrive in 25 now there are three broad reasons why I believe this to be the best cross Lister but I'm going to be also getting into specifics in this video first up this platform has updated features and integrates with all major reselling platforms secondly it has an easy to use interface as well as a responsive customer service and thirdly it's being Contin updated to stay ahead of Industry Trends and real quick before we get into the specifics let me explain what cross listing is and what a cross-listing tool can help you do cross-listing just means that you are listing your items out to multiple platforms and having a cross-listing tool means that you don't have to do it manually if you were to manually cross list which you can certainly do you're essentially going to be copying and pasting that same listing over and over again to the different marketplaces that you want to be selling on a cross listing tool can save you tons of time because it can give you one place to be able to create your listing and have that broadcast out to multiple platforms and it also gives you a way for those listings to actually be connected so that if it sells on one platform it's going to get delisted across those other platforms so that you don't end up with duplicate sales and a cross-listing tool is really all about saving you time so I spoiled things a little bit there but let's go ahead and jump on into the seven reasons why I believe that vendue is the best tool for you to be using in 2025 number one since I just touched on is that Auto Sales detect feature this is a GameChanger because it allows you to be able to go about your day without having to worry about ending up with duplicate sales vendue will actually take care of this for you in the back end where you don't have to be at your computer or on your phone constantly checking on your sales and then going in and delisting so what the auto sales detect feature will do you do need to actually have this toggle turned on for it to work but when you have that turned on what it's going to do is it's going to detect any sales that happen in real time and as soon as a sale comes in let's say you have a sale come in on merari and you have that item listed to depop eBay and Poshmark what vendu is actually going to do is remove those listings from those other platforms so that you don't end up with duplicate sales number two with the user interface you can actually get your items listed out to multiple Platforms in just a few clicks you'll create your listing right inside of vendue and then it takes just a couple of clicks to get it listed over to eBay couple clicks to get it listed to merari couple clicks to get it listed to Poshmark whatever platforms that you want to be selling on all of that information is going to be pulled into those specific platforms is going to take just a couple of things like maybe entering size maybe entering shipping and then you'll click to get that item listed and from experience this is infinitely faster than trying to manually do this yourself number three is Inventory management capabilities if you are not using a cross Lister and trying to sell in multiple places it's going to be very difficult to manage your inventory and track your sales coming in vendue gives you one place but it also gives you a way to be able to manage that inventory through things like tags that are specific to to the vendue platform there are also all other kinds of capabilities such as being able to sort and different filters that you can apply to be able to manage your inventory and speaking of sorting you can actually sort your items by how stale they are and that brings me to number four which vendue has the capability to actually delist and relist your sale items for you you're going to Simply sort your items by how stale they are you're going to select which items that you want to D list and relist and you're going to click for vendue to go ahead and complete this for you what this is going to do is it's actually going to remove your listings from the platforms where you want it removed from and then it's going to relist them as fresh brand new items and this is going to boost your sales because it's going to push your listings to the top of search results so that they actually get seen and sold and this is just one of the reasons why I believe vendue to be the best for 2025 because it is so much more more than just a cross listing tool number five vendue actually gives you the capability to have one place to send out offers from if you've tried to sell items across multiple places before it can be a nightmare pulling hair of trying to go to each and every platform manage your inventory along with sending out offers vendue gives you one place to be able to go to and actually get your offers sent out from just that one platform without having to log in to multiple places and this is just another example of how vendue not only saves you time but helps you make more sales number six is having custom templates you can actually go in and set these templates up I recommend setting templates up for each and every category that you're going to be listing into frequently and what these templates do is allow you to drastically speed up the listing process because it's going to prefill that information into all of your listing for you and this is a huge timesaver for you and number seven is the analytics dashboard this is the place where you can access all of your data so you can make informed decisions about your business I hope you found this video helpful and then it shows you just how easy it is to be able to sell across multiple platforms get more eyes on your items and make more sales if you tried vendue before or if you're looking to level up your reselling game let me know in the comments below and don't forget about that link down there to get you 25% off of your first month with vendue and if you're needing more help

manage selling across multiple platforms trying to juggle all of your listings then this video is for you I'm going to be diving into what I believe to be the very best cross-listing tool for resellers in 2025 hey there my name is Lee Meyer I'm the founder of listing the freedom and the empowered reseller.com and I'm on a mission to help 1,000 resellers make $100,000 in the next 12 months if you're new here welcome to the channel my name is Lee Meer and I've made well over $100,000 flipping used Goods on sites like eBay Poshmark and merari and a big piece of My Success has been selling across multiple platforms with the help of a cross Lister now when I first started reselling there were not any cross listing tools on the market no help available you had to manually go and crosspost your items to multiple platforms if you wanted to be able to sell in multiple places it just was not feasible but shortly after after I got started with reselling cross-listing tools started coming on the market and there's several out there you might be looking into and in this video I'm going to share with you why I chose the one that I did and why I continue to believe that it is the best choice for resellers now the cross listing tool and app that I use and recommend is called vendue down here in the description below this video you'll find a link that will get you 25% off of your first month you're also able to get a free trial where you get five free listings each and every month to be able to try it out for yourself and see if it is right for you again you'll find a link down here with an affiliate code this is at no additional cost to you and helps me keep this channel running and helps me to be able to bring you more amazing reseller content and I'm going to let you in on a little secret if you're watching this video in the month of January 2025 you can actually get 40% off of your first month using the link below as well as the coupon code thrive in 25 now there are three broad reasons why I believe this to be the best cross Lister but I'm going to be also getting into specifics in this video first up this platform has updated features and integrates with all major reselling platforms secondly it has an easy to use interface as well as a responsive customer service and thirdly it's being Contin updated to stay ahead of Industry Trends and real quick before we get into the specifics let me explain what cross listing is and what a cross-listing tool can help you do cross-listing just means that you are listing your items out to multiple platforms and having a cross-listing tool means that you don't have to do it manually if you were to manually cross list which you can certainly do you're essentially going to be copying and pasting that same listing over and over again to the different marketplaces that you want to be selling on a cross listing tool can save you tons of time because it can give you one place to be able to create your listing and have that broadcast out to multiple platforms and it also gives you a way for those listings to actually be connected so that if it sells on one platform it's going to get delisted across those other platforms so that you don't end up with duplicate sales and a cross-listing tool is really all about saving you time so I spoiled things a little bit there but let's go ahead and jump on into the seven reasons why I believe that vendue is the best tool for you to be using in 2025 number one since I just touched on is that Auto Sales detect feature this is a GameChanger because it allows you to be able to go about your day without having to worry about ending up with duplicate sales vendue will actually take care of this for you in the back end where you don't have to be at your computer or on your phone constantly checking on your sales and then going in and delisting so what the auto sales detect feature will do you do need to actually have this toggle turned on for it to work but when you have that turned on what it's going to do is it's going to detect any sales that happen in real time and as soon as a sale comes in let's say you have a sale come in on merari and you have that item listed to depop eBay and Poshmark what vendu is actually going to do is remove those listings from those other platforms so that you don't end up with duplicate sales number two with the user interface you can actually get your items listed out to multiple Platforms in just a few clicks you'll create your listing right inside of vendue and then it takes just a couple of clicks to get it listed over to eBay couple clicks to get it listed to merari couple clicks to get it listed to Poshmark whatever platforms that you want to be selling on all of that information is going to be pulled into those specific platforms is going to take just a couple of things like maybe entering size maybe entering shipping and then you'll click to get that item listed and from experience this is infinitely faster than trying to manually do this yourself number three is Inventory management capabilities if you are not using a cross Lister and trying to sell in multiple places it's going to be very difficult to manage your inventory and track your sales coming in vendue gives you one place but it also gives you a way to be able to manage that inventory through things like tags that are specific to to the vendue platform there are also all other kinds of capabilities such as being able to sort and different filters that you can apply to be able to manage your inventory and speaking of sorting you can actually sort your items by how stale they are and that brings me to number four which vendue has the capability to actually delist and relist your sale items for you you're going to Simply sort your items by how stale they are you're going to select which items that you want to D list and relist and you're going to click for vendue to go ahead and complete this for you what this is going to do is it's actually going to remove your listings from the platforms where you want it removed from and then it's going to relist them as fresh brand new items and this is going to boost your sales because it's going to push your listings to the top of search results so that they actually get seen and sold and this is just one of the reasons why I believe vendue to be the best for 2025 because it is so much more more than just a cross listing tool number five vendue actually gives you the capability to have one place to send out offers from if you've tried to sell items across multiple places before it can be a nightmare pulling hair of trying to go to each and every platform manage your inventory along with sending out offers vendue gives you one place to be able to go to and actually get your offers sent out from just that one platform without having to log in to multiple places and this is just another example of how vendue not only saves you time but helps you make more sales number six is having custom templates you can actually go in and set these templates up I recommend setting templates up for each and every category that you're going to be listing into frequently and what these templates do is allow you to drastically speed up the listing process because it's going to prefill that information into all of your listing for you and this is a huge timesaver for you and number seven is the analytics dashboard this is the place where you can access all of your data so you can make informed decisions about your business I hope you found this video helpful and then it shows you just how easy it is to be able to sell across multiple platforms get more eyes on your items and make more sales if you tried vendue before or if you're looking to level up your reselling game let me know in the comments below and don't forget about that link down there to get you 25% off of your first month with vendue and if you're needing more help

Grab a cup of coffee, and let’s break this down step by step. ## Understanding PPC Advertising on Amazon Before diving into strategies, let’s ensure we understand what PPC advertising is. Simply put, PPC allows sellers to bid on keywords, paying for their products to appear in sponsored slots on Amazon search results.
