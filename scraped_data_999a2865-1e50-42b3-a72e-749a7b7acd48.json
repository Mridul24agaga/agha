The idea being crosslisting is to increase your exposure and target a niche audience when you might not otherwise have access to it. But there are some pitfalls, so here’s what you need to know before trying this approach for yourself. What exactly is crosslisting? Crosslisting (also known as crossposting) refers to selling the same products through different channels or venues to reach more potential customers who may not be able to find out about your business any other way. You can do this by copying all your listings from one marketplace over to another or using a tool like Crosslister that automatically lists to several marketplaces, including Depop, Etsy, and eBay OR You can do this manually. You’ll see many sellers in the e-Commerce space turn to crosslisting tools when they first start out because it’s easier than listing from scratch. In many cases, all you have to do is enter your product title and description into a template copy-paste images from one site onto another. Why should you crosslist/crosspost? Selling on multiple platforms is almost always a good idea. If your sales from one platform decrease, you can rely more heavily on revenue made through other outlets to make up for it. So here are 5 really good reasons why you should crosslist on various marketplaces to maximize your exposure. These are common questions raised when beginning a discussion about crossposting – how does it benefit me, should I do it? 1. Crosslisting can introduce you to new audiences Sellers who use only one platform might not be tapping into all the potential buyers there are. By crossposting your listings to multiple platforms, you can reach a wider audience than would otherwise be difficult. 2. Crosslisting presents the opportunity for more targeted selling! Let’s say you have different products or services in each marketplace that cater to different markets. Listing to different marketplaces allows you to put the right item in front of the right people, which leads to more sales in the long term. Each reselling app is different, and buyers on different apps want and expect different things. You can read our comparison on some reselling apps: Etsy vs Depop Poshmark vs Depop Vinted vs Depop 3. Crosslisting can increase your SEO performance & Brand Recognition Each marketplace has its own search algorithm, for example the etsy algorithm is quite different from the depop algorithm. How ever there is one unifying search engine! We’re sure you’ve heard of it’s a small startup that rhymes with poodle 😉 GOOGLE! Crossposting across multiple platforms helps create many listings available to be indexed by the search engines. The more listings you have being indexed by google the higher the chances are that someone will search for something on google (or bing, duckduckgo etc.) will end up on one of your listings. Using a well-designed crosslisting strategy will help you rank on the first page for popular keywords and phrases that are used by potential customers while searching the Internet. Additionally, when someone searches up your brand name instead of the search results being a ghost town you have lots of search results that are relevant to your business, this helps a customer trust that they are dealing with a genuine business! 4. Crosslisting can make your reseller life easier in the long term If you want to ensure success for your business, building a strong reputation is essential. By crossposting on multiple marketplaces, you will have increased exposure while helping to improve the overall perception of your brand. A strong reputation can lead to higher conversions and more positive reviews. Crosslisting allows you to have more peace of mind, knowing that slow sales on one marketplace will not kill 100% your income is a great feeling. 5. Crosslisting is free This means you have nothing to lose except for your time, which could help you build a solid foundation to grow your reselling business. Which platform should you crosslist to? The first thing to ask yourself is which platforms you want to be on. There are many different options available, and they’re all going to have different potential audiences. You can decide based on what type of product you’re selling. If it’s a fashion item, you might want to target Depop or Poshmark, but if it focuses on handmade or vintage items and craft supplies, you may want to look into Etsy. Figuring out the audience your product will most appeal to can make choosing the best platform much more effortless. Depop Depop is an app that allows users to buy and sell their goods – like discount designer clothing, jewelry, vintage – through curated photo feeds similar to Instagram’s feed of posts by people you follow. Shoppers can find anything from discounted designer clothes to cute handmade trinkets on Depop. Users post photos and descriptions of what they’re selling, along with a price. You might come across some hidden treasures in your search for the perfect birthday gift or unique decor items. Poshmark Poshmark is a go-to app for buying and selling all fashion needs. Users can buy, sell, or just give a second life to their clothes with Poshmark’s social commerce marketplace in three countries: the US, Canada, and Australia. Get a dose of Poshmark tips for your business here. Etsy Etsy is an eCommerce company that allows you to sell handmade or vintage items as well as craft supplies and tools from their online website. On Etsy, people can find a wide array of products such as jewelry, bags, clothing, home décor, and furniture toys art, among other things! If you’re already on Etsy, discover how to increase your Etsy traffic (and sales). eBay eBay is one of the oldest and most successful e-commerce websites on the Internet and king of second-hand goods. It doesn’t sell any items but instead allows users to list their own used goods for sale in online auctions, which other bidders can bid against them until one of them wins with a better offer than anyone else’s first price. Vinted One of the newest ways to make a buck is by selling your unworn clothes. Vinted enables people from all over the world, and in every walk of life, an easy platform to sell (or resell) clothing items with others. Vinted is geared towards people selling their own clothes, large businesses running commercial operations may have a hard time as vinted opposes commercial selling. Mercari Mercari is an app that lets you quickly sell your clothes, electronics, and other items. Sellers can create a listing with photos of the item in question, along with its description and price. Other factors should be considered when deciding which platforms to crosslist on, such as: The type of site/service you want to use – Some sites only accept listings based on certain criteria, so it’s important that you understand how each one operates before deciding where to send your product. Who owns the site/service – Sometimes, it can be more beneficial to crosslink with sites owned by larger companies, making them more likely to send traffic your way. How much traffic the site gets – Knowing how many visitors a platform has can give you an idea of whether or not it will be worthwhile to crosslink there, and if so, for how long. For example, ebay.com is one of the most popular sites on the Internet, with thousands of people visiting every day. However, smaller platforms may not be quite there yet when it comes to traffic. The platform’s reputation – Some sites have good reputations, but others have less than favourable ones!. If you’re unsure about how reputable a site is, then it’s best to steer clear. Even large marketplaces have had and can have lapses in communication with their sellers. There are countless examples of sites having false positives when it comes to moderating content on their platform, leading to lots of sellers being locked out/pushed away Recommendations before crosslisting Before you get started with crosslisting, it’s important to make sure that your product is set up properly so that you can submit it to various platforms. Here are some things you should look at: Your sales page If possible, you should have an optimized sales page in place before sending your product to another marketplace. This will make it much easier to rank for various keywords and get more views in the long run. Your item title Make sure that the item title correctly describes your product and doesn’t contain any extra information such as your business name or website address, which can confuse customers and lead them astray. Your product pictures It’s also a good idea to have multiple high-quality photos of your product so that people can see what they’re buying, along with images on your sales page that show off its features and benefits. Your specifications If you have any details about the weight or dimensions of the item, then it’s best to note them on your sales page. This can be useful for customers looking for more specific details about a product before purchasing. Your prices When putting up the price of your item, it must be as accurate as possible, and you should avoid listing any incorrect information such as discounts or coupons that can confuse your customers. Your shipping times If you’re going to be crosslisting on multiple sites, then it’s best to have awareness about the shipping times in place for all of them so that people are not left hanging if they order something from a particular marketplace. It takes longer than expected to arrive. How do you crosslist to other marketplaces? All right, we already know that crosslisting is a way to increase your visibility, reach, and sales on other marketplaces. There are different ways to do this. If you were to try and copy-paste all of the information from your current marketplace listings into another one, it could take several minutes per listing. If you want to list on Etsy, Mercari, or similar platforms, that would add up at least a half-hour for each listing. The problem with manually copying items to different marketplaces is that you always miss steps and have to correct them later in the process. The quickest way to crosslist on multiple marketplaces is by using a crossposting tool. Simplify your workflow and eliminate work hours each day by crosslisting your items into multiple marketplaces in seconds with the SellerAider Crosslister.

Another thing you should do is not compromise on the quality of other sites just to get more sales, make sure your shop looks well put together! Always remember that crosslisting is about making money as well as giving your potential customers a good experience.

Sales vs. Marketing: Understanding the Key Differences Table of Contents Sales and Marketing are like two seemingly inseparable twins – forever entwined in the world of business, similar, yet with their own distinct personalities. While they are just like two peas in a pod, working harmoniously towards a common goal – generating revenue, their approaches are as different as chalk and cheese. Understanding these differences is important not only for the effective operation of a company but also for unlocking its full potential. It’s as if you had a bike instead of a business. There are two wheels of the same size but different functions, and it is better to leave them like that. If they are treated as the same thing, or one is ignored, the bicycle loses its balance, making it difficult to ride smoothly and efficiently. Of course, there are statistics to back it up. In 2020 LinkedIn conducted a study and found that a whopping 87% of Sales and Marketing experts believe that teamwork between their departments helps businesses grow. Not only that, but 85% of them also think that getting Sales and Marketing on the same page is the golden ticket to boosting their overall business performance. Sales vs. Marketing By definition, the sales process is about selling products or services, and there is no money without it. Sometimes, “sales” can also refer to the money made or the quantity of items sold. It’s a crucial part of any company’s success, in both action and measurement, but we will be talking about the former. Marketing, on the other hand, is all about getting the word out about your products or services. It includes things like doing research to understand what customers want and using this information to grab people’s attention. So, it’s the fun, creative side of the business that helps people learn about and fall in love with what you’re selling. Purpose of Sales and Marketing In a big short: sales is all about closing the deal. It turns prospects into paying customers using numerous interpersonal techniques. A good salesperson is the one who can sweet-talk their way into getting a free dessert at a restaurant. They are the faces of the company who make sure that the right product or service finds a loving home in the arms of customers. Marketing, on the other hand, is the BFF of sales. It’s the wingman that sets the stage for sales to do its thing. The brand awareness lures potential customers into the sales funnel by creating interest, trust, and a bit of pizzazz. From catchy slogans to eye-popping visuals, marketing makes sure people know about your product and why they need it in their lives. The Difference Between Sales and Marketing Focus In the discussion on sales vs. marketing, their focus is the first element worth considering. The sales team’s main concern is the people. They’re the social butterflies of the business world, always eager to chat with potential customers, get to know them, and figure out what they need. They piece together clues to find the perfect solution for each individual prospect. They are passionate about building relationships as well as creating positive experiences that turn potential buyers into happy customers. They’re the ones who dream up and execute everything from attention-grabbing ads to engaging social media posts that capture the hearts and minds of potential customers. Beyond that, they’re constantly analyzing market trends and consumer behavior to ensure that their strategies remain relevant and effective. It is all about creating a buzz and generating leads, setting the stage for the sales team. Delivery: Storytelling vs. Asking Questions A good salesperson has to be like a curious child, specifically when it comes to asking questions (a lot of them). Asking by itself is not enough, though, people from the sales department listen carefully, offer helpful advice, and work hard to find the perfect solution for each person. Their inquisitive nature helps them dig much deeper than any market analysis would ever allow. Marketing is all about spinning a good yarn, it’s more general as it has to apply to a larger group of people. And what do people like? – a good story. Marketers are the storytellers of the business world, creating emotional and engaging connections between the brand and its audience. They paint vivid pictures of how amazing life could be with their products or services, making potential customers feel like they’re witnessing a thrilling narrative part that they can purchase. Tactics Sales is all about getting up close and personal with prospects and customers. It’s about being a friend who’s always there to lend an ear and help you find what you need. Whether it’s a phone call, face-to-face meeting, or video conference, they’re great at answering questions, addressing concerns, as well as offering special deals to make sure people feel confident in their purchase and that they get the right product. In a party full of people, marketing is its life, using all sorts of creative tactics to be noticed and remembered. Marketers not just talking to one person; they want to spread the word far and wide, no matter if people need what they have to offer. They use a mix of traditional and digital channels to connect with as many people as possible, spark their interest, and turn them into fans of your brand. From eye-catching billboards to viral videos, marketing teams consistently innovate to ensure your brand stays top of mind. Skill Sets What’s worth considering is that a good marketing person won’t necessarily make a good salesperson. The latter requires a combination of a soul-of-the-party logician and a therapist – someone who can listen while identifying and understanding customer needs and preferences as well as various patterns. Add to that a good dose of resilience and persistence (because, let’s face it, rejection is part and parcel of the sales world) and a keen sense of timing followed by the ability to close deals, and you get yourself a successful salesperson. Marketing needs an artist with a hint of a mathematician in them – a creative thinker and storyteller, weaving engaging narratives that draw people in and don’t let go, but also data-driven and analytical at the same time. They have to be able to interpret metrics and make informed decisions to optimize campaigns while looking at the bigger picture and developing long-term plans to boost brand visibility and reach. Metrics Sales just love numbers – specifically, the money numbers. When it comes to measuring success, sales teams look at revenue, which means how much cash they’ve brought in from all those deals they’ve closed. They also track key performance indicators (KPIs) like conversion rates and average deal sizes. Although it sounds complicated, it’s rather straightforward: more sales equals more success (and commission). With marketing, the measurement game is a bit more complex. They can look at a bunch of different factors, like how many people are visiting their website, how many new leads they’re bringing in, and how engaged people are with their content. They also track metrics like brand awareness and customer sentiment. Regardless of different factors that may be taken into account, it’s sometimes hard to say if the campaign is even working. For marketing, it’s not just about the money; it’s about how well they’re connecting with their audience and whether they’re making a positive impact on the brand, and that’s something that’s extremely hard to put a tag on. Timeframe The sale process is quick, like a sprint. Wins are short-term and immediate. All in all, it doesn’t take long to close a deal and get the customer on board, or at least it shouldn’t – targets and deadlines are always pushing to hit the right numbers and make sales happen right now. Sales reps often juggle multiple prospects at once, ensuring that they maintain momentum and keep their schedules full. Marketing isn’t like that, it is more like a marathon, focused on the long game. Marketers are all about building a strong brand and forging lasting relationships with customers. It takes time to create a loyal fan base, and the efforts might not pay off immediately. It’s for this reason that it is often neglected, but the patience it requires is undoubtedly worth it. The investment is in marketing strategies that will grow the brand over time and keep customers coming back for more. Marketing teams are constantly fine-tuning their approach, adjusting campaigns, and analyzing results to ensure they’re on track to achieve long-term success. Patience and perseverance are key for marketing professionals as they work to create a solid foundation for the brand’s future growth. Similarities Between Sales and Marketing Shared Goal The most obvious thing that comes to mind when we talk about similarities is that sales goals and marketing ones are pretty much the same. Ultimately, it’s about growing the business. They might have different methods and focuses, but it’s all about making the company more successful. Customer-Centric Approach At the heart of both sales and marketing strategy is the customer. Both of them need to understand their customers and be able to tell what are their needs, preferences, pain points, and what floats their boat in general. All of that is crucial to tailor the messaging and strategies accordingly. Adaptability and flexibility The business world is like a roller coaster, full of twists, turns, and unexpected surprises. To stay ahead, both teams need to be as flexible as a yoga master. They must respond quickly to market changes, customer feedback, and new opportunities, always ready to refine their strategies and tactics to remain competitive and drive growth. Both of these worlds are those of constant development and keeping up to date. Slowing down for a while can mean losing ground to competitors and missing out on potential sales or leads. Collaboration and communication To achieve the best results, sales and marketing teams need to communicate effectively and collaborate closely. Sharing information and working together can create a seamless customer journey that changes random passersby into loyal customers. This teamwork involves sharing customer insights, aligning messaging, and coordinating strategies. The more these two departments can work together, the more successful their efforts will be. Conclusion Sales and marketing might seem like two sides of the same business coin, but they have their own unique ways of making things happen. While sales are all about connecting with people and sealing the deal, marketing is the mastermind behind creating interest and building the brand. Each team has its own focus, techniques, and skill sets, but they share the common goal of driving business growth. Thus, in the end, sales vs. marketing is just about pointing out the small differences that make each other special, but which together are a super-power for every business. It’s important to remember that a company’s success doesn’t come down to choosing one over the other. Instead, it’s about embracing their differences and ensuring they work together like a well-oiled machine. Understanding how each team operates, communicating effectively, and collaborating on strategies can create a customer experience that keeps people coming back for more. So, at the end of the day, it’s not about picking a winner in the sales vs. marketing debate. It’s about recognizing the value both bring to the table and harnessing their unique strengths to create a powerful, unstoppable force that drives your business forward.

Sales vs. Marketing: Understanding the Key Differences Table of Contents Sales and Marketing are like two seemingly inseparable twins – forever entwined in the world of business, similar, yet with their own distinct personalities. While they are just like two peas in a pod, working harmoniously towards a common goal – generating revenue, their approaches are as different as chalk and cheese. Understanding these differences is important not only for the effective operation of a company but also for unlocking its full potential. It’s as if you had a bike instead of a business. There are two wheels of the same size but different functions, and it is better to leave them like that. If they are treated as the same thing, or one is ignored, the bicycle loses its balance, making it difficult to ride smoothly and efficiently. Of course, there are statistics to back it up. In 2020 LinkedIn conducted a study and found that a whopping 87% of Sales and Marketing experts believe that teamwork between their departments helps businesses grow. Not only that, but 85% of them also think that getting Sales and Marketing on the same page is the golden ticket to boosting their overall business performance. Sales vs. Marketing By definition, the sales process is about selling products or services, and there is no money without it. Sometimes, “sales” can also refer to the money made or the quantity of items sold. It’s a crucial part of any company’s success, in both action and measurement, but we will be talking about the former. Marketing, on the other hand, is all about getting the word out about your products or services. It includes things like doing research to understand what customers want and using this information to grab people’s attention. So, it’s the fun, creative side of the business that helps people learn about and fall in love with what you’re selling. Purpose of Sales and Marketing In a big short: sales is all about closing the deal. It turns prospects into paying customers using numerous interpersonal techniques. A good salesperson is the one who can sweet-talk their way into getting a free dessert at a restaurant. They are the faces of the company who make sure that the right product or service finds a loving home in the arms of customers. Marketing, on the other hand, is the BFF of sales. It’s the wingman that sets the stage for sales to do its thing. The brand awareness lures potential customers into the sales funnel by creating interest, trust, and a bit of pizzazz. From catchy slogans to eye-popping visuals, marketing makes sure people know about your product and why they need it in their lives.

They help build stronger customer relationships, improve satisfaction, and increase order value—all without finding new customers. When someone buys, it’s the perfect time to suggest helpful upgrades or complementary products. These strategies enhance the customer’s experience and show real value. The key is using simple, proven tactics that fit naturally into the sales process without overwhelming your customers. This guide has easy tips and real examples to help you increase sales, build loyalty, and keep customers coming back. Let’s get started! Boost Conversion Instantly Add Social Proof & Urgency to your website Try WiserNotify Today Statistics Of Upselling and Cross-selling 37% of salespeople avoid upselling and cross-selling. Upselling can boost a customer’s lifetime value by 20%-40%. Research shows that upselling and cross-selling to existing and new customers can result in 42% more revenue. Upselling vs Cross Selling Understanding upselling and cross-selling is crucial for boosting sales and customer satisfaction. While both aim to drive revenue, they focus on different stages of the sales process. Let’s explore. ◈ Upselling Focuses on encouraging customers to upgrade to a higher-value version of the product they are already considering. It seeks to boost average order value by providing premium features or sophisticated alternatives. Aligns with the customer’s current purchase intent, enhancing their experience while increasing sales revenue. It is often used during the sales process, like at checkout or on the product page. ◈ Cross-Selling Focuses on recommending complementary products or services that go well with the customer’s initial purchase. It aims to increase the total items in the cart and boost customer lifetime value. Helps enhance the customer journey by addressing additional needs and improving customer satisfaction. Often used before checkout, on product pages, or in follow-up emails. Why is Upselling And Cross-selling Important? Upselling and cross-selling are clever ways to grow your business without spending extra time or money trying to find new customers. They focus on getting the most out of your existing customers, making every sale more valuable while keeping customers happy. Here’s why they matter: ➲ Increase Revenue Without Extra Effort Getting new customers takes time and money. Upselling and cross-selling allow you to grow your revenue by encouraging your current customers to buy more. ➲ Build Stronger Customer Relationships You show customers that you care about their needs when recommending relevant products or upgrades. This builds trust and strengthens your connection with them. People are more likely to return to a business that makes them feel understood. ➲ Increase Customer Loyalty and Lifetime Value Happy customers come back. By offering value through helpful recommendations, you encourage repeat purchases and increase the customer’s lifetime value. Over time, loyal customers spend more and drive consistent growth for your business. ➲ Use What You Already Know With insights from past purchases or buying patterns, you can make personalized suggestions that feel natural. Customers appreciate when businesses recommend products that make sense for them, which can lead to more sales and stronger relationships. ➲ Support Long-Term Business Growth Upselling and cross-selling help your business grow in a steady, sustainable way. They improve profit margins, boost customer loyalty, and keep people coming back—all without needing major changes to your operations. ➲ Making It Work For example, if a customer buys a smartphone, offering a case or screen protector feels helpful, not pushy. It’s a small step that adds value for them and increases your revenue at the same time. The Newest and Most Impactful Upsell Strategies 1. Customer Reviews for Premium Options One of the most effective ways to encourage customers to upgrade is by using real customer reviews. When people see others benefiting from a premium option, it creates trust and makes the decision easier. This approach works because customers want proof that they’re making the right choice, and nothing is more convincing than positive feedback from someone who’s been in their shoes. People naturally trust other customers more than marketing pitches. Seeing real experiences makes the upgrade feel more worthwhile. Reviews offer reassurance by answering common questions like, “Is this worth the extra cost?” or “Will it solve my problem?” How to Use Reviews for Upselling: Put Reviews Where They Matter Place reviews in spots where customers are deciding, like: The pricing page: Help them compare and choose. During checkout: Give them one last nudge. Follow-up emails: Remind them what they’re missing. Use a Mix of Formats Combine written reviews, star ratings, and even short videos. A quick clip of someone sharing their experience adds a personal touch that builds confidence. 2. Use Bundled Discounts Of Products Bundled discounts are a tried-and-true upsell strategy that benefits both businesses and customers. The idea is simple: combine related products or services into a package and offer a discount on the total price. It’s a win-win—customers feel like they’re getting a deal, and you increase your average order value. Bundled offers appeal to a customer’s sense of value. Instead of deciding whether to purchase individual items, they see a single, more attractive deal. This strategy also encourages customers to buy items they might not have considered otherwise, increasing your overall sales revenue. How to Create Effective Bundles: Pair Complementary Products Offer items that naturally complement each other, such as a smartphone with a case and screen protector or a camera with a lens and tripod. Bundling relevant products simplifies the customer’s purchase decision. Show the Savings Clearly highlight the discount customers are getting. For example: “Buy all three and save 15%!” “Bundle deal: Get a $50 value for just $40.” Use Seasonal or Themed Bundles Create bundles around holidays, special occasions, or specific customer needs. For instance, a “Back-to-School Kit” for students or a “Winter Essentials Bundle” for outdoor enthusiasts. 3. Highlight Your Product’s Value Upselling isn’t about pushing customers to spend more—it’s about showing them why the upgrade is worth it. When you clearly highlight the value of your product, you make it easier for customers to see how it can solve their problems or improve their experience. Customers don’t just want to know what an upgraded product can do—they want to know how it benefits them. By focusing on the features that matter most and connecting them to real-world benefits, you can help them understand why the premium option is the better choice. How to Highlight Your Product’s Value: Focus on Benefits, Not Just Features Instead of listing technical specs, explain how the upgrade will make their life easier or better. Example: “Our Pro plan lets you save time with automation tools, so you can focus on what really matters.” “Upgrade to Premium for faster delivery and exclusive member perks.” “The extra features in the Pro plan helped me achieve my goals faster.” Solve Specific Pain Points Identify common challenges your customers face and explain how the upgraded product addresses them. Example: “With our Premium laptop, you’ll enjoy double the battery life—perfect for long workdays.” Use Real Examples Show how other customers have benefited from the upgrade. A case study, testimonial, or statistic can make the value more relatable and convincing. 4. Use Visual Comparisons Visual comparisons are a powerful upselling strategy to help customers understand the value of upgrading to a higher-tier product or service. By presenting options side by side, you make it clear why the upsell is worth the extra cost. How to Use Visual Comparisons in Upselling: Feature Comparison Tables Create tables that compare basic and premium options, highlighting key differences. Example: | Feature | Basic Plan | Premium Plan | | --- | --- | --- | | Storage | 5 GB | 50 GB | | Customer Support | Standard Email | 24/7 Priority Chat | | Price | $9.99/month | $19.99/month | Visual Price Comparisons Show how a slightly higher price can save money or provide more value over time. Example: “Pay $30 more upfront and get double the features!” Side-by-Side Product Images Display images of both options for physical goods, emphasizing what the upgrade offers. Example: A basic phone with standard features versus a premium phone with an enhanced camera and extra battery life. Why Visual Comparisons Work for Upselling Visual tools make decision-making faster and more intuitive. Customers can immediately see what they’re missing by not upgrading, making the upsell offer more compelling. By focusing on benefits and clarity, you reduce hesitation and increase conversions. Pro Tips for Using Visual Comparisons in Upselling Place your comparison charts or visuals near critical decision points, such as the product page or checkout. Keep the design simple and intuitive—too much information can overwhelm customers. Continuously test your visuals to optimize performance and maximize your upselling success. 5. Improve Your Timing The timing of your upselling offer is critical to its success. When done right, upselling enhances the customer experience and increases revenue. A poorly timed upsell, however, can feel pushy and lead to lost sales. Here’s how to make timing work for your upselling strategy. Introduce Upsells During Checkout Offer customers an enhanced version of their chosen product or a premium upgrade while they finalize their purchase. Use targeted language, such as “Complete your order with our exclusive premium plan upgrade—only $10 more!” Present Post-Purchase Upselling Offers Suggest related products or services after completing the transaction. Send an email with a personalized message: “Enhance your recent purchase with a matching accessory—offer valid for 48 hours.” 6. Checkout-Specific Offers The checkout is a perfect opportunity to upsell because customers are already in buying mode. Offering an upsell at checkout, you catch them at the moment of commitment. Example, if a customer is buying a mid-tier plan, suggest to upgrade to a higher tier plan with more features at a discounted rate for immediate upgrade. These offers can be presented as limited time offers to create urgency. Add phrases like “Exclusive deal—upgrade now and save 20%!” to make customers act fast. Visual elements like a comparison chart showing the added value of the upsell product or service will make the decision easier for the customer. Build trust & FOMO Highlight real-time activities like reviews, sales & sign-ups. Add to My Website NowTry for free (No card required) Best Cross-Selling Strategies 7. Recommend Items After the Purchase Recommending items after someone has made a purchase is a great way to keep the shopping experience going and offer extra value. After buying something, customers are often still thinking about how to make the most of their purchase, so this is the perfect time to suggest related items they might find useful. For instance, if someone buys a camera, you could recommend accessories like a protective case, extra memory cards, or a tripod. These are things they might need anyway, and suggesting them saves them time searching. Make the recommendations feel personal by tying them to what the customer already bought, like saying, “Protect your new camera with this highly-rated carrying case.” 8. Create Themes or Sets One of the most effective ways to implement cross-selling is by curating themes or sets that combine products or services into cohesive packages. This approach makes it easier for customers to see the value in purchasing complementary items together. Customers are drawn to ready-made solutions that eliminate the guesswork of finding complementary items. Bundles give the impression of a better deal, even if there’s no discount applied. Themed sets evoke emotions, making purchases feel purposeful and exciting. 9. Make It Easy to Add Items When cross-selling, the simpler the process, the more likely customers will accept your offer. Complicated steps or unclear navigation can deter even the most interested buyers. Here’s how to streamline the process: Use One-Click Additions Quick actions reduce friction and keep customers focused on completing their purchases. How to Implement: Add a “+ Add to Cart” button next to cross-sell suggestions. Use drop-down menus or checkboxes for easy selection. Example: “Add a matching charger for $10—just one click away!” 10. Use Location-Based Cross-Selling Location-based cross-selling is a smart way to connect with your customers by offering suggestions that make sense for where they are. It’s about understanding what people in a specific area might need or want and tailoring your recommendations to match. This approach feels personal and helpful, which makes customers more likely to say yes. Use Location Data to Personalize Offers Use simple tools like GPS or zip codes to make your suggestions feel more relevant. Example: If someone orders takeout in a beach town, suggest popular seafood dishes or local drinks that go well with their meal. Use Location-Based Notifications Send suggestions to customers based on where they are. Example: If a customer is near your store, notify them of a discount on an accessory that pairs with something they’ve already purchased. 11. Show “Others Are Buying This” One of the most valuable strategies is letting customers know what others are purchasing can help them feel more confident in their choices. By using this strategy, you’re not just suggesting products – you’re showing that other shoppers found these items valuable, too. Here’s how to use this approach effectively: Tools to use: like WiserNotify showcase real-time purchase activity and product updates to engage visitors and build trust. Add Live Updates Display notifications about what others are adding to their carts right now. Real-time updates create excitement and make customers feel part of a larger shopping experience. Example: “Just now: Someone purchased this fitness tracker and matching wristbands.” Show What’s Trending Highlight products that are popular among other shoppers. Customers are naturally drawn to products that are loved by others, especially when they see they’re in demand. Example: “This cozy sweater is trending this week—add it to your wardrobe!” Best Practices for Implementing Upselling and Cross-Selling Tactics Upselling and cross-selling can be amazing for your business if done right. But it’s not just about suggesting higher value or additional products—it’s about doing so in a way that adds to the customer’s experience. Let’s explore the best practices to help you make the most of these strategies while keeping trust and loyalty intact Keep the Process Simple When you add upselling and cross-selling to your business, it’s important to make things easy for your customers. A clear and simple process helps them feel confident and makes it more likely they’ll say yes to your offers. Keep your messages clear and easy to understand. Focus on what the customer will gain. Example: Instead of “Unlock premium access for enhanced efficiency and added functionality,” say “Get more features with Premium.” Place your offers where they naturally fit into the shopping experience. Example: Add a button next to the main product in the cart that says “Add Warranty” or “Upgrade Now.” Use tools that can suggest the best offers for each customer based on what they’re looking at or have purchased before. Example: “You might also like…” suggestions powered by your website’s software. Overloading the customer with lengthy explanations or too many benefits can confuse and frustrate them. Use short, clear phrases like “Upgrade to Pro for more features” or “Add a matching case for just $10.” Focus on Customer Needs Upselling and cross-selling work best when they align with what the customer truly wants or needs. Instead of pushing random products or upgrades, tailor your approach to solve their specific problems or enhance their experience. Here’s how to focus on customer needs effectively: Listen to What Customers Want Listening to what your customers want is the key to offering the right products or services. Pay attention to their needs, preferences, and feedback to understand what truly matters to them. Ask questions, read reviews, or analyze their shopping habits to gather insights. When you know what they’re looking for, you can suggest options that feel thoughtful and relevant. This simple act of listening builds trust and leads to better customer satisfaction. Follow Up After Purchase of Product Following up after someone buys a product is a simple yet powerful way to build trust and encourage future purchases. A quick thank-you email or message lets customers know you appreciate their business. You can also use this opportunity to suggest items that go well with what they bought or share tips to help them get the most out of their purchase. Keep it friendly and personal by mentioning the product they chose, so it feels like you’re talking directly to them. Asking for feedback is another great way to show you care about their experience. A thoughtful follow-up can turn a happy customer into a loyal one. Automate Follow-Up Campaigns Use automation tools to send timely follow-ups based on purchase history, ensuring the communication feels relevant and personalized. Example: Week 1: “How’s your [Product Name]? Here are some tips to maximize its benefits.” Week 2: “Complete your experience with these hand-picked recommendations.” Keep the Prices Balanced When implementing upselling and cross-selling strategies, maintaining a well-balanced pricing approach is key to ensuring your offers feel valuable rather than opportunistic. Customers are more likely to respond positively to suggestions that fit their budget and offer clear benefits. Here’s how you can keep the pricing balanced while driving conversions: Leverage Psychological Pricing Use pricing techniques that feel smaller or more affordable: “Upgrade for just $3 per month” instead of “$36 per year.” Set prices at $19.99 instead of $20 to make it appear more budget-friendly. Test and Adjust Pricing Conduct A/B testing to identify the price points that yield the best results. Experiment with different price ranges for upsells or cross-sells and monitor conversion rates. Use customer feedback to refine your pricing approach. Avoid Overloading the Customer When implementing upselling and cross-selling strategies, it’s essential to strike the right balance between offering valuable recommendations and overwhelming your customers. Here’s how to avoid overloading them while still maximizing your opportunities: Limit the Number of Suggestions Offering too many options at once can lead to choice paralysis, where customers feel overwhelmed and decide to make no purchase at all. Stick to 1–2 relevant upsell or cross-sell recommendations during the buying process. Keep It Relevant Ensure that your suggestions align closely with the customer’s current purchase or browsing behavior. Example: If a customer buys a laptop, suggest a warranty or laptop bag, not unrelated items like kitchenware. Top 5 Successful Upselling and Cross-Selling Examples Here are the Examples of Upselling Strategies 1. Highlight New Arrivals Upselling is an old-school sales technique for boosting sales and the shopping experience. It’s all about getting customers to look at premium options or new products that add more value to their purchases. Highlighting new arrivals is one of the easiest ways to introduce upsell opportunities, especially when showing how these products solve customer pain points or enhance their experience. Example: At MR PORTER_,_ showing fresh stock on your homepage or suggesting an upgrade of a customer’s purchase at checkout can grab attention and get them to take action. With the right approach, upselling isn’t just about increasing sales revenue. It’s about showing customers options they didn’t know they needed and, ultimately, customer satisfaction and loyalty. 2. Create Daily Offers Upselling is a clever sales technique that helps you make more sales by getting customers to buy higher-value products or services. One of the best examples is daily offers that showcase premium products or upgrades in a nice way. These daily deals grab attention and give customers a reason to consider options they might not have thought of. Whether it’s a premium plan, bundling extras, or discounts on upgraded items, daily offers are a quick way to increase customer interaction and make more sales. This works particularly well in ecommerce as it keeps customers engaged and brings new opportunities to upsell. 3. Display Products Other Customers Have Viewed When it comes to upselling, showing products that other customers have viewed is a simple but powerful tactic. Showing these, you tap into the power of social proof and get customers to look at other options they may not have considered. This works really well in ecommerce, where personalization and real-time customer interaction are key to the shopping experience. Example: Walmart’s approach to upselling goes beyond selling—it’s about enhancing the customer experience.showing “Customers Also Viewed” or “Similar Products” on your product pages can subtly guide customers toward higher-value items. This increases the chances of an upsell and enhances the overall customer journey by showing them more options that are relevant to them. It’s a smart sales technique that creates value for the customer and your business. Here are the Examples of Cross-Selling Strategy 4.

Showing “customers also bought” suggestions not only promotes related products but also builds trust by using social proof. This works because it feels natural and helpful, showing relevant products based on actual buying behavior. Example: When a customer buys a laptop, suggesting a mouse, a laptop bag, or an external hard drive makes perfect sense. By showing these options during or after the purchase process, ecommerce businesses can improve the customer experience, increase sales, and encourage repeat business. This simple cross-selling is a win-win for both customer and business, creating value and building the relationship with the customer. 5. Offer Related Products Cross-selling is a smart way to offer customers more value while increasing sales. Suggesting related products that complement their current purchase enhances their shopping experience and shows you understand their needs. Whether it’s recommending a phone case when someone buys a smartphone or offering a pair of socks alongside running shoes, these simple strategies can make a big impact. Cross-selling works best when it feels natural and helpful, not pushy. It’s about showing customers how your products work together to improve their experience. With the right cross-selling techniques, ecommerce businesses can boost sales, strengthen customer relationships, and keep customers coming back for more. Conclusion Both upselling and cross-selling strategies are essential tools for ecommerce businesses and sales teams looking to boost revenue, improve customer satisfaction, and build lasting customer relationships.

They help build stronger customer relationships, improve satisfaction, and increase order value—all without finding new customers. When someone buys, it’s the perfect time to suggest helpful upgrades or complementary products. These strategies enhance the customer’s experience and show real value. The key is using simple, proven tactics that fit naturally into the sales process without overwhelming your customers. This guide has easy tips and real examples to help you increase sales, build loyalty, and keep customers coming back. Let’s get started! Boost Conversion Instantly Add Social Proof & Urgency to your website Try WiserNotify Today Statistics Of Upselling and Cross-selling 37% of salespeople avoid upselling and cross-selling. Upselling can boost a customer’s lifetime value by 20%-40%. Research shows that upselling and cross-selling to existing and new customers can result in 42% more revenue. Upselling vs Cross Selling Understanding upselling and cross-selling is crucial for boosting sales and customer satisfaction. While both aim to drive revenue, they focus on different stages of the sales process. Let’s explore. ◈ Upselling Focuses on encouraging customers to upgrade to a higher-value version of the product they are already considering. It seeks to boost average order value by providing premium features or sophisticated alternatives. Aligns with the customer’s current purchase intent, enhancing their experience while increasing sales revenue. It is often used during the sales process, like at checkout or on the product page. ◈ Cross-Selling Focuses on recommending complementary products or services that go well with the customer’s initial purchase. It aims to increase the total items in the cart and boost customer lifetime value. Helps enhance the customer journey by addressing additional needs and improving customer satisfaction. Often used before checkout, on product pages, or in follow-up emails. Why is Upselling And Cross-selling Important? Upselling and cross-selling are clever ways to grow your business without spending extra time or money trying to find new customers. They focus on getting the most out of your existing customers, making every sale more valuable while keeping customers happy. Here’s why they matter: ➲ Increase Revenue Without Extra Effort Getting new customers takes time and money. Upselling and cross-selling allow you to grow your revenue by encouraging your current customers to buy more. ➲ Build Stronger Customer Relationships You show customers that you care about their needs when recommending relevant products or upgrades. This builds trust and strengthens your connection with them. People are more likely to return to a business that makes them feel understood. ➲ Increase Customer Loyalty and Lifetime Value Happy customers come back. By offering value through helpful recommendations, you encourage repeat purchases and increase the customer’s lifetime value. Over time, loyal customers spend more and drive consistent growth for your business. ➲ Use What You Already Know With insights from past purchases or buying patterns, you can make personalized suggestions that feel natural. Customers appreciate when businesses recommend products that make sense for them, which can lead to more sales and stronger relationships. ➲ Support Long-Term Business Growth Upselling and cross-selling help your business grow in a steady, sustainable way. They improve profit margins, boost customer loyalty, and keep people coming back—all without needing major changes to your operations. ➲ Making It Work For example, if a customer buys a smartphone, offering a case or screen protector feels helpful, not pushy. It’s a small step that adds value for them and increases your revenue at the same time. The Newest and Most Impactful Upsell Strategies 1. Customer Reviews for Premium Options One of the most effective ways to encourage customers to upgrade is by using real customer reviews. When people see others benefiting from a premium option, it creates trust and makes the decision easier. This approach works because customers want proof that they’re making the right choice, and nothing is more convincing than positive feedback from someone who’s been in their shoes. People naturally trust other customers more than marketing pitches. Seeing real experiences makes the upgrade feel more worthwhile. Reviews offer reassurance by answering common questions like, “Is this worth the extra cost?” or “Will it solve my problem?” How to Use Reviews for Upselling: Put Reviews Where They Matter Place reviews in spots where customers are deciding, like: The pricing page: Help them compare and choose. During checkout: Give them one last nudge. Follow-up emails: Remind them what they’re missing. Use a Mix of Formats Combine written reviews, star ratings, and even short videos. A quick clip of someone sharing their experience adds a personal touch that builds confidence. 2. Use Bundled Discounts Of Products Bundled discounts are a tried-and-true upsell strategy that benefits both businesses and customers. The idea is simple: combine related products or services into a package and offer a discount on the total price. It’s a win-win—customers feel like they’re getting a deal, and you increase your average order value. Bundled offers appeal to a customer’s sense of value. Instead of deciding whether to purchase individual items, they see a single, more attractive deal. This strategy also encourages customers to buy items they might not have considered otherwise, increasing your overall sales revenue. How to Create Effective Bundles: Pair Complementary Products Offer items that naturally complement each other, such as a smartphone with a case and screen protector or a camera with a lens and tripod. Bundling relevant products simplifies the customer’s purchase decision. Show the Savings Clearly highlight the discount customers are getting. For example: “Buy all three and save 15%!” “Bundle deal: Get a $50 value for just $40.” Use Seasonal or Themed Bundles Create bundles around holidays, special occasions, or specific customer needs. For instance, a “Back-to-School Kit” for students or a “Winter Essentials Bundle” for outdoor enthusiasts. 3. Highlight Your Product’s Value Upselling isn’t about pushing customers to spend more—it’s about showing them why the upgrade is worth it. When you clearly highlight the value of your product, you make it easier for customers to see how it can solve their problems or improve their experience. Customers don’t just want to know what an upgraded product can do—they want to know how it benefits them. By focusing on the features that matter most and connecting them to real-world benefits, you can help them understand why the premium option is the better choice. How to Highlight Your Product’s Value: Focus on Benefits, Not Just Features Instead of listing technical specs, explain how the upgrade will make their life easier or better. Example: “Our Pro plan lets you save time with automation tools, so you can focus on what really matters.” “Upgrade to Premium for faster delivery and exclusive member perks.” “The extra features in the Pro plan helped me achieve my goals faster.” Solve Specific Pain Points Identify common challenges your customers face and explain how the upgraded product addresses them. Example: “With our Premium laptop, you’ll enjoy double the battery life—perfect for long workdays.” Use Real Examples Show how other customers have benefited from the upgrade. A case study, testimonial, or statistic can make the value more relatable and convincing. 4. Use Visual Comparisons Visual comparisons are a powerful upselling strategy to help customers understand the value of upgrading to a higher-tier product or service. By presenting options side by side, you make it clear why the upsell is worth the extra cost. How to Use Visual Comparisons in Upselling: Feature Comparison Tables Create tables that compare basic and premium options, highlighting key differences. Example: | Feature | Basic Plan | Premium Plan | | --- | --- | --- | | Storage | 5 GB | 50 GB | | Customer Support | Standard Email | 24/7 Priority Chat | | Price | $9.99/month | $19.99/month | Visual Price Comparisons Show how a slightly higher price can save money or provide more value over time. Example: “Pay $30 more upfront and get double the features!” Side-by-Side Product Images Display images of both options for physical goods, emphasizing what the upgrade offers. Example: A basic phone with standard features versus a premium phone with an enhanced camera and extra battery life. Why Visual Comparisons Work for Upselling Visual tools make decision-making faster and more intuitive. Customers can immediately see what they’re missing by not upgrading, making the upsell offer more compelling. By focusing on benefits and clarity, you reduce hesitation and increase conversions. Pro Tips for Using Visual Comparisons in Upselling Place your comparison charts or visuals near critical decision points, such as the product page or checkout. Keep the design simple and intuitive—too much information can overwhelm customers. Continuously test your visuals to optimize performance and maximize your upselling success. 5. Improve Your Timing The timing of your upselling offer is critical to its success. When done right, upselling enhances the customer experience and increases revenue. A poorly timed upsell, however, can feel pushy and lead to lost sales. Here’s how to make timing work for your upselling strategy. Introduce Upsells During Checkout Offer customers an enhanced version of their chosen product or a premium upgrade while they finalize their purchase. Use targeted language, such as “Complete your order with our exclusive premium plan upgrade—only $10 more!” Present Post-Purchase Upselling Offers Suggest related products or services after completing the transaction. Send an email with a personalized message: “Enhance your recent purchase with a matching accessory—offer valid for 48 hours.” 6. Checkout-Specific Offers The checkout is a perfect opportunity to upsell because customers are already in buying mode. Offering an upsell at checkout, you catch them at the moment of commitment. Example, if a customer is buying a mid-tier plan, suggest to upgrade to a higher tier plan with more features at a discounted rate for immediate upgrade. These offers can be presented as limited time offers to create urgency. Add phrases like “Exclusive deal—upgrade now and save 20%!” to make customers act fast. Visual elements like a comparison chart showing the added value of the upsell product or service will make the decision easier for the customer. Build trust & FOMO Highlight real-time activities like reviews, sales & sign-ups. Add to My Website NowTry for free (No card required) Best Cross-Selling Strategies 7. Recommend Items After the Purchase Recommending items after someone has made a purchase is a great way to keep the shopping experience going and offer extra value. After buying something, customers are often still thinking about how to make the most of their purchase, so this is the perfect time to suggest related items they might find useful. For instance, if someone buys a camera, you could recommend accessories like a protective case, extra memory cards, or a tripod. These are things they might need anyway, and suggesting them saves them time searching. Make the recommendations feel personal by tying them to what the customer already bought, like saying, “Protect your new camera with this highly-rated carrying case.” 8. Create Themes or Sets One of the most effective ways to implement cross-selling is by curating themes or sets that combine products or services into cohesive packages. This approach makes it easier for customers to see the value in purchasing complementary items together. Customers are drawn to ready-made solutions that eliminate the guesswork of finding complementary items. Bundles give the impression of a better deal, even if there’s no discount applied. Themed sets evoke emotions, making purchases feel purposeful and exciting. 9. Make It Easy to Add Items When cross-selling, the simpler the process, the more likely customers will accept your offer. Complicated steps or unclear navigation can deter even the most interested buyers. Here’s how to streamline the process: Use One-Click Additions Quick actions reduce friction and keep customers focused on completing their purchases. How to Implement: Add a “+ Add to Cart” button next to cross-sell suggestions. Use drop-down menus or checkboxes for easy selection. Example: “Add a matching charger for $10—just one click away!” 10. Use Location-Based Cross-Selling Location-based cross-selling is a smart way to connect with your customers by offering suggestions that make sense for where they are. It’s about understanding what people in a specific area might need or want and tailoring your recommendations to match. This approach feels personal and helpful, which makes customers more likely to say yes. Use Location Data to Personalize Offers Use simple tools like GPS or zip codes to make your suggestions feel more relevant. Example: If someone orders takeout in a beach town, suggest popular seafood dishes or local drinks that go well with their meal. Use Location-Based Notifications Send suggestions to customers based on where they are. Example: If a customer is near your store, notify them of a discount on an accessory that pairs with something they’ve already purchased. 11.

I'm the founder of ListingToFreedom.com where I teach people just like you how to make money flipping used items on online platforms like eBay, Mercari, and Poshmark. 1 comments if you're trying to manage selling across multiple platforms trying to juggle all of your listings then this video is for you I'm going to be diving into what I believe to be the very best cross-listing tool for resellers in 2025 hey there my name is Lee Meyer I'm the founder of listing the freedom and the empowered reseller.com and I'm on a mission to help 1,000 resellers make $100,000 in the next 12 months if you're new here welcome to the channel my name is Lee Meer and I've made well over $100,000 flipping used Goods on sites like eBay Poshmark and merari and a big piece of My Success has been selling across multiple platforms with the help of a cross Lister now when I first started reselling there were not any cross listing tools on the market no help available you had to manually go and crosspost your items to multiple platforms if you wanted to be able to sell in multiple places it just was not feasible but shortly after after I got started with reselling cross-listing tools started coming on the market and there's several out there you might be looking into and in this video I'm going to share with you why I chose the one that I did and why I continue to believe that it is the best choice for resellers now the cross listing tool and app that I use and recommend is called vendue down here in the description below this video you'll find a link that will get you 25% off of your first month you're also able to get a free trial where you get five free listings each and every month to be able to try it out for yourself and see if it is right for you again you'll find a link down here with an affiliate code this is at no additional cost to you and helps me keep this channel running and helps me to be able to bring you more amazing reseller content and I'm going to let you in on a little secret if you're watching this video in the month of January 2025 you can actually get 40% off of your first month using the link below as well as the coupon code thrive in 25 now there are three broad reasons why I believe this to be the best cross Lister but I'm going to be also getting into specifics in this video first up this platform has updated features and integrates with all major reselling platforms secondly it has an easy to use interface as well as a responsive customer service and thirdly it's being Contin updated to stay ahead of Industry Trends and real quick before we get into the specifics let me explain what cross listing is and what a cross-listing tool can help you do cross-listing just means that you are listing your items out to multiple platforms and having a cross-listing tool means that you don't have to do it manually if you were to manually cross list which you can certainly do you're essentially going to be copying and pasting that same listing over and over again to the different marketplaces that you want to be selling on a cross listing tool can save you tons of time because it can give you one place to be able to create your listing and have that broadcast out to multiple platforms and it also gives you a way for those listings to actually be connected so that if it sells on one platform it's going to get delisted across those other platforms so that you don't end up with duplicate sales and a cross-listing tool is really all about saving you time so I spoiled things a little bit there but let's go ahead and jump on into the seven reasons why I believe that vendue is the best tool for you to be using in 2025 number one since I just touched on is that Auto Sales detect feature this is a GameChanger because it allows you to be able to go about your day without having to worry about ending up with duplicate sales vendue will actually take care of this for you in the back end where you don't have to be at your computer or on your phone constantly checking on your sales and then going in and delisting so what the auto sales detect feature will do you do need to actually have this toggle turned on for it to work but when you have that turned on what it's going to do is it's going to detect any sales that happen in real time and as soon as a sale comes in let's say you have a sale come in on merari and you have that item listed to depop eBay and Poshmark what vendu is actually going to do is remove those listings from those other platforms so that you don't end up with duplicate sales number two with the user interface you can actually get your items listed out to multiple Platforms in just a few clicks you'll create your listing right inside of vendue and then it takes just a couple of clicks to get it listed over to eBay couple clicks to get it listed to merari couple clicks to get it listed to Poshmark whatever platforms that you want to be selling on all of that information is going to be pulled into those specific platforms is going to take just a couple of things like maybe entering size maybe entering shipping and then you'll click to get that item listed and from experience this is infinitely faster than trying to manually do this yourself number three is Inventory management capabilities if you are not using a cross Lister and trying to sell in multiple places it's going to be very difficult to manage your inventory and track your sales coming in vendue gives you one place but it also gives you a way to be able to manage that inventory through things like tags that are specific to to the vendue platform there are also all other kinds of capabilities such as being able to sort and different filters that you can apply to be able to manage your inventory and speaking of sorting you can actually sort your items by how stale they are and that brings me to number four which vendue has the capability to actually delist and relist your sale items for you you're going to Simply sort your items by how stale they are you're going to select which items that you want to D list and relist and you're going to click for vendue to go ahead and complete this for you what this is going to do is it's actually going to remove your listings from the platforms where you want it removed from and then it's going to relist them as fresh brand new items and this is going to boost your sales because it's going to push your listings to the top of search results so that they actually get seen and sold and this is just one of the reasons why I believe vendue to be the best for 2025 because it is so much more more than just a cross listing tool number five vendue actually gives you the capability to have one place to send out offers from if you've tried to sell items across multiple places before it can be a nightmare pulling hair of trying to go to each and every platform manage your inventory along with sending out offers vendue gives you one place to be able to go to and actually get your offers sent out from just that one platform without having to log in to multiple places and this is just another example of how vendue not only saves you time but helps you make more sales number six is having custom templates you can actually go in and set these templates up I recommend setting templates up for each and every category that you're going to be listing into frequently and what these templates do is allow you to drastically speed up the listing process because it's going to prefill that information into all of your listing for you and this is a huge timesaver for you and number seven is the analytics dashboard this is the place where you can access all of your data so you can make informed decisions about your business I hope you found this video helpful and then it shows you just how easy it is to be able to sell across multiple platforms get more eyes on your items and make more sales if you tried vendue before or if you're looking to level up your reselling game let me know in the comments below and don't forget about that link down there to get you 25% off of your first month with vendue and if you're needing more help with getting started with vendue I will leave a link up here with the playlist that will walk you through step byep how to use bendu thanks for watching and I'll see you soon [Music] [Music]",

Hamel / September 28, 2023 E-commerce trends show that Q4 is the most wonderful time of the year for e-commerce. Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the holiday season are the perfect time to focus on maximizing sales. Everyone is shopping for everything on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but the focus is generally holiday shopping. Be sure to prioritize your NWT (new with tags) inventory that can be gifted. Here is how to make the most out of Black Friday by hosting sales and promotions. How to Host a Black Friday Sale Here is your ultimate guide to hosting a Black Friday or Cyber Monday Reseller Sale on Poshmark, eBay, Depop, Etsy, and more! 1. Name The Sale First, you will need to determine which type of sale you’re going to host. While your options vary by marketplace tools, you might also choose to create your own sale via messaging or advertisement. Generally, simpler is better. If your sale is too confusing, buyers will not understand. Here are a few different types of Black Friday sales I’ve hosted over the years: 50% Off Everything. This is self-explanatory. It is a blanket discount on everything you have for sale. You can choose any percentage, but the higher it is, the more enticing it will be. BOGO: Buy One, Get One This is another very popular sale! Sellers often do “buy one, get one free” (equal or lesser value), or “buy one, get one half off.” These sales are great because they require the purchase of more than one item to participate. $10 Sale! Variations of this sale are simple: You slash the price of qualifying items, and you can advertise that you have “hundreds of items marked at $10 while supplies last” 💡Tip: Make sure you can honor your sale. Be sure you don’t have special items or consignment items you cannot make eligible for these promotions. You can always raise the price before the sale. 2. Advertise Your Sale A good sale takes some careful planning and advertising. If you’re not yet on social media for your reselling business, here is your sign to create accounts today. Social media is amongst the most effective ways to advertise, using paid advertisement and just posting about your sale and showing your items! 💡Tip: Have you considered paid advertising on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and more? Most allow you to establish demographic goals and set a budget. This can be very effective for driving traffic to your stores. If you’re willing to familiarize yourself, Google Ads is also a valuable tool for paid advertising across the internet! Of course, there are also in-app tools and promotions. See below some things you can do on different marketplaces to notify shoppers of your sales! 💡Tip: Feel free to screenshot and use these graphics for your sale! They’re generic, so you can always add some text! You can also create and customize your own for free on Canva. How to Host a Black Friday Sale on eBay, Poshmark, Etsy, and more! Here is the step-by-step to hosting sales, promoting your items, and using the marketplace tools to promote sales on Black Friday! How to Run a Black Friday Sale on Poshmark Poshmark is booming during the holiday season. Here is how to host a sale on Poshmark! Note that there is no official “sale” tool or feature on Poshmark. However, there are many Poshmark tools and features that you can use to strategically host a sale. 💡Tip: The new Poshmark Promoted Closet feature is a great way to promote your closet. You might choose to allocate a decent budget between Black Friday and Cyber Monday to get the most eyes on your listings Whichever type of sale you choose, here are the ways to promote it and inform potential buyers. Make Bulk Offers to Likers (OTL) Making bulk offers to likers is probably the simplest way to offer a discount to those who have already expressed interest in your items. You can make individual offers on each item, or use Poshmark’s Bulk Actions (or a tool like PosherVA) to make bulk offers. The bigger the offer, the more chance of sales. 💰 💡Tip: Don’t forget to comment in bundles to encourage multi-item sales! Create a Closet Sale Sign on Poshmark You can create a closet sale sign by creating a listing, the way you would for any other item. You’ll use graphic images to promote your sales, and explain it in the description. You will want to select the “brand” for this listing to expand your reach; perhaps select one similar to the types of items you sell. You can use graphics like the ones above for the listing photos, and be sure to share the listing as often as possible! Use the My Shoppers Tool on Poshmark The My Shoppers tool enables sellers to interact with buyers in bulk. With the feature, you can do things like add likes to bundles, add bundle comments, and message former buyers. Thus, you can send a message to a mass number of users who have interacted with your closet to promote a sale or deal! Here is an example: Any combination of the ideas above can be used to run a sale on Poshmark. For more information, Check out this video about How To Host a Successful Sale on Poshmark. How to Host a Black Friday Sale on Mercari Frankly, you can’t. There is no sale or promotional feature on Mercari. There also aren’t too many tools on Mercari to use as work-arounds… That said, you can do a few things that might increase your chances of making sale. 💡Tip: Don’t forget to also create a Mercari Shop sale sign! Promote Your Listings on Mercari To promote your listings, go to your profile, tap Selling, and select “Promote.” You’ll be prompted to select whether you want to promote your listing to everyone or just send an Offer to Likers. Promoting your listings requires that you drop the price, boost them in the Mercari search feed results, and notify all likers about the price decrease. Making Offers to Likers (OTL) on Mercari requires that you make an offer of at least 10% off, and the platform then sends this special offer to all likers. Check out this chart to see how to promote your Mercari listings to make more sales. Image courtesy of the Mercari Help Center. Message Potential Buyers You might consider what I call “Buyer Outreach_.”_ This includes browsing your Mercari inbox, and reaching out to the buyers who have ghosted you after initial inquiry, to say something like: “Hey! Are you still interested in this item? I’m running a 50% off sale today for Black Friday! Feel free to make the offer, and I’ll accept.” Note that this method is a little spammy; use it sparingly. While there is no official way to run a sale, discount, or promotion on your entire Mercari shop, the steps above are the best ways to run an unofficial sale. How to Run a Black Friday Sale on eBay eBay provides sellers with so many tools, including promotions, offers to watchers, bulk price adjustments, coupons, and official tools for discounting store items with a sale event. Note that some of these features require that you have an eBay store. Tools to Make More Sales on eBay First, you can send offers to watchers from your eBay seller hub.

Hamel / September 28, 2023 E-commerce trends show that Q4 is the most wonderful time of the year for e-commerce. Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the holiday season are the perfect time to focus on maximizing sales. Everyone is shopping for everything on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but the focus is generally holiday shopping. Be sure to prioritize your NWT (new with tags) inventory that can be gifted. Here is how to make the most out of Black Friday by hosting sales and promotions. How to Host a Black Friday Sale Here is your ultimate guide to hosting a Black Friday or Cyber Monday Reseller Sale on Poshmark, eBay, Depop, Etsy, and more! 1. Name The Sale First, you will need to determine which type of sale you’re going to host. While your options vary by marketplace tools, you might also choose to create your own sale via messaging or advertisement. Generally, simpler is better. If your sale is too confusing, buyers will not understand. Here are a few different types of Black Friday sales I’ve hosted over the years: 50% Off Everything. This is self-explanatory. It is a blanket discount on everything you have for sale. You can choose any percentage, but the higher it is, the more enticing it will be. BOGO: Buy One, Get One This is another very popular sale! Sellers often do “buy one, get one free” (equal or lesser value), or “buy one, get one half off.” These sales are great because they require the purchase of more than one item to participate. $10 Sale! Variations of this sale are simple: You slash the price of qualifying items, and you can advertise that you have “hundreds of items marked at $10 while supplies last” 💡Tip: Make sure you can honor your sale. Be sure you don’t have special items or consignment items you cannot make eligible for these promotions. You can always raise the price before the sale. 2. Advertise Your Sale A good sale takes some careful planning and advertising. If you’re not yet on social media for your reselling business, here is your sign to create accounts today. Social media is amongst the most effective ways to advertise, using paid advertisement and just posting about your sale and showing your items! 💡Tip: Have you considered paid advertising on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and more? Most allow you to establish demographic goals and set a budget. This can be very effective for driving traffic to your stores. If you’re willing to familiarize yourself, Google Ads is also a valuable tool for paid advertising across the internet! Of course, there are also in-app tools and promotions. See below some things you can do on different marketplaces to notify shoppers of your sales! 💡Tip: Feel free to screenshot and use these graphics for your sale! They’re generic, so you can always add some text! You can also create and customize your own for free on Canva. How to Host a Black Friday Sale on eBay, Poshmark, Etsy, and more! Here is the step-by-step to hosting sales, promoting your items, and using the marketplace tools to promote sales on Black Friday! How to Run a Black Friday Sale on Poshmark Poshmark is booming during the holiday season. Here is how to host a sale on Poshmark! Note that there is no official “sale” tool or feature on Poshmark. However, there are many Poshmark tools and features that you can use to strategically host a sale. 💡Tip: The new Poshmark Promoted Closet feature is a great way to promote your closet. You might choose to allocate a decent budget between Black Friday and Cyber Monday to get the most eyes on your listings Whichever type of sale you choose, here are the ways to promote it and inform potential buyers. Make Bulk Offers to Likers (OTL) Making bulk offers to likers is probably the simplest way to offer a discount to those who have already expressed interest in your items. You can make individual offers on each item, or use Poshmark’s Bulk Actions (or a tool like PosherVA) to make bulk offers. The bigger the offer, the more chance of sales. 💰 💡Tip: Don’t forget to comment in bundles to encourage multi-item sales! Create a Closet Sale Sign on Poshmark You can create a closet sale sign by creating a listing, the way you would for any other item. You’ll use graphic images to promote your sales, and explain it in the description. You will want to select the “brand” for this listing to expand your reach; perhaps select one similar to the types of items you sell. You can use graphics like the ones above for the listing photos, and be sure to share the listing as often as possible! Use the My Shoppers Tool on Poshmark The My Shoppers tool enables sellers to interact with buyers in bulk. With the feature, you can do things like add likes to bundles, add bundle comments, and message former buyers. Thus, you can send a message to a mass number of users who have interacted with your closet to promote a sale or deal! Here is an example: Any combination of the ideas above can be used to run a sale on Poshmark. For more information, Check out this video about How To Host a Successful Sale on Poshmark. How to Host a Black Friday Sale on Mercari Frankly, you can’t. There is no sale or promotional feature on Mercari. There also aren’t too many tools on Mercari to use as work-arounds… That said, you can do a few things that might increase your chances of making sale. 💡Tip: Don’t forget to also create a Mercari Shop sale sign! Promote Your Listings on Mercari To promote your listings, go to your profile, tap Selling, and select “Promote.” You’ll be prompted to select whether you want to promote your listing to everyone or just send an Offer to Likers. Promoting your listings requires that you drop the price, boost them in the Mercari search feed results, and notify all likers about the price decrease. Making Offers to Likers (OTL) on Mercari requires that you make an offer of at least 10% off, and the platform then sends this special offer to all likers. Check out this chart to see how to promote your Mercari listings to make more sales. Image courtesy of the Mercari Help Center. Message Potential Buyers You might consider what I call “Buyer Outreach_.”_ This includes browsing your Mercari inbox, and reaching out to the buyers who have ghosted you after initial inquiry, to say something like: “Hey! Are you still interested in this item? I’m running a 50% off sale today for Black Friday! Feel free to make the offer, and I’ll accept.” Note that this method is a little spammy; use it sparingly. While there is no official way to run a sale, discount, or promotion on your entire Mercari shop, the steps above are the best ways to run an unofficial sale. How to Run a Black Friday Sale on eBay eBay provides sellers with so many tools, including promotions, offers to watchers, bulk price adjustments, coupons, and official tools for discounting store items with a sale event. Note that some of these features require that you have an eBay store. Tools to Make More Sales on eBay First, you can send offers to watchers from your eBay seller hub. You can also promote your items in various ways, through paid promotional tools (and you only pay the promotion fee when your item sells as a direct result of the promotion).

With millions of products, fierce competition, and the intricacies of digital marketing, it’s crucial to have a strong strategy in place.
