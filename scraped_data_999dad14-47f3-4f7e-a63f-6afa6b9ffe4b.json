Yet, it lacks clarity about the actual benefits and unique features of the service beyond the initial list count promise. The design is clean but monotonous; the color scheme could use more contrast to guide attention effectively. The CTA placements do stand out, but the effectiveness of their wording could be improved to drive action. Information is logically organized but lacks detailed differentiation, making it feel somewhat repetitive between sections. The social proof, such as \"Join 100+ founders,\" needs a bit more trust-building power with additional proof or testimonials. Main Recommendations: Enhance the value proposition by clearly stating unique features or results that set it apart. Increase visual contrast to better direct user focus and create more engaging visuals. Revise CTAs with more action-oriented and specific language to increase click-through rates.",

Report this article Pascal Unger Pascal Unger Managing Partner @ focal || We lead Pre-Seed rounds Published Mar 2, 2023 + Follow Last week, I argued against bringing on advisors for early startup to focus on angels instead. If you still want to add them, then read today's newsletter. It discusses when to consider them and how to best go about it. In last week’s post, I argued that startups should (early on) focus their time and energy on bringing on the right angels vs decorated individuals as advisors. I got a bunch of replies stating that there is a case to be made for advisors too. Which I agree with in certain instances. Thus, here’s my high level thinking on the when and how of bringing on advisors at the start of your startup journey: In my last post, I argued that most potential advisors can afford to put in (even a small) angel check into your (pre-) seed round. This aligns incentives much better, increases the likelihood of them putting in hard work on your behalf and is a much stronger signal towards the (VC and hiring) market. However, sometimes individuals cannot put in a check. Everyone’s personal situation is different after all - whether it be from a liquidity, employment agreement, etc perspective. If you have a high level of conviction that this individual’s involvement in your startup is of high value (even if they cannot invest), then make sure to ask the following question: “What can they help me do faster or better in the next 6 months?” You need to have a clear and specific answer to this question plus a tangible way of measuring the impact they have over the next six months. Otherwise, the individual likely isn't a good fit for an advisory role at your startup at this point in time, no matter how decorated their resume is. Recommended by LinkedIn Of Simple Milestones and Revved-Up Starts RevUp Consulting 7 months ago Navigating the Turbulent Waters of Growth-Stage… Growjunction 9 months ago 9 BARRIERS TO OVERCOME ON THE WAY FROM A START-UP TO… UAB BitFlow 2 years ago As argued in last week’s post, a lot can change in a few months in early stage startup land (smaller and larger pivots happen often). Thus, bringing on advisors that may eventually become relevant means chances are high they’ll never actually become relevant. Which is a waste of your time and company equity. If you do have a clear answer to the question above, then do the following: Tie their comp to the measurable and tangible value add they’re supposed to bring. For example, an advisor who is supposed to get you more sales leads could have 100% of their comp be performance-based. Stay between 0.1% and 0.5% equity comp, depending on their impact. Going up to 1.0% is only warranted in outlier cases. Use the value add of a full time employee (minus a discount for salary) as a benchmark for what their comp should be, based on the impact they should have. Tie them to a (minimum) 2-year vesting schedule with a (minimum) 6-month cliff When negotiating all of the above, keep in mind that the best results happen when incentives between the best and most motivated people are aligned. That should be your #1 goal. For advisory board agreement templates and additional guidelines, take a look at: The FAST (Founder / Advisor Standard Template) agreement by Founder Institute or This advisor agreement by Founder Space And of course don’t forget to consult with your legal counsel before signing anything! Last but not least, a small side note re advisors when pitching: Team pages of pre-seed / seed pitches are here to showcase the team and their (domain) expertise. However, more often than not, we see advisors take up a lot of “real estate” on team pages. With it, there’s little room left to showcase the founders / key team members. Rather, as a rule of thumb, if you have advisors (and angels) involved - “real estate” on the team page should be roughly in line with ownership in your business. pascal's notes pascal's notes 1,035 follower + Subscribe Like Like Celebrate Support Love Insightful Funny Comment Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Share 13 1 Comment Pascal UngerManaging Partner @ focal || We lead Pre-Seed rounds 1y Report this comment Sign up to the newsletter directly on Substack to receive it in your inbox weekly, alongside > 1,000 other startup founders and operators: https://knowledgetraction.substack.com/ LikeReply2 Reactions 3 Reactions To view or add a comment, sign in More articles by Pascal Unger Decision-making in early-stage investing Feb 18, 2025 Decision-making in early-stage investing As a strong believer in frameworks for better decision making, I spent the past weekend diving (back) into… 7 4 Comments How to win in this \"AI-native\" era of software Feb 10, 2025 How to win in this \"AI-native\" era of software I had published this article on my Substack about 10 days ago It took a weekend like the one we just lived through for… 6 What it takes to raise in 2023 Oct 19, 2023 What it takes to raise in 2023 I study Point Nine 's annual SaaS funding napkins every year as they are a good reference point re how to think about… 26 3 Comments The relationship between risk and return Sep 21, 2023 The relationship between risk and return I read Howard Marks' memos religiously.

You’ve come to the right place. Join us as we look at the top 10 platforms and tools for startups you should be using in the year ahead. If you have an eCommerce business, you need all the help you can get to grow. This is especially true if you don’t have a big budget, or a team of staff to support you. With this in mind, we’ve put together a guide to our top ten eCommerce platforms and top ten eCommerce tools. The current list is an addition to our Workbench for a startup The top 10 startup platforms and tools to use this year The right eCommerce platform can make or break your startup. There is a wide range of eCommerce platforms out there with many different features. Here are our top ten eCommerce sites and how they could benefit your business. Shopify; Wix; Squarespace; Adobe Commerce (powered by Magento); BigCommerce; WooCommerce; Weebly; Prestashop; Volution; WordPress. 1. Shopify Shopify is one of the most well-known and loved eCommerce platforms in the world. Startups of all shapes and sizes are fans because it’s easy to use and makes customizing an online store as easy as possible. One of the things we like the most about Shopify is that it lets you import products from other eCommerce platforms. This means if you used another eCommerce platform for your startup, but things didn’t work out, you don’t have to create your products again. Prices range from $29 to $299 a month, with a free 14-day trial. 2. Wix Similar to Shopify, Wix is another eCommerce platform that is simple to use and easy to set up. A lot of the customization is done through drag and drop, meaning that no coding knowledge is needed. Another advantage Wix has is that you can set up marketing automation. This means you can send shoppers a friendly reminder if they add an item to their cart but don’t buy it, helping to boost your conversion rates. Prices for Wix’s eCommerce plan range from $18 to $30 a month. 3. Squarespace Squarespace has become extremely popular with startups in recent years, thanks to its excellent customer support, stunning templates, and ease of use. One of the advantages Squarespace has over other eCommerce platforms is the ability to manage inventory. You can amend stock levels, get alerts when a product is running low, and even set up waiting lists to let shoppers know when a sold-out item is back in stock. Prices for Squarespace’s eCommerce plan range from $28 to $41 a month. 4. Adobe Commerce (powered by Magento) Formerly known as Magento, you need web development skills to make the most out of Adobe Commerce. However, if you have them, it is one of the most scalable and flexible eCommerce platforms around. Adobe Commerce has a lot of features you can use to make your eCommerce site stand out, including reward points, gift registries, and the option to promote product bundles. Users also comment that it is particularly good for SEO, increasing the odds of getting to the first page of the search engine results. Pricing is available on request. 5. BigCommerce One of the great things about BigCommerce is the scalability it provides. This means that you can start using it as a small eCommerce business, and the platform will grow and evolve as you do. It also looks great and is fully responsive on a smartphone, something which is very important to shoppers considering one out of every two purchases is now made on a mobile device. Prices range from $29.95 to $299.95 a month, with a free 15-day trial. 6. WooCommerce Another one of the major players in the eCommerce platform market, WooCommerce has a lot of rich features that will easily adapt to your startup, no matter which industry you are in. Unlike the other platforms on this list, WooCommerce is slightly different as it is built into WordPress, meaning you can easily incorporate it into your existing WP site. WooCommerce is free to use, but you can pay for additional features. 7. Weebly Weebly is one of the most cost-effective options on this list, making it a good option for startups on a smaller budget. However, just because it is cheaper, doesn’t mean it lacks functionality. The eCommerce platform is well-known for having lots of attractive template designs to choose from, as well as the ability to send emails from within the platform. The basic option is free, with prices increasing to $25 a month. 8. Prestashop Like Weebly, Prestashop is another one of the cheaper options available, but this certainly shouldn’t take it out of the running for your business! The platform itself is completely free; you just pay for any premium themes and modules you would like to use on your website. This means you can completely customize your site to look and behave exactly how you want. 9. Volusion Volusion is best known for its excellent customer service. This means that if you need a little extra support getting your new eCommerce site up and running, this eCommerce platform has you covered. Another advantage of this platform is its ease of use, making it simple to add new product descriptions and images. Prices range from $29 to $299 a month, with a free 14-day trial. 10. WordPress While WordPress isn’t an eCommerce site builder as such, it does have a lot of plugins (like WooCommerce) you can use to integrate shopping onto your website. If you’re already used to building sites in WordPress (and bear in mind that about one in three sites is built on the WP platform), this can be a huge advantage. WordPress is free to use, but you may have to purchase some eCommerce plugins. The top ten tools for startups in 2022 Once you have your eCommerce platform sorted, you will want to find some great tools to use alongside it. Here are our top ten eCommerce tools which will add extra functionality to your business. Google Analytics; Slack; Mockplus; Optimizely; Veeqo; Smile.io; Buffer; Oberlo; Unbxd; Mailchimp. 1. Google Analytics No eCommerce platform is complete without Google Analytics. Free to use and easy to install, this tool will help you see which pages web users are visiting, what products people are buying and how shoppers are searching on your site. 2. Slack Whether you have a team working from home, or a collection of freelancers and consultants you need to keep in contact with, Slack makes it easy to stay connected. It also comes with a mobile app so you can send messages and hold meetings while you’re on the go. Slack is free to use, but you can pay between $7.15 and $13.28 a month for additional functionality, including unlimited message storage. 3. Mockplus When you’re designing your eCommerce site, a wireframe design is a fantastic way to determine what needs to go where on your pages. Mockplus makes it simple to put together a prototype of your website that you can use when creating your site or, alternatively, give to your web developer. Prices range from $199 to $9999 a year. If you prefer, you can buy a license to use the software as long as you like. 4. Optimizely A/B testing is a valuable way of seeing what works on your eCommerce site and what needs improving. You have two pages, each with one key difference and then see which one members of the public respond to the best. With the Optimizely tool, you can create two landing pages or product pages and test each one to see which results in the most conversions. Pricing is available on request. 5. Veeqo If your eCommerce platform of choice doesn’t come with inventory management as an option, you will need a way to ensure that you don’t sell out. Veeqo pulls inventory from all your selling channels (including brick-and-mortar stores if you have them) in real time, meaning you can ensure your stock levels are as accurate as possible. Prices range from $164 to $273 a month, with a free trial. 6. Smile.io Formerly known as Sweet Tooth, Smile.io offers rewards programs for your startup, meaning you can offer gifts and prizes to your best customers. You can integrate Smile.io into your eCommerce platform of choice, no matter the size of your online store or the products you sell. Building brand loyalty is especially important in the early days of a startup. With tools like Smile.io, you can foster engagement and encourage people to advocate for your business. Prices range from $49 to $599 a month. There is also a free plan with limited features. 7. Buffer When you launch your eCommerce site, you will need some social media channels to show off your latest products and entice prospective customers to make a purchase. A social media scheduling tool like Buffer can help you plan your social media campaigns. You can also schedule messages to go out at any time of the day – perfect if your startup targets an international audience. Buffer has a free scheduling plan where you can schedule 10 messages at a time on three different social media platforms. Alternatively, you can pay $5 a month per social media platform and receive unlimited scheduling. 8. Oberlo Dropshipping is not without its challenges. You want to make sure you are getting your products at the right price as well as make sure they are sent to your customers in good time. As a result, Oberlo has explicitly been designed for businesses that sell drop shipped products. This tool allows startups to import dropshipped products into their eCommerce store and track them as they are being delivered to customers. There is a free version with limited features, or you can pay $29.90 a month for additional functionality. 9. Unbxd When you have created your eCommerce site, it’s essential to make sure your products are as easy to find as possible. You could have the best-looking site and the most affordable prices, but if your customer can’t find what they need, you’re wasting your money. If you haven’t got the resources to optimize your online store yourself, Unbxd uses artificial intelligence (AI) to audit your eCommerce site for you. The tool will provide lots of recommendations to give your store an extra boost and increase conversion rates. Prices range from $99 to $1999 a month. 10. Mailchimp Some of the eCommerce platforms above come with inbuilt mailing list systems. However, if your eCommerce site doesn’t have that functionality, Mailchimp can manage the process for you. One of the easiest-to-use and cost-effective mailing list tools on the market, Mailchimp lets you build mailing lists using a popup on your site. You can also create automated emails to encourage customers to continue their shopping or let them know when new products are in stock. Mailchimp offers a free version where you can store up to 2,000 contacts. The paid-for version starts from $9.99 a month. In summary: which tools are the right ones for your startup? In this article, we’ve gone through the top ten eCommerce platforms as well as the top ten tools for startups. There are a lot of different tools and platforms out there.

You’ve come to the right place. Join us as we look at the top 10 platforms and tools for startups you should be using in the year ahead. If you have an eCommerce business, you need all the help you can get to grow. This is especially true if you don’t have a big budget, or a team of staff to support you. With this in mind, we’ve put together a guide to our top ten eCommerce platforms and top ten eCommerce tools. The current list is an addition to our Workbench for a startup The top 10 startup platforms and tools to use this year The right eCommerce platform can make or break your startup. There is a wide range of eCommerce platforms out there with many different features. Here are our top ten eCommerce sites and how they could benefit your business. Shopify; Wix; Squarespace; Adobe Commerce (powered by Magento); BigCommerce; WooCommerce; Weebly; Prestashop; Volution; WordPress. 1. Shopify Shopify is one of the most well-known and loved eCommerce platforms in the world. Startups of all shapes and sizes are fans because it’s easy to use and makes customizing an online store as easy as possible. One of the things we like the most about Shopify is that it lets you import products from other eCommerce platforms. This means if you used another eCommerce platform for your startup, but things didn’t work out, you don’t have to create your products again. Prices range from $29 to $299 a month, with a free 14-day trial. 2. Wix Similar to Shopify, Wix is another eCommerce platform that is simple to use and easy to set up. A lot of the customization is done through drag and drop, meaning that no coding knowledge is needed. Another advantage Wix has is that you can set up marketing automation. This means you can send shoppers a friendly reminder if they add an item to their cart but don’t buy it, helping to boost your conversion rates. Prices for Wix’s eCommerce plan range from $18 to $30 a month. 3. Squarespace Squarespace has become extremely popular with startups in recent years, thanks to its excellent customer support, stunning templates, and ease of use. One of the advantages Squarespace has over other eCommerce platforms is the ability to manage inventory. You can amend stock levels, get alerts when a product is running low, and even set up waiting lists to let shoppers know when a sold-out item is back in stock. Prices for Squarespace’s eCommerce plan range from $28 to $41 a month. 4. Adobe Commerce (powered by Magento) Formerly known as Magento, you need web development skills to make the most out of Adobe Commerce. However, if you have them, it is one of the most scalable and flexible eCommerce platforms around. Adobe Commerce has a lot of features you can use to make your eCommerce site stand out, including reward points, gift registries, and the option to promote product bundles. Users also comment that it is particularly good for SEO, increasing the odds of getting to the first page of the search engine results. Pricing is available on request. 5. BigCommerce One of the great things about BigCommerce is the scalability it provides. This means that you can start using it as a small eCommerce business, and the platform will grow and evolve as you do. It also looks great and is fully responsive on a smartphone, something which is very important to shoppers considering one out of every two purchases is now made on a mobile device. Prices range from $29.95 to $299.95 a month, with a free 15-day trial. 6. WooCommerce Another one of the major players in the eCommerce platform market, WooCommerce has a lot of rich features that will easily adapt to your startup, no matter which industry you are in. Unlike the other platforms on this list, WooCommerce is slightly different as it is built into WordPress, meaning you can easily incorporate it into your existing WP site. WooCommerce is free to use, but you can pay for additional features. 7. Weebly Weebly is one of the most cost-effective options on this list, making it a good option for startups on a smaller budget. However, just because it is cheaper, doesn’t mean it lacks functionality. The eCommerce platform is well-known for having lots of attractive template designs to choose from, as well as the ability to send emails from within the platform. The basic option is free, with prices increasing to $25 a month. 8. Prestashop Like Weebly, Prestashop is another one of the cheaper options available, but this certainly shouldn’t take it out of the running for your business! The platform itself is completely free; you just pay for any premium themes and modules you would like to use on your website. This means you can completely customize your site to look and behave exactly how you want. 9. Volusion Volusion is best known for its excellent customer service. This means that if you need a little extra support getting your new eCommerce site up and running, this eCommerce platform has you covered. Another advantage of this platform is its ease of use, making it simple to add new product descriptions and images. Prices range from $29 to $299 a month, with a free 14-day trial. 10. WordPress While WordPress isn’t an eCommerce site builder as such, it does have a lot of plugins (like WooCommerce) you can use to integrate shopping onto your website. If you’re already used to building sites in WordPress (and bear in mind that about one in three sites is built on the WP platform), this can be a huge advantage. WordPress is free to use, but you may have to purchase some eCommerce plugins. The top ten tools for startups in 2022 Once you have your eCommerce platform sorted, you will want to find some great tools to use alongside it. Here are our top ten eCommerce tools which will add extra functionality to your business. Google Analytics; Slack; Mockplus; Optimizely; Veeqo; Smile.io; Buffer; Oberlo; Unbxd; Mailchimp. 1. Google Analytics No eCommerce platform is complete without Google Analytics. Free to use and easy to install, this tool will help you see which pages web users are visiting, what products people are buying and how shoppers are searching on your site. 2. Slack Whether you have a team working from home, or a collection of freelancers and consultants you need to keep in contact with, Slack makes it easy to stay connected. It also comes with a mobile app so you can send messages and hold meetings while you’re on the go. Slack is free to use, but you can pay between $7.15 and $13.28 a month for additional functionality, including unlimited message storage. 3. Mockplus When you’re designing your eCommerce site, a wireframe design is a fantastic way to determine what needs to go where on your pages. Mockplus makes it simple to put together a prototype of your website that you can use when creating your site or, alternatively, give to your web developer. Prices range from $199 to $9999 a year. If you prefer, you can buy a license to use the software as long as you like. 4. Optimizely A/B testing is a valuable way of seeing what works on your eCommerce site and what needs improving. You have two pages, each with one key difference and then see which one members of the public respond to the best. With the Optimizely tool, you can create two landing pages or product pages and test each one to see which results in the most conversions. Pricing is available on request. 5. Veeqo If your eCommerce platform of choice doesn’t come with inventory management as an option, you will need a way to ensure that you don’t sell out. Veeqo pulls inventory from all your selling channels (including brick-and-mortar stores if you have them) in real time, meaning you can ensure your stock levels are as accurate as possible. Prices range from $164 to $273 a month, with a free trial. 6. Smile.io Formerly known as Sweet Tooth, Smile.io offers rewards programs for your startup, meaning you can offer gifts and prizes to your best customers. You can integrate Smile.io into your eCommerce platform of choice, no matter the size of your online store or the products you sell. Building brand loyalty is especially important in the early days of a startup. With tools like Smile.io, you can foster engagement and encourage people to advocate for your business. Prices range from $49 to $599 a month. There is also a free plan with limited features. 7. Buffer When you launch your eCommerce site, you will need some social media channels to show off your latest products and entice prospective customers to make a purchase. A social media scheduling tool like Buffer can help you plan your social media campaigns. You can also schedule messages to go out at any time of the day – perfect if your startup targets an international audience. Buffer has a free scheduling plan where you can schedule 10 messages at a time on three different social media platforms. Alternatively, you can pay $5 a month per social media platform and receive unlimited scheduling. 8. Oberlo Dropshipping is not without its challenges. You want to make sure you are getting your products at the right price as well as make sure they are sent to your customers in good time. As a result, Oberlo has explicitly been designed for businesses that sell drop shipped products. This tool allows startups to import dropshipped products into their eCommerce store and track them as they are being delivered to customers. There is a free version with limited features, or you can pay $29.90 a month for additional functionality. 9. Unbxd When you have created your eCommerce site, it’s essential to make sure your products are as easy to find as possible. You could have the best-looking site and the most affordable prices, but if your customer can’t find what they need, you’re wasting your money. If you haven’t got the resources to optimize your online store yourself, Unbxd uses artificial intelligence (AI) to audit your eCommerce site for you. The tool will provide lots of recommendations to give your store an extra boost and increase conversion rates. Prices range from $99 to $1999 a month. 10. Mailchimp Some of the eCommerce platforms above come with inbuilt mailing list systems. However, if your eCommerce site doesn’t have that functionality, Mailchimp can manage the process for you. One of the easiest-to-use and cost-effective mailing list tools on the market, Mailchimp lets you build mailing lists using a popup on your site. You can also create automated emails to encourage customers to continue their shopping or let them know when new products are in stock. Mailchimp offers a free version where you can store up to 2,000 contacts. The paid-for version starts from $9.99 a month. In summary: which tools are the right ones for your startup?

While some platforms offer free versions, others like Shopify require monthly subscriptions. Consider initial and ongoing expenses, including web development, security, hosting, and maintenance. Some companies, for example, provide transparent pricing with no transaction fees, which can be cost-effective for startups. Flexibility: If you expand, your platform should grow with your business, handling increased traffic and a more extensive product catalog. Some solutions are known for their scalability, supporting growth from small startups to larger enterprises. Alternatively, other platforms allow for extensive customization, accommodating evolving business needs. Ease of Use: Ease of use is essential for startups with limited technical expertise. Some platforms offer user-friendly interfaces with drag-and-drop features, simplifying store setup and management. Customer support options, like 24/7 chat, are also valuable for troubleshooting issues. Omnichannel Capabilities: An effective ecommerce platform should support an omnichannel strategy, providing a consistent experience across multiple channels, such as social media, online stores, and physical locations. SEO and Marketing Tools: Generating traffic is key to sales, so choose a platform with built-in SEO tools and marketing integrations. Some online stores are noted for their SEO-friendly features, while others offer customizable URLs, improving visibility and attracting customers.

Yes, most modern ecommerce platforms support mobile commerce (m-commerce). This is crucial as more consumers shop via smartphones and tablets. A good ecommerce platform should offer mobile-responsive design templates, ensuring that your online store looks and functions well on all devices. Additionally, mobile payment integrations and features like mobile-optimized checkout pages can improve the shopping experience and reduce cart abandonment. How important is customer support when choosing ecommerce platforms for startups? Customer support is very important when choosing an ecommerce platform, especially for startups that may not have in-house technical expertise. Look for platforms that offer 24/7 support, comprehensive documentation, and access to a community or knowledge base. Some platforms also provide onboarding assistance or dedicated account managers for higher-tier plans. Reliable support can help resolve issues quickly and ensure smooth operations for your online store. How can ecommerce platforms for startups help with marketing? Ecommerce platforms often come with built-in marketing tools or integrations with popular third-party services. These tools can help startups create email marketing campaigns, run promotions, and offer discount codes. SEO tools are also commonly included to improve search engine rankings, which is vital for organic traffic growth. Some platforms offer integration with social media platforms, allowing startups to market directly through channels like Instagram and Facebook. Leveraging these tools can help startups attract and retain customers while managing marketing efforts from one central dashboard. Is it possible for ecommerce platforms for startups to switch to another platform? Yes, startups can switch ecommerce platforms later if needed, but it can be a complex process. Migration involves transferring product data, customer information, and order histories to the new platform. Depending on the complexity of your current setup, this can take time and may require technical expertise. Some platforms offer migration services or guides to help with the transition. It’s important to choose a platform that supports easy export/import functions for future flexibility. Is security a concern when using ecommerce platforms for startups? Security is a top concern when using an ecommerce platform. Startups must ensure that their chosen platform complies with industry standards like PCI-DSS for handling payment information. Look for platforms that offer SSL certificates, encryption, and regular security updates to protect customer data. Some platforms also provide fraud detection tools and two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security. What’s Next? The world of ecommerce moves fast—and so do you.

His experience there had taught him the fundamental importance of a solid corporate culture. Thirty years after IBM changed its culture and came to flourish under Gerstner’s leadership, corporate culture remains an essential ingredient in business success. In this article, we’ll look at which elements constitute corporate culture and consider a business culture definition. Then, we’ll explore the 4 main types of company cultures. After that, we’ll dive into the many ways that a solid corporate culture serves your company. What is corporate culture? A corporate culture definition comprises both the mundane and the intangible. It is more than merely identity, industry, or branding. It stems from a company’s common beliefs and values, expressed in its everyday practices. Which elements constitute corporate culture? Here are but a few of them: typical employee behaviors, including interactions with clients and customers management styles and hierarchy (or lack thereof) day-to-day business practices personnel decisions, leave policies, and employee perks elements of workspace organization, such as seating arrangements or dress codes 4 types of company culture for your organization The Competing Values Framework came from extensive academic research into corporate organizational styles. It describes 4 types of corporate culture: hierarchy culture, adhocracy culture, clan culture, and market culture. Source: Page #3 of Dr. Kim Cameron’s report, “An Introduction to the Competing Values Framework.” While your company may use some combination of these culture styles, it’s likely that one of them will dominate. Each type of corporate culture represents different approaches to management and business operations: Type of corporate cultureFocusGrowth patternApproachHierarchyControlIncremental changesDo things rightAdhocracyCreationDramatic breakthroughsDo things firstMarketCompetitionShort-term performanceDo things fastClanCollaborationLong-term developmentDo things together We’ll break down each one of these corporate culture examples, and look at the pros and cons of each type. Hierarchy culture Perhaps the most instantly recognizable, classic example of corporate culture revolves around a hierarchy. It emphasizes the separation of workers from middle management and executives. It delineates the distinctions between departments. Its processes and procedures have been etched in stone, since time immemorial. A stereotypical example of hierarchy culture is a federal government workplace. The antithesis of hierarchy culture is adhocracy culture. Pros: Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined. If business needs remain static, the hierarchy provides a certain efficiency. After all, no one has to spend time re-inventing the proverbial wheel. Cons: The rigidity of hierarchy culture makes re-evaluation, change, and adaptability nearly impossible. It can choke attempts at innovation or “outside-the-box” thinking. Rather than working together cooperatively, different departments can become siloed. This hampers cross-functional collaboration. Adhocracy culture In Latin, ad hoc means something done for a special or specific purpose. It usually refers to a temporary, makeshift solution. This is the essence of an adhocracy. As in agile methodology, adhocracy structure is flexible and adaptable. It can be changed on the fly. As new business or management challenges arise, an adhocracy re-evaluates and re-configures itself in response to evolving needs. Rather than following a conventional chain of command, employees are encouraged to take the most expeditious route to solve a problem. This can mean improvising solutions, bypassing checks and balances, or working directly with C-suite executives to solve workday issues. Pros: Adhocracy culture stresses efficiency over titles and bureaucracy. It is designed to adapt and pivot, as needed. Cons: Compared to a more traditional management hierarchy, the flat organizational structure may be confusing or intimidating. Upper management may focus more on addressing day-to-day operational concerns than big-picture strategizing. Lines of project ownership and accountability can quickly become blurred. Market culture When you think of market culture, picture Gordon Gekko of the movie Wall Street, with his aggressive “greed is good” motto. While market culture isn’t necessarily so cutthroat, it’s definitely focused on profit and achievement above all else. Whether within the broader industry or the confines of the company itself, co-workers compete for recognition. Winning awards and landing “wales” are the markers of success. Pros: High performance is emphasized. Intense competition among colleagues can mean that the company will win big, since everyone is trying to outshine everyone else in the office. Cons: By putting performance over cooperation, a market culture could create an atmosphere of tension and mistrust among colleagues. Workplace ethics might get muddied or outright eschewed. Clan culture No, we’re not talking Clash of Clans here! Rather than spotlighting performance and competition, clan culture centers around building an almost familial atmosphere in the workplace. Clan culture emphasizes corporate values such as cooperation, loyalty, and connection. Coworkers often bond at activities like company picnics and game nights. The company encourages complete employee devotion to the corporate mission, in the workplace and beyond. Management supports the needs of individual staff members through policies like open leave, tuition reimbursement, and other employee perks. Mentorship and job enrichment are common management tools in clan culture to nurture employees in their career growth. Like adhocracy culture, clan culture often relies on a flat organizational structure. In this case, the lack of organizational formality is meant to make workers feel more comfortable when approaching management. Pros: The supportive working environment of clan culture is built on trust and transparency. Employee engagement and satisfaction tend to be high, leading to long-term loyalty. Cons: Clan culture can create an echo chamber in which there is no room for dissenting opinions. This can cause blind spots and reduce innovation. Perceived outsiders might be regarded with mistrust. Over-emphasis on consensus can drag out decision-making. The lack of boundaries and management structure can lead to a breakdown of leadership authority. Why you need to establish a corporate culture in your organization Corporate cultures can be like cities: Some are deliberately planned, and others simply evolve. A nebulous or undefined corporate culture can be a detriment. Before its elements can be modified or improved to meet business challenges, they need to be clearly identified. If this is not done, your company may struggle to remain viable. As tech startup entrepreneur David Cummings declared, “Corporate culture is the only sustainable competitive advantage that is completely within the control of the entrepreneur.” He further advised, “Develop a strong corporate culture first and foremost.” Here are a few key reasons why establishing – or (re-)defining – your corporate culture is essential to long-term business success. To attract top talent High-performing professionals often garner primo job offers. They will likely seek a corporate culture promoting career growth, flexible benefits, and a satisfying work-life balance. In addition, topflight talent tends to expect a culture of respect, where they feel their considerable skills and contributions are valued. To foster employee engagement and productivity The degree of individual investment in the company’s goals and mission can be characterized as employee engagement. Ranging from the active engagement of superstar, high-performing employees to the active disengagement of employees who barely contribute, the level of employee engagement is often driven by company culture. In cultures where employees feel confident and valued – such as clan cultures – their engagement increases. They become more invested and productive. Employees often feel more valued when their companies invest in their futures. This might be through a benefit such as contribution matching for retirement accounts, workplace mentoring, or ongoing corporate training. Regular opportunities for upskilling and reskilling are highly valued by employees as career builders. Corporate language training, in particular, can increase employee engagement and productivity. It also stimulates creativity and improves concentration, which can certainly lead to better productivity in the workplace. To support employee retention Employee engagement is closely related to employee retention. After all, engaged employees usually stick around longer than apathetic ones. There are many benefits of employee retention. Among these are improved customer relationships, increased productivity, and savings on training costs. Ways to support employee retention include: competitive benefits packages flexible working options opportunities for career growth To streamline the decision-making process Management policies that provide clear, value-based guidelines for decision-making can minimize ambiguity and uncertainty. This will ensure that decisions are made efficiently. Such a corporate culture also aligns decisions with the company’s vision and values, while supporting its mission. To increase customer satisfaction While much of corporate culture is focused internally, it’s equally important to consider the needs of customers. Companies can increase customer satisfaction and retention by listening to customers’ concerns, addressing them fairly, and treating them with respect at all times. This will protect your company’s investment in customer acquisition costs and lead to more repeat customers. To improve the company’s reputation A corporate culture communicating values such as honesty, transparency, and fairness will build a positive reputation. It will likely retain existing customers and staff. By building a solid reputation, it can become both a trusted brand and a sought-after employer. Final words The time and effort needed to establish or redefine your corporate culture is one of the most important investments you can make in your company’s future. With careful consideration, you can create a corporate culture that represents your company’s values in the best way possible. You can attract and retain top talent and increase your customer base, all while working toward the fulfilment of your company’s mission.

Management supports the needs of individual staff members through policies like open leave, tuition reimbursement, and other employee perks. Mentorship and job enrichment are common management tools in clan culture to nurture employees in their career growth. Like adhocracy culture, clan culture often relies on a flat organizational structure. In this case, the lack of organizational formality is meant to make workers feel more comfortable when approaching management. Pros: The supportive working environment of clan culture is built on trust and transparency. Employee engagement and satisfaction tend to be high, leading to long-term loyalty. Cons: Clan culture can create an echo chamber in which there is no room for dissenting opinions. This can cause blind spots and reduce innovation. Perceived outsiders might be regarded with mistrust. Over-emphasis on consensus can drag out decision-making. The lack of boundaries and management structure can lead to a breakdown of leadership authority. Why you need to establish a corporate culture in your organization Corporate cultures can be like cities: Some are deliberately planned, and others simply evolve. A nebulous or undefined corporate culture can be a detriment. Before its elements can be modified or improved to meet business challenges, they need to be clearly identified. If this is not done, your company may struggle to remain viable. As tech startup entrepreneur David Cummings declared, “Corporate culture is the only sustainable competitive advantage that is completely within the control of the entrepreneur.” He further advised, “Develop a strong corporate culture first and foremost.” Here are a few key reasons why establishing – or (re-)defining – your corporate culture is essential to long-term business success. To attract top talent High-performing professionals often garner primo job offers. They will likely seek a corporate culture promoting career growth, flexible benefits, and a satisfying work-life balance. In addition, topflight talent tends to expect a culture of respect, where they feel their considerable skills and contributions are valued. To foster employee engagement and productivity The degree of individual investment in the company’s goals and mission can be characterized as employee engagement. Ranging from the active engagement of superstar, high-performing employees to the active disengagement of employees who barely contribute, the level of employee engagement is often driven by company culture. In cultures where employees feel confident and valued – such as clan cultures – their engagement increases. They become more invested and productive. Employees often feel more valued when their companies invest in their futures. This might be through a benefit such as contribution matching for retirement accounts, workplace mentoring, or ongoing corporate training. Regular opportunities for upskilling and reskilling are highly valued by employees as career builders. Corporate language training, in particular, can increase employee engagement and productivity. It also stimulates creativity and improves concentration, which can certainly lead to better productivity in the workplace. To support employee retention Employee engagement is closely related to employee retention. After all, engaged employees usually stick around longer than apathetic ones. There are many benefits of employee retention. Among these are improved customer relationships, increased productivity, and savings on training costs. Ways to support employee retention include: competitive benefits packages flexible working options opportunities for career growth To streamline the decision-making process Management policies that provide clear, value-based guidelines for decision-making can minimize ambiguity and uncertainty. This will ensure that decisions are made efficiently. Such a corporate culture also aligns decisions with the company’s vision and values, while supporting its mission. To increase customer satisfaction While much of corporate culture is focused internally, it’s equally important to consider the needs of customers. Companies can increase customer satisfaction and retention by listening to customers’ concerns, addressing them fairly, and treating them with respect at all times. This will protect your company’s investment in customer acquisition costs and lead to more repeat customers. To improve the company’s reputation A corporate culture communicating values such as honesty, transparency, and fairness will build a positive reputation. It will likely retain existing customers and staff. By building a solid reputation, it can become both a trusted brand and a sought-after employer. Final words The time and effort needed to establish or redefine your corporate culture is one of the most important investments you can make in your company’s future. With careful consideration, you can create a corporate culture that represents your company’s values in the best way possible. You can attract and retain top talent and increase your customer base, all while working toward the fulfilment of your company’s mission.

Report this article Pascal Unger Pascal Unger Managing Partner @ focal || We lead Pre-Seed rounds Published Mar 2, 2023 + Follow Last week, I argued against bringing on advisors for early startup to focus on angels instead. If you still want to add them, then read today's newsletter. It discusses when to consider them and how to best go about it. In last week’s post, I argued that startups should (early on) focus their time and energy on bringing on the right angels vs decorated individuals as advisors. I got a bunch of replies stating that there is a case to be made for advisors too. Which I agree with in certain instances. Thus, here’s my high level thinking on the when and how of bringing on advisors at the start of your startup journey: In my last post, I argued that most potential advisors can afford to put in (even a small) angel check into your (pre-) seed round. This aligns incentives much better, increases the likelihood of them putting in hard work on your behalf and is a much stronger signal towards the (VC and hiring) market. However, sometimes individuals cannot ",

The content discusses the importance of aligning incentives between founders and investors, suggesting that early-stage startups should prioritize bringing on angel investors who are willing to contribute financially, while also considering the potential value of advisors in certain situations. It reflects on the dynamics of startup support and the decision-making process involved in building a team of investors and advisors.",

With millions of products, fierce competition, and the intricacies of digital marketing, it’s crucial to have a strong strategy in place. Today, we’ll explore actionable strategies for mastering Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising and effective management techniques to help you thrive in the Amazon marketplace. Grab a cup of coffee, and let’s break this down step by step. ## Understanding PPC Advertising on Amazon Before diving into strategies, let’s ensure we understand what PPC advertising is. Simply put, PPC allows sellers to bid on keywords, paying for their products to appear in sponsored slots on Amazon search results. It’s a vital tool that can significantly increase your product's visibility and drive traffic to your listings. ### Quick Tip: Start Small With Your Budget When starting with PPC, set a modest budget. This allows you to test and learn without risking too much capital. As you find what works, you can gradually increase your spend. ## Choosing the Right Keywords Keywords are the backbone of a successful PPC campaign. They determine when and where your ads will appear. Here’s how you can find the right keywords for your products: ### Step-by-Step Keyword Research 1. **Use Amazon’s Search Bar**: Start typing relevant terms related to your product. Amazon will suggest popular searches, which can give you ideas on what customers are looking for. 2. **Utilize Tools**: Consider using keyword research tools like SellerMate, which can provide insights into search volume and competition for different keywords.
