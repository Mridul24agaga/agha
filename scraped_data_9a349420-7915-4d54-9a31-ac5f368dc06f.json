A use case focused approach is critical to optimize the value of technology investments. We find 100 use cases and real-life examples of Robotic Process Automation, and how it is applied to automate repetitive tasks in various business, industry-specific, and personal contexts. Common Business Processes 1. Customer onboarding The customer onboarding process is critical in reducing customer churn and getting new customers to start using the product. OCR and RPA can help companies deliver intelligent automation in customer onboarding. Most customer onboarding processes, like contract generation, can even be done in companies relying on legacy systems. Real-life example: Finastra, a financial software company, has leveraged automation to streamline its contact center operations. Before automating, the onboarding process for new employees took 8-12 weeks. With the automation, this time has been significantly reduced, allowing new hires to become proficient faster.1 2. Extracting data from PDFs & scanned documents Screen scraping, OCR, and basic pattern recognition technologies enable data extraction from almost any format. This reduces the need to extract and input data manually. Explore our data-driven list of the top document-capturing applications. This use of RPA gains importance in processes such as accounts payable where document management and document capture should be together. There are examples where the accounts payable process in ERPs is developed by technologies that also use RPA: Dynamics 365 in Accounts Payable Automation Blackbaud Accounts Payable (AP) Automation Sage Accounts Payable (AP) Automation NetSuite AP Automation Real-life example: Carglass automated its manual PDF data import process, saving around two hours daily previously spent correcting data entered by field technicians. By streamlining administrative tasks, Carglass empowered its field teams to focus on customer service and sales.2 The automation significantly improved employee satisfaction, with 99% of technicians reporting positive experiences. 3. Data updates Most departments, including HR, customer service, and marketing, routinely need to update their ever-changing customer or personnel data. By setting up bots to automatically update relevant data from forms, and emails, departments will always have access to the most recent and correct information. 4. Data validation Most data validation controls can be embedded in databases. However, RPA is suitable for other validation tasks, such as cross-checking data against publicly available data. That’s because RPA is easy to program, scalable, and integrable to different systems. Real-life example: Protelindo leveraged automation to enhance data validation and reconciliation tasks through its employee-driven “ProAction” event. Employees across various departments developed automated solutions, significantly reducing the time required for data validation, improving operational accuracy, and enabling the company to manage high data volumes.3 Employees developed 29 automation projects, enabling the company to process large data volumes 75% faster. 5. Periodic report preparation and dissemination Businesses need regular reports to inform managers and teams of their progress. However, manual report preparation and sending is time-consuming. RPA can auto-generate reports, analyze their contents, and based on the contents, email them to relevant stakeholders. This automates periodic reporting. For example, telecom operators need to send reports on connectivity issues to the correct personnel. For instance, a CTO should be copied in reports with critical issues, and the head of the network with major issues. RPA bots can analyze reports to modify recipients according to the provided criteria. Learn more about RPA use cases in reporting. 6. Data migration and entry Legacy systems still perform critical functions at companies. For example, legacy billing systems need to interface with other systems, which may not have the capability to pull relevant data from APIs. In such cases, employees manually migrate data using formats like CSV. Real-life example: Encova Insurance automated its policy intake process and reduced manual data entry from approximately 650 hours per month to just 12.5 hours per year with a productivity increase of over 99%.4 7. Generating mass emails Personalizing emails, newsletters, and other forms of marketing outreach can lead to more successful campaigns. But personalization relies on data inflow from different systems (e.g. CRM or ERP systems), which can be time-consuming if done manually. RPA can help businesses: : Gather customer data from different systems Put them onto pre-approved email templates Send them to customers/potential leads Real-life example: HUB International automated email processing enabling the automatic extraction and classification of customer data directly into their NetSuite policy management system. By automating this previously manual workflow, HUB International, reduced costs related to third-party labor, and scaled operations to manage thousands of diverse documents and communications.5 Automation has supported HUB International’s rapid growth by streamlining over 60 processes company-wide, allowing them to integrate new acquisitions faster. 8. Quote-to-cash Businesses need to sell to survive. Quote-to-cash issues can result in late receivables, delayed invoice generation, selling at reduced prices (due to clerical errors), etc. By streamlined data extraction and transportation from different order forms and systems, quote-to-cash automation enables: Manual error reduction Faster B2C/B2B services Reduction in accountancy costs 9. Procure-to-pay (P2P)/Source-to-pay (S2P) Procure-to-pay process involves creating a purchase order, and extracting invoice and payment data from multiple systems: Supplier emails Enterprise resource planning (ERP) Customer relationship management (CRM) Banks Vendors Logistics companies. The data coming in can be in different forms, such as emailed vendor invoices. Invoices need to be captured, validated, and enriched. For example, companies need to assign general ledger (GL) accounts to invoices without purchase orders (POs). Learn more about RPA use cases in the procurement process. Commercial Functions (Marketing & Sales) Figure 1: Use cases of RPA in commercial functions. Marketing: 10. Lead nurturing Leads arrive through a myriad of channels such as LinkedIn, lead collection forms, and vendors. RPA bots can extract them and put them in a single location. Real-life example: Habib Bank Limited (HBL) automated its sanction screening process for new customer onboarding using 15 digital workers, which now handle over 80,000 cases monthly with 98% accuracy. Previously a manual task requiring significant effort, automation reduced processing time from hours to minutes, enabling compliance teams to focus on complex tasks.6 Automation saved HBL approximately 341,000 working hours annually, driving the bank’s wider digital transformation and improving service quality for its 37 million customers. 11. Bid adjustment Automated bid adjustment tools use RPA-API integration to monitor your ads’ performance, assess it, and automatically adjust the bid. Although you should keep monitoring the bot’s performance, the need to manually adjust the bid decreases. Real-life example: Sopra Steria leveraged automation by integrating RPA with AI/ML technologies to fully automate its bid adjustment processes. This resulted in processing bids three times faster, reducing manual effort to zero, and eliminating errors. This automation allowed Sopra Steria to achieve ROI within just six months, significantly streamlining operations and enhancing competitiveness in bidding processes.7 12.

Learn more about competitor monitoring automation Sales: Though sales personnel should focus on building relations and selling, most of their time is spent on operational activities in most organizations. RPA can automate the interactions between the data systems and the CRM.8 15. Creating and delivering invoices This is a case of data replication. Both the CRM and the accounting systems should have identical sales data. Bots can update accounting records, and prepare, and deliver invoices from the right email accounts to ensure data consistency between systems. Real-life example: FlySafair automated its invoicing processes to streamline billing airline partners for shared journeys, significantly reducing manual work hours and protecting income. This automation reduced the billing time per invoice from hours to minutes.9 16. Updating CRM Adding interactions with prospects to the CRM is time-consuming but critical. Modern solutions help companies integrate their email, call, and other communication data into a CRM system. But they require integration into your company’s CRM to work. When such integrations are not available, companies can build bots to update CRM records with customer contact information. 17. Updating scorecards RPA bots can ensure that CRM changes are uploaded to scorecards. This allows sales reps to see their progress in real time. Learn more about sales processes to automate with RPA. Customer Relationship Management 18. Loading a detailed customer profile RPA bots can load customers’ profiles (Figure 1) info on demand. Figure: Example of a customer profile template. Source: 10 19. Getting detailed billing data When you call customer service about your most recent payment, you need to stay on the line while the rep pulls your record and reviews it. With RPA bots, reps can load billing data much quicker. 20. Updating user preferences and other user information RPA chatbots can update user preferences, addresses, contact/personal information, and more. This replaces the need to connect to a live agent. 21. Resolving simple, yet common customer issues RPA bots can reset a customer’s broadband network, or fix simple connection issues without a rep interacting with multiple windows. 22. Automating multi-step complex tasks that require little decision-making Some legacy systems require customer service reps to navigate a lot of steps for simple tasks. If these do not require human judgment, they can be automated, saving significant time. 23. Answering FAQs Companies can build RPA-enabled FAQ chatbots to answer customers’ most frequently asked questions without human intervention. 24. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) RPA bots can be used to automatically generate SLAs, monitor conformance, give breach notifications, and orchestrate troubleshooting. Learn more about service-level agreement automation. 25. Automating multi-step complex tasks that require little decision-making Some legacy systems force customer service reps to complete numerous steps to complete some common tasks. If these steps do not require human judgment, they can be automated, saving significant time. 26. Spam detection Approximately: 90B spam emails are sent daily.11 4% of all online reviews are estimated to be spam.12 Companies can use NLP-driven RPA bots to read incoming emails, documents, and online reviews to notice those that are likely to be spam and flag them as such. Real-life example: Leaf Home leveraged automation to overcome spam filter issues that prevented them from reaching potential customers, causing daily losses of up to $3 million. By automating the rotation of their contact phone numbers, Leaf Home successfully bypassed spam detection systems, significantly improving customer communication and protecting vital revenue.13 27.

RPA bots can automatically translate the content’s language to allow customer agents to resolve them quickly. Learn more about RPA & NLP integration. IT, Security & Technology Operations IT Support & Security: 28. Regular diagnostics Regular diagnostic is running preemptive screening of processes. This puts the tech support teams one step ahead and allows them to respond to possible failures before regular users can notice them. This improves user satisfaction and saves support personnel from wasting time on calls about problems they already know about. There are workload automation (WLA) tools that can be scheduled to run regular diagnostics on the processes to notify users of possible failures. 29. Fault remediation In fault remediation, conversational AI-enabled RPA bots can leverage responses from command catalogs to troubleshoot users’ problems. For instance, a user might say the application “keeps crashing.” The chatbot would understand the query, search the database for the appropriate answer, and give it to the user. 30. Incident management IT incident management is identifying, solving, and minimizing disruptive incidents in the IT ecosystem. RPA bots can send a notification to the IT staff automatically when an IT outage is detected. Or they can put all the support tickets in one location, enabling the IT staff to access them easily. Real-life example: PostNord automated its regression testing, continuously testing and monitoring 20 critical end-to-end logistics processes overnight. This automation enabled immediate detection and rapid resolution of software issues which resulted in reduced time for incident identification and resolution.14 Learn more about data breach incident response. 31.

Improve tech support by learning other IT automation technologies, such as Top 10+ Data Warehouse Automation Software Top 12 IT Automation Software: Vendor Benchmarking Top 10 Batch Scheduling Software: Vendor Benchmark TOP 5 SAP Job Scheduling Software: Vendor Benchmarking 32. DevOps Management Real-life example: TriNet streamlined their DevOps change management process, transforming manual workflows into automated, real-time processes. By automating code deployment tasks, they eliminated manual hand-offs and human errors, reducing cycle time from 15 minutes to under one minute.15 Technology Operations: 33. Opening internal tools to customers or employees Almost all customer service or tech support departments have internal tools with advanced functionality. Service reps use them for internal and external needs. For example, they may be used to approve payments to vendors even when a 3-way match is not reflected in the systems or enable employees to take additional days off. If those tools are in legacy systems, it is difficult to expose them directly to customers or employees without training. RPA offers a solution. The usage frequency of functionalities follows the Pareto principle. A few functionalities (80%) are quite commonly used; the rest (20%) aren’t. After identifying the most popular functionalities of an internal tool, it is possible to write simple web interfaces that leverage bots to complete them. This saves users time while reducing the burden of support teams. In addition, the functionalities that the internal tools provide would be more targeted enabling more efficient usage. 34. Software installations RPA can enable single-click installations of complex systems with interdependent components 35. Automated software testing RPA tools evolved from testing tools that mimic user interactions. The tests can be built into the software, but testing from a user perspective is equally important. Manual testing is time-consuming; automated RPA testing is fast and can: Boost digital transformation of businesses Speed-up software development Produce more reliable outcomes Be run after each deployment to ensure new bugs aren’t introduced Creative manual tests are required for specific scenarios. But no-code RPA solutions are good for common tests that need to be repeated. 36. Product update automation Companies can automate their product updates to notify their customer base of added capabilities of their product/service line in real-time. The benefit of product update automation is that companies do not have to dedicate manpower to notify customers by emails, messages, or phone calls Finance & Accounting Planning & Accounting: 37. Financial planning & budgeting Financial planning involves processing and merging financial statements from numerous departments in a Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) system. Intelligent RPA bots with OCR features can automate this via data extraction and ETL. Real-life example: A large U.S. financial services firm used RPA to enhance customer interactions and internal efficiency within its loan underwriting processes. By automating 60% of customer inquiries and 80% of complex calculations through generative AI-powered automation, the firm achieved a reduction of over 99% in Service Level Standard (SLS) times.

Business engine rules embedded in bots can: Extract applicant info Validate it Assess the submitted business plan Ask users to fix incorrect issues Make preliminary evaluation Generate confirmation/rejection letters Real-life example: The Loan Store (TLS) automated various mortgage lending processes, including loan setup, disclosures, underwriting, and servicing. This automation resulted in a 100% increase in productivity, 60% cost savings, over 80% straight-through processing, and a reduction of mortgage loan turn times by more than 25%. The automation allowed TLS to scale operations while maintaining high levels of customer service, leading to faster loan processing and cost savings.18 42. Trade execution In cases where legacy systems are not capable of storing complex limit orders, RPA bots can automate the processing of complex orders. 43. Same-day funds transfers The cooperative Bank completes payments using The Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS) which offers same-day funds transfers. The manual process, which took 10 minutes per request, was automated. The steps included: Checking for fund availability Making a purchase order Performing transfers to where the funds are needed manually Real-life example: The Co-operative Bank automated their CHAPS payment transfer process. Previously, each transfer required around 10 minutes of manual effort, but automation reduced this time to approximately 20 seconds. The automated workflow includes verifying fund availability, performing the transaction accurately until manual authorization, charging the customer, and updating the account notes.19 44. Account closure Real-life example: The Co-operative Bank automated their account closure process. Previously, closing an account involved multiple manual tasks, including canceling direct debits and transferring funds. Now, customer service agents simply fill out an electronic form during a call, and the RPA system processes these requests automatically, eliminating manual intervention.20 45. Validating and processing online loan applications Real-life example: The Co-operative Bank automated their online loan application process. Previously, loan applications required significant manual intervention for data validation and preliminary decision-making. Automation enabled the bank to process 99% of loan applications on the same day they were submitted, greatly improving customer service by reducing delays.21 46. Audits preparation Banks need to reply to requests by the auditors for company audit reports. Bots can be used to find all the customer’s accounts year-end balances and return the audit to the audit clerk in the form of a Word document. This can reduce the time it takes to run an average audit from days to minutes. Real-life example: The Loan Store, Inc. (TLS) implements automation across several mortgage processes, including audits and loan documentation. By automating processes like loan document classification and disclosures, TLS increased productivity by over 100% and compressed mortgage loan turn times by more than 25%.22 47. Trade finance logistics Trade finance involves multiple parties coordinating and ensuring the delivery of goods and payments.

Schools and universities can use RPA for the initial screening of applications to eliminate those that do not meet the basic requirement criteria, such as missing documents, and spam applications. The benefit is that the admission personnel can then spend more time on applications that have made it to the next round. 76. Attendance management RPA bots can be used by teachers to track each student’s attendance. For example, if answering live quiz questions in class is a sign of attendance, RPA bots can match each student’s answer on the day with their name. Or, in virtual classrooms, they can scrape each student’s name and type it into the attendance sheet for that day. Then, they can figure out how many points each student has. Hospitality: 77. Room reservation RPA bots can reconcile users’ online payments, extract their information from the website’s database, and reserve their rooms automatically. 78. Automated check-ins & check-outs RPA bots can send periodic notifications or emails to guests to remind them of their check-in and check-out times so misunderstandings about this matter are minimized. 79. Automated room pricing RPA bots can scrape competitors’ websites for the prices they charge for similar rooms. The data can be put into spreadsheets and sent to the hotel manager for analysis. The bot can also automatically adjust the hotel’s room prices, based on pre-determined rules, to match the competitors with minimal human intervention. Learn more about RPA’s use cases in the hospitality industry. Healthcare: 80. Patient Appointment Scheduling RPA can schedule a patient’s appointments based on diagnosis, doctor availability, location, and other variables including financial statements and insurance information.

Meal price updates RPA bots can be configured to keep track of small changes in the pricing of the ingredients and to automatically increase/decrease the cost of the meal accordingly. The benefit is that, especially in inflationary times, restaurants can adjust their meal prices for ingredient costs. Learn more about the use cases of RPA in the food industry. Retail: Retail includes constant operational and analytics activities, such as launching new products or promotions. Though RPA companies rely on API connections for such operations, there are still many legacy systems without API interfaces where RPA can be used for integration for completing the following processes: 88. Product categorization Global retail companies need to harmonize SKU (stock keeping unit) data from multiple markets to be able to look beyond numbers to insights such as, “What is our toothpaste market share in Eastern Europe?”. Traditionally, these tasks required employees to manually match SKUs to categories in complex spreadsheets. Since this is a task that does not directly impact customers, fault tolerance is not very high and RPA bots can be used to automate the process, saving thousands of hours of work and reducing manual errors. 89. Automated returns Automating returns can improve customer satisfaction and reduce manual labor. RPA bots can be used to automate the steps of the return process, which include: Checking customer purchase records from the system Checking the reason for the return Asking more questions such as “Has the item been worn?” Assessing the return’s eligibility 90. Trade promotions Shop floor trade promotions require back-end admin work. RPA bots can automate relevant tasks such as: Creating and allocating funds for promotions Generating reports that give visibility of promotion performance Automation makes it easier and faster for retailers to launch trade promotions. 91. Inventory and supply chain management Some retailers rely on legacy systems for stockkeeping. RPA bots can perform constant checks on these systems, providing data on key metrics like items with low stock levels or rapidly changing stock levels.

A use case focused approach is critical to optimize the value of technology investments. We find 100 use cases and real-life examples of Robotic Process Automation, and how it is applied to automate repetitive tasks in various business, industry-specific, and personal contexts. Common Business Processes 1. Customer onboarding The customer onboarding process is critical in reducing customer churn and getting new customers to start using the product. OCR and RPA can help companies deliver intelligent automation in customer onboarding. Most customer onboarding processes, like contract generation, can even be done in companies relying on legacy systems. Real-life example: Finastra, a financial software company, has leveraged automation to streamline its contact center operations. Before automating, the onboarding process for new employees took 8-12 weeks. With the automation, this time has been significantly reduced, allowing new hires to become proficient faster.1 2. Extracting data from PDFs & scanned documents Screen scraping, OCR, and basic pattern recognition technologies enable data extraction from almost any format. This reduces the need to extract and input data manually. Explore our data-driven list of the top document-capturing applications. This use of RPA gains importance in processes such as accounts payable where document management and document capture should be together. There are examples where the accounts payable process in ERPs is developed by technologies that also use RPA: Dynamics 365 in Accounts Payable Automation Blackbaud Accounts Payable (AP) Automation Sage Accounts Payable (AP) Automation NetSuite AP Automation Real-life example: Carglass automated its manual PDF data import process, saving around two hours daily previously spent correcting data entered by field technicians. By streamlining administrative tasks, Carglass empowered its field teams to focus on customer service and sales.2 The automation significantly improved employee satisfaction, with 99% of technicians reporting positive experiences. 3. Data updates Most departments, including HR, customer service, and marketing, routinely need to update their ever-changing customer or personnel data. By setting up bots to automatically update relevant data from forms, and emails, departments will always have access to the most recent and correct information. 4. Data validation Most data validation controls can be embedded in databases. However, RPA is suitable for other validation tasks, such as cross-checking data against publicly available data. That’s because RPA is easy to program, scalable, and integrable to different systems. Real-life example: Protelindo leveraged automation to enhance data validation and reconciliation tasks through its employee-driven “ProAction” event. Employees across various departments developed automated solutions, significantly reducing the time required for data validation, improving operational accuracy, and enabling the company to manage high data volumes.3 Employees developed 29 automation projects, enabling the company to process large data volumes 75% faster. 5. Periodic report preparation and dissemination Businesses need regular reports to inform managers and teams of their progress. However, manual report preparation and sending is time-consuming. RPA can auto-generate reports, analyze their contents, and based on the contents, email them to relevant stakeholders. This automates periodic reporting. For example, telecom operators need to send reports on connectivity issues to the correct personnel. For instance, a CTO should be copied in reports with critical issues, and the head of the network with major issues. RPA bots can analyze reports to modify recipients according to the provided criteria. Learn more about RPA use cases in reporting. 6. Data migration and entry Legacy systems still perform critical functions at companies. For example, legacy billing systems need to interface with other systems, which may not have the capability to pull relevant data from APIs. In such cases, employees manually migrate data using formats like CSV. Real-life example: Encova Insurance automated its policy intake process and reduced manual data entry from approximately 650 hours per month to just 12.5 hours per year with a productivity increase of over 99%.4 7. Generating mass emails Personalizing emails, newsletters, and other forms of marketing outreach can lead to more successful campaigns. But personalization relies on data inflow from different systems (e.g. CRM or ERP systems), which can be time-consuming if done manually. RPA can help businesses: : Gather customer data from different systems Put them onto pre-approved email templates Send them to customers/potential leads Real-life example: HUB International automated email processing enabling the automatic extraction and classification of customer data directly into their NetSuite policy management system. By automating this previously manual workflow, HUB International, reduced costs related to third-party labor, and scaled operations to manage thousands of diverse documents and communications.5 Automation has supported HUB International’s rapid growth by streamlining over 60 processes company-wide, allowing them to integrate new acquisitions faster. 8. Quote-to-cash Businesses need to sell to survive. Quote-to-cash issues can result in late receivables, delayed invoice generation, selling at reduced prices (due to clerical errors), etc. By streamlined data extraction and transportation from different order forms and systems, quote-to-cash automation enables: Manual error reduction Faster B2C/B2B services Reduction in accountancy costs 9. Procure-to-pay (P2P)/Source-to-pay (S2P) Procure-to-pay process involves creating a purchase order, and extracting invoice and payment data from multiple systems: Supplier emails Enterprise resource planning (ERP) Customer relationship management (CRM) Banks Vendors Logistics companies. The data coming in can be in different forms, such as emailed vendor invoices. Invoices need to be captured, validated, and enriched. For example, companies need to assign general ledger (GL) accounts to invoices without purchase orders (POs). Learn more about RPA use cases in the procurement process. Commercial Functions (Marketing & Sales) Figure 1: Use cases of RPA in commercial functions. Marketing: 10. Lead nurturing Leads arrive through a myriad of channels such as LinkedIn, lead collection forms, and vendors. RPA bots can extract them and put them in a single location. Real-life example: Habib Bank Limited (HBL) automated its sanction screening process for new customer onboarding using 15 digital workers, which now handle over 80,000 cases monthly with 98% accuracy. Previously a manual task requiring significant effort, automation reduced processing time from hours to minutes, enabling compliance teams to focus on complex tasks.6 Automation saved HBL approximately 341,000 working hours annually, driving the bank’s wider digital transformation and improving service quality for its 37 million customers. 11. Bid adjustment Automated bid adjustment tools use RPA-API integration to monitor your ads’ performance, assess it, and automatically adjust the bid. Although you should keep monitoring the bot’s performance, the need to manually adjust the bid decreases. Real-life example: Sopra Steria leveraged automation by integrating RPA with AI/ML technologies to fully automate its bid adjustment processes. This resulted in processing bids three times faster, reducing manual effort to zero, and eliminating errors. This automation allowed Sopra Steria to achieve ROI within just six months, significantly streamlining operations and enhancing competitiveness in bidding processes.7 12. Price monitoring RPA bots can monitor competitor prices on e-commerce retail websites to track and implement price changes in real time. 13. Product and service monitoring The R&D department can use RPA bots to track competitors’ products/services on competitor websites and online retail platforms. The gained insights can shape the company’s offerings. 14. Customer review monitoring Companies can use RPAs to track, extract, and structure users’ sentiment analysis about their products. Learn more about competitor monitoring automation Sales: Though sales personnel should focus on building relations and selling, most of their time is spent on operational activities in most organizations. RPA can automate the interactions between the data systems and the CRM.8 15. Creating and delivering invoices This is a case of data replication. Both the CRM and the accounting systems should have identical sales data. Bots can update accounting records, and prepare, and deliver invoices from the right email accounts to ensure data consistency between systems. Real-life example: FlySafair automated its invoicing processes to streamline billing airline partners for shared journeys, significantly reducing manual work hours and protecting income. This automation reduced the billing time per invoice from hours to minutes.9 16. Updating CRM Adding interactions with prospects to the CRM is time-consuming but critical. Modern solutions help companies integrate their email, call, and other communication data into a CRM system. But they require integration into your company’s CRM to work.

Reply Post Comment AIMultiple Jan 30, 2019 at 22:51 While relatively simple checks like data type checks would be automatically performed in databases, more complex validation that includes business rules can be programmed using RPA.

This restriction can be programmed in a simple RPA bot that regularly validates data and highlights anomalies Reply Post Comment Related research RPA Pricing: Comparison of Leading RPA Vendors' Fees in 2025 Mar 86 min read RPA & Web Scrapers: Screen Scraping in 2025 Mar 84 min read Follow us on: AIMultiple AboutCareerCommitmentsContactCultureHow we are fundedHow we testMethodology Follow us on: Solution Categories AI AR / VRConversational AIEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP)Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)HealthcareMachine Learning APISales Research Categories AI AcceleratorData LabelingGenAILarge Language Model (LLM)Managed File TransferProxySupply Chain & LogisticsSustainabilityWeb Scraping For Vendors Claim Your SolutionLearn Best Practices Copyright ©️ 2025 AIMultiple | All Rights Reserved | Terms and Conditions | Privacy Policy"

I run a 7-figure service business that offers DJ, photo, video services (#1 largest in Canada), and spent years figuring out how to automate every part of it (and hired the roles that I couldn't). Conservatively, I used to work 80+ hours per week, before sunrise till long after sunset; missing gatherings, family events and everything in between. Through automation though, I was able to replace my job. My goal is to help share what worked for me, in a dream of helping others find true success with their passion.

Humanizing AI automation 18:10 Hyperautomation 19:04 Conclusion #automation #aiautomation 44 comments what's going on guys it is Jon o and today we're going to be talking about my favorite seven Trends in automation that you should be applying every single day moving forward these are going to be massive in 2025 they're going to save you so much time and when I mean save you so much time I don't mean like hey you know it might save you 15 minutes a day I'm like liter like for me it saved me the equivalent of like 40 people full-time it's more work than I could ever do in a freaking day or probably even a month so with that being said let's dive into these right now I'm going to start off with the easiest one here I want to actually share with you a example now I actually coined this myself and I'm calling this life cycle automation this is what I did with my business that allowed me to replace myself from a job and I went from working 14 hours a day down to literally I want to say maybe like 10 15 minutes every single day and it's coined life cycle automation because you just map out every process you take a client through in the life cycle that they have with your company and you say how can I automate this so for example let's say that somebody is a new lead on uh that inquires as a new lead right so we can go ahead uh that just irks me that I spelled my name wrong there and we'll fill out this this form right and we have this client in our CRM right now this is go high level right and the first thing that's going to happen is as soon as they inquire it's literally going to call me so I'm going to pick up the phone here you can see that my phone is ringing here I'm going to pick this up and put it on speaker Hey Jo jono catlick has inquired about services please press any key on the keypad to be connected into a call with jono so if I went ahead and I connected into that call me and the client would be on a phone call pretty much immediately let's Circle back into the CRM if that call was not picked up then it's going to send off a text message and an email and it's going to say hey jono it's jono from jono catli that is way too many jonos this is getting out of control right now I just saw that you filled out a form on our website looking for whatever services this is blank just because this is test information I'd love to help are you free to chat now and then they you they can go ahead and book an appointment right same kind of deal with the email you can just nurture them down a particular email sequence so that the goal here is to book an appointment and when that person is like hell yeah I want to jump on a call they're going to come to an appointment widget like this they're going to pick a time right they're going to fill in all of their information here so I'm going to go ahead and fill in my information and schedule that meeting and as soon as that meeting scheduled you could be like hey jono manually I'm typing this email out being like hey I booked this appointment or whatever and just confirming it or you could automate that now I'm just going to pan over to myself because you can see here that um I just essentially sent myself an email so I'm not sure if you can see that but it's essentially saying hey we're confirming the time or whatever if you want to reschedule if you need to cancel it you can do that both of those are automated all of this stuff 100% automated you don't have to do anything right so that's really cool now let's take it a step further and say I jump on the call with this person everything goes well and I want to you know you know essentially send them over a proposal thank them for their time that all sounds good to me all I have to do here is just let say finish off a sales call so I'm just going to say you know hypothetically I finished off the sales call I'm going to add them into this manually obviously this wouldn't be manual but it's going to say hey jonno it's jono great chatting once again thank you for your time I just sent over the contract and invoice let me know if you have any questions right so these are just breaking up all the tasks you have to do for an individual client step by step and then automating it now this is pretty simplistic because it's like just emails and text messages and phone calls right now but you can get more advanced you could generate a contract like this is the exact contract we generate for our clients there's over 150 different custom fields that really go into this so it gets pretty nuts pretty crazy and this is like the tip at the iceberg what I'm showing you guys here is literally maybe one or 2% of all the things that I can automate and just in case you guys are wondering I um if you guys do want a system like this I just released the system it got my company up to seven figures I'm giving away completely for free I do charge people F five figures every single month just to do the same kind of automation but if you are interested the links down below you can go to my sign up page for go high level download this it's free to get started you do have to pay go high level $97 a month and yes I do get an affiliate Commission on that but if you guys don't like it you can cancel and there is a free Trail this is kind of what it looks like on the inside there's going to be videos walking through everything with descriptions on how to get started in the blueprints all you have to do is just uh download the blueprints and it it's going to pretty much work out of box out of the box for most people uh that have a business in this like a service based business now the second Trend here is using artificial intelligence in automation right and there's so many so many so many use cases for this but I'm just going to give an example of an AI assistant here so let's say and I'm actually just going to go ahead and run this workflow so you guys can see it and this is make.com I do have blueprints my top 10 if you guys sign out for this you can get in the description below but let's say that you have an AI assistant that you want it to complete tasks for you you could say um you could get it to do really anything you want to so I'm going to go ahead and request something from it hey can you please send an email to Jon o catli telling them that we're good to go for our call tomorrow at 2 p.m. and I look forward to chatting with them then and I'm going to send that message off in slack and in real time what's going to go what's going to happen behind the scenes is we're going to receive that message we're going to transcribe it using Ai and then it's going to go down the right AI agent path and it's going to execute on the task that we wanted it to do now in this case we're just creating a draft email it's going to notify us that that email or that task has been created back in slack.com you don't have to use slack you can use Facebook Messenger WhatsApp um text messaging whatever the case is right there's a million one things you can do but you can literally create an AI agent that does whatever task that it is that you need it to be done this is just I think seven here actually six but you can do hundreds or thousands right so this is just one example of how to use AI in automation now the next and the third Trend that I want to talk about is document processing using artificial intelligence now the cool thing is is we live in a time where we can literally just strip information from documents like a PDF or like a Google sheet or like an Excel spreadsheet or whatever we could just take that information and analyze it and then deliver results back so for example in make.com situation like this what's going on is we're just waiting for emails right and when those emails come in we're going to use AI to literally strip that email of uh the attachments in that email so we're going to come into an email like this we're going to take an attachment right we're going to literally grab that information we're going to process it using AI we're going to spit it out in like a Google sheet like this so we can see the price and the tax and the subtotal and all that kind of stuff the cool thing is is you know it doesn't have to stop there you could add this into QuickBooks and automate a huge part of your accounting process now you don't just have to do receipts that's a cool thing but there's a lot of other applications for this I'm sure you have some ideas in your head on how you can implement this in your business but another one is recruiting right so in my business I get hundreds well probably more like thousands of people applying every single uh month to jobs that I have and obviously this is a ton of work it is a ton of work and if you're like me um I like getting the top 1% of candidates which means I have to go through at least 100 maybe 200 maybe 300 people just to find one person that I'm super happy with now that's a lot of work that's a lot of resumes that's a lot of reading and something like this will be able to speed up that time because you could essentially have an AI system that takes that document that we're essentially converting into um text and then we're going to create like a 10-point basis where we um essentially rate that person like how much experience do you have with this role do you have any relevant degrees how's the spelling and grammar and punctuation what's your experience in that particular role um all of that kind of stuff you can tell AI to do and then you can generate a response right so it really allows you to remove yourself from the process that's super freaking cool now the next thing here is that um you can automate AI chat Bots now this is freaking awesome right um but I'm not talking about just like chat gbt or whatever I'm talking about putting that puppy on steroids and what I mean by that is like connecting that chatbot into tens or hundreds or thousands of applications now in this case we're going to take a chatbot this is go high level this is kind of the same CRM that we were using before and we're going to have a realtime AI conversation with somebody and we're going to connect that into this make.com scenario here so I'm going to go ahead I'm going to run this okay and coming back in here I'm going to just message this AI bot now nothing crazy it's just going to reply saying hey you know what's going on right and once it does that I'm just going to say you know butterflies rain obviously not um can you please send me over my invoice so I can pay it please and then and of course I always say please even if it's AI just because I'm Canadian but we're going to wait for it to reply again and it's just going to ask us for our email because at this point in time it doesn't know who I am there's no unique identifier to connect me to a client in the CRM or to actually email that off so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to provide my email here now in the back end you can actually see in real time this conversation happening you can see everything going on and it's going to send over that particular message here and in the background we have run this scenario right and this is essentially pulled the client in Panda do it's grabbed their particular contract and then it sent it back to go high level so that we can send a live chat back to the person and here is a link to that document obviously he should be flipped the other way around so that would need to be fixed but here is that exact document that we have it's being sent in real time then that person can go ahead sign pay all of that kind of stuff pretty much immediately so that's a really cool use case for automation um in 2025 right so supercharge your chatbots now the next thing here actually before we move on to the next thing I want to showcase the exact same thing that you can do but instead of using a chatot you could use a phone call so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to run the scenario it's using a software called vapy and it's going to call myself you can see here I'm receiving a call I'm going to pick it up and that's not a good customer service let's go ahead and run that again you're getting a zero to five for that that was not a good performance there hello hello this is Ava how may I assist you today hey Ava do you mind just sending over that invoice for me so that I can pay um the deposit right now it sounds like you're looking for an invoice to make a deposit payment that's correct can you please confirm the specific great I can help with that to ensure I send the correct invoice could you please provide me with the invoice number or any other relevant details yeah it's under my email which is John @gmail.com thank you for providing your email address I will send the invoice to john. Catalyst gmail.com shortly if you need any further assistance okay fre to let me know um it was actually Jon o catli gmail.com not john. catli so j n o c a tli FF gmail.com got it I will send the invoice to J NZ a t LF Gmail mail.com short if you need any further assistance feel free to let me know so the email is J is in Jerry o is in Orange n is in Nancy o is in Orange C is in car a is in attic T is in Tango L as L as and life I is an Ango f is enforced f is enforced gmail.com got it I will send the invoice to j n c a t l Gmail mail.com shortly if you need any further assistance feel free to let me know okay sounds good thank you very much so that's how you could easily set up phone AI assistants or agents to essentially call your contacts on your behalf it's not perfect as you can see there it kind of screwed up the email but let's be honest every time I call the bank I'm practically screaming on the other end Jay oh was an every single time and it's usually a 10 in a process anyway so not perfect it can't get better but it will get better and this is the worst it's ever going to be obviously with this kind kind of stuff guys just make sure if you're using phone AI assistant that you're ethical about it because obviously this can be used for really good things but it can also be used for really bad things so I always like just throwing in that okay and the next Trend to look out for in 2025 is robotic process automation now this is a really cool Trend um but essentially how it works is that what it's going to happen is a robot's going to just look at what you're doing it's going to analyze you clicking buttons you processing information say you log into an app you log in your Gmail you send an email or whatever and it's going to recognize what the buttons are that you're clicking the keystrokes all of that kind of stuff and then I can repeat that behavior over and over and over again so it is automation but it's a different type of automation put more simply in explaining it like a 5-year-old chapi just says um you have a friend that's a little robot and um essentially you want to open a bunch of files copy something from each one and put into another file doing this might take a lot of time but you if you tell your friend your RPA friend what to do once it can remember what to do and just do it over and over again just like magic um so yeah it's it's super cool stuff now um you can create a lot of advanced a lot of customized workflows but here's just one example we're using a platform called uip path here and we're doing something very similar where we're extracting documents from our Gmail account and then we are going to push those into Google Drive so this is the default kind of scenario that I have set up here and what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to run test and it's going to give logs it's kind of like almost web scraping when I see it but it's cool right it's going through it's logging every single process and yeah it's going to push that into this particular folder here so that I have for example all of my bills right this is a way where you can strip all of your documents put them into a folder all that kind of stuff so that's really really cool this is something to look out for this does integrate into make.com as well so if you guys are interested in doing this you could literally programmatically start this from make.com now the last two things that I'm going to talk about Point number six and point number seven in trends for 2025 when it comes to automation are a bit contradictory to one another so just keep that in mind but this one is about humanizing Automation in AI so I know that there's this big push to you know essentially um just get results as fast as possible use automation AI to remove yourself completely and and it's great right it's it's awesome but I do believe strongly that there needs to be some level of human intervention in most of these not all but a lot of these workflows right because for me the reality is is when I publish content online for example I would want to make sure that I do a quick double check whether it's me or somebody on my team so that I'm not pushing out things that I wouldn't be proud of or that doesn't reflect or represent my brand the way I want it to so in this instance you know I have this workflow just to summarize it up we're generating um AI clones right so here's kind of this video I'm going to play it imagine taking a vacation while your business runs itself sounds too good to be true with make.com comma you can automate 95% of your operations from sales to customer service make.com comma I love how it just specifies the comma like you know this is part of the sentence it needs to be specified it's like if you're reading this you need to know this is a freaking comma right here um anyway so obviously there's some mistakes in there and I probably wouldn't want to push that out entirely just by itself so with a workflow like this what's going on here is we're breaking up into three segments and we're cing these videos automatically right but we have checkpoints so the first thing is is we're going to generate the script so um here's kind of like what the script is we generate it and if you read that you like that sounds awesome you can click this video check box here and it's going to generate the video and taking a step back too to create the content you click this check box for the content based on the idea and this checkbox will create the script based on the idea and then this video check boox will actually generate this particular video right so this is creating the content this is creating the video different paths and then the final path is just posting us your favorite platforms like LinkedIn like X like Instagram right um but yeah there's some human intervention there so that you're only posting something that you're proud to post and the last thing here that I kind of want to go over is hyper automation where essentially it's the inverse and it is contradictory but I think like the Pinnacle of Automation and Ai and the direction like the The Logical conclusion if you will is where all of these different processes are stitched together into one so you might have have some form of automation that's like maybe a chatbot that's receiving messages you're automating the process of stitching together multiple applications to get a response you're using Ai and deep learning to be able to really understand the syntax grab the right information process it deliver a coherent response push it back to the end user and then be able to take that information store it into a database and be able to train that model over time so that every single process that it iterates through it gets better over time right so that's kind of I think the logical conclusion or the end game of where we're going so thanks guys for watching if you made it this far um if you found value in this video please hit that subscribe button down below helps letting me know that I'm doing a good job if you do have any questions make sure to leave them in the comment section down below if you guys are interested in those particular blueprints you can just go ahead and download them there's going to be a link in the description for this and then you can just go at your own Cadence and walk through through implementing all of these did take me 5 years did I did end up spending millions of dollars testing this so uh I'd like to believe it's at least pretty good so yeah just let me know your thoughts on that and thanks for watching once again I'll see you guys in the next video bye-bye",

text messaging whatever the case is right there's a million one things you can do but you can literally create an AI agent that does whatever task that it is that you need it to be done this is just I think seven here actually six but you can do hundreds or thousands right so this is just one example of how to use AI in automation now the next and the third Trend that I want to talk about is document processing using artificial intelligence now the cool thing is is we live in a time where we can literally just strip information from documents like a PDF or like a Google sheet or like an Excel spreadsheet or whatever we could just take that information and analyze it and then deliver results back so for example in make.com situation like this what's going on is we're just waiting for emails right and when those emails come in we're going to use AI to literally strip that email of uh the attachments in that email so we're going to come into an email like this we're going to take an attachment right we're going to literally grab that information we're going to process it using AI we're going to spit it out in like a Google sheet like this so we can see the price and the tax and the subtotal and all that kind of stuff the cool thing is is you know it doesn't have to stop there you could add this into QuickBooks and automate a huge part of your accounting process now you don't just have to do receipts that's a cool thing but there's a lot of other applications for this I'm sure you have some ideas in your head on how you can implement this in your business but another one is recruiting right so in my business I get hundreds well probably more like thousands of people applying every single uh month to jobs that I have and obviously this is a ton of work it is a ton of work and if you're like me um I like getting the top 1% of candidates which means I have to go through at least 100 maybe 200 maybe 300 people just to find one person that I'm super happy with now that's a lot of work that's a lot of resumes that's a lot of reading and something like this will be able to speed up that time because you could essentially have an AI system that takes that document that we're essentially converting into um text and then we're going to create like a 10-point basis where we um essentially rate that person like how much experience do you have with this role do you have any relevant degrees how's the spelling and grammar and punctuation what's your experience in that particular role um all of that kind of stuff you can tell AI to do and then you can generate a response right so it really allows you to remove yourself from the process that's super freaking cool now the next thing here is that um you can automate AI chat Bots now this is freaking awesome right um but I'm not talking about just like chat gbt or whatever I'm talking about putting that puppy on steroids and what I mean by that is like connecting that chatbot into tens or hundreds or thousands of applications now in this case we're going to take a chatbot this is go high level this is kind of the same CRM that we were using before and we're going to have a realtime AI conversation with somebody and we're going to connect that into this make.com scenario here so I'm going to go ahead I'm going to run this okay and coming back in here I'm going to just message this AI bot now nothing crazy it's just going to reply saying hey you know what's going on right and once it does that I'm just going to say you know butterflies rain obviously not um can you please send me over my invoice so I can pay it please and then and of course I always say please even if it's AI just because I'm Canadian but we're going to wait for it to reply again and it's just going to ask us for our email because at this point in time it doesn't know who I am there's no unique identifier to connect me to a client in the CRM or to actually email that off so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to provide my email here now in the back end you can actually see in real time this conversation happening you can see everything going on and it's going to send over that particular message here and in the background we have run this scenario right and this is essentially pulled the client in Panda do it's grabbed their particular contract and then it sent it back to go high level so that we can send a live chat back to the person and here is a link to that document obviously he should be flipped the other way around so that would need to be fixed but here is that exact document that we have it's being sent in real time then that person can go ahead sign pay all of that kind of stuff pretty much immediately so that's a really cool use case for automation um in 2025 right so supercharge your chatbots now the next thing here actually before we move on to the next thing I want to showcase the exact same thing that you can do but instead of using a chatot you could use a phone call so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to run the scenario it's using a software called vapy and it's going to call myself you can see here I'm receiving a call I'm going to pick it up and that's not a good customer service let's go ahead and run that again you're getting a zero to five for that that was not a good performance there hello hello this is Ava how may I assist you today hey Ava do you mind just sending over that invoice for me so that I can pay um the deposit right now it sounds like you're looking for an invoice to make a deposit payment that's correct can you please confirm the specific great I can help with that to ensure I send the correct invoice could you please provide me with the invoice number or any other relevant details yeah it's under my email which is John @gmail.com thank you for providing your email address I will send the invoice to john. Catalyst gmail.com shortly if you need any further assistance okay fre to let me know um it was actually Jon o catli gmail.com not john. catli so j n o c a tli FF gmail.com got it I will send the invoice to J NZ a t LF Gmail mail.com short if you need any further assistance feel free to let me know so the email is J is in Jerry o is in Orange n is in Nancy o is in Orange C is in car a is in attic T is in Tango L as L as and life I is an Ango f is enforced f is enforced gmail.com got it I will send the invoice to j n c a t l Gmail mail.com shortly if you need any further assistance feel free to let me know okay sounds good thank you very much so that's how you could easily set up phone AI assistants or agents to essentially call your contacts on your behalf it's not perfect as you can see there it kind of screwed up the email but let's be honest every time I call the bank I'm practically screaming on the other end Jay oh was an every single time and it's usually a 10 in a process anyway so not perfect it can't get better but it will get better and this is the worst it's ever going to be obviously with this kind kind of stuff guys just make sure if you're using phone AI assistant that you're ethical about it because obviously this can be used for really good things but it can also be used for really bad things so I always like just throwing in that okay and the next Trend to look out for in 2025 is robotic process automation now this is a really cool Trend um but essentially how it works is that what it's going to happen is a robot's going to just look at what you're doing it's going to analyze you clicking buttons you processing information say you log into an app you log in your Gmail you send an email or whatever and it's going to recognize what the buttons are that you're clicking the keystrokes all of that kind of stuff and then I can repeat that behavior over and over and over again so it is automation but it's a different type of automation put more simply in explaining it like a 5-year-old chapi just says um you have a friend that's a little robot and um essentially you want to open a bunch of files copy something from each one and put into another file doing this might take a lot of time but you if you tell your friend your RPA friend what to do once it can remember what to do and just do it over and over again just like magic um so yeah it's it's super cool stuff now um you can create a lot of advanced a lot of customized workflows but here's just one example we're using a platform called uip path here and we're doing something very similar where we're extracting documents from our Gmail account and then we are going to push those into Google Drive so this is the default kind of scenario that I have set up here and what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to run test and it's going to give logs it's kind of like almost web scraping when I see it but it's cool right it's going through it's logging every single process and yeah it's going to push that into this particular folder here so that I have for example all of my bills right this is a way where you can strip all of your documents put them into a folder all that kind of stuff so that's really really cool this is something to look out for this does integrate into make.com as well so if you guys are interested in doing this you could literally programmatically start this from make.com now the last two things that I'm going to talk about Point number six and point number seven in trends for 2025 when it comes to automation are a bit contradictory to one another so just keep that in mind but this one is about humanizing Automation in AI so I know that there's this big push to you know essentially um just get results as fast as possible use automation AI to remove yourself completely and and it's great right it's it's awesome but I do believe strongly that there needs to be some level of human intervention in most of these not all but a lot of these workflows right because for me the reality is is when I publish content online for example I would want to make sure that I do a quick double check whether it's me or somebody on my team so that I'm not pushing out things that I wouldn't be proud of or that doesn't reflect or represent my brand the way I want it to so in this instance you know I have this workflow just to summarize it up we're generating um AI clones right so here's kind of this video I'm going to play it imagine taking a vacation while your business runs itself sounds too good to be true with make.com comma you can automate 95% of your operations from sales to customer service make.com comma I love how it just specifies the comma like you know this is part of the sentence it needs to be specified it's like if you're reading this you need to know this is a freaking comma right here um anyway so obviously there's some mistakes in there and I probably wouldn't want to push that out entirely just by itself so with a workflow like this what's going on here is we're breaking up into three segments and we're cing these videos automatically right but we have checkpoints so the first thing is is we're going to generate the script so um here's kind of like what the script is we generate it and if you read that you like that sounds awesome you can click this video check box here and it's going to generate the video and taking a step back too to create the content you click this check box for the content based on the idea and this checkbox will create the script based on the idea and then this video check boox will actually generate this particular video right so this is creating the content this is creating the video different paths and then the final path is just posting us your favorite platforms like LinkedIn like X like Instagram right um but yeah there's some human intervention there so that you're only posting something that you're proud to post and the last thing here that I kind of want to go over is hyper automation where essentially it's the inverse and it is contradictory but I think like the Pinnacle of Automation and Ai and the direction like the The Logical conclusion if you will is where all of these different processes are stitched together into one so you might have have some form of automation that's like maybe a chatbot that's receiving messages you're automating the process of stitching together multiple applications to get a response you're using Ai and deep learning to be able to really understand the syntax grab the right information process it deliver a coherent response push it back to the end user and then be able to take that information store it into a database and be able to train that model over time so that every single process that it iterates through it gets better over time right so that's kind of I think the logical conclusion or the end game of where we're going so thanks guys for watching if you made it this far um if you found value in this video please hit that subscribe button down below helps letting me know that I'm doing a good job if you do have any questions make sure to leave them in the comment section down below if you guys are interested in those particular blueprints you can just go ahead and download them there's going to be a link in the description for this and then you can just go at your own Cadence and walk through through implementing all of these did take me 5 years did I did end up spending millions of dollars testing this so uh I'd like to believe it's at least pretty good so yeah just let me know your thoughts on that and thanks for watching once again I'll see you guys in the next video bye-bye"

Test automation can help businesses achieve a competitive advantage, but choosing the right tool or platform is critical to your success. In the search for the best of the best, what should you look for and which vendors are considered the top test automation tools? This overview serves as an introduction to the best tools for automated testing with a focus on functional testing. For a more in-depth view that will help you assess vendors, download our test automation comparison chart. Skip ahead to: What are test automation tools? What to consider when choosing a test automation tool The top 20 test automation tools of 2025 Taking your research a step further What are test automation tools? Test automation tools are software applications that assist in the execution of tests by automating repetitive tasks which are typically performed manually. Read about the differences between manual testing and automated testing These tools validate the functionality and performance of software applications by simulating user interactions, comparing the actual outcomes with expected results, and (in some cases) generating detailed reports. Read about the different types of functional testing in software testing The power of test automation is in its ability to increase the efficiency, speed, and coverage of testing while reducing human error. By using these tools, organizations can ensure consistent software quality, streamline their development processes, and enable continuous testing. What to consider when choosing a test automation tool As with any tool assessment, you should be fully equipped with your evaluation criteria, the capabilities that your tool needs (note: this will be different depending on the size of your company and the makeup of your team), and how to get the best return on investment. To prepare you for choosing a tool, we outline some of the points you should consider in your evaluation process. Technology Support: The ability of the tool to support a wide range of technologies and applications should be a primary consideration. Depending on the complexity of your system and the platforms you work with (e.g., web, desktop, mobile), you need to evaluate how well the tool integrates with your technology stack. Scripting or Programming Requirements: Another key factor is whether the tool requires users to have programming knowledge. If the tool relies heavily on scripting or programming to build and maintain test automation, this may exclude non-technical team members from participating, driving up the total cost of ownership. A no-code or low-code solution can enable greater collaboration across the team. Open-source vs. Licensed: The decision between an open-source tool or a licensed one often comes down to budget and the size of your test case suite. Open-source tools can be more cost-effective for smaller teams, but may come with hidden costs such as longer setup times or a steeper learning curve. Licensed tools might provide faster implementation and more robust support but at a higher cost. It's crucial to weigh these factors based on your team's size and needs. Ease of Use: User-friendliness is crucial, particularly for teams that involve non-technical staff. A tool that is easy to use can accelerate the automation process by allowing more team members to contribute without needing specialized technical skills. This not only reduces bottlenecks but also increases the tool's ROI by lowering the total cost of ownership. Adoption Time: Time-to-value is another consideration. A tool that takes months to implement can cause delays and resistance from stakeholders. On the other hand, a solution with a fast learning curve and easy setup will result in quicker wins and stronger internal buy-in. Customer Support: Reliable and accessible customer support is especially important for tools that are more code-heavy or complex. Without ongoing support, you may end up spending more on external consultants or encountering frustrating delays when issues arise. The right vendor should provide strong customer service to ensure you can get the most out of the tool with minimal roadblocks. End-to-End Testing: Finally, consider the tool's ability to provide end-to-end testing across multiple platforms. Some tools, like Selenium, may be limited to web testing, while others like Leapwork allow you to automate across both web and desktop environments. Comprehensive support for various technologies is key to achieving complete test coverage.

Now, in 2025, integrating home automations into our living spaces is not only possible but also increasingly accessible. From controlling your lights with a simple voice command to having a fully automated security system, these advancements in technology are redefining the essence of a modern home. If you are a homeowner eager to embrace this smart home revolution, this guide is your tailored roadmap. We'll explore the top 9 home automation ideas that can transform your living space, integrating convenience, efficiency, and security seamlessly into your daily routine. Join us as we delve into how you can make your home smarter, safer, and more energy-efficient! Table of Contents What is Smart Home Automation? 9 Cutting-Edge Smart Home Automation Ideas How to Seamlessly Combine All Your Smart Home Devices? Conclusion What is Smart Home Automation? Smart home automation refers to the use of advanced technology to integrate various household devices and systems, allowing for their control and automation through interconnected networks. This innovation enables homeowners to manage aspects like lighting, temperature, security, and entertainment systems remotely, often via a smartphone app or a central home automation hub. It enhances convenience, energy efficiency, and security, making everyday tasks simpler and more efficient. The system is customizable and can be expanded over time, adapting to the changing needs of the user. Benefits of Smart Home Automation The integration of smart technology into the home environment brings a plethora of benefits that enhance daily living. Here are some of the key advantages: *Enhanced Convenience:*Smart home automation simplifies daily tasks. With automation, activities like turning off lights, adjusting thermostats, or locking doors can be done remotely or scheduled in advance, making life more convenient and efficient. *Improved Energy Efficiency:* These systems often lead to considerable energy savings. Smart thermostats and lighting systems adjust themselves based on occupancy or time of day, leading to significant reductions in power consumption and lower utility bills. *Increased Security:*Home automation systems include advanced security features like smart locks, surveillance cameras, and motion detectors. Receive alerts on your phone about unusual activity, and monitor your home remotely, giving you peace of mind whether you're at work or on vacation. 9 Cutting-Edge Smart Home Automation Ideas Building on the benefits we've discussed, let's dive into some of the best home automation ideas that are changing the game in 2025. From voice-activated controls to automated security systems, each idea represents a key step towards a fully integrated smart home experience. 1. Voice-Activated Control Voice-activated devices are at the forefront of home assistant ideas. These systems, powered by voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple's Siri, allow you to manage various home functions like lighting, temperature, and media playback with simple voice commands. They are particularly useful for hands-free operations and accessibility, enhancing the overall smart home experience. 2. Smart Lighting Automation Smart lighting automation is one of the most popular home automation suggestions. Imagine soft, guiding smart night light that gently lights up your path to the bathroom or kitchen at night, ensuring safety without being dazzling. It is not just about automatically turning lights on and off though. It's about creating the perfect ambiance for every moment. With smart lighting, you can adjust brightness, color, and even the warmth or coolness of the light to match your mood or activity. These systems can be programmed to follow your daily routine, like gradually brightening in the morning to wake you up gently or dimming at night for a relaxed atmosphere. 3. Automated Security Systems One of the best home automations revolves around security. Automated security systems integrate surveillance cameras, smart locks, and alarm systems that you can monitor and control remotely, each offering unique features to safeguard your home. Smart security cameras offer high-definition video, night vision capabilities, and even motion detection. Some models provide real-time streaming to your smartphone or tablet, allowing you to monitor your home from anywhere. With features like facial recognition, these cameras can distinguish between known residents and strangers, adding an extra layer of security. Today's alarm systems are highly sophisticated and can detect a range of incidents, from unauthorized entry to smoke and carbon monoxide presence. Upon detection, these systems can alert you via your smartphone, emit loud alarms to deter intruders, and even notify emergency services automatically. Smart locks are revolutionizing the way we think about home entry. Gone are the days of traditional keys; these locks can be operated via smartphone apps, fingerprints, or even voice commands. Advanced video smart lock models, like our eufy Video Smart Lock S330, combine a HD camera, doorbell, and smart lock to offer comprehensive security for your front door. They allow you to get a clear, real-time view of your doorstep from anywhere, lock and unlock remotely, and grant temporary access to visitors without compromising overall security. By combining these components, you can build your own security system tailored to your needs. With security cameras offering surveillance, alarm systems providing instant alerts, and smart locks ensuring secure access, you'll have a fully integrated security solution that offers both convenience and peace of mind. 4. Energy Management Systems Energy management systems in smart homes optimize energy usage for efficiency and cost savings. These systems include smart thermostats, automated lighting, and energy-efficient appliances, which adjust settings based on your habits and presence, reducing energy consumption and lowering utility bills. They offer an eco-friendly approach to living by minimizing your carbon footprint and providing detailed energy usage data. 5. Home Health Monitoring Home health monitoring systems in smart homes cater to health and safety needs, especially for the elderly and those with medical conditions. They include wearable health trackers, emergency alert systems, and environmental sensors that monitor air quality, humidity, and detect potential hazards. These systems track vital signs, remind about medication, and ensure a safe living environment, promoting proactive health management. 6. Smart Appliances Smart appliances are a staple in home automation, providing enhanced convenience and efficiency in household tasks. These interconnected devices, like smart refrigerators, ovens, and washing machines, can be remotely controlled and programmed. They optimize the use of resources, adapt to user preferences, and assist in daily chores, making household management more streamlined and user-friendly. 7. Smart Windows and Blinds Smart windows and blind systems allow for the automatic adjustment of natural light and privacy in your home. Using sensors and timers, they can be programmed to open or close based on the time of day or the amount of sunlight, effectively controlling heat gain and offering energy savings. Security sensors, like our eufy Entry Sensor, can also be integrated into these systems to add an extra layer of safety. These compact devices easily fit onto any window frame. If a forced entry is detected, it triggers a siren and sends instant notifications to your smartphone, providing peace of mind with advanced security measures. 8. Automated Gardening Systems For those with a green thumb, automated gardening systems can cater to your plant care needs autonomously. These systems can regulate watering, sunlight exposure, and even nutrient distribution, making gardening more accessible and less labor-intensive. They are ideal for those who love gardening but have limited time or are new to plant care. 9. Integrated Entertainment Systems Integrated entertainment systems unify audio-visual components under one control system. This integration allows for easy management of TVs, speakers, streaming devices, and other entertainment equipment, creating a cohesive and user-friendly experience for movies, music, gaming, and more. How to Seamlessly Combine All Your Smart Home Devices? After exploring these ideas for home automation, the next crucial step is understanding how to bring these diverse technologies together into a cohesive, smoothly functioning system. Here are some essential tips to ensure seamless combination and synchronization of your smart home devices: *Choose a Central Hub or Platform:* Start by selecting a central hub or platform that is compatible with most, if not all, of your smart home devices. This could be a physical device like eufy HomeBase S380 or Amazon Echo, or a software platform like Apple HomeKit. The hub acts as the brain of your smart home, allowing different devices to communicate with each other. *Use a Unified Interface:* Employ applications that can control multiple devices across different brands and types. Apps like IFTTT (If This Then That) allow you to create custom automations and interactions between various smart devices, enhancing their functionality and your convenience. *Ensure a Strong Network:* A robust and reliable Wi-Fi network is crucial for smart home devices, especially if they are spread across your home. Consider upgrading your router or adding Wi-Fi extenders or mesh networks to ensure strong connectivity in all areas of your home. *Plan for Scalability:* Think about future expansions when setting up your smart home. Choose a system that is scalable, allowing you to add more devices or upgrade existing ones without needing a complete overhaul. Conclusion As we've explored, the realm of smart home automation offers endless possibilities to enhance your living experience. By integrating these home automation ideas, from voice-activated control systems to smart appliances, you can create a home that not only simplifies daily tasks but also provides a higher level of security and energy efficiency. Start with what resonates most with your lifestyle and gradually build up. The future is smart, and with these cool home automation ideas, your home can be too. Transform your living space today!

Now, in 2025, integrating home automations into our living spaces is not only possible but also increasingly accessible. From controlling your lights with a simple voice command to having a fully automated security system, these advancements in technology are redefining the essence of a modern home. If you are a homeowner eager to embrace this smart home revolution, this guide is your tailored roadmap. We'll explore the top 9 home automation ideas that can transform your living space, integrating convenience, efficiency, and security seamlessly into your daily routine. Join us as we delve into how you can make your home smarter, safer, and more energy-efficient! Table of Contents What is Smart Home Automation? 9 Cutting-Edge Smart Home Automation Ideas How to Seamlessly Combine All Your Smart Home Devices? Conclusion What is Smart Home Automation? Smart home automation refers to the use of advanced technology to integrate various household devices and systems, allowing for their control and automation through interconnected networks. This innovation enables homeowners to manage aspects like lighting, temperature, security, and entertainment systems remotely, often via a smartphone app or a central home automation hub. It enhances convenience, energy efficiency, and security, making everyday tasks simpler and more efficient. The system is customizable and can be expanded over time, adapting to the changing needs of the user. Benefits of Smart Home Automation The integration of smart technology into the home environment brings a plethora of benefits that enhance daily living. Here are some of the key advantages: *Enhanced Convenience:*Smart home automation simplifies daily tasks. With automation, activities like turning off lights, adjusting thermostats, or locking doors can be done remotely or scheduled in advance, making life more convenient and efficient. *Improved Energy Efficiency:* These systems often lead to considerable energy savings. Smart thermostats and lighting systems adjust themselves based on occupancy or time of day, leading to significant reductions in power consumption and lower utility bills. *Increased Security:*Home automation systems include advanced security features like smart locks, surveillance cameras, and motion detectors. Receive alerts on your phone about unusual activity, and monitor your home remotely, giving you peace of mind whether you're at work or on vacation. 9 Cutting-Edge Smart Home Automation Ideas Building on the benefits we've discussed, let's dive into some of the best home automation ideas that are changing the game in 2025. From voice-activated controls to automated security systems, each idea represents a key step towards a fully integrated smart home experience. 1. Voice-Activated Control Voice-activated devices are at the forefront of home assistant ideas. These systems, powered by voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple's Siri, allow you to manage various home functions like lighting, temperature, and media playback with simple voice commands. They are particularly useful for hands-free operations and accessibility, enhancing the overall smart home experience. 2. Smart Lighting Automation Smart lighting automation is one of the most popular home automation suggestions. Imagine soft, guiding smart night light that gently lights up your path to the bathroom or kitchen at night, ensuring safety without being dazzling. It is not just about automatically turning lights on and off though. It's about creating the perfect ambiance for every moment. With smart lighting, you can adjust brightness, color, and even the warmth or coolness of the light to match your mood or activity. These systems can be programmed to follow your daily routine, like gradually brightening in the morning to wake you up gently or dimming at night for a relaxed atmosphere. 3. Automated Security Systems One of the best home automations revolves around security. Automated security systems integrate surveillance cameras, smart locks, and alarm systems that you can monitor and control remotely, each offering unique features to safeguard your home. Smart security cameras offer high-definition video, night vision capabilities, and even motion detection. Some models provide real-time streaming to your smartphone or tablet, allowing you to monitor your home from anywhere. With features like facial recognition, these cameras can distinguish between known residents and strangers, adding an extra layer of security. Today's alarm systems are highly sophisticated and can detect a range of incidents, from unauthorized entry to smoke and carbon monoxide presence. Upon detection, these systems can alert you via your smartphone, emit loud alarms to deter intruders, and even notify emergency services automatically. Smart locks are revolutionizing the way we think about home entry. Gone are the days of traditional keys; these locks can be operated via smartphone apps, fingerprints, or even voice commands. Advanced video smart lock models, like our eufy Video Smart Lock S330, combine a HD camera, doorbell, and smart lock to offer comprehensive security for your front door. They allow you to get a clear, real-time view of your doorstep from anywhere, lock and unlock remotely, and grant temporary access to visitors without compromising overall security. By combining these components, you can build your own security system tailored to your needs. With security cameras offering surveillance, alarm systems providing instant alerts, and smart locks ensuring secure access, you'll have a fully integrated security solution that offers both convenience and peace of mind. 4. Energy Management Systems Energy management systems in smart homes optimize energy usage for efficiency and cost savings. These systems include smart thermostats, automated lighting, and energy-efficient appliances, which adjust settings based on your habits and presence, reducing energy consumption and lowering utility bills. They offer an eco-friendly approach to living by minimizing your carbon footprint and providing detailed energy usage data. 5. Home Health Monitoring Home health monitoring systems in smart homes cater to health and safety needs, especially for the elderly and those with medical conditions. They include wearable health trackers, emergency alert systems, and environmental sensors that monitor air quality, humidity, and detect potential hazards. These systems track vital signs, remind about medication, and ensure a safe living environment, promoting proactive health management. 6. Smart Appliances Smart appliances are a staple in home automation, providing enhanced convenience and efficiency in household tasks. These interconnected devices, like smart refrigerators, ovens, and washing machines, can be remotely controlled and programmed. They optimize the use of resources, adapt to user preferences, and assist in daily chores, making household management more streamlined and user-friendly. 7. Smart Windows and Blinds Smart windows and blind systems allow for the automatic adjustment of natural light and privacy in your home. Using sensors and timers, they can be programmed to open or close based on the time of day or the amount of sunlight, effectively controlling heat gain and offering energy savings. Security sensors, like our eufy Entry Sensor, can also be integrated into these systems to add an extra layer of safety. These compact devices easily fit onto any window frame. If a forced entry is detected, it triggers a siren and sends instant notifications to your smartphone, providing peace of mind with advanced security measures. 8. Automated Gardening Systems For those with a green thumb, automated gardening systems can cater to your plant care needs autonomously. These systems can regulate watering, sunlight exposure, and even nutrient distribution, making gardening more accessible and less labor-intensive. They are ideal for those who love gardening but have limited time or are new to plant care. 9. Integrated Entertainment Systems Integrated entertainment systems unify audio-visual components under one control system. This integration allows for easy management of TVs, speakers, streaming devices, and other entertainment equipment, creating a cohesive and user-friendly experience for movies, music, gaming, and more. How to Seamlessly Combine All Your Smart Home Devices? After exploring these ideas for home automation, the next crucial step is understanding how to bring these diverse technologies together into a cohesive, smoothly functioning system. Here are some essential tips to ensure seamless combination and synchronization of your smart home devices: *Choose a Central Hub or Platform:* Start by selecting a central hub or platform that is compatible with most, if not all, of your smart home devices. This could be a physical device like eufy HomeBase S380 or Amazon Echo, or a software platform like Apple HomeKit. The hub acts as the brain of your smart home, allowing different devices to communicate with each other. *Use a Unified Interface:* Employ applications that can control multiple devices across different brands and types. Apps like IFTTT (If This Then That) allow you to create custom automations and interactions between various smart devices, enhancing their functionality and your convenience. *Ensure a Strong Network:* A robust and reliable Wi-Fi network is crucial for smart home devices, especially if they are spread across your home. Consider upgrading your router or adding Wi-Fi extenders or mesh networks to ensure strong connectivity in all areas of your home. *Plan for Scalability:* Think about future expansions when setting up your smart home. Choose a system that is scalable, allowing you to add more devices or upgrade existing ones without needing a complete overhaul. Conclusion As we've explored, the realm of smart home automation offers endless possibilities to enhance your living experience. By integrating these home automation ideas, from voice-activated control systems to smart appliances, you can create a home that not only simplifies daily tasks but also provides a higher level of security and energy efficiency. Start with what resonates most with your lifestyle and gradually build up. The future is smart, and with these cool home automation ideas, your home can be too. Transform your living space today!

After another in an endless series of “software updates” to the windows DOS, it would be great to have a program that would run to fix all the issues the update has introduced. The ability to restore a working windows OS appears to have disappeared as a simple solution. Topping the list would be to insure all peripheral and internal addon hardware was still working property. DVD/CD drives, audio cards, etc. and any non-standard products required to use the computer system should be tested for operation and restored if a problem is detected. Second would be to repeat the same process on a user entered list of programs required for productive computer use. Here the problem is one of compatible operation when a change in the OS is made. Where does the Machine Learning (ML) come in? As the utility searches and possibly finds a solution to the problems the update introduced, it would build a “cloud” database of “Problem Solutions”. Future users who run the utility would benefit from the data gathered via unsupervised ML to fix the update damage introduced. The database would include the system specifications, peripheral/internal product information, a rating value of some kind and a solution to restoring it. That might mean updating a specific driver, changing a windows parameter(s) and/or printing a “change settings” list for the user to perform on the now non-working addon to regain compatibility. If no solution is found, it would be placed in to a summary report for the user to examine when the utility finished.
