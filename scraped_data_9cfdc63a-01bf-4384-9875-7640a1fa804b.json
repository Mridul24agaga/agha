  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, so let’s break this down. You hit me with a URL—https://playpickups.app/—and I’m gonna take a wild guess about what’s going on over there, like we’re just kicking it and chatting over some cold ones. First off, I see the word \"play\" in the URL. That’s usually a good sign that there’s something fun happening. I’m thinking this site might be focused on games or some kind of interactive experience—maybe it’s a platform where you can engage with friends or fellow gamers. It might be an app that pulls people in for some casual gaming or competitions. You know, like picking teams or creating fantasy leagues or something along those lines. Now, the “pickups” part feels a little mysterious, right? It’s got that vibe of grabbing something fun or maybe selecting players or items. So, this could be a site where you can strategize and choose your squad for a fantasy game, or maybe it revolves around selecting your favorite characters in multiplayer setups. There’s definitely a community aspect here, where you can connect with others who are on the same wavelength—like sharing your picks and getting into friendly competitions. Given that it’s an app, I’d bet it probably has some slick features, maybe allowing users to track their stats or compete in real-time games. I can picture guys and gals hopping on their phones or tablets, checking in to see how their picks are performing, maybe even engaging in some banter in the chat sections or forums. That kind of social interaction always spices things up, right? In today’s digital world, it wouldn’t be surprising if Playpickups has that element of gamification. Like, there could be rewards for making great picks or even leaderboards showing who’s crushing it in the game. Picture a mix of competition and camaraderie, where you can show off your skills while also hanging out with your buddies. It’s like everyone’s having a good time while getting a little bit competitive. Plus, I can’t help but wonder if they’ve integrated some cool features like live updates or notifications to keep you in the loop about your picks and how they’re doing in the game. Imagine being at a bar, enjoying the game, and getting alerts on your phone about your fantasy picks lighting it up on the scoreboard. That could really amp up the excitement, and you’d definitely want to share that victory with your crew! Overall, it sounds like Playpickups is aiming to create an engaging space where players can both play and strategize together—sort of like a modern-day hangout for gamers. Whether it’s a casual experience or a more competitive showdown, it seems to be about bringing people together to have some fun with games and picks. So yeah, that’s my take on it! Could be a cool spot to dive into if you’re into gaming, competitive picking, or just chilling with friends while enjoying some digital fun. Let’s hope Tavily gets it together with the scraping so we can see what the hype is really about! Cheers!",

On the other hand, \"game night\" might be a touch stressful if you're in a competitive mood. While you hope the evening goes off without a hitch and that everyone has fun, you can't help but feel the need to prove yourself. You can have fun with your pals on game night without fail if you follow these simple guidelines. Your game night plan is vital, from picking out the correct games to having enough food. Whether you're the host or a participant, here are some ways to dominate game night, leaving those around you with fond memories and encouraging the type of friendship that thrives on healthy competition and shared laughter. Choose perfect games Everybody loves a good game night, and the games are when the fun really starts. Recognize the nature of the group dynamic. For example, some of your friends may thrive on tactical card games, while others would rather test their mettle with a trivia game. Make sure to choose those games that suit your friends’ interests and level of competition. Choose a timeless classic like Monopoly or any of these top IP board games to introduce your friends to game evenings. Word games like Words with Friends and Scrabble are great options for gathering bibliophiles. Make sure everyone plays by the rules by deciding whether words should be unscrambled manually or automatically. If you want a helpful tool for unscrambling words, take a look at Unscramblex.com, which can help you find the highest-scoring words. Always have a variety of games ready to go to accommodate varying energy levels and moods so that game night stays interesting all the way through. Organize a cozy and welcoming environment Choose gentle lighting that lets you see the cards but isn’t so harsh that you can’t relax. Bring a lot of plush chairs and plenty of cushions to make everyone feel comfortable. It is important that your friends feel at ease so that they can relax and enjoy themselves. Make sure there are free routes between the various places of play in the gaming room. Clear the gaming area of any objects that may distract your focus from the gameplay. A cozy and inviting environment plays an important role in the game night’s organization, so don’t forget to carefully arrange it. Schedule One important yet quite challenging task is to figure out when everyone is available. Organizing a host’s schedule is always a challenge, and board game evenings are no exception. Depending on the number of friends you’ve invited, making a choice can take some time. However, it is a good idea to start a group chat or create a calendar. Striking a reasonable balance between being accommodating and forceful is key to ensuring that all people involved feel like they have achieved a mutually beneficial agreement. Food and drinks Food and drinks are staples at every gathering. You certainly don’t want a bunch of angry, hungry, and thirsty people around you. To sidestep that problem and keep your friends entertained, stock up on food and beverages. Finger foods, sweets, or pizza are all fair game unless they are too oily and there are not enough napkins available. Also, a lot of board games suffer terrible spills and stains every year, and the last thing you want is for your collection to be destroyed this way. Make sure you have enough napkins, wet tissues, and other stuff available to make sure everyone has a nice meal. Establish rules Introduce your friends to the game by doing this: For the sake of clarity, take a minute to lay down some ground rules everyone must follow. Promote excellent sportsmanship by stressing the need to treat each other with respect and play by the rules. Make sure everyone knows the rules of the game, how to handle disagreements, and whether there will be house rules. To avoid any one game taking over the night, it could be a good idea to impose a time restriction for each game. You may try out different games in this way, and everyone will get a chance to play and have fun. Bring in some competition spirit A good dose of friendly rivalry may live up to game night, even if the main goal is to relax and enjoy each other’s company. Inspire some healthy competition among your visitors, but stress that coming out as a winner isn’t paramount. What matters is that everyone has a great time. Think about switching up the teams or switching up who plays in each game to keep things level throughout the night. That way, no one can dominate the competition and everyone can have a chance to shine. Quick reminders Having a backup game is a great luxury. Games might be ineffective at times. Perhaps the time, the group dynamic, or the game itself is to blame. Just in case—no need to be concerned. The games of charades and taboos are usually ones that everyone can pick up and play. Be Yourself: Hosts might lose sight of what it's like to play the game if they let themselves too much into hosting. When you enjoy yourself, your visitors will follow suit. Relax and enjoy the night without worrying about being the host. Finally, some suggestions: You should always ask for feedback on the night's success or failure at its conclusion. When people recommend games, always listen to them, so you can make better decisions the next time around. Digital invitations Digital invitations are a practical and easy way to inform people about your game night. Choose a design that effectively communicates the ambiance of the event to your attendees, whether it be through a coordinated color scheme or an expression of the game event’s spirit. Are you ready to invigorate your evening with some competitive excitement? Have a great time, invite your friends, and provide a small selection of refreshments. There are many ideas on how to organize the most enjoyable game party, and careful attention to details that really matter is something that can make your game night a complete success and one your friends will remember for years to come. 0 Comments family, healthyliving, Parties You may also like Neon Party Decor: Creating Unforgettable Celebrations Read more What Grooms and Groomsmen Should Wear for a Beach Ceremony Read more Dream Wedding Venues in Port Melbourne: Your Ultimate Guide Read more Previous Home Next Would you like to comment?

Why Should You Host a Game Night? There are so many reasons to host a fun night at home playing games with your friends. Game nights are a great way to reconnect with friends. Life is busy, and it’s easy to lose touch with people, so getting together is always a good idea. Plus, it’s usually more affordable to stay in than go out. Here are a few more reasons you need to host an adult game night: encourage some friendly competition celebrate a special occasion bond with adult children unplug from technology opportunity to get creative with the theme try new games make memories What’s a Fun Adult Game Night Theme Choosing a cohesive theme gives your guests a hint of what’s to come for the evening. The theme also helps you when planning how you want to decorate for your party. You can choose a theme that aligns with the games you will play during your get-together. I went with the classics since my game night included many traditional games. Here are some more game night themes to consider: casino night murder mystery trivia challenge decades-themed game night escape room game show night Hollywood game night minute to win it board game bonanza What’s an Easy Way to Style a Game Night Table If you’ll serve food before the games begin, keep your place settings simple so that clean-up is quick and easy. Coordinate your tableware with your theme so that everything matches and enhances the atmosphere of your party. The wood chargers on my table mirror the wooden game pieces in the centerpiece, and the gold flatware matches the gold votive candle holders. A black plate and neutral striped napkin complement the fabric checkerboard and bring texture to the table design. What Game Pieces Make Good Party Decor Shop your home before you head out to the stores to purchase party decor. What’s better than using game pieces you already have as props to enhance your theme? Fill inexpensive glass cylinder vases with poker chips, dominos, scrabble tiles, and cards. Gotta love free party decor! Hang playing cards from a light fixture for a unique game night decoration. Use a hole punch in the corner of each card and tie it to the chandelier with twine or ribbon. It’s so easy and cheap. You can also DIY game night decor like banners and signs to coordinate with your theme. What Personal Touch Can You Add for Guests Personalize each place setting with an oldie but goodie…Scrabble. Spell out each guest’s name with Scrabble tiles and place them on a rack for a unique place card. You can buy extra Scrabble racks and tiles on Amazon for crafting or party decor. If you’re crafty, you can also make place cards for your table settings or download a free template like this one. Where Will You Host a Game Night You’ll need to decide where you’ll host your game night, considering both space and comfort. Depending on the number of guests you have, you may want to set up more than one table so that there is enough room to play. My dining room chairs are padded, so they’re comfortable to sit in for hours while playing games. You can also rotate locations for different games as the night progresses. What Should You Serve During a Game Night Party Offer your guests snacks and drinks throughout your party. You may want to set up a snack station or buffet so that everyone can help themselves during your event. Consider serving finger foods that are easy to eat while playing games. Themed snacks would be a fun addition as well. Anne’s yummy snack mix is the perfect food to serve during my classic game night. It’s a classic snack filled with Chex, pretzels, M&Ms, and more, matching the classic theme. Serve classic cocktails like Martini or Tom Collins and Coca-Cola or Shirley Temples for your non-drinking guests. How to Set the Vibe for Your Party Whenever we have a game night, we always have the music playing in the background. Be sure to set the mood for your party with some upbeat tunes. A classic-themed game night is begging for some good old classic rock and roll, don’t you think? You’ll probably want all the lights on if you’re playing board games so that your guests can see well, but that doesn’t mean you can’t light a few candles on the table for some ambiance. What Games Should You Play The games that you’ll play during your game night will likely go with the theme of your party. I recommend having various games available for different tastes and group sizes. A mix of classic games, card games, and new, trending options would be perfect. I set out a variety of traditional games that coordinated with my classic game night theme. Classic games include: Yahtzee Connect Four Battleship Monopoly Sequence (my personal favorite) Scrabble Jenga Dominos Poker Mexican Train Dominos Risk Clue Sorry The games that were used in my table centerpiece are also great to incorporate during your party. A quick game of Jenga gets everyone’s energy levels up after a long game that requires more concentration. Games like charades, trivia questions, or timed challenges can be done between longer games. How to Host an Unforgettable Game Night If you incorporate these nine winning strategies, you’ll have a successful adult game night that your friends will talk about for a long time. Here’s a recap of the 9 tips to host the best game night ever: Choose a theme Style a fun tablescape Use game pieces for decor Personalize place settings Provide comfortable seating Keep snacks and drinks flowing Set the mood with music and lighting Have a variety of games available Incorporate mini-games between rounds What Questions Do You Have about Hosting a Game Night?

It’s a chance to connect and get to know one another in a meaningful way. Some Fridays we play various activities and quick fun office games to play in the office. Other Fridays, we go around the table and share personal and company highs for the week. This allows everyone to stay in tune with what is going on with the business and to celebrate each other’s success (oftentimes they turn into a big love fest!).

We also like to break up the year by attending things like Comic Con in Minneapolis and take some time of our “grueling” day jobs with another very popular rock-paper-scissors tournament. As you might imagine, the grueling comment was sarcastic! Promoting a fun environment gives people a reason to get up every day and do their best, not because you are working for a paycheck, but because you are working to help the friends beside you do well in the broader arena of finding a work/life balance while building lasting relationships.

Werewolf is a great way for people to loosen up and casually accuse each other of being a blood-thirsty werewolf that has been killing the villagers while they sleep. You can find the rules here. Eat Poop, You Cat is essentially telephone Pictionary. Each person writes down a phrase, passes it to the left. The person must then draw a picture based on the phrase, then fold the paper over so the phrase is hidden. Once it’s passed to the left, the next person must write a phrase based on the drawing. You continue to pass the paper until you get yours back. Another awesome way to get people laughing together!” Werewolf at TINYPulse HQ Next step to get started: Choose your challenge and learn the rules: Mafia, Eat Poop You Cat, and Werewolf. 24) Weekly Trivia “Use trivia to create far from trivial bonds.” Trivia is a lot of fun.

They settled on “asynchronous” weekly trivia contests. “The weekly trivia contests from Water Cooler Trivia has promoted some healthy competition between our team members when we compete for the top three positions. Sharing laughs about the questions that stump us gives us a fun start to the work week. I even recently learned through the trivia contests that an international World Toilet Day actually exists! Since our team has members that are based in the UK and other parts of the world, it’s great to see a mix of questions that aren’t all US-centric, and it’s great that the quizzes are open for an entire day so people can fit it into their schedule.” Next step to get started: Get support for your weekly trivia habit. 25) Conference Table Ice Curling “Discover yet another use for that old conference table.” You don’t need ice, brooms, or even massive rocks to get the experience of ice curling on a conference table.

If they know absolutely nothing at all, then they can at least tell a good or hilarious story about what they imagined might have happened. Put a spin on it: Add an employee engagement spin by turning this event into YOUR Drunk History, where participants guess details about each other’s personal history.

Think you can keep your cool under extreme pressure? Find out by daring to enter an escape room. You and your team will bond as you work together to pursue your ultimate goal: freedom. Choose your adventure to wind up in anything from an art museum to a remote jungle. Put a spin on it: Have everyone create a character that they must embody throughout the entire challenge. Here is what one group of coworkers thought after solving an escape room together, “Our group just completed their 4th escape room and this one was our favorite!!! So far we’ve done; the playground, gold rush, special ops, and the heist! The heist was our favorite partially because of JACOB!!! He is amazing and so much fun to have as a remote guide. He allowed us to really think about what we needed to do, which is the whole enjoyment of Escape Rooms! Thanks to EVERYONE involved at this location!!! Y’all are great!!! We’ve had a blast every time! See you in a few weeks!!!” Next step to get started: Don’t wait — the sooner you get in trouble, the sooner you can escape. 33) Office Fitness “Experience the joy of wordless bonding.” Personal genomics company 23andMe makes onsite fitness activities and treadmill desks available to their employees to get the blood flowing during the workday.

Perfect for celebrating milestones, sparking collaboration, or just unwinding, these games ensure remote doesn’t mean disconnected. So log in, gear up, and let the virtual fun begin! 11) Clue Murder Mystery “Channel your inner detective.” Even the latest page-turning crime thriller won’t immerse you as much as this virtual mystery. During this event, you actually get to live inside the mystery. It combines video conferencing and a specially designed app to make every aspect of solving the mystery, from examining clues to reviewing case files, flow perfectly. Put a spin on it: Debrief after the mystery and assign everyone funny “superlatives” based on how they contributed to the solution. (Ex: Most likely to suspect everyone.) This Office Game at Work – Facebook The team at Facebook recently explored this office activity and found some initial success. Check out their testimonial here. “Our point of contact at Outback provided top-notch customer service by reaching out to me immediately after booking, as well as following up with me several days before our event and after our event. He helped me get up to speed with the app and the event and was super professional. I also loved how easy it was to pay for our event and get all of the details to print out and to run the event. Whoever decided on Clue Murder Mystery is great!” Next step to get started: Don’t let them get away with it. 12) Virtual Code Break “It’s like HIIT for your brain.” Do you have what it takes to be a master codebreaker? Put your skills to the test during this virtual session packed with trivia, riddles, and puzzles to dizzy your intellect. Put a spin on it: Tell everyone to come prepared with a riddle. Pause the game clock at random so teammates can challenge teammates with even more mind-bending fun. This Office Game at Work – Swiss Re Here is what Swiss Re said about their recent office team building activity, “The Virtual Code Break scenarios were quite challenging and fun. The teams had a great time solving them. Your team provided great support to ensure we had what we needed for the event to be successful.” Next step to get started: Face the ultimate code-breaking challenge. 13) Virtual Office Games “It’s actually all fun and games.” Why choose between games when you can experience a spectacular combination of all your favorite virtual team-building activities? Remote teams will delight in a series of drawing prompts, trivia questions, and video challenges. Put a spin on it: Choose an amount of time (say, 5, 10, or 15 minutes) and agree to break for a dance party at those intervals. This Office Game at Work – Intel After their most recent office game competition, Christine Smessaert from Intel had this to say about the event, “Everyone enjoyed their experience with you guys at our team building event. We are discussing having another event for our Capital Partners. When I have more details/a decision, I will reach back out!” Next step to get started: Did someone say virtual office games? Book an event here. 14) Office Olympics “You won’t get any medals, but you’ll make gold memories.” Bust out your home country mini flags. You’re about to dive into a virtual tribute of all things Olympics. Test your knowledge with trivia and taste an Olympian’s thirst for competition with a series of challenges. Put a spin on it: Have everyone share throwback pictures of themselves either being athletic or trying to be athletic. This Office Game at Work – Medtronic The team at Medtronic talked about their most recent experience with Outback Team Building’s Virtual Office Olympics: “It was fun for all of us. It brought us together across geographies — working together as teams and having a lot of fun. We really saw some skills that we didn’t know each other had. And you know what, a little competition, and a lot of fun.” Next step to get started: Grab that torch. Your team is waiting. Fun Office Games Turn your office into a buzz of excitement with fun games that shake up the routine! With a little planning, your next office event or conference room meeting can become a memorable team bonding experience. These ideas include team building events, workplace celebrations, or midweek boredom busters, fun office games are the secret to a happier, more connected workplace. Let the games and laughter begin! 15) “Chat n’ Chew” “Chew on delicious food and brilliant ideas.” Shared with us by a BrightFire staffer, this idea is similar to a classic lunch and learn, where everyone gathers to eat lunch and learn new things. The “Chat n’ Chew” aligns more with a classic team-building activity because you learn from your team members. Instead of bringing in an outside expert, invite your co-workers to share new ideas or explain new technologies they’re excited about. Put a spin on it: Maximize the teamwork aspect by inviting groups to collaborate on and pitch ideas during the session while enjoying a curated employee care package. This Office Game at Work – BrightFire Hannah Day shows us how BrightFire gets creative with their office fun: Some of the favorite activities here at BrightFire are weekly Yoga sessions, and a “Chat n’ Chew” where we discuss new ideas, or new technologies over a catered lunch and swag give aways! Our close-knit and friendly feeling lends to an open-minded atmosphere for every one to bring forward ideas and new concepts. Next step to get started: Make sure the centerpiece of this office event — the food — is delicious and healthy: 16) Doggie Play Date “The dog days are so not over.” Doggos hanging out at SnackNation HQ! Bring dogs to work to brighten up the office and provide for the best kinds of work breaks (in the form of petting and wagging tails). It also brings employees together as they stop by each other’s desks, meet the pups, and schedule doggie play dates. Put a spin on it: Create an office bulletin board or Slack channel for employees to share funny photos of their beloved pets! This quote from a Time magazine article explains why pets make good office mates: “Dogs in the workplace provide more social support for employees, as well as more opportunities for coworkers to interact in a positive setting, according to a number of studies.” Next step to get started: Get that pet policy in order. Check out this beautiful pooch from the University Partners office in Dallas, Texas! 17) Guess the Coworker Guess the Coworker is a fun team building game perfect for larger offices. Employees try to guess who the mystery coworker is based on clues provided by the team. 👶 Baby Picture Version: Players can submit baby photos of themselves and the team must match each person to their baby photo. 💃🏻 Celebrity Doppelgänger: Write down celebrity names that resemble each of your coworkers and see who can correctly guess the most. Put a spin on it: Have a bonus round with fun questions related to the mystery coworker. This Office Game at Work: Beech-Nut Nutrition Company Employees at Beech-Nut Nutrition Company had a blast playing Guess the Coworker “Baby Picture Version” and it turned out to be a great office game: Next step to get started: Ask your team to submit baby photos and celebrity doppelgangers for the game. 18) Taco Tuesday – With Trivia “An event so awesome, you can’t say it ten times fast: TacoTuesdayTrivia.” It’s happy hour, Taco Tuesday (or any night of the week if you want to cheat), and trivia night all rolled into one spectacular event of awesomeness. Bring everyone, even people from different teams, together. If they can’t bond over a shared taste for taco toppings then they can at least bond during trivia. Put a spin on it: Involve everyone, including people with families and those who don’t do happy hours, by doing the same event during the lunch break and with work-related trivia. This Office Game at Work – Swag.com We spoke with John Giunta, VP of Marketing at Swag.com, to find out what fun office activities they play. This is what he told us: “At Swag.com we have a monthly afterwork Happy Hour where we try to incorporate games and team activities. We usually alternate months between going out and doing activities in the office. Recently we stayed in for a team trivia and taco night where we mixed-up the teams across departments to help people get to know each better. We are a quickly growing team, so these happy hours are great way for new members to meet gain talk with co-workers that haven’t spent much time with and the team activities and games can help break the ice.” Next step to get started: Get your trivia games and ideas in order. Friday Games & Activities Say goodbye to boring Fridays and hello to a team tradition that ends the week with a bang. Friday games like trivia quizzes, scavenger hunts, and karaoke contests turn TGIF into a full-blown celebration. Whether you’re in-office or remote, these activities boost morale, strengthen relationships, and keep the energy high. Forget boring handshakes and quiet goodbyes—leave work smiling and ready for the weekend. Companies that embrace Friday fun show their teams they care, and employees return the favor with engagement and loyalty. Make Fridays unforgettable—it’s the best kind of office magic! 19) Karaoke “Sound bad. Feel good.” It’s time to shine or at least try to. Grow at least a million times closer to your team by embarrassing yourself with a round of karaoke. If you happen to be a good singer, then sit back and enjoy watching your co-workers’ jaws drop. Put a spin on it: Pair this event with a chili cook-off. (This covers the food for the singers and the entertainment for the dinner crowd.) This Office Game at Work – Hack Reactor Hack Reactor is a boot camp where programmers become software engineers in 12 weeks. They’re a group of hard-working individuals, but they also know how to have fun, says Jared Neil: “At CUSL we always love to have a good time together after work singing karaoke, hosting talent shows, movie nights, scavenger hunts, ice cream socials as well as casino night just to name a few! We work hard, play hard, and eat healthily!” Next step to get started: Starting making the karaoke setlist of your dreams. 20) Virtual Taboo “Shh…Can’t say that!” A classic board game upgraded to the virtual world with a Zoom-friendly activity that any and all employees can jump into and participate in. To play the game, players will use the online platform to get their team members to guess the word at the top of each card, without using any of the other related Taboo words listed underneath. It’s really that simple! Put a spin on it: Try out one of their themed games to celebrate a special time of the year! Here is what Katie at Dropbox said about her recent Taboo experience, Our team took a break in the day to play Taboo via Confetti and had a blast! We all got to know each other a little better, on a very silly level. Next step to get started: Keep on guessing with Taboo! 21) Lunch & Learn & Game “Combine learning and play to achieve office-fun equilibrium.” Another variation on the classic lunch and learn is the lunch and learn and game. You eat. You learn. You play. It’s that simple. The details of each are totally up to you. For example, you could eat ice cream sundaes while learning about the decimation of natural gorilla habitats and playing a game of Jenga. Put a spin on it: Have three different people select the three main components of this event (the lunch, the learning, and the games) — no collusion allowed! The resulting activity will be a delightful mashup of their preferences and personalities. This Office Game at Work – monday.com Omri Itzhak at monday.com explained how Friday (ironically enough) is always a fun day to be at their office: A favorite monday.com office activity is getting together every Friday for team lunches, which are held on the rooftop floor of our building with an incredible view of downtown. It’s a chance to connect and get to know one another in a meaningful way. Some Fridays we play various activities and quick fun office games to play in the office. Other Fridays, we go around the table and share personal and company highs for the week. This allows everyone to stay in tune with what is going on with the business and to celebrate each other’s success (oftentimes they turn into a big love fest!). The best part of Friday lunches is the initiation activity that all the new team members have to partake in. We’d share, but it’s a company secret! Monday Team Lunch Next step to get started: Pick your lineup of games and activities that lead to fun at work. 22) Rock, paper, scissors competition “Keep your poker face. Show your rock, paper, scissors face.” Rock, paper, scissors is a brilliant office activity. It’s fun. It requires no equipment. Almost everyone already knows how to play, and if they don’t, it won’t take long to get them up to speed. You don’t even have to plan this competition in advance. Just blow a whistle and tell everyone it’s game time. Put a spin on it: Whether you’re competing virtually or in person, you can combine this competition with a happy hour to see if libations inspire anyone to change up their strategy. This Office Game at Work – FUN.com If you get competitive playing Rock Paper Scissors, then you’ll love what Marlon Heimerl over at FUN.com told me about their company: Rock Paper Scissors Contest At FUN.com you might imagine we’re all about promoting a Fun-loving culture.. Not only do we have an annual Mario Kart tournament and an annual Nerf Gun war, but we have an entire room dedicated to gaming on breaks. We also like to break up the year by attending things like Comic Con in Minneapolis and take some time of our “grueling” day jobs with another very popular rock-paper-scissors tournament. As you might imagine, the grueling comment was sarcastic! Promoting a fun environment gives people a reason to get up every day and do their best, not because you are working for a paycheck, but because you are working to help the friends beside you do well in the broader arena of finding a work/life balance while building lasting relationships. Next step to get started: Be prepared. Get the official rules of rock, paper, scissors. Small Office Games & Activities Small offices, big fun! Quick games like “Two Truths and a Lie,” scavenger hunts, and desk-decorating contests turn any small space into a hotspot for laughs and connection. These activities are budget-friendly, easy to organize, and perfect for breaking up the monotony. Think of them as microbursts of joy that boost morale, spark collaboration, and bring your team closer together. Small office games prove that you don’t need a big team to have a big impact. Easy to setup, quick to explain, these ideas are designed for meetings, icebreaker activities, warm ups, or to mix things up during an event. 23) Deduction Games “It’s pretty much the opposite of a trust fall.” Pick your favorite form of trickery mind games, such as Mafia, Eat Poop You Cat, and Werewolf, to embark on an adventure of laughter, treachery, and both big and little lies, all told in the name of fun. Get to know who spins the most clever lies and also who can spit them out while looking you straight in the eye. Put a spin on it: Set up a laptop or webcam to capture all the silly faces people make when they’re trying to trick each other. This Office Game at Work – TINYpulse What the people at TINYpulse say about these games: “One of our favorite activities at TINYpulse is playing simple games like Werewolf or Eat Poop, You Cat. Werewolf is a great way for people to loosen up and casually accuse each other of being a blood-thirsty werewolf that has been killing the villagers while they sleep. You can find the rules here. Eat Poop, You Cat is essentially telephone Pictionary. Each person writes down a phrase, passes it to the left. The person must then draw a picture based on the phrase, then fold the paper over so the phrase is hidden. Once it’s passed to the left, the next person must write a phrase based on the drawing. You continue to pass the paper until you get yours back. Another awesome way to get people laughing together!” Werewolf at TINYPulse HQ Next step to get started: Choose your challenge and learn the rules: Mafia, Eat Poop You Cat, and Werewolf. 24) Weekly Trivia “Use trivia to create far from trivial bonds.” Trivia is a lot of fun. Trivia that’s actually based on you and your co-workers is absolutely unforgettable. Take a variety of trivia quizzes and then peruse (and laugh about) the results to turn your work team into a family. Put a spin on it: Ice cream and icebreaker games. Warm up the team with some sugar and a few casual icebreakers before you immerse them in a test of random knowledge. This Office Game at Work – Accredible Kim Lao from Accredible is on a team that spans continents, so it was important that they could find some type of activity that would allow folks on either side of the Atlantic to participate. They settled on “asynchronous” weekly trivia contests. “The weekly trivia contests from Water Cooler Trivia has promoted some healthy competition between our team members when we compete for the top three positions. Sharing laughs about the questions that stump us gives us a fun start to the work week. I even recently learned through the trivia contests that an international World Toilet Day actually exists! Since our team has members that are based in the UK and other parts of the world, it’s great to see a mix of questions that aren’t all US-centric, and it’s great that the quizzes are open for an entire day so people can fit it into their schedule.” Next step to get started: Get support for your weekly trivia habit. 25) Conference Table Ice Curling “Discover yet another use for that old conference table.” You don’t need ice, brooms, or even massive rocks to get the experience of ice curling on a conference table. Just rally your teams and create flat targets, even with something simple like Post-Its® for example, on opposite ends of a table. Take turns sliding rocks or really any slidable objects (Matchbox cars, coasters, or snack bars) toward the targets. The goal is simply getting as close to the target as possible. Put a spin on it: The losing team gets to challenge the winning team to a dare of their choice. This Office Game at Work – Objective Liz Van Camp told SnackNation about an epic monthly tournament the company competes in: At Objective, we have a monthly ‘Office Olympics’ tournament. The entire office gets to participate and relax while we hold the competition that afternoon. It has been a ton of fun and Events include the following, to name a few: Water Balloon Toss Nerf Shootout Conference Table ‘Ice Curling’ Dizzy Dash (where after being spun around with your eyes closed, you see how far you can walk/run down a curb in 10 seconds without falling off) This monthly competition brings the entire office together and keeps everyone laughing, but still trying their best, since the winner receives a prize. It’s the activity everyone most looks forward to each month. It also helps to break things up a bit and to encourage a fun atmosphere in the office. Next step to get started: Get an out-of-the-box game board if you want to be fancy. 26) Drunk History “One person’s history is another person’s comedy.” Inspired by the beloved Comedy Central series, this activity is more about testing your improv skills than your knowledge of history. The point is to have fun, not to be right about everything. Participants will be challenged to relay details about historical events. If they know absolutely nothing at all, then they can at least tell a good or hilarious story about what they imagined might have happened. Put a spin on it: Add an employee engagement spin by turning this event into YOUR Drunk History, where participants guess details about each other’s personal history. This Office Game at Work – Point 72 Catie Cribbin and her team at Point 72 loved the flexibility to run a virtual event with her entire team in her testimonial, Thanks for reaching out. The team loved the event we hosted in June! It was a great way to get to know each other and have fun while doing so. I am actually looking to host an end of summer event as well – can you tell me more about the Scavenger Hunt and if it’s possible to do that in a virtual setting? Next step to get started: Start laughing at past experiences with Drunk History! 27) Old School Videogame day “Get ready to game like it’s 1999.” Time to dig through your closets and your attics. Dust off those vintage Nintendo consoles, Playstations, and maybe even a rare sighting of Sega. New consoles are welcome too of course. The only rule to this activity is that everyone comes together to play or at least cheer gamers on. Put a spin on it: Come up with a silly challenge or victory dance people must complete each time they level up. This Office Game at Work – Greenvelope Alex Kelsey at Greenvelope reached out to SnackNation with these fantastic ways they create an enjoyable work environment: The Greenvelope.com team works hard, but we also know the importance of stepping away from the computer and having some fun during the day. Daily foosball tournaments are never missed, and are occasionally supplemented by a corn hole tournament on our custom Greenvelope set. Weekly happy hours bring the team together, whether we are experimenting with new recipes and cocktails, crafting for the holidays, or exploring downtown Seattle’s bar and restaurant scene. The newest addition to the office is a Nintendo 64, so you know there are Mario Kart championships going down on the regs. And our CEO, Sam Franklin, also included the perfect dose of zen by including a yoga room in our new office, complete with workout equipment to help us de-stress or get a little workout in during the day. Office N64 Next step to get started: Getting excited during a visit to the virtual Museum of Mario. Office Games For Large Groups Are you managing a large team? Games for big groups bring everyone together for unforgettable moments. Try interactive activities like office trivia, “Minute to Win It” challenges, or a murder mystery game that turns coworkers into sleuths. For something more physical, organize office Olympics with quirky events like chair races or paper toss competitions. These games boost morale, encourage teamwork, and create bonds across departments. Large group games are also ideal for annual celebrations or quarterly team-building events. They prove that big teams can have even bigger fun while staying connected. 28) Hungry, Hungry Ninjas “Bring a classic board game to life.” Invented by a team at Bigcommerce, this super physical, super collaborative activity will get your team from zero to laughter in record time, even after a long workday. Basically, you play the classic board game, Hungry, Hungry Hippos, but you (with the help of a skateboard) are the hippo, your mouth is a laundry basket, your food are balloons, and the world is your game board. Put a spin on it: Boost the camaraderie factor with matching team uniforms or jerseys. This Office Game at Work – Bigcommerce Here’s how Bigcommerce’s Austin office unwinds at work according to Office and Experience Manager, Elizabeth Rhymaun: Here at Bigcommerce we work hard, but we also play hard! Whether its a small break for a ping pong tournament or our Friday yoga sessions, we like to find outlets to relieve stress and have a little fun. We love to throw in the random lip sync battle during a Friday afternoon happy hour or have holiday decorating contests for free breakfast tacos, or even make up our own office games ideas (Hungry Hungry Ninjas = skateboards, laundry baskets, and balloons). We definitely love to keep things a bit wild around the office! Next step to get started: Watch and learn. 29) Basketball Tournament “Is it a full-court press or a press full court?” Skills or no skills, everyone will enjoy this game, whether they’re aspiring toward greatness on the court or laughing on the sidelines. All you need is a basketball, a hoop, and some able and willing bodies. A whistle would also be a fantastic addition. Just be sure to give it to someone responsible. Put a spin on it: Turn it into the cornerstone event of an office spirit week. Dress up in team colors, hold a pep rally, and just generally channel some old-fashioned high school enthusiasm and obnoxiousness. This Office Game at Work – Limeade As an employee engagement platform also plays fun employee engagement games, it makes a lot of sense that Limeade pays special attention to their culture and their team. Here are the fun office games for employees to play at work that Andrea Augustine at Limeade shared with us: From walking meetings to coloring and puzzle stations, there’s always something to get us out of our chairs (well, standing desks that is). Fitness challenges frequent here (planking and wall sits) and team competition gets fierce. When we need to blow off steam, we hop on a razor scooter or start a nerf war. Some enjoy ping pong and others 3×3 basketball, but our dance breaks are loved by all. Next step to get started: Learn how to plan and organize a full basketball tournament here. 30) Mini Game Mash-Up “A bunch of mini-games adds up to a lot of fun.” Race through a series of games that challenge and stimulate your intellect and your funny bone. Improvise hand-sketched artwork, annihilate some riddles, and even play a round of surprise and tell. Put a spin on it: Add lightning rounds of interactive games in between the other games. Some picks that bring out the most laughs and the most madness include egg drop, two truths, and a lie, foosball, and ping pong. You could even try to play ping pong while playing two truths and a lie if you really want a challenge. What people say about Confetti’s Mini Game Mash-Up: “The team LOVED the event! It was super fun and engaging and was the perfect activity for this group. Nik was also awesome! Perfect candor that meshed well with the team.” Next step to get started: What do we say to fun? Bring it on. 31) Office Raffle “Find out who has Lady Luck on their side!” Office Raffles are a fun office game sure to liven up any workday. Employees can purchase raffle tickets for charity or team building activities and then submit the tickets in a raffle for prizes. It’s an easy way to generate team spirit and excitement while giving back. Get your team ready for the next office raffle with these fun game ideas: ▶︎ Bingo: Offer an exciting bingo raffle to your employees where they can select their lucky numbers, which they will then match up with the charity or team building activities that have been drawn. ▶︎ Charades: Inspire your employees to get creative and have fun by hosting a charades-style raffle, where they must act out their task or charity activity in order to win exciting prizes! ▶︎ Celebrity Heads: Get everyone involved in your office raffle by playing Celebrity Heads, where they must guess the celebrity name based on a randomly chosen card! Each player gets the name of a celebrity put on their head, without knowing which one they have. As the players start walking around and asking yes or no questions about their character – such as “am I an actor?” – others must answer while trying to get their own celebrity in the process! Put a spin on it: Up the fun factor by offering a prize for most creative raffle ticket design. This Office Game at Work – CEVA Logistics Grace Wright, Admin & Compliance Controller at CEVA Logistics, participated in supporting Save the Children by raising money to help children across the world get the important healthcare they need: “We finished off the Christmas festivities at UKPN with our annual Christmas Charity Raffle on the 21st December and we managed to raise an amazing £1,440 for Havens Hospice. The day was full of lovely food and winning some amazing prizes!” Next step to get started: Ask your team for ideas on prizes and reach out to local organizations to find a charity partner. 32) Escape Room “Live out a scene of your very own action movie.” Think you’re an escape artist? Think you can keep your cool under extreme pressure? Find out by daring to enter an escape room. You and your team will bond as you work together to pursue your ultimate goal: freedom. Choose your adventure to wind up in anything from an art museum to a remote jungle. Put a spin on it: Have everyone create a character that they must embody throughout the entire challenge. Here is what one group of coworkers thought after solving an escape room together, “Our group just completed their 4th escape room and this one was our favorite!!! So far we’ve done; the playground, gold rush, special ops, and the heist! The heist was our favorite partially because of JACOB!!! He is amazing and so much fun to have as a remote guide. He allowed us to really think about what we needed to do, which is the whole enjoyment of Escape Rooms! Thanks to EVERYONE involved at this location!!! Y’all are great!!! We’ve had a blast every time! See you in a few weeks!!!” Next step to get started: Don’t wait — the sooner you get in trouble, the sooner you can escape. 33) Office Fitness “Experience the joy of wordless bonding.” Personal genomics company 23andMe makes onsite fitness activities and treadmill desks available to their employees to get the blood flowing during the workday.

You don’t even need to talk that much; the synchronization of your movements provides a satisfying sense of bonding and unity. Put a spin on it: Create a shared, team playlist for your workout fun. This Office Game at Work – OwnLocal We reached out to Nicole Brooks of OwnLocal after seeing their company listed in an article on The Muse called “10 Companies That Are Just as Great as Google”.

People at OwnLocal work extremely hard throughout the day, so we encourage people to blow off steam.” Next step to get started: Explore a world of corporate wellness possibilities.

Reply Faylinn says: July 26, 2016 at 5:55 pm My work is currently having us come up with suggestions of things that could be done to make our office environment more fun and so I think that they could look to Bigcommerce for an example. We already play four square every day during break, but I really like that they play Hungry Hungry Ninjas and have ping pong tournaments. I am definitely going to suggest to my bosses that we should be doing those two things. Reply Emil Shour says: July 28, 2016 at 7:28 pm Awesome Faylinn! Kudos to you for heading up office fun 🙂 Reply Andreea says: October 28, 2016 at 8:14 am At my workplace, we’re having this month a gratitude challenge (post-it notes of appreciation signed by someone who was grateful to another colleague), but we also had challenges in which someone would present new ideas or technologies to the team, would help in the recruiting process or organize a team event and so on. Also, we plant flowers every year 🙂 But these fun activities from this article are pretty good, like ping pong tournaments or interesting topics to talk about; thanks for inspiring me, ha ha!

Adding a pinch of mind games like making objects using LEGO, blocks, or clay within a given time frame can relax your day. Some great games with reasonable play times include Boggle, Jenga, or even playing cards. Don’t forget to incentivize with prizes for winners.

All Lifestyle Interests Art Holidays & Occasions Home & Garden Travel Secondary Navigation About Us Search Done✕ Five Steps To A Successful Game Night ![Image 2: catan 1140x400](https://www.howlifeunfolds.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_hero/public/migrate/catan-1140x400.jpg?itok=Vnq1ncXg) Game nights are wonderful ways to create social activities for both friends and newly-met acquaintances. They can be fun, educational, and memorable and may even turn into a regular tradition. But before planning a game night, keep in mind that many people have been through a bad gaming experience. It only takes one negative experience to turn people off of the concept altogether. As a regular game night host and guest, here are my five steps to making your next game night experience as positive as possible. 1. KNOW YOUR GOALS If your number one goal is winning, as opposed to having fun and enjoying friends’ and family members’ company, you’re hosting game night for the wrong reasons. Think about why you’re gathering folks in the first place. Are you trying to expose the kids to taking turns, strategy, or just introducing a new way to bring the family together? Often just the act of “calling” your favorite colored game piece or unfolding the board and laying it out evokes happy memories and becomes a cherished tradition. It often uncovers new learnings about ourselves that can even foster new passions. Or, are you looking for ways to better connect with friends or switch up the typical Saturday evening festivities? Know going into the night why you’ve chosen this route in the first place. While everyone can appreciate (and even benefit from) healthy competition, make sure your priorities are in the right place. Playing a game is a tangible, shared opportunity to escape from everyday realities and express oneself in interactive, engaging ways. It should be fun, not stressful. 2. KNOW YOUR ENVIRONMENT Will everyone be playing at a single table? Will you have several games going simultaneously? Will they be loud games? How much space for games, drinks, snacks, and onlookers will you need? Obviously, you want people to socialize, and, whether they are players or spectators, they still should feel like they are part of the fun. Will the food you serve end up all over your games? Often, if I can’t control the crowd or the type of food that will be involved (and especially if alcohol is involved), I will make the decision to purchase a copy (or copies) of games for party play, separate from the games in my personal collection. 3. KNOW YOUR GAME LIMITS All games are not created equal. The more rules you have to explain, the greater the chance people may lose interest before the game even begins. Consider offering your guests a vote on the games they’d like to play or provide links to demonstration videos in advance. Choose games that don’t take a long time to play, unless you’re sure everyone is going to spend the entire evening playing just one game. Games that take 20 to 40 minutes allow players to rotate players in and out, and offer everyone a chance to play, socialize, snack, and relax are a good choice. Make gaming a part of your party, or even the theme, but don’t make it the only thing! 4. KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE The most important thing, by far, is knowing who is coming over to play. How many people will you have? Are they all the same age, or will there be a mix of ages? Have they played games before, or will this be a new experiment? Take a moment to reflect on the people and what games would be appropriate for them. If you’re all of the same age, many party games will give you the opportunity to play as a large group. Team games, in particular, let people participate at whatever level they desire. If children and adults are involved, consider breaking the group into two groups for play, or play games that involve skills that children are good at (like memory or dexterity). 5. KNOW YOUR BACKUP PLAN Sometimes, you’ll get a bad mix of players or a game that just doesn’t work for the group involved. Don’t be afraid to simply end a game (with the agreement of the players, of course) and move on to other activities. Put some thought into how to seamlessly move on to something new if/when the game doesn’t take off. If you enjoy a game, you will be its best advocate. Your enthusiasm will signal your guests that they should expect to have fun on game night. Tags: Games, Planning You Might Also Like Lifestyle & Interests Sustainable Tips to Get Your Party Poppin’!

(this might also apply to friends who apparently like to argue about these things. 3. while you’re at it, choose the right games now that our game night has commenced so many times, we know what we all enjoy and what we don’t. games that end up being the most fun for us are : taboo, mafia and celebrity. we also love balderdash when the group is feeling a little more mellow. and to spice up your old board games, i came up with an easy DIY to gift all your friends with : personalized game pieces! you can keep them in one place and use them every time you guys play a board game – so no more fighting over who has to be orange. head over to the kendall-jackson blog today to see the how-to. 4. don’t start the game right away, and have another as backup we usually end up talking for about 30 mins at least before we start playing. but as the host, it’s your job to shut everyone up and make them start the game at a certain point (what a thoughtful host i am!) when the game has finished and everyone is winding down, but not leaving — have an extra little game for them to play. we love telephone pictionary for the end of the night, because everyone can sit around and crack up and leave on a really high note. 5. clear off your coffee table we always tend to play around a coffee table versus a dining table, because it’s a much more relaxed vibe. while the girls will admire your cute coffee table styling, it ends up getting in the way so save the trinket display for your next party. all you need on the table is the games and some coasters. 6. make easy finger foods that don’t require flatware you don’t need to serve dinner at game night, and it’s much easier to nosh while playing. chips and dips, crudite and frozen appetizers are all easy. (even easier, just order a couple of pizzas to be delivered when everyone arrives.) also, if you want to avoid doing a bunch of dishes, no one will judge you for using paper plates and paper napkins. especially if they get to drink from real glasses. 7. provide dessert because you don’t want your teammates running out of steam before you lead them to victory. give them a little sugar fix. we always find a box of donuts is cheap, easy, and gets eaten. and when they don’t, you can turn them into favors! i have a printable i’ll be sharing with you next week for that. 8. don’t worry about not having enough chairs as long as you have enough floor space. arrange some cushions and pillows on the floor, and make your guests feel comfortable by sitting on the floor yourself. 9. make sure there is plenty to drink we usually do game night on tuesdays, but everyone still wants to have a glass of wine or two. it’s also totally acceptable to provide food as the host and ask your guests to BYOB if they’re particular. we still always have a bottle or two of wine in case, like kendall-jackson avant sauvignon blanc (especially perf for a summer game night al fresco) 10. you don’t need to set a mood don’t bother setting the mood with music and candles. background music is fine, but in our group — we’ve always ended up turning down the music so we can focus and yell more. and candles, although they might create some pretty mood lighting, use a lamp instead. you don’t want your rug setting on fire because your friend just blew his round of celebrity and was flailing everywhere.

The main topic here revolves around strategies and approaches to playing fantasy role-playing games (RPGs), and how to balance getting through the story quickly versus really immersing yourself in the game's world and lore. It's like, do you want to zoom through and finish it, or do you just wanna soak it all in and explore every nook and cranny? Huh, it’s wild—gonna spill the practical juice now...Look, the RPG landscape is a sprawling battlefield of choices. You’re either the tactical wizard zooming through the main quest, or the lore-hungry knight collecting every piece of history like it’s a Pokémon card. Let’s dive deep into the trenches of this narrative war!The Quick and the Curious: Know Your PlaystyleAlright, let’s break it down! First up, are you the type of gamer who sprints through the main quest, not giving a rat’s ass about side quests or lore? You're likely a quick-fix player, gnawing at the story like a dog with a bone.Or maybe you’re the methodical type, the one who pauses at every corner to sniff the roses, read every scroll, and listen to every NPC’s long-winded story about their cat’s adventures. Each side has its charms and drawbacks—let’s take a closer look at this dichotomy.The Efficiency ExpertLook, if you’re on the quick path, you’ve got a full toolbox of strategies to blast through that main story. You’re all about that time-saving life. You prioritize your quest markers and avoid anything that isn’t essential. Here’s how you can maximize your efficiency:Stick to Main Quests: Ignore side quests unless they directly lead to main story progression. This way, you’re minimizing distractions.Skip Cutscenes: I get it, cutscenes can be cool, but if your goal is speed, hitting the skip button is your new best friend.Loot Creatively: Focus on looting chests a",
