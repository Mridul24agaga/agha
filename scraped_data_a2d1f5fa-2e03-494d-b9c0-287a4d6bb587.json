Communicating fluently in English is a gradual process, one that takes a lot of practice and time to hone. In the meantime, the learning process can feel daunting: You want to get your meaning across correctly and smoothly, but putting your ideas into writing comes with the pressure of their feeling more permanent. This is why consistent, tailored suggestions are most helpful for improving your English writing abilities.

In the meantime, the learning process can feel daunting: You want to get your meaning across correctly and smoothly, but putting your ideas into writing comes with the pressure of their feeling more permanent. This is why consistent, tailored suggestions are most helpful for improving your English writing abilities. Seeing specific writing suggestions based on common grammatical mistakes multilingual speakers make in English is key to improving your communication and English writing fluency. Regular feedback is powerful because writing in a language that isn’t the first one you learned poses extra challenges. It can feel extra frustrating when your ideas don’t come across as naturally as in your primary language. It’s also tough to put your writing out there when you’re not quite sure if your grammar and wording are correct. For those communicating in English in a professional setting, your ability to write effectively can make all the difference between collaboration and isolation, career progress and stagnation. Grammarly Pro helps multilingual speakers sound their best in English with tailored suggestions to improve grammar and idiomatic phrasing. Especially when you’re writing for work, where time often is in short supply, you want your communication to be effortless. In addition to offering general fluency assistance, Grammarly Pro now includes tailored suggestions for writing issues common among Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, French, and German speakers, with more languages on the way. Features for all multilingual speakers Grammarly’s writing suggestions will catch the most common grammatical errors that multilingual speakers make in English. For example, if you drop an article or misuse a preposition (such as “on” instead of “in”), our sidebar will flag those mistakes within the Fix spelling and grammar category with the label Common issue for multilingual speakers. Most importantly, it will provide suggestions for fixing them. While these errors seem small, one right after another can make sentences awkward and more difficult to absorb. Eliminating them all in one fell swoop is a powerful way to put a more fluent spin on your document. Features for speakers of specific languages With Grammarly Pro, speakers of French, German, Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish can get suggestions specifically tailored to their primary language, unlocking a whole other level of preciseness in written English. For speakers of those languages, our sidebar will flag “false friends,” or cognates, which are words or phrases that have a similar form or sound in one’s primary language but don’t have the same meaning in English. But now Grammarly Pro’s writing suggestions will catch these types of errors for you and provide suggestions on how to fix them.

Picture your attendees walking right out onto the field or court where sports history was made, crowds roared and the rafters literally echoed with that roar. Picture the great performances that have taken place there, along with the great pride that championship teams have bestowed upon their cities. Picture walking through the locker rooms where players stood before taking the field or court, getting last-minute motivational words from their coaches while hearing the anticipatory roar of the crowd just outside. Then picture the museums or halls of fame inside many of these sports venues, where a team’s greatest players and brightest moments jump out at your attendees. It’s hard not to be inspired in such a place. Meeting planners, in their search for inspirational settings, are finding this out. An increasing number of them are using these sports venues to energize and inspire attendees. The results are often surprising. Here are some of the sports venues where the extra bonus of inspiration is everywhere you look. Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles When the Brooklyn Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958, they shook up the baseball world, helping to usher in an era of tremendous expansion for all professional sports, to all corners of America. From its opening in 1962 to the 2017 World Series, Dodger Stadium has been one of Los Angeles’ places to see and be seen, as evidenced by the movie stars and celebrities at the games. The Dodgers have won five World Series since moving there, and have boasted great players such as Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale and Don Sutton. It’s a great place for meetings and events, as well, with seven meeting spaces of various, and flexible, sizes. On-field event options include a dinner or reception on the warning track, between the Dodgers’ and visitor’s dugouts; and batting practice on the field, set up the same way as a Major League batting practice. In addition, former Dodgers greats are available for meet and greets, which create memorable experiences for attendees. Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, California Levi’s Stadium is home to the National Football League’s San Francisco 49ers. Open only three years, it has the latest technology and amenities, among them full-scale meeting, conferencing and event production; catering; and unique experiences, all in-house. This stadium has 17 meeting and event spaces, totaling 400,000 sq. ft. The sidelines are available to planners year-round and the field is available outside of football season. Unique activities include 49ers experiences such as photo opportunities with the Gold Rush cheerleaders; the popular mascot, Sourdough Sam; and the team’s five Super Bowl trophies. In addition, attendees can test their football skills and practice real drills. Famous 49ers alumni also sometimes visit. The field at Levi’s Stadium can accommodate up to 10,000 people for events, and meeting spaces can hold up to 2,000. This was the site of Super Bowl 50 in 2016, and a game in the National Hockey League’s Stadium Series in 2015. Coors Field, Denver Coors Field was built in 1995 to resemble an old-time ballpark, but it has all the modern amenities. It’s in downtown Denver, convenient to cool neighborhoods and nightlife. Management is always looking for ways to make it more attendee-friendly. For example, the 38,000-square-foot Rooftop, opened in 2014, is not only one of Denver’s best bars, but also a great place for events. Coors Field has 126,400 sq. ft. of meeting and event space, in addition to the field, and the Rocky Mountains are never far from view. Your group can meet Colorado Rockies players and coaches. On nongame days, you can hold a reception on the warning track, and attendees can experience behind-the-scenes tours of the visitors’ clubhouse and dugout. On game days, if your group is large enough, it can actually take batting practice. David DeCamillis is vice president of sales and marketing at Platte River Networks, a Denver technology firm. “We’ve been holding two meetings a year at Coors Field for several years now, ranging in size from a hundred to a thousand,” DeCamillis says. “And our attendees come from all over the country. They’re genuinely inspired by this stadium, and the former and current players with whom they can interact. They love that you can see the mountains. And, year after year, our meetings at Coors Field generate higher survey scores than anywhere else.” AT&T Stadium, Arlington, Texas The Dallas Cowboys have always done things in a big way—hey, this is Texas! So, when owner Jerry Jones built a $1.5 billion stadium in 2011 that is the largest domed structure on Earth—with seating for more than 100,000—it seemed a perfect fit for a team that’s won five Super Bowls. Now, it’s also a perfect fit for meeting planners. AT&T Stadium has more than 20 meeting and event spaces available, totaling more than 320,000 sq. ft. It can provide personalized experiences for groups ranging from 50 to 5,000. Customized options include team-building activities such as punt, pass and kick competitions on the field, along with VIP tours, dinner in the Cowboys locker room, performances by the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders and an appearance by Rowdy the mascot, who sports perhaps the biggest cowboy hat on Earth. Teresa Alfaro, senior meetings manager for Volunteers of America, a philanthropic organization based in Alexandria, Virginia, brought 850 employees to AT&T Stadium in April for an awards dinner. “Our attendees will never forget it,” Alfaro says. “We had dinner right on the field. But the best part is they had all 850 of us walk out of the tunnel and onto the field, like the Cowboys do! We came out through a ring of smoke, and they showed it on the scoreboard screen. Many people told me it was very inspiring. And many of our post-meeting surveys asked how in the world we would ever top that awards dinner!” U.S. Bank Stadium, Minneapolis When pro football’s Minnesota Vikings inaugurated their magnificent indoor stadium in 2016, fans didn’t have to learn how to get there: It was built where the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, the team’s former home, once stood. Actually, though, the stadium was in use even before the season started. Destination Marketing Association International broke in the new property with its annual convention that August. From six distinctive club areas to the field and concourse, plus suites and lounge areas, U.S. Bank Stadium boasts 241,000 sq. ft. of event space, including nearly 136,600 sq. ft. on the event level and stadium floor. If your meeting or event is a huge one, fear not: There are 65,000 seats (which will all be filled for Super Bowl LII next month). U.S. Bank Stadium offers state-of-the-art audiovisual and technology features, among them two video boards in each end zone and 2,000 flat-screen, high-definition TVs. Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta This striking glass-and-steel structure with a covered roof is the newest stadium in the United States. It opened to great acclaim just before the 2017 season kickoff of its major tenant, the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons and Atlanta United soccer team won’t be the only tenants, however. Meeting planners are already utilizing the 15 meeting and event spaces, totaling more than 150,000 sq. ft., and calling on the services of the on-site meetings and events team. Your attendees will be inspired—because events can be centered around games, VIP Club spaces, locker rooms, behind-the-scenes tours of the stadium, current and former Falcons players, punt, pass and kick events, running and exercise drills, or a variety of different experiences right on the field. Two Field Club Patios each offer 30,000 sq. ft. of meeting space, along with 30 big-screen TVs and sideline views. Mercedes-Benz Stadium is in the heart of downtown Atlanta, and right next to Georgia World Congress Center. Yankee Stadium, New York City How can you not be inspired when you meet in Yankee Stadium, arguably the greatest baseball stadium in the United States? This latest incarnation of Yankee Stadium opened in 2009 (and the Yankees won the World Series that year), on the same hallowed grounds where the original Yankee Stadium opened in 1923, and the rebuilt Yankee Stadium opened in the mid-’70s. Babe Ruth. Lou Gehrig. Joe DiMaggio. Whitey Ford. Mickey Mantle. Reggie Jackson. Derek Jeter. The list of Yankee greats seems endless…along with the list of its American League championships, 40, and World Series titles, 27. Inspiration dwells in “the House that (Babe) Ruth Built,” in spaces such as the 10 clubs, more than 60 luxury suites and a vast concourse area. Together, they can be configured to provide meeting spaces for 10 to 10,000. Inspiration emanates, too, from the huge pool of former and current superstars available for your event. Melissa Rosenbloom is vice president of New York City-based Gourmet Advisory, a high-end event-planning company for corporations and nonprofits. She’s done about 20 events at Yankee Stadium, and believes that they generate dramatic results. “Whether you’re a baseball fan or not, it’s almost impossible not to be inspired there,” Rosenbloom says. “This stadium represents a true piece of American history. Pretty much every meeting we do there has record attendance. I believe the Yankees set the bar for the offerings required to make a meeting memorable. And Yankee Stadium sets the bar for inspiring attendees.” Colleges Have Great Venues, Too In your search for inspiring stadiums and arenas, don’t forget about universities and colleges. Many have unique histories, perfect facilities and all the inspiration your attendees need. Here is a sampling. Notre Dame Stadium, South Bend, Indiana Notre Dame can “wake up the echoes”—as its fight song attests—of some of the greatest moments in college football history. It is arguably the most iconic college football spot in America. Nothing on campus may be more iconic, though, than “Touchdown Jesus,” a multistory painting on a building towering over the stadium, in which Jesus is raising his arms (signaling a touchdown, according to popular local legend). Duncan Student Center, Corbett Family Hall and O’Neill Hall each overlook the stadium, and together they have 18 meeting and event spaces, and, along with the stadium concourse, 140,000 sq. ft. of meeting space. These spaces are all part of the Campus Crossroads Project, a $400 million endeavor that added 800,000 sq. ft. of classroom, performance, meeting, event and hospitality space adjacent to the stadium in 2016. A new department called VenueND is a one-stop shop for meeting planners. VenueND can connect planners with an IACC-certified conference center at McKenna Hall, schedule campus tours and arrange for attendees to walk onto the field. Cameron Indoor Stadium, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina Cameron Indoor Stadium is a 77-year-old icon in college basketball. Duke has won the national championship five times, all under the direction of current coach Mike Krzyzewski, and it has appeared in the NCAA Tournament’s Final Four 16 times. Many of Duke’s players have had successful careers in the National Basketball Association, among them Danny Ferry, Christian Laettner, Elton Brand and Shane Battier. Two new meeting spaces opened in Cameron Indoor Stadium in October 2016, offering state-of-the-art technology and amenities. Champions Club, with 2,000 sq. ft., is available for rentals during the day and on nonbasketball game days, weekends and nights. Rubenstein Pavilion Lobby has 1,500 sq. ft. of meeting space, and is available on nongame days. Tom Gola Arena, La Salle University, Philadelphia In Philadelphia, and, happily, near the historic sites of Valley Forge National Historical Park, great basketball is a tradition. La Salle University’s Tom Gola was a Basketball Hall of Fame player who led the Explorers to a national championship in 1954, and the Philadelphia Warriors to the NBA championship two years later. He’s the greatest player to ever come out of La Salle. Tom Gola Arena (pictured) is inside Trumark Financial Center on campus. The arena has four meeting spaces, totaling 45,000 sq. ft., and high-speed internet, audiovisual equipment, telephone-conferencing capabilities and catering. Meetings with former and current stars of the basketball team are easily arranged.

Vegas Doubles Down on Pro Sports When Lisa Motley finally got the news the NFL’s Raiders would be moving to a new home in Las Vegas, she recalls it as a pinch-me moment. “It was a long time coming, and it was surreal,” says the University of Minnesota alum, sports fan and Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) director of sports marketing and special events. How did this metropolitan region of more than 2 million people win big in the pro sports business? Motley starts the story way back in 1905, when city leaders first started making it a goal. By the 1930s, Hoover Dam was supplying water, and local workers were settling nearby. The first casinos had opened, but mid-week business was slow. That led to the opening of Las Vegas Convention Center in 1959, to bring in convention business. In 1973, Rossi Ralenkotter joined LVCVA as a research analyst—before rising to senior vice president of marketing and, in 2004, president and CEO. “He has been putting the pieces in place all that time,” Motley says. Those pieces include the first professional sport in town, Triple-A baseball’s Las Vegas 51s (now a farm team for the New York Mets), which arrived in 1983 and still plays at Cashman Field. That same year, the PGA Tour’s Panasonic Las Vegas Invitational (now Shriners Hospitals for Children Open) golf tournament arrived at Spanish Trail Country Club. “That helped with summer and October need times,” Motley says. Boxing was already a staple, first at Las Vegas Convention Center and later at Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, The Mirage and, now, T-Mobile Arena (pictured above). To bring a new sporting audience to town during December, LVCVA recruited National Finals Rodeo to the Thomas & Mack Center at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Bull riding is held in conjunction with a Cowboy Christmas expo at Las Vegas Convention Center. Boots and lassos were followed by rubber and smoke with the first running of NASCAR Winston Cup Series at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. That dates to March of 1998, and it happened in front of 120,000 people. Ralenkotter was cagily putting the dominos in place, Motleys says. Next, Las Vegas started hosting championship hockey and NBA all-star games, demonstrating that sporting events could be successfully played in the city without being tainted by gambling. In fact, teams were bringing record numbers of fans to a city where some 150,000 guest rooms are available at a wide range of price points. The Strip’s restaurants and entertainment only blocks away encouraged people to linger. Then in 2016 and 2017, the dominos really began to clatter across the desert landscape. National Hockey League announced the Las Vegas Golden Knights would be the next expansion team and play in a new T-Mobile Arena, built by MGM Resorts International and the Anschutz Entertainment Group. The arena holds 20,000 people, and lies just west of The Strip. Then the NFL approved Mark Davis’ bid to relocate the Raiders from Oakland to a new stadium in Las Vegas starting in 2020, with support from Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee and a hike in hotel room taxes to raise $750 million for a new stadium. The sporting news kept coming: United Soccer League announced that Las Vegas Lights FC would join the 51s at Cashman Field. Then, in October of last year, MGM Resorts purchased the Women’s National Basketball Association San Antonio Stars team and started selling tickets for 2018 season games at Mandalay Bay Events Center. This is all good news for event professionals. New, ultra-modern facilities can be repurposed for events, entertainment options for off-sites in suites—and are another reason for people to come in the first place. “Sports represent the shiny penny for visitors,” Motley says. LVCVA hopes to leverage fan appeal to keep the almost 43 million visitors who come each year just a little longer. That is why sports that hold international appeal, such as rugby, curling and soccer, are vital to the plan. International visitors stay longer and spend more. What’s next? Motley is already looking forward to when MLB and NBA teams announce they are coming to town. —JT Long How Meetings Benefit from Sporting Events From football to baseball to figure skating, college, professional and amateur sports bring revenue and tourism to popular meeting destinations. When a city is preparing to host a sporting event, it invests in improving infrastructure, building and renovating hotels, and expanding public transportation routes. These enhancements, plus the fact they are trusted cities to accommodate massive amounts of people, have obvious allure for meeting professionals. Here are some cities that have benefited from the sports halo effect. Indianapolis When Visit Indy announced Indianapolis would host the 2022 College Football Playoff National Championship at Lucas Oil Stadium, it committed to using Indiana Convention Center for a fan fest. The city is anticipating that the game and festivities surrounding it will bring in more than $150 million and 100,000 visitors to Central Indiana. Philadelphia Philadelphia Convention & Visitors Bureau revealed that April’s NFL Draft (pictured above) generated an estimated $94.9 million for the City of Brotherly Love. Hotel reservations reached 18,991 booked room nights. Hotel revenue increased by 11 percent from the previous year during that same time period. Houston The Super Bowl is one of the biggest money-makers of them all. Whether your favorite team is playing or not, the Big Game draws crowds. The Super Bowl is also a great incentive trip, regardless whether you can get your hands on game tickets. There are so many events and activities going on, visitors will surely have a memorable time. An estimated 337,000-plus hotel room nights were booked in connection with Houston’s Super Bowl in 2017. The game brought an estimated $428 million in new spending to the region. San Jose Leading up to an Olympics, qualifying events are held to select members of Team USA. One such sport is figure skating. Seeking to capitalize on the popularity of the Olympic spirit, San Jose’s SAP Center will host the U.S. National Figure Skating Championships this month, ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The same event reaped some $23 million for the city in 2012. —Paige Feigenbaum advertisement Be the First to Know Everything meeting planners need in one beautiful print and digital magazine Subscribe now View this Issue Related articles Mar 1, 2025 Risk Management is a Team Effort JT Long Mar 1, 2025 Presenting the 2025 Smart Women in Meetings Award Winners Smart Meetings Related Posts Feb 26, 2025 Notes from the Road: Atlanta Sara Robertson Feb 24, 2025 Event Contracts: What to Watch in 2025 Malik Anderson Feb 21, 2025 Dreaming About California Meetings Eming Piansay Subscribe to our newsletter!

Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles When the Brooklyn Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958, they shook up the baseball world, helping to usher in an era of tremendous expansion for all professional sports, to all corners of America. From its opening in 1962 to the 2017 World Series, Dodger Stadium has been one of Los Angeles’ places to see and be seen, as evidenced by the movie stars and celebrities at the games. The Dodgers have won five World Series since moving there, and have boasted great players such as Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale and Don Sutton. It’s a great place for meetings and events, as well, with seven meeting spaces of various, and flexible, sizes. On-field event options include a dinner or reception on the warning track, between the Dodgers’ and visitor’s dugouts; and batting practice on the field, set up the same way as a Major League batting practice. In addition, former Dodgers greats are available for meet and greets, which create memorable experiences for attendees. Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, California Levi’s Stadium is home to the National Football League’s San Francisco 49ers. Open only three years, it has the latest technology and amenities, among them full-scale meeting, conferencing and event production; catering; and unique experiences, all in-house. This stadium has 17 meeting and event spaces, totaling 400,000 sq. ft. The sidelines are available to planners year-round and the field is available outside of football season. Unique activities include 49ers experiences such as photo opportunities with the Gold Rush cheerleaders; the popular mascot, Sourdough Sam; and the team’s five Super Bowl trophies. In addition, attendees can test their football skills and practice real drills. Famous 49ers alumni also sometimes visit. The field at Levi’s Stadium can accommodate up to 10,000 people for events, and meeting spaces can hold up to 2,000. This was the site of Super Bowl 50 in 2016, and a game in the National Hockey League’s Stadium Series in 2015. Coors Field, Denver Coors Field was built in 1995 to resemble an old-time ballpark, but it has all the modern amenities. It’s in downtown Denver, convenient to cool neighborhoods and nightlife. Management is always looking for ways to make it more attendee-friendly. For example, the 38,000-square-foot Rooftop, opened in 2014, is not only one of Denver’s best bars, but also a great place for events. Coors Field has 126,400 sq. ft. of meeting and event space, in addition to the field, and the Rocky Mountains are never far from view. Your group can meet Colorado Rockies players and coaches. On nongame days, you can hold a reception on the warning track, and attendees can experience behind-the-scenes tours of the visitors’ clubhouse and dugout. On game days, if your group is large enough, it can actually take batting practice. David DeCamillis is vice president of sales and marketing at Platte River Networks, a Denver technology firm. “We’ve been holding two meetings a year at Coors Field for several years now, ranging in size from a hundred to a thousand,” DeCamillis says. “And our attendees come from all over the country. They’re genuinely inspired by this stadium, and the former and current players with whom they can interact. They love that you can see the mountains. And, year after year, our meetings at Coors Field generate higher survey scores than anywhere else.” AT&T Stadium, Arlington, Texas The Dallas Cowboys have always done things in a big way—hey, this is Texas! So, when owner Jerry Jones built a $1.5 billion stadium in 2011 that is the largest domed structure on Earth—with seating for more than 100,000—it seemed a perfect fit for a team that’s won five Super Bowls. Now, it’s also a perfect fit for meeting planners. AT&T Stadium has more than 20 meeting and event spaces available, totaling more than 320,000 sq. ft. It can provide personalized experiences for groups ranging from 50 to 5,000. Customized options include team-building activities such as punt, pass and kick competitions on the field, along with VIP tours, dinner in the Cowboys locker room, performances by the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders and an appearance by Rowdy the mascot, who sports perhaps the biggest cowboy hat on Earth. Teresa Alfaro, senior meetings manager for Volunteers of America, a philanthropic organization based in Alexandria, Virginia, brought 850 employees to AT&T Stadium in April for an awards dinner. “Our attendees will never forget it,” Alfaro says. “We had dinner right on the field. But the best part is they had all 850 of us walk out of the tunnel and onto the field, like the Cowboys do! We came out through a ring of smoke, and they showed it on the scoreboard screen. Many people told me it was very inspiring. And many of our post-meeting surveys asked how in the world we would ever top that awards dinner!” U.S. Bank Stadium, Minneapolis When pro football’s Minnesota Vikings inaugurated their magnificent indoor stadium in 2016, fans didn’t have to learn how to get there: It was built where the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, the team’s former home, once stood. Actually, though, the stadium was in use even before the season started. Destination Marketing Association International broke in the new property with its annual convention that August. From six distinctive club areas to the field and concourse, plus suites and lounge areas, U.S. Bank Stadium boasts 241,000 sq. ft. of event space, including nearly 136,600 sq. ft. on the event level and stadium floor. If your meeting or event is a huge one, fear not: There are 65,000 seats (which will all be filled for Super Bowl LII next month). U.S. Bank Stadium offers state-of-the-art audiovisual and technology features, among them two video boards in each end zone and 2,000 flat-screen, high-definition TVs. Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta This striking glass-and-steel structure with a covered roof is the newest stadium in the United States. It opened to great acclaim just before the 2017 season kickoff of its major tenant, the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons and Atlanta United soccer team won’t be the only tenants, however. Meeting planners are already utilizing the 15 meeting and event spaces, totaling more than 150,000 sq. ft., and calling on the services of the on-site meetings and events team. Your attendees will be inspired—because events can be centered around games, VIP Club spaces, locker rooms, behind-the-scenes tours of the stadium, current and former Falcons players, punt, pass and kick events, running and exercise drills, or a variety of different experiences right on the field. Two Field Club Patios each offer 30,000 sq. ft. of meeting space, along with 30 big-screen TVs and sideline views. Mercedes-Benz Stadium is in the heart of downtown Atlanta, and right next to Georgia World Congress Center. Yankee Stadium, New York City How can you not be inspired when you meet in Yankee Stadium, arguably the greatest baseball stadium in the United States? This latest incarnation of Yankee Stadium opened in 2009 (and the Yankees won the World Series that year), on the same hallowed grounds where the original Yankee Stadium opened in 1923, and the rebuilt Yankee Stadium opened in the mid-’70s. Babe Ruth. Lou Gehrig. Joe DiMaggio. Whitey Ford. Mickey Mantle. Reggie Jackson. Derek Jeter. The list of Yankee greats seems endless…along with the list of its American League championships, 40, and World Series titles, 27. Inspiration dwells in “the House that (Babe) Ruth Built,” in spaces such as the 10 clubs, more than 60 luxury suites and a vast concourse area. Together, they can be configured to provide meeting spaces for 10 to 10,000. Inspiration emanates, too, from the huge pool of former and current superstars available for your event. Melissa Rosenbloom is vice president of New York City-based Gourmet Advisory, a high-end event-planning company for corporations and nonprofits. She’s done about 20 events at Yankee Stadium, and believes that they generate dramatic results. “Whether you’re a baseball fan or not, it’s almost impossible not to be inspired there,” Rosenbloom says. “This stadium represents a true piece of American history. Pretty much every meeting we do there has record attendance. I believe the Yankees set the bar for the offerings required to make a meeting memorable. And Yankee Stadium sets the bar for inspiring attendees.” Colleges Have Great Venues, Too In your search for inspiring stadiums and arenas, don’t forget about universities and colleges. Many have unique histories, perfect facilities and all the inspiration your attendees need. Here is a sampling. Notre Dame Stadium, South Bend, Indiana Notre Dame can “wake up the echoes”—as its fight song attests—of some of the greatest moments in college football history. It is arguably the most iconic college football spot in America. Nothing on campus may be more iconic, though, than “Touchdown Jesus,” a multistory painting on a building towering over the stadium, in which Jesus is raising his arms (signaling a touchdown, according to popular local legend). Duncan Student Center, Corbett Family Hall and O’Neill Hall each overlook the stadium, and together they have 18 meeting and event spaces, and, along with the stadium concourse, 140,000 sq. ft. of meeting space. These spaces are all part of the Campus Crossroads Project, a $400 million endeavor that added 800,000 sq. ft. of classroom, performance, meeting, event and hospitality space adjacent to the stadium in 2016. A new department called VenueND is a one-stop shop for meeting planners. VenueND can connect planners with an IACC-certified conference center at McKenna Hall, schedule campus tours and arrange for attendees to walk onto the field. Cameron Indoor Stadium, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina Cameron Indoor Stadium is a 77-year-old icon in college basketball. Duke has won the national championship five times, all under the direction of current coach Mike Krzyzewski, and it has appeared in the NCAA Tournament’s Final Four 16 times. Many of Duke’s players have had successful careers in the National Basketball Association, among them Danny Ferry, Christian Laettner, Elton Brand and Shane Battier. Two new meeting spaces opened in Cameron Indoor Stadium in October 2016, offering state-of-the-art technology and amenities. Champions Club, with 2,000 sq. ft., is available for rentals during the day and on nonbasketball game days, weekends and nights. Rubenstein Pavilion Lobby has 1,500 sq. ft. of meeting space, and is available on nongame days. Tom Gola Arena, La Salle University, Philadelphia In Philadelphia, and, happily, near the historic sites of Valley Forge National Historical Park, great basketball is a tradition. La Salle University’s Tom Gola was a Basketball Hall of Fame player who led the Explorers to a national championship in 1954, and the Philadelphia Warriors to the NBA championship two years later. He’s the greatest player to ever come out of La Salle. Tom Gola Arena (pictured) is inside Trumark Financial Center on campus. The arena has four meeting spaces, totaling 45,000 sq. ft., and high-speed internet, audiovisual equipment, telephone-conferencing capabilities and catering. Meetings with former and current stars of the basketball team are easily arranged.

Vegas Doubles Down on Pro Sports When Lisa Motley finally got the news the NFL’s Raiders would be moving to a new home in Las Vegas, she recalls it as a pinch-me moment. “It was a long time coming, and it was surreal,” says the University of Minnesota alum, sports fan and Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) director of sports marketing and special events. How did this metropolitan region of more than 2 million people win big in the pro sports business? Motley starts the story way back in 1905, when city leaders first started making it a goal. By the 1930s, Hoover Dam was supplying water, and local workers were settling nearby. The first casinos had opened, but mid-week business was slow. That led to the opening of Las Vegas Convention Center in 1959, to bring in convention business. In 1973, Rossi Ralenkotter joined LVCVA as a research analyst—before rising to senior vice president of marketing and, in 2004, president and CEO. “He has been putting the pieces in place all that time,” Motley says. Those pieces include the first professional sport in town, Triple-A baseball’s Las Vegas 51s (now a farm team for the New York Mets), which arrived in 1983 and still plays at Cashman Field. That same year, the PGA Tour’s Panasonic Las Vegas Invitational (now Shriners Hospitals for Children Open) golf tournament arrived at Spanish Trail Country Club. “That helped with summer and October need times,” Motley says. Boxing was already a staple, first at Las Vegas Convention Center and later at Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, The Mirage and, now, T-Mobile Arena (pictured above). To bring a new sporting audience to town during December, LVCVA recruited National Finals Rodeo to the Thomas & Mack Center at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Bull riding is held in conjunction with a Cowboy Christmas expo at Las Vegas Convention Center. Boots and lassos were followed by rubber and smoke with the first running of NASCAR Winston Cup Series at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. That dates to March of 1998, and it happened in front of 120,000 people. Ralenkotter was cagily putting the dominos in place, Motleys says. Next, Las Vegas started hosting championship hockey and NBA all-star games, demonstrating that sporting events could be successfully played in the city without being tainted by gambling. In fact, teams were bringing record numbers of fans to a city where some 150,000 guest rooms are available at a wide range of price points. The Strip’s restaurants and entertainment only blocks away encouraged people to linger. Then in 2016 and 2017, the dominos really began to clatter across the desert landscape. National Hockey League announced the Las Vegas Golden Knights would be the next expansion team and play in a new T-Mobile Arena, built by MGM Resorts International and the Anschutz Entertainment Group. The arena holds 20,000 people, and lies just west of The Strip. Then the NFL approved Mark Davis’ bid to relocate the Raiders from Oakland to a new stadium in Las Vegas starting in 2020, with support from Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee and a hike in hotel room taxes to raise $750 million for a new stadium. The sporting news kept coming: United Soccer League announced that Las Vegas Lights FC would join the 51s at Cashman Field. Then, in October of last year, MGM Resorts purchased the Women’s National Basketball Association San Antonio Stars team and started selling tickets for 2018 season games at Mandalay Bay Events Center. This is all good news for event professionals. New, ultra-modern facilities can be repurposed for events, entertainment options for off-sites in suites—and are another reason for people to come in the first place. “Sports represent the shiny penny for visitors,” Motley says. LVCVA hopes to leverage fan appeal to keep the almost 43 million visitors who come each year just a little longer. That is why sports that hold international appeal, such as rugby, curling and soccer, are vital to the plan. International visitors stay longer and spend more. What’s next? Motley is already looking forward to when MLB and NBA teams announce they are coming to town. —JT Long How Meetings Benefit from Sporting Events From football to baseball to figure skating, college, professional and amateur sports bring revenue and tourism to popular meeting destinations. When a city is preparing to host a sporting event, it invests in improving infrastructure, building and renovating hotels, and expanding public transportation routes. These enhancements, plus the fact they are trusted cities to accommodate massive amounts of people, have obvious allure for meeting professionals. Here are some cities that have benefited from the sports halo effect. Indianapolis When Visit Indy announced Indianapolis would host the 2022 College Football Playoff National Championship at Lucas Oil Stadium, it committed to using Indiana Convention Center for a fan fest. The city is anticipating that the game and festivities surrounding it will bring in more than $150 million and 100,000 visitors to Central Indiana. Philadelphia Philadelphia Convention & Visitors Bureau revealed that April’s NFL Draft (pictured above) generated an estimated $94.9 million for the City of Brotherly Love. Hotel reservations reached 18,991 booked room nights. Hotel revenue increased by 11 percent from the previous year during that same time period. Houston The Super Bowl is one of the biggest money-makers of them all. Whether your favorite team is playing or not, the Big Game draws crowds. The Super Bowl is also a great incentive trip, regardless whether you can get your hands on game tickets. There are so many events and activities going on, visitors will surely have a memorable time. An estimated 337,000-plus hotel room nights were booked in connection with Houston’s Super Bowl in 2017. The game brought an estimated $428 million in new spending to the region. San Jose Leading up to an Olympics, qualifying events are held to select members of Team USA. One such sport is figure skating. Seeking to capitalize on the popularity of the Olympic spirit, San Jose’s SAP Center will host the U.S. National Figure Skating Championships this month, ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The same event reaped some $23 million for the city in 2012. —Paige Feigenbaum advertisement Be the First to Know Everything meeting planners need in one beautiful print and digital magazine Subscribe now View this Issue Related articles Mar 1, 2025 Risk Management is a Team Effort JT Long Mar 1, 2025 Presenting the 2025 Smart Women in Meetings Award Winners Smart Meetings Related Posts Feb 26, 2025 Notes from the Road: Atlanta Sara Robertson Feb 24, 2025 Event Contracts: What to Watch in 2025 Malik Anderson Feb 21, 2025 Dreaming About California Meetings Eming Piansay Subscribe to our newsletter!

START THE QUIZ 30+ (Fun) Ways To Meet New People11/9/2021 Looking for ways to meet new people?You’re in the right place!Maybe you’ve just moved to a new city and you’re looking to get out there and make new friends.Maybe you’ve lived in your city for years, but you’ve been stuck in a routine.Either way, here’s a list of 30+ ways to meet new people.First: The secret to meeting new people? Consistency.Before we dive into the list, here’s a pro-tip for meeting new people.​Be consistent!Most people go to one meetup, they don’t have an earth-shattering time making the best friends of their life. Then…they quit.Don’t be like that.To find people you LOVE hanging with, you’re going to have to meet several dozen people and go to events and meetups regularly. The more time you spend trying new events and starting conversations while you’re there…the higher your chances of meeting new people go way up.Repeat after me: “It takes time. And that’s okay.”Okay, let’s dive in!1. VolunteeringVolunteering is a fantastic way to do a little good in the community, and meet other volunteers at the same time.Often, it can be easier to connect with people when connecting isn’t the sole reason for interacting with them.​When you have a shared reason for being around each other, connection can happen naturally. 2. Cooking classesCooking classes are a great way to level up your cooking skills, and meet new people at the same time! Pro-Tip: If you hit it off with people at other events on this list, you can even show off your cooking skills and invite them to a dinner party!3. Hiking clubFeel like getting outside? Hiking clubs are great for exploring the great outdoors, breaking a sweat, and meeting new people who are also into nature!4. Martial arts classesKicking and punching your way to friendship!​There’s something about physical activity that help people break the ice in social situations. My hunch is that people are too tired to feel nervous.5. ​Fitness classesCould be Tae Bo (kidding) Zumba, CrossFit, HIIT classes, or anything else that gets the blood pumping.6. Running groupsI used to be a competitive runner, and running groups are a great way to meet new people.Many running groups will have people at all skill levels, so don’t worry about slowing down the group if you’re just getting into running.​After a few meetings, you’ll be going out for beer and tacos soon enough!7. Group dance classesMy wife and I took swing dancing classes for a couple of years and it was fun learning new moves.​Most mid-size cities have dance events where people get together and dance the night away!8. Yoga classesAh, yoga class!It’s a very chill way to spend a Friday night.Pro-Tip: If it’s your first time going, be sure to stay behind after class for a few minutes and start some conversations with the instructor and some fellow students!9. ​Art classesMaybe you want to level up your doodles to drawings, or you just want to paint and sip wine.​Either way, art classes are a great way to meet new people who are fun and creative.10. ​Meetup.comThis one is a go-to there are 1,000s of meetups on every conceivable topic. Keep in mind that it can be a little bit of a process to find a Meetup that you LOVE.A rule I picked up from a reader: “I’ll go once, just to see if I like it.” This is the best mindset to have as you meet new people.Go once, just to see if you like it!Click here to find a meetup near you.#element-a7b9bfc8-08ed-4940-a949-c1c929fa45be .callout-box-wrapper { padding: 20px 0px;

More than squabbling with your Dad who wants to lend you Monopoly money at 5% interest after you landed on Boardwalk AGAIN.​There are a bunch of board game meetups that range from simple to complex. Most meetups will have a theme or BYOB (Bring your own board) options.12. ​Meet people in your neighborhood!Don’t sleep on this oneIf your neighborhood has events, great! If not, take some walks around your neighborhood and stop and chat with your neighbors! (Optional: Get involved with your neighborhood association, assuming they aren’t full of old busybodies who complain about people who don’t mow their lawns every weekend.)13. ​Book clubsYou might be into reading and sharing your interpretations of books!​This is a fantastic way to meet new people because you already have something to talk about. (the book!)14. ​Book readingsCheck out local bookstores for readings. Be sure to stick around and meet the author and other people who enjoy their work! 15. ​Say yes to invites!This is another tip to not sleep on. Be sure to say “yes” to as many invites as possible when you’re trying to meet new people.​Invites lead to more invites, so if you’re at a new job and someone invites you out to drinks with your coworkers: SAY YES! Putting yourself in social situations is half the battle of being more social. Plus, you’re much more likely to get invites in the future if you say yes today.16. ​Dog parksI’m a well documented cat person, but for those people who enjoy having a pet love you unconditionally, I hear dog parks are great places to meet new people. “Which one’s yours?” is basically the last conversation starter you’ll need at the dog park. Bonus: My town has something called a Bark Bar…it’s a bar where you can bring your pup. Maybe your city has one too. It’s probably in the trendy area of town.17. ​Online Groups for your interestHave a niche interest? Live in a tiny rural town? Online/Facebook/Reddit groups are a great option to meet new people. Over time, you can even FaceTime them and deepen the relationship.​I know plenty of people who met great friends online years before they met them in real life. Just remember to be patient!18. ​Trivia night at your local barOh boy! Trivia night!​A great way to flex your knowledge of obscure geography after your second beer! Also, a great way to meet new people who aren’t on a trivia team of join an existing one. 19. ​Cultural events in your cityMuseum openings, walking tours, interesting speakers, art exhibits, these are fun ways to meet new people who are out exploring their city (just like you are) ​20. ​Beer tasting/Brewery ToursIf you’re into beer and want to learn more about how it’s brewed, hit up a beer tasting event or a brewery tour in your city.Chances are, there are some cool local breweries in your town.​Years ago, I even helped a local brewery bottle their beer for a day. They paid me in beer…which was great for a 21 year old me.21. ​Improv classesYou don’t have to be an aspiring SNL cast member to have a good time meeting new people at an improv class.Silly situations, spur-of-the-moment topics and learning how to “yes and…” your way to making people laugh is a great way to push your comfort zone and hopefully meet some fun people along the way.22. ​Adult sports leaguesA few years ago, my wife joined a kickball league, she had a great time meeting new people at games.​If you’re a athletic person who likes a little friendly competition, joining an adult sports league could be a great option to find new people to hang with.23. ​Networking eventsNot just for handing out business cards and talking up the 5 year vision for your career.​The secret to “networking” is being human, and having good conversations with people. The more people you have conversations with, the higher the chance is that you’ll meet new people that you really hit it off with!Also, online networking is an option too:24. ​ConferencesIn a similar vein as networking event, conferences can be fantastic places to meet new people. I especially like traveling to new places to go to conferences that focus on topics that I’m interested in. Mandatory tip: The conference isn’t over at 5 PM! Make sure to go to local bars/restaurants with other attendees. This is where the real fun of conferences is to be had.25. Toastmasters clubsPolishing up your public speaking skills, and meeting new people who are doing the same, what’s not to like?​As with other places to meet new people, be sure to stay after for 5-10 minutes to introduce yourself to some people.Click here to find a local Toastmasters club.26. Speed DatingThis is a fun one that many people write-off. Will you end up meeting the love of your life at a speed dating event? Maybe. What’s more likely is that you’ll have a bunch of short conversations in rapid order with new people.​Part of improving your people skills is practicing, and speed dating is a great way to practice your conversation skills.27. ​Bumble BFFAh apps!Bumble BFF is a uber-convenient way to meet new people. Create an account, upload a picture, and fill out your interests and profile and get to swiping. If you match with someone, you’ll have a limited amount of time to make the first move. Pro-tip: Get good candid pictures preferably taken by a professional. Friend of BMC and personal stylist Peter Nguyen does this for his personal styling clients, and it makes a huge difference.28. ​Self-Development groupsThis one’s a little broad, but if you’re into self-development, finding a group that meets regularly can be a great way to meet new people who are constantly trying to stay motivated and improve.29. ​Language learning groupsLast year, my wife and I started learning American Sign Language (ASL) and she started an ASL meetup group where people could come, have lunch and practice their skills.If you’re into learning a new language, this is a fantastic way to meet new people and improve your language skills at the same time! Win/win!30. Dinner at the bar of a restaurant ​This is another low-key awesome way to meet new people.Find a restaurant that you love, and sit at the bar and have dinner there a couple of nights per week. You’ll meet the bartender, staff, and people hanging out nearby. Pro tip: If you’re feeling a little nervous about going out alone.Bring a book and read it casually at the bar. (Meaning taking frequent breaks from reading to sip your drink, eat some food, etc.)​People WILL ask you what you’re reading. This is an easy way for other people to start conversations with you.31. Reach out to friends-of-friendsSuper underrated tip here.​If you’ve met a friend of a friend a few times, reach out to them and ask them if they want to grab some coffee.Making friends doesn’t mean you have to start from zero! Since you already have connections in common, it’s easier to break the ice and get the conversation started! Pro tip: When asking people to hang out, it’s important to keep the ask low-pressure and give them an option to decline. Saying “We should grab some coffee sometime” and adding “If that doesn’t work for you, that’s totally cool, I’m sure I’ll see you around!”32. Groupon dealsThis is a really outside of the box idea, but you can check your city’s Groupon deals under the “Things to do” section to find some interesting things to do that might put you in a position to meet new people.33. ​Get on your city’s subreddit and ask for recommendations.This is another under-the-radar way to meet new people. Many cities that have over…say…150K population have a subreddit.​This can be a great way to get local recommendations for things to do from people that you may not have heard of.And there are usually new people who are moving to town that are looking for people to hang out with.Pro-tip for US folks: Here’s a list of a bunch of US city subreddits.Bonus tip: How to Start a Conversation at a Meetup or EventThe following is taken from this post on starting conversations.Meetups and classes have the benefit of being structured.Everyone signed up to be there and came specifically to gather and learn or do something together. This takes a lot of the pressure off you because you know the people around you signed up for this!​Try some of these conversation starters to pique interest and make new friends:Hey, it’s my first time here, is this the [Meetup Name] Meetup?Hi, I’ve never tried a [Class Name] Class before. You?Hey, I’m new here. I’m [Your Name]. Hey, is this your first class? I’m [Your Name].I’m so excited about [class subject]!

My hunch is that people are too tired to feel nervous.5. ​Fitness classesCould be Tae Bo (kidding) Zumba, CrossFit, HIIT classes, or anything else that gets the blood pumping.6. Running groupsI used to be a competitive runner, and running groups are a great way to meet new people.Many running groups will have people at all skill levels, so don’t worry about slowing down the group if you’re just getting into running.​After a few meetings, you’ll be going out for beer and tacos soon enough!7. Group dance classesMy wife and I took swing dancing classes for a couple of years and it was fun learning new moves.​Most mid-size cities have dance events where people get together and dance the night away!8. Yoga classesAh, yoga class!It’s a very chill way to spend a Friday night.Pro-Tip: If it’s your first time going, be sure to stay behind after class for a few minutes and start some conversations with the instructor and some fellow students!9. ​Art classesMaybe you want to level up your doodles to drawings, or you just want to paint and sip wine.​Either way, art classes are a great way to meet new people who are fun and creative.10. ​Meetup.comThis one is a go-to there are 1,000s of meetups on every conceivable topic. Keep in mind that it can be a little bit of a process to find a Meetup that you LOVE.A rule I picked up from a reader: “I’ll go once, just to see if I like it.” This is the best mindset to have as you meet new people.Go once, just to see if you like it!Click here to find a meetup near you.#element-a7b9bfc8-08ed-4940-a949-c1c929fa45be .callout-box-wrapper { padding: 20px 0px;

More than squabbling with your Dad who wants to lend you Monopoly money at 5% interest after you landed on Boardwalk AGAIN.​There are a bunch of board game meetups that range from simple to complex. Most meetups will have a theme or BYOB (Bring your own board) options.12. ​Meet people in your neighborhood!Don’t sleep on this oneIf your neighborhood has events, great! If not, take some walks around your neighborhood and stop and chat with your neighbors! (Optional: Get involved with your neighborhood association, assuming they aren’t full of old busybodies who complain about people who don’t mow their lawns every weekend.)13. ​Book clubsYou might be into reading and sharing your interpretations of books!​This is a fantastic way to meet new people because you already have something to talk about. (the book!)14. ​Book readingsCheck out local bookstores for readings. Be sure to stick around and meet the author and other people who enjoy their work! 15. ​Say yes to invites!This is another tip to not sleep on. Be sure to say “yes” to as many invites as possible when you’re trying to meet new people.​Invites lead to more invites, so if you’re at a new job and someone invites you out to drinks with your coworkers: SAY YES! Putting yourself in social situations is half the battle of being more social. Plus, you’re much more likely to get invites in the future if you say yes today.16. ​Dog parksI’m a well documented cat person, but for those people who enjoy having a pet love you unconditionally, I hear dog parks are great places to meet new people. “Which one’s yours?” is basically the last conversation starter you’ll need at the dog park. Bonus: My town has something called a Bark Bar…it’s a bar where you can bring your pup. Maybe your city has one too. It’s probably in the trendy area of town.17. ​Online Groups for your interestHave a niche interest? Live in a tiny rural town? Online/Facebook/Reddit groups are a great option to meet new people. Over time, you can even FaceTime them and deepen the relationship.​I know plenty of people who met great friends online years before they met them in real life. Just remember to be patient!18. ​Trivia night at your local barOh boy! Trivia night!​A great way to flex your knowledge of obscure geography after your second beer! Also, a great way to meet new people who aren’t on a trivia team of join an existing one. 19. ​Cultural events in your cityMuseum openings, walking tours, interesting speakers, art exhibits, these are fun ways to meet new people who are out exploring their city (just like you are) ​20. ​Beer tasting/Brewery ToursIf you’re into beer and want to learn more about how it’s brewed, hit up a beer tasting event or a brewery tour in your city.Chances are, there are some cool local breweries in your town.​Years ago, I even helped a local brewery bottle their beer for a day. They paid me in beer…which was great for a 21 year old me.21. ​Improv classesYou don’t have to be an aspiring SNL cast member to have a good time meeting new people at an improv class.Silly situations, spur-of-the-moment topics and learning how to “yes and…” your way to making people laugh is a great way to push your comfort zone and hopefully meet some fun people along the way.22. ​Adult sports leaguesA few years ago, my wife joined a kickball league, she had a great time meeting new people at games.​If you’re a athletic person who likes a little friendly competition, joining an adult sports league could be a great option to find new people to hang with.23. ​Networking eventsNot just for handing out business cards and talking up the 5 year vision for your career.​The secret to “networking” is being human, and having good conversations with people. The more people you have conversations with, the higher the chance is that you’ll meet new people that you really hit it off with!Also, online networking is an option too:24. ​ConferencesIn a similar vein as networking event, conferences can be fantastic places to meet new people. I especially like traveling to new places to go to conferences that focus on topics that I’m interested in. Mandatory tip: The conference isn’t over at 5 PM! Make sure to go to local bars/restaurants with other attendees. This is where the real fun of conferences is to be had.25. Toastmasters clubsPolishing up your public speaking skills, and meeting new people who are doing the same, what’s not to like?​As with other places to meet new people, be sure to stay after for 5-10 minutes to introduce yourself to some people.Click here to find a local Toastmasters club.26. Speed DatingThis is a fun one that many people write-off. Will you end up meeting the love of your life at a speed dating event? Maybe. What’s more likely is that you’ll have a bunch of short conversations in rapid order with new people.​Part of improving your people skills is practicing, and speed dating is a great way to practice your conversation skills.27. ​Bumble BFFAh apps!Bumble BFF is a uber-convenient way to meet new people. Create an account, upload a picture, and fill out your interests and profile and get to swiping. If you match with someone, you’ll have a limited amount of time to make the first move. Pro-tip: Get good candid pictures preferably taken by a professional. Friend of BMC and personal stylist Peter Nguyen does this for his personal styling clients, and it makes a huge difference.28. ​Self-Development groupsThis one’s a little broad, but if you’re into self-development, finding a group that meets regularly can be a great way to meet new people who are constantly trying to stay motivated and improve.29. ​Language learning groupsLast year, my wife and I started learning American Sign Language (ASL) and she started an ASL meetup group where people could come, have lunch and practice their skills.If you’re into learning a new language, this is a fantastic way to meet new people and improve your language skills at the same time! Win/win!30. Dinner at the bar of a restaurant ​This is another low-key awesome way to meet new people.Find a restaurant that you love, and sit at the bar and have dinner there a couple of nights per week. You’ll meet the bartender, staff, and people hanging out nearby. Pro tip: If you’re feeling a little nervous about going out alone.Bring a book and read it casually at the bar. (Meaning taking frequent breaks from reading to sip your drink, eat some food, etc.)​People WILL ask you what you’re reading. This is an easy way for other people to start conversations with you.31. Reach out to friends-of-friendsSuper underrated tip here.​If you’ve met a friend of a friend a few times, reach out to them and ask them if they want to grab some coffee.Making friends doesn’t mean you have to start from zero! Since you already have connections in common, it’s easier to break the ice and get the conversation started! Pro tip: When asking people to hang out, it’s important to keep the ask low-pressure and give them an option to decline. Saying “We should grab some coffee sometime” and adding “If that doesn’t work for you, that’s totally cool, I’m sure I’ll see you around!”32. Groupon dealsThis is a really outside of the box idea, but you can check your city’s Groupon deals under the “Things to do” section to find some interesting things to do that might put you in a position to meet new people.33. ​Get on your city’s subreddit and ask for recommendations.This is another under-the-radar way to meet new people. Many cities that have over…say…150K population have a subreddit.​This can be a great way to get local recommendations for things to do from people that you may not have heard of.And there are usually new people who are moving to town that are looking for people to hang out with.Pro-tip for US folks: Here’s a list of a bunch of US city subreddits.Bonus tip: How to Start a Conversation at a Meetup or EventThe following is taken from this post on starting conversations.Meetups and classes have the benefit of being structured.Everyone signed up to be there and came specifically to gather and learn or do something together. This takes a lot of the pressure off you because you know the people around you signed up for this!​Try some of these conversation starters to pique interest and make new friends:Hey, it’s my first time here, is this the [Meetup Name] Meetup?Hi, I’ve never tried a [Class Name] Class before. You?Hey, I’m new here. I’m [Your Name]. Hey, is this your first class? I’m [Your Name].I’m so excited about [class subject]!

Steps 1 Take a class. Download Article Chatting with new people is easier if you have similar interests. It’s hard to become friends with someone if you don’t have anything in common. Pick something you’re interested in learning and sign up for a class near you. You could take a dancing class at a studio, a cooking class at a nearby culinary school, or a creative writing class at your local community college.[1] X Research source If you’re still in school, consider taking an elective you’d never otherwise take. If you’re not big on art and most of your friends are into sports, an art class may introduce you to a new crowd. Advertisement 2 Pursue a new social hobby. Download Article Fun group activities make socializing a breeze. Things like community theatre, improv groups, and writing clubs are all perfect when it comes to meeting new people and finding friends. Look online or ask around to see if there’s something interesting out there that you could join. It can be intimidating to join a group where you don’t know anyone, but they’ll welcome you with open arms.[2] X Research source If all of your hobbies are solitary, there are probably social groups out there for them. Reading is the perfect example—if you love a good book, join a book club! If you’re still in high school or college, there are probably social clubs all over the place that you could join. If you’re struggling to find group pertaining to your hobby, check out Meetup. Facebook groups for your area may also have resources for you. 3 Hit the gym or join a sports team.

Over time, you’ll meet the other gym rats who hang around.[3] X Research source If you normally do yoga at home, signing up for a guided yoga class will expose you to people who love the same kind of things you do! Not only is this a great way to meet people, it’s a fun way to stay fit. Advertisement 4 Attend more local events. Download Article For a more artistic crowd, check out local venues and museums. Art gallery openings, concerts, and museum exhibits are all great opportunities to connect with new people. Universities often host lectures and forums for the public if you’re more interested in philosophy, economics, or politics. Poke around and keep an eye out for unique things to do where you might meet new people.[4] X Research source Open mics are awesome options if you’re a singer, poet, or musician. Connecting with other artists can make for some rewarding friendships! 5 Volunteer for a good cause. Download Article Volunteering is perfect if you want to meet people with similar values. You might join a local political organization, or sign up with a neighborhood cleanup crew to help beautify your area. Volunteering is fun and rewarding, and it also happens to be the perfect way to meet folks who have beliefs that align with yours.[5] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Church groups can be a great way to volunteer and meet people with similar religious beliefs if that’s important to you.[6] X Trustworthy Source Pew Research Center Nonpartisan thinktank conducting research and providing information on public opinion, demographic trends, and social trends Go to source If you enjoy being outside, you might volunteer to help out at your local park, or to coach a kid’s sports team. You might offer to help out at a local soup kitchen, or see if anyone needs a hand at your local community center. Advertisement 6 Frequent a nearby bar or coffee shop. Download Article Going to the same local spot will make it easy to meet other regulars. If there’s a local bar you like, try going there for an after-work drink a few times a week. Alternatively, you meet go to a cool coffee shop every Saturday and Sunday around noon to do your homework. Over time, you’ll find yourself running into the same people over and over again. This is a great way to meet new people who probably live near you.[7] X Research source The people who work at the bar or coffee shop will get to know you too. Maybe there’s a fun barista or bartender looking for new friends. 7 Meet your neighbors. Download Article Instead of giving head nods and waves, try talking to them! You know what’s better than a new friend? A new friend who lives a few buildings over from you! Don’t go on autopilot when you see the people on your block—actually engage them in conversation. If you find someone you could see yourself hanging out with, the two of you may become friends over time.[8] X Research source An easy way to chat a neighbor up is to ask about something that happened in the area. You might say, “Hey, do you know why they shut Main Street down last week?” or, “What was all that noise last weekend? It sounded like it was coming from the end of the block.” Alternatively, you could ask for a recommendation. “Do you know if there’s a good Mediterranean place around here?” can spark a friendly conversation. Advertisement 8 Try finding friends online. Download Article Message boards and social media can help you find friends near you. Go on to your local Facebook group and ask if anyone wants to grab a drink, play chess, or just hang out. You can also poke around on meetup sites, your hometown’s Reddit page, or on a friend-finder site to see if anyone near you might need some new pals. There are even apps out there that will help you connect with people near you who are looking for buddies with similar interests.[9] X Research source This might have been an uncommon thing to do a few years ago, but this is super normal these days. Don’t feel weird about finding friends online. 9 Ask a friend to introduce you to others. Download Article Having a mutual friend can put you and some new people at ease. Your old friends may have other friend groups, and asking your friend to introduce you can be a great way to grow your circle. You already like your old friend to begin with, so whoever hangs out with them when you aren’t around can’t be too dissimilar, right?[10] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source The other way to do this is to simply ask them to bring you along the next time they go to a party or head over to a friend’s place for poker night. Reader Poll: We asked 129 wikiHow readers, and 50% agreed that the best way to start a conversation when introducing yourself to someone at a party is to compliment something they are wearing. [Take Poll] Advertisement 10 Open up to new people early and often. Download Article Sharing something personal can put new people at ease. People tend to be a bit guarded when they interact with people they don’t know very well. This can make it hard to connect. To break the barrier, try opening up and being more vulnerable than you might normally be. Just pretend you’re already kind of friends. This will help them connect and bond with you.[11] X Research source For example, if you’re talking to a new person and they ask you how you are, you might normally say, “I’m good, you?” Instead, try saying something like, “I’m great actually! I had a wonderful day. I went shopping actually.” 11 Say yes to every invitation. Download Article Accepting every invite will expose you to the maximum number of people. It’s super easy to find an excuse to not do something. If you’re tired after work, fight through it. If you still have to do the laundry, put it off for later. Say “yes” any time someone asks you to do something. You will meet so many new people if you’re open to going new places and trying new things.[12] X Research source This can be a little uncomfortable if you’re not used to it. The good news is that it gets a lot easier the more often you do it. Advertisement 12 Give people compliments. Download Article People like hanging out with folks who make them feel good. When you’re talking to new people, pick one thing to compliment them on. You might say their outfit is really on point, or tell them you like some accessory they have. As you get to know people better, make the compliments more meaningful. This will make it much easier to build relationships with new people.[13] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source More meaningful compliments might include things like, “You’re really kind,” or, “I love the way you think about things.” You don’t need to go over the top or anything—these little comments matter. 13 Get a dog. Download Article A cute pooch will draw people to you and help you get outside. A pet dog can be a great way to meet new people. You might come across people who want to pet your dog, or meet other dog owners on your walks. On top of that, you’ll have a brand new friend in your pup X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source The more time you spend outside, the more likely you are to meet someone new. A dog is a great motivation for getting out of the house. Don’t get a dog if this is the only reason you’d want one. If you’ve been strongly considering it though, maybe this is the little nudge you need to justify getting one. Advertisement Community Q&A Search Add New Question Question How do I meet people if I don't go to any clubs, etc.? Community Answer In order to meet people, you've got to get out there. Do things you enjoy; find groups that appeal to your interest on sites like Meetup.com, find local volunteer opportunities for a cause that has personal meaning to you, take community education classes.

Maybe you're looking to expand your social circle, or you've recently started going to a new school and you don’t know anybody yet. Regardless of the reason, it helps to know where and how you can meet new people. We know it can be scary to introduce yourself to strangers, but making friends will totally get easier the more you try. For tips on meeting new people, read on and we’ll point you in the right direction. Ways to Meet New People Take a class to meet people with similar interests. Pursue a new social hobby to make socializing easier. Hit the gym, take fitness classes, or join a sports team. Join more local events at venues or museums. Volunteer to meet like-minded individuals. Steps 1 Take a class. Download Article Chatting with new people is easier if you have similar interests. It’s hard to become friends with someone if you don’t have anything in common. Pick something you’re interested in learning and sign up for a class near you. You could take a dancing class at a studio, a cooking class at a nearby culinary school, or a creative writing class at your local community college.[1] X Research source If you’re still in school, consider taking an elective you’d never otherwise take. If you’re not big on art and most of your friends are into sports, an art class may introduce you to a new crowd. Advertisement 2 Pursue a new social hobby. Download Article Fun group activities make socializing a breeze. Things like community theatre, improv groups, and writing clubs are all perfect when it comes to meeting new people and finding friends. Look online or ask around to see if there’s something interesting out there that you could join. It can be intimidating to join a group where you don’t know anyone, but they’ll welcome you with open arms.[2] X Research source If all of your hobbies are solitary, there are probably social groups out there for them. Reading is the perfect example—if you love a good book, join a book club! If you’re still in high school or college, there are probably social clubs all over the place that you could join. If you’re struggling to find group pertaining to your hobby, check out Meetup. Facebook groups for your area may also have resources for you. 3 Hit the gym or join a sports team. Download Article If you’re athletic, these are great ways to meet other active people. There are tons of social sports leagues out there that are always looking for new team members. Even pickup basketball games at the park are a great way to meet people. You can also start going to your local gym on a regular basis. Over time, you’ll meet the other gym rats who hang around.[3] X Research source If you normally do yoga at home, signing up for a guided yoga class will expose you to people who love the same kind of things you do! Not only is this a great way to meet people, it’s a fun way to stay fit. Advertisement 4 Attend more local events. Download Article For a more artistic crowd, check out local venues and museums. Art gallery openings, concerts, and museum exhibits are all great opportunities to connect with new people. Universities often host lectures and forums for the public if you’re more interested in philosophy, economics, or politics. Poke around and keep an eye out for unique things to do where you might meet new people.[4] X Research source Open mics are awesome options if you’re a singer, poet, or musician. Connecting with other artists can make for some rewarding friendships! 5 Volunteer for a good cause. Download Article Volunteering is perfect if you want to meet people with similar values. You might join a local political organization, or sign up with a neighborhood cleanup crew to help beautify your area. Volunteering is fun and rewarding, and it also happens to be the perfect way to meet folks who have beliefs that align with yours.[5] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Church groups can be a great way to volunteer and meet people with similar religious beliefs if that’s important to you.[6] X Trustworthy Source Pew Research Center Nonpartisan thinktank conducting research and providing information on public opinion, demographic trends, and social trends Go to source If you enjoy being outside, you might volunteer to help out at your local park, or to coach a kid’s sports team. You might offer to help out at a local soup kitchen, or see if anyone needs a hand at your local community center. Advertisement 6 Frequent a nearby bar or coffee shop. Download Article Going to the same local spot will make it easy to meet other regulars. If there’s a local bar you like, try going there for an after-work drink a few times a week. Alternatively, you meet go to a cool coffee shop every Saturday and Sunday around noon to do your homework. Over time, you’ll find yourself running into the same people over and over again. This is a great way to meet new people who probably live near you.[7] X Research source The people who work at the bar or coffee shop will get to know you too. Maybe there’s a fun barista or bartender looking for new friends. 7 Meet your neighbors. Download Article Instead of giving head nods and waves, try talking to them! You know what’s better than a new friend? A new friend who lives a few buildings over from you! Don’t go on autopilot when you see the people on your block—actually engage them in conversation. If you find someone you could see yourself hanging out with, the two of you may become friends over time.[8] X Research source An easy way to chat a neighbor up is to ask about something that happened in the area. You might say, “Hey, do you know why they shut Main Street down last week?” or, “What was all that noise last weekend? It sounded like it was coming from the end of the block.” Alternatively, you could ask for a recommendation. “Do you know if there’s a good Mediterranean place around here?” can spark a friendly conversation. Advertisement 8 Try finding friends online. Download Article Message boards and social media can help you find friends near you. Go on to your local Facebook group and ask if anyone wants to grab a drink, play chess, or just hang out. You can also poke around on meetup sites, your hometown’s Reddit page, or on a friend-finder site to see if anyone near you might need some new pals. There are even apps out there that will help you connect with people near you who are looking for buddies with similar interests.[9] X Research source This might have been an uncommon thing to do a few years ago, but this is super normal these days. Don’t feel weird about finding friends online. 9 Ask a friend to introduce you to others. Download Article Having a mutual friend can put you and some new people at ease. Your old friends may have other friend groups, and asking your friend to introduce you can be a great way to grow your circle. You already like your old friend to begin with, so whoever hangs out with them when you aren’t around can’t be too dissimilar, right?[10] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source The other way to do this is to simply ask them to bring you along the next time they go to a party or head over to a friend’s place for poker night. Reader Poll: We asked 129 wikiHow readers, and 50% agreed that the best way to start a conversation when introducing yourself to someone at a party is to compliment something they are wearing. [Take Poll] Advertisement 10 Open up to new people early and often. Download Article Sharing something personal can put new people at ease. People tend to be a bit guarded when they interact with people they don’t know very well. This can make it hard to connect. To break the barrier, try opening up and being more vulnerable than you might normally be. Just pretend you’re already kind of friends. This will help them connect and bond with you.[11] X Research source For example, if you’re talking to a new person and they ask you how you are, you might normally say, “I’m good, you?” Instead, try saying something like, “I’m great actually! I had a wonderful day. I went shopping actually.” 11 Say yes to every invitation. Download Article Accepting every invite will expose you to the maximum number of people. It’s super easy to find an excuse to not do something. If you’re tired after work, fight through it. If you still have to do the laundry, put it off for later. Say “yes” any time someone asks you to do something. You will meet so many new people if you’re open to going new places and trying new things.[12] X Research source This can be a little uncomfortable if you’re not used to it. The good news is that it gets a lot easier the more often you do it. Advertisement 12 Give people compliments. Download Article People like hanging out with folks who make them feel good. When you’re talking to new people, pick one thing to compliment them on. You might say their outfit is really on point, or tell them you like some accessory they have. As you get to know people better, make the compliments more meaningful. This will make it much easier to build relationships with new people.[13] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source More meaningful compliments might include things like, “You’re really kind,” or, “I love the way you think about things.” You don’t need to go over the top or anything—these little comments matter. 13 Get a dog. Download Article A cute pooch will draw people to you and help you get outside. A pet dog can be a great way to meet new people. You might come across people who want to pet your dog, or meet other dog owners on your walks. On top of that, you’ll have a brand new friend in your pup X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source The more time you spend outside, the more likely you are to meet someone new. A dog is a great motivation for getting out of the house. Don’t get a dog if this is the only reason you’d want one. If you’ve been strongly considering it though, maybe this is the little nudge you need to justify getting one. Advertisement Community Q&A Search Add New Question Question How do I meet people if I don't go to any clubs, etc.? Community Answer In order to meet people, you've got to get out there. Do things you enjoy; find groups that appeal to your interest on sites like Meetup.com, find local volunteer opportunities for a cause that has personal meaning to you, take community education classes. Go to concerts, do outdoor activities you like, and basically be places where others will be doing things that you enjoy doing. Thanks! We're glad this was helpful. Thank you for your feedback.

Swmnupsrtm , 18.08.2020 How else ? It's tough for me to socialize. Even when I want to , it's not easy to find what will work. Meetup has given me a chance to connect with people based on mutual interests without feeling forced to socialize more than I want to. I started out with a movie meetup, something I often do alone.i had the option of socializing after too. Next I tried a local place where we could play video games and have snacks or drinks . I then found a group that meets up at a coffee shop to get paperwork done! I had been dreaming of finding something this, I even tried to place an ad for a buddy prior to meetup . I haven't tried started a meetup but it's also a possibility here. I found fellow sci fi lovers too, who knew ?! There are lots of groups for outdoor exercise like hiking and biking and during this time of distancing it may prove to be healthy endeavor. The fact that I can pick and choose is ideal. If you haven't tried meetup I say go for it! I am normally leery of people too and meetup provides a nice balance of meeting ,safety, interests and exploration. The groups are generally closed I found that to join I can say a bit about my interests and check out other profiles. I love that I have been about to hang with a 70 yr old and a 20 year old finding common ground. I can leave if I want or stay for the duration. I can talk sci fi or knit ,color or draw , exercise or chill. It's all there in meetup ! Thank GxD 4 Bad Taste , 21.08.2021 Add a video call feature 2021 is about connecting more than ever. Every app now has video or conference call built in. And if you add it please add screen sharing capabilities for subscription and group leaders. Thanks! Secondly I mentioning how when viewing meetup groups in the app “past events” shows before “upcoming events”. If someone isn’t eager to go through the group events they may not see any upcoming events and think the group isn’t as active. Please fix to make it show the upcoming events before past events via meetup app.///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Update: using the app it doesn’t show or accept certain links when posting new events. It will say “oops we don’t recognize this link please use a different service/link” but via web browser you can publish using link of choice. If someone is using the app and want to join video conference they will not see the link nor be able to join since it shows “TBD” instead of link. Please fix app. *****Also update so we can add video into photos albums * I want to add, anyone having issues with not liking the app via iPad just go on the website (not in private mode) sign in click remember me then add meetup to home screen as an app. Now you will view it full screen with all capabilities as the web version.
