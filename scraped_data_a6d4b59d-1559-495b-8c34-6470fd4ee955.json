From speeding up scriptwriting to streamlining the editing process, they’re helping creators like us focus more on the creative stuff and less on the technical headaches. So, grab a coffee and let’s dive into the top 7 video automation tools that are making waves this year. Whether you’re a YouTube pro or just getting started, I think you’ll find something here to level up your content game. Table of Contents What is Automated Video Creation? Why Video Automation is Essential in 2025 Top 7 Software for Automated Video Creation 1. ZapCap 2. ElevenLabs 3. ToolBaz 4. Opus Clip 5. Buffer 6. Fliki 4 Essential Tips for Effective Automated Video Creation What is Automated Video Creation? Ever wonder how some creators churn out polished videos like they’re running a content factory? Well, let me introduce you to the magic of automated video creation. Imagine software that can edit your footage, slap on some snazzy subtitles, throw in sound effects, and even spruce up the visuals – all while you’re brainstorming your next big idea. That’s automated video creation in a nutshell. It’s all about using smart tools to handle the nitty-gritty tech stuff, so you can focus on what really matters – bringing your creative vision to life. The best part? You don’t need to be a tech wizard to use these tools. They’re designed to help creators like us pump out quality content faster, without getting bogged down in editing software. Ready to see how it can transform your workflow? Why Video Automation is Essential in 2025 In 2025, video automation is not just a luxury—it’s a necessity. With over 500 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, standing out requires more than just creativity; it requires efficiency and scale. According to CalCalistech, internet traffic is projected to increase by 190 times this year​​. This highlights the growing demand for video content and the importance of producing high-quality videos consistently to capture and retain audience attention. Video automation allows creators to generate more content without sacrificing quality. By automating repetitive tasks, creators can focus on what truly matters: storytelling and engagement. Automation tools help streamline video production, reduce costs, and eliminate the need for extensive teams or resources. Additionally, businesses and brands are leveraging video automation to maintain a competitive edge. A survey by Wyzowl reported that 91% of businesses use video as a marketing tool, with 88% of marketers considering video an important part of their strategy​​. With the demand for video content rising, automation tools enable creators to keep up with the pace without burning out. Top 7 Software for Automated Video Creation 1.

ElevenLabs Add Automated Voice-Overs You know how sometimes you need a voiceover for your video but don’t want to record it yourself? That’s where ElevenLabs comes in handy. It’s this cool tool that turns your script into speech, and let me tell you, it sounds pretty darn realistic. Here’s the neat part – you’ve got a ton of voices to choose from. Want a British accent?

The goal is to upload multiple posts and schedule them for publishing—usually on social media platforms. Agencies or brands must use a social media marketing tool with bulk scheduling features to achieve this. Vista Social, for example, is one of the best social media management platforms and IG tools with bulk scheduling features. What are the benefits of bulk scheduling? Bulk scheduling your clients’ social media posts offers several advantages, such as: Improved efficiency. Scheduling multiple posts in one go saves you a lot of time and effort compared to doing it individually. It gives you more time to work on more critical tasks such as engagement management and content development and creation Consistency.

It helps free up mental space, allowing you to be more proactive and creative Bulk scheduling: How to use Vista Social to schedule social media posts in bulk As mentioned, the best way to schedule your social media posts in bulk is to use reliable social media management platforms like Vista Social. The platform offers handy features to help you bulk schedule your posts in several ways. How to bulk schedule posts by importing a CSV file You can use an Excel file or a spreadsheet app like Google Sheets to plan social media posts in bulk and export them as a CSV file. CSV files can then be imported into Vista Social’s bulk schedule tool. Start by clicking Create on the left-hand menu and selecting Bulk publishing. Next, choose the bulk upload method you wish to use, in this case, Import from CSV. You can download the sample CSV here or from your dashboard. In your CSV file, you can include links along with scheduling instructions in addition to post descriptions. Scheduled posts can be set to be queued next or last, published immediately, or published at a specific time. Enter the scheduling instructions in the fourth column of the CSV file. Must read: 142+ Instagram Poll Questions to Ask Your Followers Vista Social requires that the CSV file you import for post scheduling must be in this exact order: Column 1: The post’s message or caption Column 2: An image, video, article, or message Column 3: The link to the image, video, or article Column 4: Posting time in this format: 2024-12-15 5:05 pm or 2024-12-15 17:05. Note that the time can be in 24-hour format or am/pm Remember these important factors when importing CSV files for bulk scheduling social media posts with Vista Social: Links to media files must be to publicly hosted media items Google Drive links are not supported yet, but you can always upload them to your Vista Social media library and use their links in your CSV CSVs from Excel do not support emojis at this time. You can use Google Sheets as an alternative. CSV imports are limited to 200 rows, but it’s best to only upload up to 100 posts to avoid potential issues The rest of your spreadsheet’s columns are optional, which you can use to customize your post further. If you use the exact headings to ensure they are mapped correctly during importing, you can use the columns in any order. You can download a sample CSV file with custom fields here. Vista Social also allows you to schedule posts with multiple media or carousels by adding each media link in separate rows. Ensure you add the same elements to the posts, such as the type, captions, scheduled date and time, etc., to each row like this: How to bulk schedule posts by importing from a blog Using the bulk uploader with a CSV file gives you granular control over posting times. You can also schedule social media posts from just about any website, including your own blog. The downside is you still need to prepare the actual spreadsheet. A faster way to bulk schedule posts is to import content using an RSS feed. Let’s say you want to bulk-schedule posts from Backlinko’s blog. Go back to Create from the main menu, then Bulk publishing. This time, select Import from RSS. Important note: The option is only available for blog post pages and websites with an RSS feed. Copy and paste the site’s RSS feed link (https://backlinko.com/blog/feed) and click Import Vista Social will pull up a recent list of blog posts from the RSS feed’s source. Click on the checkbox beside the posts you wish to import and add to your calendar. You can click on each post and edit the content and posting time. Select Next when you’re done. Remember to specify if you want the blog posts added to your posting queue next or last. You can also save them as a draft or idea. A prompt will appear, and you can click Schedule to bulk schedule your imported blog posts for auto-publishing. How to bulk schedule posts by importing from news articles You can find online articles based on topics your clients’ audiences will likely be interested in and schedule them to auto-publish across social media profiles. Note: Vista Social sources the latest news from Bing News. Select Find news from the Bulk scheduling options and find content by typing in the keyword, product, or company related to the news you want to find in the designated field. Click Find posts, and you should see a list of news articles related to your search term. Tick the boxes beside each news article you want to import and schedule for bulk publishing. You can modify the post per social network, leave it as is, and click Next to set a bulk posting schedule. You’ll get a notification when your post has been scheduled. How to bulk schedule posts by importing from Instagram hashtags Importing posts and bulk-scheduling them for auto-posting works pretty much the same way. Select Hashtag search from the Bulk scheduling options, enter the hashtag you wish to find content from, and click Find posts. You can select the posts you want to schedule, specify their order in the queue, or edit them before hitting Next. Click Schedule and you’re all set. The process is pretty similar when importing and bulk-scheduling posts from other Instagram users. The only difference is instead of entering hashtags, you must enter the Instagram account name, and the platform will pull the posts under that username.

Think about the outrageous amount of hours you’ll waste if you manually create and publish posts on various social media platforms. Add the fact that you have multiple clients and you’ll have the perfect recipe for a social media marketing disaster. That’s why in this post, we’ll show you the easiest way to schedule posts in bulk. But before that… Table of contents What is bulk scheduling? Bulk scheduling does exactly what it says on the tin. The goal is to upload multiple posts and schedule them for publishing—usually on social media platforms. Agencies or brands must use a social media marketing tool with bulk scheduling features to achieve this. Vista Social, for example, is one of the best social media management platforms and IG tools with bulk scheduling features. What are the benefits of bulk scheduling? Bulk scheduling your clients’ social media posts offers several advantages, such as: Improved efficiency. Scheduling multiple posts in one go saves you a lot of time and effort compared to doing it individually. It gives you more time to work on more critical tasks such as engagement management and content development and creation Consistency. Bulk scheduling helps you maintain a steady flow of content for clients, maximizing engagement opportunities Strategic content planning. Scheduling your clients’ posts in bulk helps you plan your content calendar. It allows you to create a cohesive content strategy while ensuring your clients’ posts align with their marketing goals Reduced stress. Having your clients’ posts scheduled and ready to go takes away the bulk of the stress of daily managing social media daily. It helps free up mental space, allowing you to be more proactive and creative Bulk scheduling: How to use Vista Social to schedule social media posts in bulk As mentioned, the best way to schedule your social media posts in bulk is to use reliable social media management platforms like Vista Social. The platform offers handy features to help you bulk schedule your posts in several ways. How to bulk schedule posts by importing a CSV file You can use an Excel file or a spreadsheet app like Google Sheets to plan social media posts in bulk and export them as a CSV file. CSV files can then be imported into Vista Social’s bulk schedule tool. Start by clicking Create on the left-hand menu and selecting Bulk publishing. Next, choose the bulk upload method you wish to use, in this case, Import from CSV. You can download the sample CSV here or from your dashboard. In your CSV file, you can include links along with scheduling instructions in addition to post descriptions. Scheduled posts can be set to be queued next or last, published immediately, or published at a specific time. Enter the scheduling instructions in the fourth column of the CSV file. Must read: 142+ Instagram Poll Questions to Ask Your Followers Vista Social requires that the CSV file you import for post scheduling must be in this exact order: Column 1: The post’s message or caption Column 2: An image, video, article, or message Column 3: The link to the image, video, or article Column 4: Posting time in this format: 2024-12-15 5:05 pm or 2024-12-15 17:05. Note that the time can be in 24-hour format or am/pm Remember these important factors when importing CSV files for bulk scheduling social media posts with Vista Social: Links to media files must be to publicly hosted media items Google Drive links are not supported yet, but you can always upload them to your Vista Social media library and use their links in your CSV CSVs from Excel do not support emojis at this time. You can use Google Sheets as an alternative. CSV imports are limited to 200 rows, but it’s best to only upload up to 100 posts to avoid potential issues The rest of your spreadsheet’s columns are optional, which you can use to customize your post further. If you use the exact headings to ensure they are mapped correctly during importing, you can use the columns in any order. You can download a sample CSV file with custom fields here. Vista Social also allows you to schedule posts with multiple media or carousels by adding each media link in separate rows. Ensure you add the same elements to the posts, such as the type, captions, scheduled date and time, etc., to each row like this: How to bulk schedule posts by importing from a blog Using the bulk uploader with a CSV file gives you granular control over posting times. You can also schedule social media posts from just about any website, including your own blog. The downside is you still need to prepare the actual spreadsheet. A faster way to bulk schedule posts is to import content using an RSS feed. Let’s say you want to bulk-schedule posts from Backlinko’s blog. Go back to Create from the main menu, then Bulk publishing. This time, select Import from RSS. Important note: The option is only available for blog post pages and websites with an RSS feed. Copy and paste the site’s RSS feed link (https://backlinko.com/blog/feed) and click Import Vista Social will pull up a recent list of blog posts from the RSS feed’s source. Click on the checkbox beside the posts you wish to import and add to your calendar. You can click on each post and edit the content and posting time. Select Next when you’re done. Remember to specify if you want the blog posts added to your posting queue next or last. You can also save them as a draft or idea. A prompt will appear, and you can click Schedule to bulk schedule your imported blog posts for auto-publishing. How to bulk schedule posts by importing from news articles You can find online articles based on topics your clients’ audiences will likely be interested in and schedule them to auto-publish across social media profiles. Note: Vista Social sources the latest news from Bing News. Select Find news from the Bulk scheduling options and find content by typing in the keyword, product, or company related to the news you want to find in the designated field. Click Find posts, and you should see a list of news articles related to your search term. Tick the boxes beside each news article you want to import and schedule for bulk publishing. You can modify the post per social network, leave it as is, and click Next to set a bulk posting schedule. You’ll get a notification when your post has been scheduled. How to bulk schedule posts by importing from Instagram hashtags Importing posts and bulk-scheduling them for auto-posting works pretty much the same way. Select Hashtag search from the Bulk scheduling options, enter the hashtag you wish to find content from, and click Find posts. You can select the posts you want to schedule, specify their order in the queue, or edit them before hitting Next. Click Schedule and you’re all set. The process is pretty similar when importing and bulk-scheduling posts from other Instagram users. The only difference is instead of entering hashtags, you must enter the Instagram account name, and the platform will pull the posts under that username.

Suggested Article: 142+ Instagram Poll Questions to Ask Your Followers Below are 4 bulk scheduling tips that will help you squeeze the most value out of your social media posts: 1. Create custom featured images for each post Remember, Vista Social automatically uses the featured image of a scheduled post using the bulk uploader. You don’t want your client’s Instagram profile to be peppered with stock images. That said, be sure to use only custom, high-quality featured images. Make them informative using text overlays, data visualizations, and other useful elements. These can be custom photographs provided by your client or custom designs using a tool like Canva. Image source: Canva.com 2. Prepare your publishing schedule beforehand Marketing agencies can make the most out of the bulk upload feature with a preplanned publishing schedule. On Vista Social, you can easily configure your schedule by setting a publishing queue for your social profile. The best times to post on Instagram are 11AM-1PM and 7PM-9PM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Suggested Article: Content Pillars for Instagram: Examples, Tips, And Steps 3. Balance automation with personalization Publishing posts in bulk will have diminishing returns, especially if it’s the sole strategy in your Instagram marketing playbook. If all the posts on social media are scheduled in bulk, you’ll miss out on other winning Instagram marketing tactics. At the end of the day, a successful Instagram marketing strategy can’t be 100% automated. For instance, some of the best questions to ask on Instagram story lets you take follower engagement to new heights. Of course, you also can’t overlook the importance of influencer marketing, especially in a platform as popular as Instagram. As an agency, you should be able to come up with strategies tailored to your client’s needs. Be sure you’re not relying too much on automation and shortcuts.

I’ve got you covered. Anyone serious about growing on Instagram should be using a scheduler. Not only does it save you a ton of time and effort, but it also provides all sorts of other benefits. For example, a good scheduling tool can help you generate content ideas, write captions, create visuals, discover your best time to post, and streamline all your social media efforts. Over the years, I’ve tested a huge number of the leading social media schedulers. My goal with this post is to share which ones I believe are best for Instagram specifically. Below, I’ll review and compare all my top picks to help you figure out which one is right for you. What is the best Instagram scheduling tool? TL;DR: Pallyy – Best for simplicity. Ideal for content creators. SocialBee – Best balance of features and affordability. Sendible – Best for agencies. Iconosquare – Best UI. 1. Pallyy Pallyy is my top pick for the overall best Instagram scheduler. It’s one of the few scheduling tools I’ve tried that feels like it was built specifically for Instagram (although you can also use it to schedule posts to other platforms, like Facebook, TikTok, and X). The pricing is super straightforward. There’s only one paid plan that gives you access to all of Pallyy’s features, including its visual content calendar, scheduling & auto-publishing tools, unified social inbox, content curation tool, analytics dashboard, bio link tool, and more. You can schedule all types of Instagram posts, including Stories and Reels, and Pallyy will auto-publish them at the time & date you choose. Or add them to a queue to go out at regular intervals. This isn’t anything particularly exciting on its own—most tools with access to Instagram’s API can do the same thing. It’s the little touches that make Pallyy special, like how it lets you preview posts as you create them so you can see exactly what they’ll look like when they go live. And how it lets you plan out your whole feed in advance in the Instagram Grid Planner. Also, the way you schedule Instagram posts on Pallyy is just so much better than other tools. You drag and drop an image, video, or other media file from your media library directly onto the date in the calendar that you want to publish it. Then from there, add your captions, hashtags, first comment, and so on. Most tools have it the other way around: You select a date first, then create a text post, and then add a photo if you want. That difference is why Pallyy is perfect for Instagram—its whole UX is clearly designed for scheduling visual content, rather than text posts, so the process is much faster and more intuitive. The only downside to Pallyy is that it’s not ideal for evergreen content. However, that tends to be less of an issue where Instagram is concerned. That said, if evergreen content is important to you, SocialBee is perfect. Pros and cons Schedule unlimited posts on the premium plan Auto-publish all Instagram post types including Stories & Reels. Highly visual content calendar and scheduling workflow that’s ideal for Instagram Grid Planner is useful for planning your feed Find and repost popular content from other creators Straightforward & affordable pricing for creators & influencers Easy to use with a great UI Can be expensive for teams (you pay extra for each user) Not ideal for evergreen content or content recycling Try Pallyy Free 2. SocialBee SocialBee is my runner-up pick. It’s a powerful Instagram scheduling app that offers a good balance of features at an affordable price point, and it has some cutting-edge features I haven’t seen elsewhere. With SocialBee, you can schedule posts to be auto-published to Instagram through an interactive content calendar. Plus, schedule and cross-post to other supported networks at the same time, like Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, etc. Integrated design tools help you craft the visuals and captions for your Instagram posts, and you also get access to other tools to help you better manage all of your socials, including an engagement feed and analytics dashboard. But what makes SocialBee stand out from the crowd is its AI-powered social media strategy generator, nicknamed Copilot. It’s one of the best AI tools I’ve seen in a scheduler and does a lot of the legwork involved in putting together an Instagram content strategy for you. Not only will it generate all your Instagram posts from scratch, but it’ll also group them into relevant content categories, devise an optimal posting schedule, and queue them up for publishing. That’s potentially months of manual work done for you in seconds. I also really like SocialBee’s new Universal Posting feature, which lets you schedule posts to networks that other scheduling tools don’t support due to API limitations (think Threads, Facebook Groups, Mastodon, Telegram, etc). You still can’t auto-publish directly to these networks through SocialBee as they don’t provide API access, but you schedule posts to them and receive mobile notifications to remind you to publish at the perfect date/time, which is the next best thing. I also need to mention evergreen content. SocialBee is purpose-built for content recycling and resharing of evergreen content. Pros and cons Good balance of features & affordability Category-based and individual Instagram scheduling The best AI tools of any Instagram scheduler Includes the most flexible post composer I’ve tested Social media strategy generator saves tons of time The only tool to offer truly universal posting No free forever plan The platform takes a little bit of time to get used to Try SocialBee Free 3. Sendible Sendible is another full-featured Instagram scheduler and in my opinion, the best choice for agencies that want to control costs. Its publishing toolkit has everything you need to dominate on Instagram. You can create visuals for your posts with the built-in image editor and Canva integration. Then, schedule those posts individually on the integrated content calendar, or save time through ‘smart queues’, which let you queue up multiple posts to be published based on your pre-defined posting schedule. Aside from Instagram, you can also publish to other networks like Facebook, YouTube, X, and LinkedIn. Plus, manage all your social media comments & messages and analyze your performance across all your accounts from the same dashboard. There are a few reasons I think Sendible is a good choice for agencies, but the main one is its ‘client connect’ onboarding feature. It allows clients to connect the profiles they want you to manage securely through a widget you install on your website. I haven’t seen anything like this on any other scheduling tools. I also think Sendible’s automated reporting capabilities are better than most. And it has pretty rich collaboration tools. For example, there’s a shared content library where you can store all the media you use in your Instagram posts for you and your team to access. Plus, you can set up custom user roles with different access permissions, and implement approval workflows to give managers and clients the final say over when each post is ready to publish. Pros and cons The best Instagram scheduler for agencies Lots of time-saving scheduling features like Smart Queues The scheduling calendar is pre-populated with 300 social media holidays for inspiration Offers ‘Client Connect’ secure onboarding Can also schedule & publish content to blog sites like WP, Medium, Tumblr, Blogger Offers first comment scheduling for Instagram (useful for hiding away hashtags) More for agencies than individual influencers/creators Try Sendible Free 4. ContentStudio ContentStudio is an easy-to-use but powerful tool that you can use to schedule and publish posts to Instagram alongside all your other social media profiles in one place. It offers a shared content calendar where you and your team can plan, manage, and organize all your Instagram content. You can schedule posts to specific dates in the calendar, or save time with custom queues and preset content categories. I particularly like Content Studio’s Discover tool—it helps a lot with generating ideas for content to share. Just search for keywords related to your niche or audience and ContentStudio will pull in trending content from across the web in infinite content streams. You can use these to inspire your Instagram posts. You can also use it to discover influencers on Instagram and connect with them. This is useful if you plan on collaborating or running influencer marketing campaigns on Instagram in the future. Another thing I like is Content Studio’s hashtag suggestions. It analyzes the content of your post captions and serves up trending hashtags that you might want to add to extend reach. Not only that, but it also recommends optimal times to publish posts for maximum engagement. On top of all that, you also get access to other useful social media tools including an AI writer, analytics, social media inbox, and more. Pros and cons Offers the best discovery tools of any Instagram scheduler Makes it easy to fill out your calendar with content Easy to use with a nice UI Content categories help you to stay organized Lots of time-saving features to streamline the process of scheduling Instagram posts AI writing tool could be better There’s a bit of a learning curve due to the number of features Try ContentStudio Free 5. Iconosquare Iconosquare has one of the best user interfaces I’ve seen in an Instagram scheduler. It’s similar to Pallyy in that it’s clearly been built around visual content and optimized mainly for Instagram, with an image-based scheduling calendar and Instagram planning grid. Iconosquare doesn’t just offer Instagram scheduling, you can use it to publish posts to all your other socials from one place. As you schedule Instagram posts, it gives you the option of also scheduling a first comment that you can use to add hashtags without making your caption messy. Speaking of hashtags, Iconosquare lets you create saved captions lists, which is a huge time-saver. And it also suggests hashtags as you write. Aside from scheduling and publishing social media posts, Iconosquare offers lots of other useful features. For example, you can generate post ideas and captions with the AI assistant, reply to unread comments and mentions in the Conversations inbox, monitor brand and keyword mentions with the Listening tool, and more. It also offers deeper analytics than most, with all the metrics you could want to measure and evaluate your performance on Instagram and other social networks. I appreciate that Iconosquare doesn’t do any feature gating. You get access to every feature no matter which plan you sign up for. But my main issue is that it’s pretty expensive—the starting price is double that of most other Instagram schedulers. If you don’t need analytics, social listening, or any of the other bells and whistles, then the value for money isn’t there. But if you do, it’s a steal. Iconosquare also offers a bunch of other useful tools for Instagram for free. That includes their bio link tool (use it to create a landing page for all your important links, then add the URL to your bio) and a comment picker (use it to pick winners for your Instagram contests). Pros and cons One of the best user interfaces of any Instagram scheduler I’ve tried An all-in-one solution with lots of useful features Provides deep analytics with all the metrics you could need No feature-gating and straightforward pricing Highly visual workflow that’s perfect for Instagram Very easy to use Expensive if you don’t need extra features like social listening and analytics Try Iconosquare Free 6. Agorapulse Agorapulse is another powerful Instagram scheduler with a lot of neat features that I haven’t seen elsewhere. You can schedule all types of Instagram posts with Agorapulse: posts, Reels, Stories, and Carousels. Posts can be scheduled individually by selecting a date in the calendar, or to save time, added to publishing queues for fully automated scheduling. I like that you can tag products in Agorapulse if you use Instagram Shopping. This is something you can’t do on a lot of other Instagram schedulers. I also like that the calendar has an optional ‘Instagram Grid’ layout, which organizes and displays your scheduled posts in an imitation Instagram feed so you can try different looks out. Agorapulse has some fantastic team collaboration features too. As you schedule posts, you can assign them to different users and set up approval workflows. Then, track where each post is in that workflow (e.g. scheduled, queued, waiting for approval, published, etc.) from the calendar. However, you pay per user on Agorapulse, so if you’re working with a large team, it can be fairly expensive. Pros and cons Schedule any type of Instagram post Capable of tagging products in Instagram posts Four different calendar views including ‘Instagram Grid’ for easy planning Collaborative scheduling workflow with notes, post approvals, and status tags Lots of advanced features (like social listening, ROI tracking, employee advocacy, etc.) Fairly high starting price (and expensive for teams) Includes lots of features you might not need if you just want an Instagram scheduler Try Agorapulse Free 7. Metricool Metricool has a fantastic free forever plan. With it, you can manage social sets for one brand and plan up to 50 pieces of content a month, which is pretty generous. The paid plans are very affordable too. You can use Metricool to compose and publish posts to Instagram and cross-post and other platforms. As you’re scheduling posts, real-time previews show you how they’ll look when they go live. If you work with a team, you’ll appreciate the ability to set up approval workflows so you can sign off on scheduled Instagram posts before they get published. I also like how Metricool’s calendar is color-coded to show you the best times to post. The darker the section of the calendar, the better your posts should perform at that time/day. Sure, a lot of other tools tell you the best time to post—Metricool isn’t unique in that regard. But it is one of the few that shows you that information inside the calendar itself, which is pretty neat. It also lets you filter the best time to post suggestions for specific networks, which again, is something you don’t get with a lot of other tools like this. Another thing I like is the hashtag search feature. Enter a keyword, and it’ll give you a list of popular hashtags on Instagram related to that topic, with metrics to show you how popular each one is. This saves you a lot of time. Plus, it also helps maximize the reach and discoverability of your posts so you can get more views and engagements. Pros and cons A good choice for beginners Very affordable with a generous free plan The color-coded content calendar makes it easy to post at the perfect time Hashtag search is a nice feature Includes a unified social inbox for managing comments and messages Supports boosted posts and ads Includes a link in bio page builder UX could be better Support could be better Try Metricool Free 8. Vista Social Vista Social is another Instagram scheduler with a decent free forever plan. It’s a better choice for brands than influencers/creators as it has some features that are specifically for businesses. Vista Social’s core feature is its publishing toolkit. You can use it to plan your strategy, write Instagram post captions (with the help of AI), and schedule posts way in advance. I like the calendar layout and how you can switch between different profiles and views. It makes it easier to keep track of what posts you’ve got coming up on each network. On top of the scheduler, it also comes with an inbox where you can manage social media messages and comments. Plus, an analytics dashboard where you can analyze what’s working and what isn’t, and a social listening tool that pulls in important conversations and organizes them into feeds. Vista Page is a useful add-on feature for Instagram as it lets you build a microsite to use as a link-in-bio landing page. Vista Social is also the only tool I’ve tried that doubles up as a review management solution. It pulls in reviews from across sites like Facebook, Tripadvisor, Google My Business, Yelp, etc. for you to view, manage, and respond to. This is super useful for brands that want to manage their online reputation alongside their socials but less useful for influencers and content creators. Pros and cons Hassle-free Instagram scheduling Offers a generous free forever plan Great for brands and local businesses Nice scheduling calendar layout Decent analytics Seems to be built more for brands than influencers/creators Includes some features you might not need (like review management) Try Vista Social Free 9. Sprout Social Sprout Social is a top-of-the-line Instagram scheduler and social media management solution built for enterprises. It’s incredibly expensive, with a starting price up to 10 times higher than most other Instagram schedulers. You also pay per seat so it’s even worse for teams. The only time I can see it being worth it is if you’re a large enterprise with exacting needs and a very large budget to work with, so you don’t have to worry too much about the price tag. In that case, you’ll appreciate how feature-rich and flexible Sprout Social is. It doesn’t just offer Instagram scheduling but also a huge array of other social media management tools. That includes features like unified social media publishing, social listening, inbox management, analytics, an integrated content library, best time to post suggestions, a link in bio tool, review management, ad tools, and more. I can see the ‘employee advocacy’ tool being super useful for enterprises too. It provides a way for businesses to leverage their employees in their social marketing campaigns. Also, Sprout Social recently acquired the influencer marketing platform Tagger, so it now unifies influencer and social media marketing in one place. You can use it to find influencers to partner with, handle negotiations, review & approve content, and manage your campaigns end-to-end. Pros and cons Enterprise-tier Instagram scheduler Supports all the main social media platforms Best-in-class feature set Great for teams thanks to rich collaboration features Offers rare features like employee advocacy and influencer marketing The most expensive Instagram scheduler on this list Higher learning curve than other tools (less easy to use) Try Sprout Social Free 10. Hootsuite Hootsuite is another scheduler that seems very expensive on the surface. However, despite the steep starting price, it can actually work out to be an economical choice if you only manage lots of Instagram accounts for different brands (I’ll explain why shortly). You can schedule Instagram Stories, Carousel posts, and regular posts to your Instagram feed towith the help of Hootsuite’s powerful publishing tools and calendar. Plus, cross-post to other networks like X, Facebook, Pinterest, and YouTube. It also comes with content curation tools to help you source ideas, articles, and images for your Instagram posts. Plus, other tools to help you manage your social presence like a listening tool, unified inbox, ads management tool, and employee advocacy solution. One thing I like is that, unlike most other tools, the price of Hootsuite plans isn’t based on the number of social sets you add, but rather the number of social media accounts. For example, you can add up to 10 social accounts and schedule unlimited posts on Hootsuite’s entry-level plan. But crucially, you could use all of those account slots for Instagram accounts specifically. So in practice, you could schedule Instagram posts for up to 10 different brands on that plan. In contrast, another tool that lets you add 10 accounts might restrict that to just 2 social sets (5 accounts on different social networks per social set), so you could only manage 2 brands. See what I mean? This can offset the high price tag somewhat and make it reasonably good value for money in certain use cases. Pros and cons Enterprise-focused feature set Reliable best time to post suggestions Excellent team collaboration features Solid content curation tools Pricing is based on the number of accounts rather than social sets (good if you exclusively manage Instagram accounts) Very expensive More focused on brands/agencies than individual Instagram creators/influencers Try Hootsuite Free 11. Buffer Buffer is the last Instagram scheduling tool to make the cut. I was impressed by its generous free plan and category-based scheduling capabilities but felt the UI could be better. Buffer has all the features you’d expect from an all-in-one scheduler, including tools for publishing, content creation, engagement management, and analytics and reporting. You can schedule Instagram posts on the unified social media calendar. Rather than choosing a time for each post individually, you can group posts into categories and then set a schedule for each category. I’ve found this is a lot quicker. I also like that Buffer offers both auto-publishing and notification publishing. The former is when the tool publishes posts for you, the latter is when it sends you a reminder at the time/date you choose so you can do it manually. You might wonder why you’d ever choose the latter, but it does give you more creative control. Publishing manually with the help of Buffer’s reminder notifications means you’ll be able to finish the post things like stickers, product tags, music, etc. as you post that you wouldn’t be able to add in Buffer due to API limitations. On Buffer’s free plan, you can connect up to 3 Instagram accounts, and schedule up to 10 posts per Instagram account, per month. If you only plan to publish a couple of posts per week, this should be enough, but paid plans are also super cheap if you need unlimited scheduling or want to unlock extra features like engagement tools, analytics, etc. Pros and cons Schedule all Instagram post types Cross-post to other social media platforms Includes content creation, inbox management, and analytics features Hands-off scheduling with content queues Offers auto-publishing and push notifications Very affordable and offers excellent value for money Free plan is good enough for low-volume publishing The user interface could be better Missing some advanced features Try Buffer Free Conclusion There you have it—everything you need to know about the top Instagram scheduling apps on the market. Or at least, in my opinion. Keep in mind that most of the tools we’ve looked at provide the same basic scheduling features. After all, they all have access to the same Instagram API, so there’s not going to be a huge difference between them in terms of their scheduling/publishing functionality. What differentiates them is their user interfaces, price, and all the extra features they come with to make your life as a social media manager easier. If you’re not sure which one to choose, I’d recommend testing a few of them out for yourself to see which you like best. Most offer a free plan or at least a free trial, so you should be able to try them out risk-free. If you still haven’t found the right tool for you, you can find more options in my comparison of the best social media scheduler tools. If you plan to run giveaways on Instagram, I’d also recommend checking out these social media contest tools.

I’ve got you covered. Anyone serious about growing on Instagram should be using a scheduler. Not only does it save you a ton of time and effort, but it also provides all sorts of other benefits. For example, a good scheduling tool can help you generate content ideas, write captions, create visuals, discover your best time to post, and streamline all your social media efforts. Over the years, I’ve tested a huge number of the leading social media schedulers. My goal with this post is to share which ones I believe are best for Instagram specifically. Below, I’ll review and compare all my top picks to help you figure out which one is right for you. What is the best Instagram scheduling tool? TL;DR: Pallyy – Best for simplicity. Ideal for content creators. SocialBee – Best balance of features and affordability. Sendible – Best for agencies. Iconosquare – Best UI. 1. Pallyy Pallyy is my top pick for the overall best Instagram scheduler. It’s one of the few scheduling tools I’ve tried that feels like it was built specifically for Instagram (although you can also use it to schedule posts to other platforms, like Facebook, TikTok, and X). The pricing is super straightforward. There’s only one paid plan that gives you access to all of Pallyy’s features, including its visual content calendar, scheduling & auto-publishing tools, unified social inbox, content curation tool, analytics dashboard, bio link tool, and more. You can schedule all types of Instagram posts, including Stories and Reels, and Pallyy will auto-publish them at the time & date you choose. Or add them to a queue to go out at regular intervals. This isn’t anything particularly exciting on its own—most tools with access to Instagram’s API can do the same thing. It’s the little touches that make Pallyy special, like how it lets you preview posts as you create them so you can see exactly what they’ll look like when they go live. And how it lets you plan out your whole feed in advance in the Instagram Grid Planner. Also, the way you schedule Instagram posts on Pallyy is just so much better than other tools. You drag and drop an image, video, or other media file from your media library directly onto the date in the calendar that you want to publish it. Then from there, add your captions, hashtags, first comment, and so on. Most tools have it the other way around: You select a date first, then create a text post, and then add a photo if you want. That difference is why Pallyy is perfect for Instagram—its whole UX is clearly designed for scheduling visual content, rather than text posts, so the process is much faster and more intuitive. The only downside to Pallyy is that it’s not ideal for evergreen content. However, that tends to be less of an issue where Instagram is concerned. That said, if evergreen content is important to you, SocialBee is perfect. Pros and cons Schedule unlimited posts on the premium plan Auto-publish all Instagram post types including Stories & Reels. Highly visual content calendar and scheduling workflow that’s ideal for Instagram Grid Planner is useful for planning your feed Find and repost popular content from other creators Straightforward & affordable pricing for creators & influencers Easy to use with a great UI Can be expensive for teams (you pay extra for each user) Not ideal for evergreen content or content recycling Try Pallyy Free 2. SocialBee SocialBee is my runner-up pick. It’s a powerful Instagram scheduling app that offers a good balance of features at an affordable price point, and it has some cutting-edge features I haven’t seen elsewhere. With SocialBee, you can schedule posts to be auto-published to Instagram through an interactive content calendar. Plus, schedule and cross-post to other supported networks at the same time, like Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, etc. Integrated design tools help you craft the visuals and captions for your Instagram posts, and you also get access to other tools to help you better manage all of your socials, including an engagement feed and analytics dashboard. But what makes SocialBee stand out from the crowd is its AI-powered social media strategy generator, nicknamed Copilot. It’s one of the best AI tools I’ve seen in a scheduler and does a lot of the legwork involved in putting together an Instagram content strategy for you. Not only will it generate all your Instagram posts from scratch, but it’ll also group them into relevant content categories, devise an optimal posting schedule, and queue them up for publishing. That’s potentially months of manual work done for you in seconds. I also really like SocialBee’s new Universal Posting feature, which lets you schedule posts to networks that other scheduling tools don’t support due to API limitations (think Threads, Facebook Groups, Mastodon, Telegram, etc). You still can’t auto-publish directly to these networks through SocialBee as they don’t provide API access, but you schedule posts to them and receive mobile notifications to remind you to publish at the perfect date/time, which is the next best thing. I also need to mention evergreen content. SocialBee is purpose-built for content recycling and resharing of evergreen content. Pros and cons Good balance of features & affordability Category-based and individual Instagram scheduling The best AI tools of any Instagram scheduler Includes the most flexible post composer I’ve tested Social media strategy generator saves tons of time The only tool to offer truly universal posting No free forever plan The platform takes a little bit of time to get used to Try SocialBee Free 3. Sendible Sendible is another full-featured Instagram scheduler and in my opinion, the best choice for agencies that want to control costs. Its publishing toolkit has everything you need to dominate on Instagram. You can create visuals for your posts with the built-in image editor and Canva integration. Then, schedule those posts individually on the integrated content calendar, or save time through ‘smart queues’, which let you queue up multiple posts to be published based on your pre-defined posting schedule. Aside from Instagram, you can also publish to other networks like Facebook, YouTube, X, and LinkedIn. Plus, manage all your social media comments & messages and analyze your performance across all your accounts from the same dashboard. There are a few reasons I think Sendible is a good choice for agencies, but the main one is its ‘client connect’ onboarding feature. It allows clients to connect the profiles they want you to manage securely through a widget you install on your website. I haven’t seen anything like this on any other scheduling tools. I also think Sendible’s automated reporting capabilities are better than most. And it has pretty rich collaboration tools. For example, there’s a shared content library where you can store all the media you use in your Instagram posts for you and your team to access. Plus, you can set up custom user roles with different access permissions, and implement approval workflows to give managers and clients the final say over when each post is ready to publish. Pros and cons The best Instagram scheduler for agencies Lots of time-saving scheduling features like Smart Queues The scheduling calendar is pre-populated with 300 social media holidays for inspiration Offers ‘Client Connect’ secure onboarding Can also schedule & publish content to blog sites like WP, Medium, Tumblr, Blogger Offers first comment scheduling for Instagram (useful for hiding away hashtags) More for agencies than individual influencers/creators Try Sendible Free 4.

In contrast, another tool that lets you add 10 accounts might restrict that to just 2 social sets (5 accounts on different social networks per social set), so you could only manage 2 brands. See what I mean? This can offset the high price tag somewhat and make it reasonably good value for money in certain use cases. Pros and cons Enterprise-focused feature set Reliable best time to post suggestions Excellent team collaboration features Solid content curation tools Pricing is based on the number of accounts rather than social sets (good if you exclusively manage Instagram accounts) Very expensive More focused on brands/agencies than individual Instagram creators/influencers Try Hootsuite Free 11. Buffer Buffer is the last Instagram scheduling tool to make the cut. I was impressed by its generous free plan and category-based scheduling capabilities but felt the UI could be better. Buffer has all the features you’d expect from an all-in-one scheduler, including tools for publishing, content creation, engagement management, and analytics and reporting. You can schedule Instagram posts on the unified social media calendar. Rather than choosing a time for each post individually, you can group posts into categories and then set a schedule for each category. I’ve found this is a lot quicker. I also like that Buffer offers both auto-publishing and notification publishing. The former is when the tool publishes posts for you, the latter is when it sends you a reminder at the time/date you choose so you can do it manually. You might wonder why you’d ever choose the latter, but it does give you more creative control. Publishing manually with the help of Buffer’s reminder notifications means you’ll be able to finish the post things like stickers, product tags, music, etc. as you post that you wouldn’t be able to add in Buffer due to API limitations. On Buffer’s free plan, you can connect up to 3 Instagram accounts, and schedule up to 10 posts per Instagram account, per month. If you only plan to publish a couple of posts per week, this should be enough, but paid plans are also super cheap if you need unlimited scheduling or want to unlock extra features like engagement tools, analytics, etc. Pros and cons Schedule all Instagram post types Cross-post to other social media platforms Includes content creation, inbox management, and analytics features Hands-off scheduling with content queues Offers auto-publishing and push notifications Very affordable and offers excellent value for money Free plan is good enough for low-volume publishing The user interface could be better Missing some advanced features Try Buffer Free Conclusion There you have it—everything you need to know about the top Instagram scheduling apps on the market. Or at least, in my opinion. Keep in mind that most of the tools we’ve looked at provide the same basic scheduling features. After all, they all have access to the same Instagram API, so there’s not going to be a huge difference between them in terms of their scheduling/publishing functionality. What differentiates them is their user interfaces, price, and all the extra features they come with to make your life as a social media manager easier. If you’re not sure which one to choose, I’d recommend testing a few of them out for yourself to see which you like best. Most offer a free plan or at least a free trial, so you should be able to try them out risk-free. If you still haven’t found the right tool for you, you can find more options in my comparison of the best social media scheduler tools. If you plan to run giveaways on Instagram, I’d also recommend checking out these social media contest tools. Once you’ve chosen a scheduler, make sure you don’t forget to check out these social media post ideas for inspiration to help you fill out your content calendar.

Ugh. The soul-crushing repetitive tasks go on and on and... 🥱 This is where social media automation saves the day. Heroic, really. So let's take a look at some social media automation tools to take some of that really (really) boring stuff off your hands. How Automation Helps Your Social Media Check out some cool stuff social media automation tech can do for you! 1. Consolidate all your social platforms. Social media is a powerful tool, but it can also be time-consuming and overwhelming. Fortunately, automated posting software, social media scheduling software, and social media management tools can help you consolidate all your social media platforms and streamline your workflow. With the right marketing automation tools, you can easily manage multiple accounts across different platforms with just a few clicks. 2. Automate your content. Your content marketing strategy guides your content creation process, and social media tools speed up content curation, helping you find, adjust or resize images, add captions, make flyers, animated images, GIFs, etc. AI writing tools can also help you write your social media posts with only a few simple settings and prompts. Republishing content is a regular part of any social media strategy, as feeds refresh all the time. Social media automation helps republish content in cycles that you pre-determine, helping you to fill up your social media content calendar in a way that is not too repetitive but still maintains your key messaging. It’s no secret that scheduling content is the best way to stay ahead of consistent content publishing on your social media platform. Automation features help you save time by automating repetitive social media tasks such as scheduling posts in advance or reposting content from other accounts.
