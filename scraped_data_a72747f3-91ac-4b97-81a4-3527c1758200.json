Conclusion: Building a Sustainable Link Profile on a Budget Understanding the Value of Backlinks in SEO Before getting into cost-effective link building techniques, let’s consider what makes backlinks valuable in the first place. In the eyes of search engines like Google, backlinks signal that your content is valuable and trustworthy, especially if they come from highly authoritative sources. When reputable sites link to your page, it sends a strong message to search algorithms that your content is worth showing to their users more than other matching pages. Backlinks are one of the most important SEO ranking factors. Google’s algorithm specifically weighs backlinks heavily when determining whether a website should appear in search results and how highly. The more high-quality backlinks you have, the more likely you are to rank for competitive keywords, because Google interprets backlinks as third-party endorsements, essentially vouching for the reliability and usefulness of your context (unless they are nofollow links). The Challenges of Budget Link Building While link building is a vital part of SEO, it’s often seen as one of the most challenging and expensive aspects of digital marketing. For many businesses, especially small or growing ones, allocating a large budget to SEO and link-building efforts can feel out of reach. High-authority backlinks don’t come easily or cheaply, and the time and resources needed to build an effective backlink profile can quickly add up. Is it possible to build quality backlinks on a limited budget, then? The answer is yes, but it’s important to understand the obstacles that make budget-friendly link building difficult. What Makes Link Building Potentially Expensive? Many factors, such as the time-consuming nature of outreach, the cost of creating link-worthy content, and the challenges of acquiring links from high-authority sites, contribute to the perception that effective link building is expensive. While the concept of getting backlinks seems straightforward—other websites linking to your content—the reality is much more complex. There are significant costs associated with time, resources, and sometimes money when it comes to building a sustainable, high-quality backlink profile. One of the primary reasons link building is considered expensive is the sheer amount of time it requires. Securing backlinks is not a process that happens overnight. It involves extensive research, outreach, and relationship-building. Researching potential sites, personalized outreach, and follow-up all take time and effort. Then comes content creation, which requires content types specifically designed to attract backlinks, along with costs associated (hiring writers, design and development costs, media promotion, etc.). Securing high-authority backlink opportunities is also notoriously difficult. These sites receive pitches from countless websites daily, and standing out from the crowd with a compelling value proposition is the only way to get their attention. While third-party link-building services can be an option, avoid directly purchasing links, as this violates Google’s guidelines and can lead to severe penalties, including complete removal from search results. Common Misconceptions About Affordable Link Building Many businesses immediately assume that only expensive link-building services can deliver results, leading them to shy away from pursuing cost-effective strategies that bring long-term benefits. It’s important to remember that budget-friendly link building doesn’t have to mean low-quality. One of the biggest misconceptions is that inexpensive links are inherently low-quality and harmful to your SEO. This belief stems from an overgeneralization based on unethical practices like purchasing links from link farms or low-quality directories, which indeed offer poor value and can hurt your rankings. However, cost-effectiveness doesn’t have to mean cutting corners. Many niche blogs, even with strong domain authority, accept guest posts without charging a fee. Networking with industry peers and engaging with bloggers, offering value to other businesses through collaborations, can also help you naturally earn backlinks over time. Creating high-quality, linkable content requires few things except from a competent writer. You can even audit and repurpose existing content to reduce costs and optimize what you already have. These strategies require effort and time, but not necessarily large financial investments. The key takeaway is that the value of a backlink is determined by its relevance, authority, and natural placement—not by how much money was spent to obtain it. DIY link building is definitely a viable solution, it only needs careful strategizing and execution. Quality Over Quantity: The Power of Building Fewer, Better Links The phrase “less is more” is definitely true in link building. Search engines, particularly Google, prioritize backlinks that are both relevant and authoritative. A few links from high-authority, well-respected websites in your niche can significantly boost your website’s rankings, whereas a large volume of low-quality or irrelevant links can provide little to no SEO benefit—and may even hurt your rankings. High-quality backlinks come from authoritative and trustworthy websites that are relevant to your industry. While domain authority (DA), a metric developed by Moz, isn't an official ranking factor used by Google, it serves as a useful indicator of a site's credibility. In addition to authority, relevance is crucial—links from websites related to your niche hold more value than those from unrelated sources. For example, if you run a health and fitness blog, a backlink from a reputable health website is more valuable than one from a generic business directory or unrelated blog. Cost-Effective Link Building Strategies As we mentioned a few times already, link building doesn’t have to come with a hefty price tag. While many traditional link-building methods can be expensive, there are numerous cost-effective strategies that can help you secure high-quality backlinks without overspending. The key is to focus on creativity, value, and strategic outreach. Below, we explore 13 practical and affordable link-building techniques that can help improve your SEO and boost your website’s authority without breaking the bank. 1. Create Shareable, High-Quality Content One of the most effective and sustainable ways to build backlinks is to create linkable assets—high-quality, shareable content that naturally earns backlinks because it provides value to readers, answers common questions, or offers unique insights. This approach not only reduces the need for extensive outreach but also ensures that the backlinks you receive are relevant and authoritative. Linkable assets are pieces of content designed to be so valuable, informative, or engaging that other websites are compelled to link to them. These assets can come in various forms, but their common feature is that they offer something unique or highly useful to the target audience. They could include: In-depth guides and tutorials Original research and data Infographics and other visual data and trend representations Case studies Lists of resources, helpful material, tools, etc. 2. Use Link Building platforms Link-building platforms like WhitePress are powerful, cost-effective tools for acquiring high-quality backlinks without the need for extensive manual outreach. These platforms connect marketers, SEO professionals, and businesses with reputable websites open to content collaborations, offering opportunities for organic and strategic link-building. One of the major advantages is the clear cost visibility they offer, allowing users to see exactly how much they'll spend upfront, making it easier to manage budgets. Additionally, they save significant time by streamlining the entire process, which contributes to reducing overall costs. WhitePress connects you to thousands of websites across multiple industries and geographic regions. This allows you to diversify your backlink profile by acquiring links from a variety of sources, which is beneficial for SEO. Whether your focus is on local, national, or international markets, WhitePress platform offers ample opportunities to expand your reach while staying in control of costs. 3. Leverage Social Media for Link Opportunities Social media platforms are a powerful yet often underutilized tool for link building. While social media links themselves may not directly impact SEO due to their \"nofollow\" attribute, social media activity can indirectly lead to valuable backlinks. By promoting your content, engaging with influencers, and leveraging your social media presence, you can create opportunities for others to discover and link to your website. One of the most effective ways to leverage social media for link building is by engaging with influencers in your niche. Influencers have the power to amplify your content, and their followers often trust and act on their recommendations, leading to organic backlinks. Start by following influencers who are relevant to your industry on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Engage with their posts by commenting thoughtfully, retweeting, and liking their content. This helps you get on their radar and establishes a connection without directly asking for anything upfront. You can track social media mentions with tools like Google Alerts, Mention, Brand24, or BuzzSumo. 4. Guest Posting on Relevant Websites Guest posting is one of the most effective and budget-friendly link-building strategies, allowing you to gain high-quality backlinks, build relationships, and establish authority within your niche. By contributing valuable content to reputable websites in your industry, you not only earn backlinks but also reach new audiences. However, it’s important to approach guest posting strategically to avoid common pitfalls. To find guest posting opportunities, search for reputable blogs in your niche that accept guest contributions. You can use tools like Ahrefs to analyze potential sites or perform Google searches with phrases such as \"your niche + write for us\" to discover relevant websites. Analyzing your competitors' backlinks can also reveal where they have published guest posts, offering additional opportunities. 5. Utilize Connectively (Formerly known as HARO - Help a Reporter Out) Connectively, formerly known as HARO (Help a Reporter Out), is a platform that connects journalists with sources for their stories. It offers a valuable opportunity for businesses to gain media exposure and earn high-quality backlinks by providing expert insights and quotes to reporters. Connectively sends out daily queries from journalists seeking information on various topics, and if your response is selected, you can earn a mention and a backlink from reputable media outlets. To use Connectively effectively, it’s crucial to craft compelling responses. Start by responding quickly, as reporters often work on tight deadlines. Tailor your response specifically to the journalist's query by providing concise, valuable, and relevant information. Avoid generic responses and ensure that your expertise directly addresses the question. 6. The Art of Ethical Link Exchange Reciprocal linking, or link exchange, involves two websites agreeing to link to each other, often in a mutually beneficial arrangement. When done ethically, it can provide benefits such as increased referral traffic and an enhanced backlink profile, as long as the exchanged links are relevant and valuable to both audiences. Here, the key is to focus on quality over quantity. Only exchange links with websites that are relevant to your niche and provide value to your visitors. Always make sure the link placement is natural and adds context, rather than appearing as a forced attempt to manipulate rankings. Avoid large-scale or automated link exchanges, which can trigger penalties from search engines like Google. 7. Converting Brand Mentions into Backlinks To find unlinked mentions of your brand, you can use tools like Google Alerts, Mention, or Ahrefs. These tools monitor the web for any mention of your brand name, products, or services. Once you've identified unlinked mentions, the next step is to reach out to the webmaster or content creator. When reaching out, keep your request polite and professional. Acknowledge that you appreciate the mention of your brand, and politely ask if they could include a link back to your website. 8. Broken Link Building Broken link building is a strategy that involves finding broken links on other websites and offering your own relevant content as a replacement. This helps webmasters fix their broken links while providing you with a valuable backlink in return. It’s a win-win, as the website owner improves their user experience, and you earn a high-quality link. To implement broken link building, start by identifying broken links on websites in your niche. Tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Check My Links can help you scan websites for broken links. The easiest approach is to analyze your competitors’ backlink profiles to find broken backlinks leading to dead pages. Once you have identified a broken link, check if you already have content that could serve as a replacement. If not, consider creating a new resource that aligns with the broken link. Crafting effective outreach emails is key to this strategy. When reaching out to the site owner, be polite and highlight the issue with the broken link. Offer your content as a helpful replacement and explain how it would provide value to their readers. Keep the message concise and professional, focusing on the mutual benefits of fixing the broken link and using your resource as a replacement. 9. Competitive Link Analysis: Learning from Your Rivals Competitive link analysis involves examining your competitors' backlink profiles to uncover valuable insights into their link-building strategies. By analyzing where your competitors are getting their backlinks, you can identify potential opportunities for your own site and replicate their success. To conduct a competitor backlink analysis, use tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Moz. These tools allow you to explore the backlinks your competitors have acquired, revealing linking domains, anchor text, and link authority. Start by identifying your top competitors and inputting their URLs into these tools to analyze their backlink profiles. Once you’ve uncovered their backlinks, focus on replicating the ones that are relevant and high-quality. For example, if they have earned links through guest posting, reach out to the same publications or websites with your own unique content pitch. Also, look for unique link opportunities your competitors may have missed by analyzing gaps in their strategy. 10. Build Relationships with Industry Influencers Relationship-based link building focuses on forming long-term connections with industry influencers, which can lead to organic backlinks and increased exposure over time. Rather than one-off link exchanges, building genuine relationships with influencers can result in sustained collaboration, content sharing, and mutual promotion. When using social media and email for outreach, keep the communication concise and clear. Personalize every message, avoid generic requests, and focus on building a relationship over time rather than pushing for immediate links. This approach creates a foundation for ongoing collaborations, which naturally leads to more link opportunities. 11. Engage in Online Communities and Forums Participating in online communities and forums can be a valuable way to build links while establishing authority in your niche. The key is to engage genuinely, offering meaningful contributions rather than simply dropping links. Communities like Reddit, Quora, and niche-specific forums such as Stack Overflow (for tech) or specialized industry boards are great places to start. When including links, do so naturally and only when relevant to the discussion. You can include links in responses when they directly add value to the conversation or provide additional resources. Some forums also allow you to add links in your signature, but this should be done sparingly and only in a professional manner. 12. Leveraging Business Directories for Quality Backlinks Business directories still play a valuable role in modern SEO, providing opportunities for quality backlinks while increasing your online visibility. When listed in reputable, industry-specific directories, your site can benefit from both the authority of the directory and increased referral traffic. Some examples of reputable directories include Yelp, TripAdvisor, and niche-specific directories such as Clutch (for B2B services) and Houzz (for home improvement professionals). 13. Outreach Outreach involves connecting with website owners to secure backlinks by offering valuable resources like expert insights, data, or well-crafted content. The key to successful outreach is personalization and relevance. Identify websites in your niche that could benefit from your resource and craft a message that highlights the specific value it adds to their audience or content. Instead of generic requests, tailor your pitch to the site’s needs, showing genuine interest in their work. Be respectful of their time, keep your message concise, and clearly outline how your resource benefits their readers. Maximizing your link-building efforts on a budget often requires a strategic approach, and one effective method to consider is tiered link building. This strategy involves creating layers of backlinks to amplify the authority passed to your target pages, helping you achieve better rankings without overspending. By combining high-quality links with secondary tiers that support them, you can create a cost-efficient and scalable system. Measuring the Success of Your Link Building Campaign To know whether your link building efforts are actually succeeding in achieving your set goals, you’ll need a way to measure their impact. Thankfully, there is a range of tools that help track key metrics and provide insights into the effectiveness of your backlink profile. Google Analytics is a powerful tool for tracking the performance of your backlinks. By navigating to the Acquisition > All Traffic > Referrals section, you can see the websites that are sending traffic to your site through backlinks. Additionally, you can set up Goals in Google Analytics to track how referral traffic from specific backlinks converts into desired actions on your site, such as sign-ups, purchases, or downloads. When tracking your performance, keep these metrics in mind: Domain Authority (DA) or Domain Rating (DR): These are metrics provided by tools like Moz (DA) or Ahrefs (DR) that estimate the strength and authority of a website’s backlink profile. Number of Backlinks: Tracking the number of new backlinks over time helps you see how well your campaign is acquiring links. However, quality should be prioritized over quantity, so focus on authoritative links from relevant sites. Referral Traffic: Backlinks can drive direct traffic to your site. Google Analytics can help you track how much referral traffic is coming from the links you’ve built. An increase in referral traffic shows that your links are placed on websites with engaged audiences. Keyword Rankings: High-quality backlinks can improve your rankings for targeted keywords. Monitor the search engine rankings of your key terms to see if your link-building efforts are positively impacting your SEO. Linking Domains: This metric tracks the number of unique domains that link back to your website. Having diverse, authoritative linking domains is more valuable than getting many links from a single source. For budget-conscious campaigns, setting realistic and achievable goals is essential. Instead of focusing on rapid domain authority growth or hundreds of backlinks, prioritize smaller, attainable targets, such as building a set number of high-quality links from niche-relevant sites within a certain timeframe. Aim for steady, incremental growth rather than expecting immediate results. Common Pitfalls to Avoid in Budget Link Building While budget-friendly link-building can be effective, there are several pitfalls that can undermine your efforts and even harm your website’s SEO. Black-hat SEO techniques often promise quick and cheap backlinks, but they come with significant risks. Tactics such as buying links, using automated link-building tools, or participating in link schemes may offer short-term gains but can lead to penalties from search engines, especially Google. Link farms and private blog networks (PBNs) are often marketed as inexpensive solutions to quickly build a large number of backlinks. However, links from these sources are generally low-quality, and Google is becoming increasingly adept at identifying these networks and penalizing sites that participate in them. Instead of relying on these shortcuts, it’s important to seek out high-quality backlinks from relevant, authoritative websites that provide real value to their audience. A few strong, reputable backlinks are far more beneficial than a large number of low-quality ones. Conclusion: Building a Sustainable Link Profile on a Budget Developing a strong link profile on a budget is entirely achievable with the right strategies and a focus on quality over quantity. Budget-friendly link-building requires patience and creativity—by prioritizing high-quality backlinks over low-quality alternatives, you can enhance your website’s SEO incrementally without breaking the bank. Throughout this guide, we’ve explored a variety of cost-effective link-building strategies, such as creating shareable content, leveraging link-building platforms, guest posting, and engaging in online communities. We’ve also emphasized the importance of avoiding black-hat techniques like link farms and PBNs, which can lead to search engine penalties, and the need to maintain a natural link profile by earning backlinks from diverse and authoritative sources. Ultimately, building a sustainable link profile on a budget is about consistency, strategic outreach, and long-term relationship building. Stay focused on high-quality, relevant backlinks, and you’ll see your site’s authority grow and your search engine rankings improve—all without overspending.

Conclusion: Building a Sustainable Link Profile on a Budget Understanding the Value of Backlinks in SEO Before getting into cost-effective link building techniques, let’s consider what makes backlinks valuable in the first place. In the eyes of search engines like Google, backlinks signal that your content is valuable and trustworthy, especially if they come from highly authoritative sources. When reputable sites link to your page, it sends a strong message to search algorithms that your content is worth showing to their users more than other matching pages. Backlinks are one of the most important SEO ranking factors. Google’s algorithm specifically weighs backlinks heavily when determining whether a website should appear in search results and how highly. The more high-quality backlinks you have, the more likely you are to rank for competitive keywords, because Google interprets backlinks as third-party endorsements, essentially vouching for the reliability and usefulness of your context (unless they are nofollow links). The Challenges of Budget Link Building While link building is a vital part of SEO, it’s often seen as one of the most challenging and expensive aspects of digital marketing. For many businesses, especially small or growing ones, allocating a large budget to SEO and link-building efforts can feel out of reach. High-authority backlinks don’t come easily or cheaply, and the time and resources needed to build an effective backlink profile can quickly add up. Is it possible to build quality backlinks on a limited budget, then? The answer is yes, but it’s important to understand the obstacles that make budget-friendly link building difficult. What Makes Link Building Potentially Expensive? Many factors, such as the time-consuming nature of outreach, the cost of creating link-worthy content, and the challenges of acquiring links from high-authority sites, contribute to the perception that effective link building is expensive. While the concept of getting backlinks seems straightforward—other websites linking to your content—the reality is much more complex. There are significant costs associated with time, resources, and sometimes money when it comes to building a sustainable, high-quality backlink profile. One of the primary reasons link building is considered expensive is the sheer amount of time it requires. Securing backlinks is not a process that happens overnight. It involves extensive research, outreach, and relationship-building. Researching potential sites, personalized outreach, and follow-up all take time and effort. Then comes content creation, which requires content types specifically designed to attract backlinks, along with costs associated (hiring writers, design and development costs, media promotion, etc.). Securing high-authority backlink opportunities is also notoriously difficult. These sites receive pitches from countless websites daily, and standing out from the crowd with a compelling value proposition is the only way to get their attention. While third-party link-building services can be an option, avoid directly purchasing links, as this violates Google’s guidelines and can lead to severe penalties, including complete removal from search results. Common Misconceptions About Affordable Link Building Many businesses immediately assume that only expensive link-building services can deliver results, leading them to shy away from pursuing cost-effective strategies that bring long-term benefits. It’s important to remember that budget-friendly link building doesn’t have to mean low-quality. One of the biggest misconceptions is that inexpensive links are inherently low-quality and harmful to your SEO. This belief stems from an overgeneralization based on unethical practices like purchasing links from link farms or low-quality directories, which indeed offer poor value and can hurt your rankings. However, cost-effectiveness doesn’t have to mean cutting corners. Many niche blogs, even with strong domain authority, accept guest posts without charging a fee. Networking with industry peers and engaging with bloggers, offering value to other businesses through collaborations, can also help you naturally earn backlinks over time. Creating high-quality, linkable content requires few things except from a competent writer. You can even audit and repurpose existing content to reduce costs and optimize what you already have. These strategies require effort and time, but not necessarily large financial investments. The key takeaway is that the value of a backlink is determined by its relevance, authority, and natural placement—not by how much money was spent to obtain it. DIY link building is definitely a viable solution, it only needs careful strategizing and execution. Quality Over Quantity: The Power of Building Fewer, Better Links The phrase “less is more” is definitely true in link building. Search engines, particularly Google, prioritize backlinks that are both relevant and authoritative. A few links from high-authority, well-respected websites in your niche can significantly boost your website’s rankings, whereas a large volume of low-quality or irrelevant links can provide little to no SEO benefit—and may even hurt your rankings. High-quality backlinks come from authoritative and trustworthy websites that are relevant to your industry. While domain authority (DA), a metric developed by Moz, isn't an official ranking factor used by Google, it serves as a useful indicator of a site's credibility. In addition to authority, relevance is crucial—links from websites related to your niche hold more value than those from unrelated sources. For example, if you run a health and fitness blog, a backlink from a reputable health website is more valuable than one from a generic business directory or unrelated blog. Cost-Effective Link Building Strategies As we mentioned a few times already, link building doesn’t have to come with a hefty price tag. While many traditional link-building methods can be expensive, there are numerous cost-effective strategies that can help you secure high-quality backlinks without overspending. The key is to focus on creativity, value, and strategic outreach. Below, we explore 13 practical and affordable link-building techniques that can help improve your SEO and boost your website’s authority without breaking the bank. 1. Create Shareable, High-Quality Content One of the most effective and sustainable ways to build backlinks is to create linkable assets—high-quality, shareable content that naturally earns backlinks because it provides value to readers, answers common questions, or offers unique insights. This approach not only reduces the need for extensive outreach but also ensures that the backlinks you receive are relevant and authoritative. Linkable assets are pieces of content designed to be so valuable, informative, or engaging that other websites are compelled to link to them. These assets can come in various forms, but their common feature is that they offer something unique or highly useful to the target audience. They could include: In-depth guides and tutorials Original research and data Infographics and other visual data and trend representations Case studies Lists of resources, helpful material, tools, etc. 2. Use Link Building platforms Link-building platforms like WhitePress are powerful, cost-effective tools for acquiring high-quality backlinks without the need for extensive manual outreach. These platforms connect marketers, SEO professionals, and businesses with reputable websites open to content collaborations, offering opportunities for organic and strategic link-building. One of the major advantages is the clear cost visibility they offer, allowing users to see exactly how much they'll spend upfront, making it easier to manage budgets. Additionally, they save significant time by streamlining the entire process, which contributes to reducing overall costs. WhitePress connects you to thousands of websites across multiple industries and geographic regions. This allows you to diversify your backlink profile by acquiring links from a variety of sources, which is beneficial for SEO. Whether your focus is on local, national, or international markets, WhitePress platform offers ample opportunities to expand your reach while staying in control of costs. 3. Leverage Social Media for Link Opportunities Social media platforms are a powerful yet often underutilized tool for link building. While social media links themselves may not directly impact SEO due to their \"nofollow\" attribute, social media activity can indirectly lead to valuable backlinks. By promoting your content, engaging with influencers, and leveraging your social media presence, you can create opportunities for others to discover and link to your website. One of the most effective ways to leverage social media for link building is by engaging with influencers in your niche. Influencers have the power to amplify your content, and their followers often trust and act on their recommendations, leading to organic backlinks. Start by following influencers who are relevant to your industry on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Engage with their posts by commenting thoughtfully, retweeting, and liking their content. This helps you get on their radar and establishes a connection without directly asking for anything upfront. You can track social media mentions with tools like Google Alerts, Mention, Brand24, or BuzzSumo. 4. Guest Posting on Relevant Websites Guest posting is one of the most effective and budget-friendly link-building strategies, allowing you to gain high-quality backlinks, build relationships, and establish authority within your niche. By contributing valuable content to reputable websites in your industry, you not only earn backlinks but also reach new audiences. However, it’s important to approach guest posting strategically to avoid common pitfalls. To find guest posting opportunities, search for reputable blogs in your niche that accept guest contributions. You can use tools like Ahrefs to analyze potential sites or perform Google searches with phrases such as \"your niche + write for us\" to discover relevant websites. Analyzing your competitors' backlinks can also reveal where they have published guest posts, offering additional opportunities. 5. Utilize Connectively (Formerly known as HARO - Help a Reporter Out) Connectively, formerly known as HARO (Help a Reporter Out), is a platform that connects journalists with sources for their stories. It offers a valuable opportunity for businesses to gain media exposure and earn high-quality backlinks by providing expert insights and quotes to reporters. Connectively sends out daily queries from journalists seeking information on various topics, and if your response is selected, you can earn a mention and a backlink from reputable media outlets. To use Connectively effectively, it’s crucial to craft compelling responses. Start by responding quickly, as reporters often work on tight deadlines. Tailor your response specifically to the journalist's query by providing concise, valuable, and relevant information. Avoid generic responses and ensure that your expertise directly addresses the question. 6. The Art of Ethical Link Exchange Reciprocal linking, or link exchange, involves two websites agreeing to link to each other, often in a mutually beneficial arrangement. When done ethically, it can provide benefits such as increased referral traffic and an enhanced backlink profile, as long as the exchanged links are relevant and valuable to both audiences. Here, the key is to focus on quality over quantity. Only exchange links with websites that are relevant to your niche and provide value to your visitors. Always make sure the link placement is natural and adds context, rather than appearing as a forced attempt to manipulate rankings. Avoid large-scale or automated link exchanges, which can trigger penalties from search engines like Google. 7. Converting Brand Mentions into Backlinks To find unlinked mentions of your brand, you can use tools like Google Alerts, Mention, or Ahrefs. These tools monitor the web for any mention of your brand name, products, or services. Once you've identified unlinked mentions, the next step is to reach out to the webmaster or content creator. When reaching out, keep your request polite and professional. Acknowledge that you appreciate the mention of your brand, and politely ask if they could include a link back to your website. 8. Broken Link Building Broken link building is a strategy that involves finding broken links on other websites and offering your own relevant content as a replacement. This helps webmasters fix their broken links while providing you with a valuable backlink in return. It’s a win-win, as the website owner improves their user experience, and you earn a high-quality link. To implement broken link building, start by identifying broken links on websites in your niche. Tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Check My Links can help you scan websites for broken links. The easiest approach is to analyze your competitors’ backlink profiles to find broken backlinks leading to dead pages. Once you have identified a broken link, check if you already have content that could serve as a replacement. If not, consider creating a new resource that aligns with the broken link. Crafting effective outreach emails is key to this strategy. When reaching out to the site owner, be polite and highlight the issue with the broken link. Offer your content as a helpful replacement and explain how it would provide value to their readers. Keep the message concise and professional, focusing on the mutual benefits of fixing the broken link and using your resource as a replacement. 9. Competitive Link Analysis: Learning from Your Rivals Competitive link analysis involves examining your competitors' backlink profiles to uncover valuable insights into their link-building strategies. By analyzing where your competitors are getting their backlinks, you can identify potential opportunities for your own site and replicate their success. To conduct a competitor backlink analysis, use tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Moz. These tools allow you to explore the backlinks your competitors have acquired, revealing linking domains, anchor text, and link authority. Start by identifying your top competitors and inputting their URLs into these tools to analyze their backlink profiles. Once you’ve uncovered their backlinks, focus on replicating the ones that are relevant and high-quality. For example, if they have earned links through guest posting, reach out to the same publications or websites with your own unique content pitch. Also, look for unique link opportunities your competitors may have missed by analyzing gaps in their strategy. 10. Build Relationships with Industry Influencers Relationship-based link building focuses on forming long-term connections with industry influencers, which can lead to organic backlinks and increased exposure over time. Rather than one-off link exchanges, building genuine relationships with influencers can result in sustained collaboration, content sharing, and mutual promotion. When using social media and email for outreach, keep the communication concise and clear. Personalize every message, avoid generic requests, and focus on building a relationship over time rather than pushing for immediate links. This approach creates a foundation for ongoing collaborations, which naturally leads to more link opportunities. 11. Engage in Online Communities and Forums Participating in online communities and forums can be a valuable way to build links while establishing authority in your niche. The key is to engage genuinely, offering meaningful contributions rather than simply dropping links. Communities like Reddit, Quora, and niche-specific forums such as Stack Overflow (for tech) or specialized industry boards are great places to start. When including links, do so naturally and only when relevant to the discussion. You can include links in responses when they directly add value to the conversation or provide additional resources. Some forums also allow you to add links in your signature, but this should be done sparingly and only in a professional manner. 12. Leveraging Business Directories for Quality Backlinks Business directories still play a valuable role in modern SEO, providing opportunities for quality backlinks while increasing your online visibility. When listed in reputable, industry-specific directories, your site can benefit from both the authority of the directory and increased referral traffic. Some examples of reputable directories include Yelp, TripAdvisor, and niche-specific directories such as Clutch (for B2B services) and Houzz (for home improvement professionals). 13. Outreach Outreach involves connecting with website owners to secure backlinks by offering valuable resources like expert insights, data, or well-crafted content. The key to successful outreach is personalization and relevance. Identify websites in your niche that could benefit from your resource and craft a message that highlights the specific value it adds to their audience or content. Instead of generic requests, tailor your pitch to the site’s needs, showing genuine interest in their work. Be respectful of their time, keep your message concise, and clearly outline how your resource benefits their readers. Maximizing your link-building efforts on a budget often requires a strategic approach, and one effective method to consider is tiered link building. This strategy involves creating layers of backlinks to amplify the authority passed to your target pages, helping you achieve better rankings without overspending. By combining high-quality links with secondary tiers that support them, you can create a cost-efficient and scalable system. Measuring the Success of Your Link Building Campaign To know whether your link building efforts are actually succeeding in achieving your set goals, you’ll need a way to measure their impact. Thankfully, there is a range of tools that help track key metrics and provide insights into the effectiveness of your backlink profile. Google Analytics is a powerful tool for tracking the performance of your backlinks. By navigating to the Acquisition > All Traffic > Referrals section, you can see the websites that are sending traffic to your site through backlinks. Additionally, you can set up Goals in Google Analytics to track how referral traffic from specific backlinks converts into desired actions on your site, such as sign-ups, purchases, or downloads. When tracking your performance, keep these metrics in mind: Domain Authority (DA) or Domain Rating (DR): These are metrics provided by tools like Moz (DA) or Ahrefs (DR) that estimate the strength and authority of a website’s backlink profile. Number of Backlinks: Tracking the number of new backlinks over time helps you see how well your campaign is acquiring links. However, quality should be prioritized over quantity, so focus on authoritative links from relevant sites. Referral Traffic: Backlinks can drive direct traffic to your site. Google Analytics can help you track how much referral traffic is coming from the links you’ve built. An increase in referral traffic shows that your links are placed on websites with engaged audiences. Keyword Rankings: High-quality backlinks can improve your rankings for targeted keywords. Monitor the search engine rankings of your key terms to see if your link-building efforts are positively impacting your SEO. Linking Domains: This metric tracks the number of unique domains that link back to your website. Having diverse, authoritative linking domains is more valuable than getting many links from a single source. For budget-conscious campaigns, setting realistic and achievable goals is essential. Instead of focusing on rapid domain authority growth or hundreds of backlinks, prioritize smaller, attainable targets, such as building a set number of high-quality links from niche-relevant sites within a certain timeframe. Aim for steady, incremental growth rather than expecting immediate results. Common Pitfalls to Avoid in Budget Link Building While budget-friendly link-building can be effective, there are several pitfalls that can undermine your efforts and even harm your website’s SEO. Black-hat SEO techniques often promise quick and cheap backlinks, but they come with significant risks. Tactics such as buying links, using automated link-building tools, or participating in link schemes may offer short-term gains but can lead to penalties from search engines, especially Google. Link farms and private blog networks (PBNs) are often marketed as inexpensive solutions to quickly build a large number of backlinks. However, links from these sources are generally low-quality, and Google is becoming increasingly adept at identifying these networks and penalizing sites that participate in them. Instead of relying on these shortcuts, it’s important to seek out high-quality backlinks from relevant, authoritative websites that provide real value to their audience. A few strong, reputable backlinks are far more beneficial than a large number of low-quality ones. Conclusion: Building a Sustainable Link Profile on a Budget Developing a strong link profile on a budget is entirely achievable with the right strategies and a focus on quality over quantity. Budget-friendly link-building requires patience and creativity—by prioritizing high-quality backlinks over low-quality alternatives, you can enhance your website’s SEO incrementally without breaking the bank. Throughout this guide, we’ve explored a variety of cost-effective link-building strategies, such as creating shareable content, leveraging link-building platforms, guest posting, and engaging in online communities. We’ve also emphasized the importance of avoiding black-hat techniques like link farms and PBNs, which can lead to search engine penalties, and the need to maintain a natural link profile by earning backlinks from diverse and authoritative sources. Ultimately, building a sustainable link profile on a budget is about consistency, strategic outreach, and long-term relationship building. Stay focused on high-quality, relevant backlinks, and you’ll see your site’s authority grow and your search engine rankings improve—all without overspending.

If you want to do SEO for your website and get relevant organic traffic, building backlinks is something you should be doing. The more backlinks your website has from authoritative domains, the higher your reputation in Google’s eyes. And you’ll dominate the SERPS. Nowadays, link building doesn’t have a great reputation, and it’s often associated with link spamming. But it shouldn’t be that way. [Tweet “You can build backlinks smartly, without spamming other sites. – @felixtarcomnicu”] You can build backlinks using smart techniques and without spamming other sites. Getting high-quality backlinks can be challenging if you are in a boring niche. Keep reading, and I’ll show you eight ways to build links using ethical strategies and SEO tools that will make things easier for you. 1. Replicate competitors’ best backlinks SEO is like playing poker with your competitors, and Google is the dealer. The exception is that everyone has to play with their cards on the table. [Tweet “SEO is like playing poker with your competitors, and Google is the dealer. – @felixtarcomnicu”] In our case, the cards are the backlinks, and everyone can access them. You can effortlessly get a list of your competitor’s backlinks and try replicating their best ones. Replicating competitor’s backlinks is one of the smartest ways to find new link-building opportunities and improve SEO. Get started by choosing your primary competitors, the websites that are ranking on the top 5 positions for your main keywords. If they’re ranking above you, it means they have a better link profile, and they have backlinks of higher quality. Once you’ve decided which competitors to spy on, you must analyze their backlinks. I’m going to show you how to replicate your competitor’s best links using Monitor Backlinks, but you can use your own preferred SEO tool as well. After adding your main competitors into Monitor Backlinks, use the metrics provided to determine which links are worth replicating. Don’t fall into the trap of trying to replicate all of them. All sites have bad links, even Wikipedia. You should only replicate the links that have good authority. While not always the case, usually, the more complicated it is to get a backlink from a website, the higher value it will have. [Tweet “Backlinks that are harder to earn usually have higher value. – @felixtarcomnicu”] To see the value of a domain in a glance, look at the Moz Domain Authority and Ahrefs Domain Rank. If these metrics are right for you, check how those sites link to third-party websites. If they use do-follow links, it will be helpful for your SEO campaigns. If it’s nofollow, it won’t help you with SEO, but it might drive some relevant traffic to your site. You’ll notice that some links are highlighted in Monitor Backlinks. That happens when your website already has a link from the same domain, meaning you shouldn’t spend more time replicating it. After finding websites with good metrics, you have to ensure the website is related to your site. For each competitor backlink, try understanding how your competitor got that link. If it was a guest article, send a request to become a contributor as well. If it was a product review by a blogger, contact the writer and offer them a good deal in exchange for a similar review. 2. Analyze competitors’ mentions Spying on your competitor’s backlinks is not enough. You should also know when their brand name is mentioned on the internet. Whether it’s a mention on social media, a forum, or a website, you’ll know by using Mention. For example, if a competitor’s client asks a question and you’re the first one to offer help, chances are you’ll create a strong relationship with that customer. If he’s got a website, you might even earn a backlink if he decides to endorse you. By being helpful and answering questions ahead of others, you’ll increase your chances of earning business and generating backlinks. [Tweet “. @Mention can help you earn backlinks by monitoring alerts for your main keywords. – @felixtarcomnicu”] Another scenario where Mention can help you get backlinks is setting up alerts for your main keywords. For example, if you have a marketing tool, you can set up an alert for the keyword “marketing tool.” Whenever someone writes an article about marketing tools or publishes something on social media, you can react and ask them to consider or add your tool as well. 3. Build backlinks with infographics For the past few years, infographics have been one of the most popular link building methods. Since 2009, the demand for infographics has been skyrocketing. Important publications like Mashable, The Verge, Huffington Post, and others are publishing infographics on a regular basis and readers love them. Not only are they great for building backlinks free, but also for driving traffic from social media, since infographics are highly shareable. If you’re not a designer, you can hire someone to create an infographic for you starting at just $5 on Fiverr. If you want a better looking infographic, you can use Dribbble to find professional designers. Once you’ve created the infographic and published it on your site, you can submit it to some of the popular infographic directories. To spread the word even more, you can use Twitter or Mention to find people that have shared related infographics in the past. You can do some outreach asking them to look at your newly published infographic and ask for feedback. If they liked it, they might share it on social media and also link to it. 4. Guest blogging Guest blogging is still one of the best ways to make yourself heard online. You can tap into already-established audiences and interact with other people from your niche. PRO TIP: This can be a great selling point to add to your SEO proposals, too. It’s a great technique for building more followers on social media, driving traffic, and building high quality links. [Tweet “Guest blogging is still one of the best ways to make yourself heard. – @felixtarcomnicu”] Contrary to popular belief, guest blogging existed long before Google started using backlinks as a ranking factor. To be more exact, guest articles started in the days when newspapers were popular. Google itself accepts guest contributors on its blog, so there’s not much reason to worry about a penalty as long as your guest posts aren’t spammy and poorly written. But if you are going to guest post, it must be high-quality. At least as good as the content you publish on your website, if not better. Not all guest bloggers are successful, but if you take this method seriously, you’ll see benefits. You can find guest blogging opportunities with these key terms in Mention or Google: Your keyword + inurl:write-for-us Your keyword + intitle: write for us Your keyword + guest posts Your keyword + become a contributor Your keyword + inurl:contribute 5. Build a solid internal linking structure Internal links are an important part of backlinks management and can be used to increase the overall usability of your website. While they won’t give you a major SEO boost, they can be a great way to build links while using your preferred anchor text. Just be careful not to overuse this technique – creating more than 100 internal links per page can make your website look suspicious. 6. Outreach and promote your best content everywhere Great content won’t get backlinks if no one knows it exists. You have to do your best to find people interested in linking to and sharing your content on social media. Use influencer research tools to find people willing to share your content. The more bloggers you talk to, the higher the chances of getting your content shared. Things will be much easier once you create a few good relationships with well-known bloggers from your field. 7. Give interviews There are websites in virtually any niche that run interviews with experts. If you’re not well-known enough to be invited, reach out and pitch the interviewer on why they should interview you. Sites that run such roundups are always looking for great content, so you have an okay chance at getting accepted. Along with your answers, you can also link out to your website. To find websites that run interview roundups, you can search for these key terms: Your keyword + roundup Your keyword + interview 8. Broken link building A lesser-known way to build backlinks is called the broken link building technique. This involves finding 404 errors or similar problems on a blogger’s website and politely telling them about it. [Tweet “Use 404 errors to build links and relationships in SEO.”] Because you’re doing them a favor, they might reward your help by linking out to your website. These backlinks are commonly found on resource pages where bloggers link to third-party sites. You can easily identify broken links using the Google Chrome Extension called Check My Links. After finding these issues, contact the webmaster and tell them about the problem. Give them direct instructions and make it easy for them to identify and fix the mistake. Then suggest your website as a resource to replace the broken link. Conclusion You can build backlinks to your website using smart techniques. If you’re just getting started, the whole process might be very time-consuming, but in the long run, it’s well worth it. Only build quality backlinks and never waste your time with links that might cause trouble.

If you want to do SEO for your website and get relevant organic traffic, building backlinks is something you should be doing. The more backlinks your website has from authoritative domains, the higher your reputation in Google’s eyes. And you’ll dominate the SERPS. Nowadays, link building doesn’t have a great reputation, and it’s often associated with link spamming. But it shouldn’t be that way. [Tweet “You can build backlinks smartly, without spamming other sites. – @felixtarcomnicu”] You can build backlinks using smart techniques and without spamming other sites. Getting high-quality backlinks can be challenging if you are in a boring niche. Keep reading, and I’ll show you eight ways to build links using ethical strategies and SEO tools that will make things easier for you. 1. Replicate competitors’ best backlinks SEO is like playing poker with your competitors, and Google is the dealer. The exception is that everyone has to play with their cards on the table. [Tweet “SEO is like playing poker with your competitors, and Google is the dealer. – @felixtarcomnicu”] In our case, the cards are the backlinks, and everyone can access them. You can effortlessly get a list of your competitor’s backlinks and try replicating their best ones. Replicating competitor’s backlinks is one of the smartest ways to find new link-building opportunities and improve SEO. Get started by choosing your primary competitors, the websites that are ranking on the top 5 positions for your main keywords. If they’re ranking above you, it means they have a better link profile, and they have backlinks of higher quality. Once you’ve decided which competitors to spy on, you must analyze their backlinks. I’m going to show you how to replicate your competitor’s best links using Monitor Backlinks, but you can use your own preferred SEO tool as well. After adding your main competitors into Monitor Backlinks, use the metrics provided to determine which links are worth replicating. Don’t fall into the trap of trying to replicate all of them. All sites have bad links, even Wikipedia. You should only replicate the links that have good authority. While not always the case, usually, the more complicated it is to get a backlink from a website, the higher value it will have. [Tweet “Backlinks that are harder to earn usually have higher value. – @felixtarcomnicu”] To see the value of a domain in a glance, look at the Moz Domain Authority and Ahrefs Domain Rank. If these metrics are right for you, check how those sites link to third-party websites. If they use do-follow links, it will be helpful for your SEO campaigns. If it’s nofollow, it won’t help you with SEO, but it might drive some relevant traffic to your site. You’ll notice that some links are highlighted in Monitor Backlinks. That happens when your website already has a link from the same domain, meaning you shouldn’t spend more time replicating it. After finding websites with good metrics, you have to ensure the website is related to your site. For each competitor backlink, try understanding how your competitor got that link. If it was a guest article, send a request to become a contributor as well. If it was a product review by a blogger, contact the writer and offer them a good deal in exchange for a similar review. 2. Analyze competitors’ mentions Spying on your competitor’s backlinks is not enough. You should also know when their brand name is mentioned on the internet. Whether it’s a mention on social media, a forum, or a website, you’ll know by using Mention. For example, if a competitor’s client asks a question and you’re the first one to offer help, chances are you’ll create a strong relationship with that customer. If he’s got a website, you might even earn a backlink if he decides to endorse you. By being helpful and answering questions ahead of others, you’ll increase your chances of earning business and generating backlinks. [Tweet “. @Mention can help you earn backlinks by monitoring alerts for your main keywords. – @felixtarcomnicu”] Another scenario where Mention can help you get backlinks is setting up alerts for your main keywords. For example, if you have a marketing tool, you can set up an alert for the keyword “marketing tool.” Whenever someone writes an article about marketing tools or publishes something on social media, you can react and ask them to consider or add your tool as well. 3. Build backlinks with infographics For the past few years, infographics have been one of the most popular link building methods. Since 2009, the demand for infographics has been skyrocketing. Important publications like Mashable, The Verge, Huffington Post, and others are publishing infographics on a regular basis and readers love them. Not only are they great for building backlinks free, but also for driving traffic from social media, since infographics are highly shareable. If you’re not a designer, you can hire someone to create an infographic for you starting at just $5 on Fiverr. If you want a better looking infographic, you can use Dribbble to find professional designers. Once you’ve created the infographic and published it on your site, you can submit it to some of the popular infographic directories. To spread the word even more, you can use Twitter or Mention to find people that have shared related infographics in the past. You can do some outreach asking them to look at your newly published infographic and ask for feedback. If they liked it, they might share it on social media and also link to it. 4. Guest blogging Guest blogging is still one of the best ways to make yourself heard online. You can tap into already-established audiences and interact with other people from your niche. PRO TIP: This can be a great selling point to add to your SEO proposals, too. It’s a great technique for building more followers on social media, driving traffic, and building high quality links. [Tweet “Guest blogging is still one of the best ways to make yourself heard. – @felixtarcomnicu”] Contrary to popular belief, guest blogging existed long before Google started using backlinks as a ranking factor. To be more exact, guest articles started in the days when newspapers were popular. Google itself accepts guest contributors on its blog, so there’s not much reason to worry about a penalty as long as your guest posts aren’t spammy and poorly written. But if you are going to guest post, it must be high-quality. At least as good as the content you publish on your website, if not better. Not all guest bloggers are successful, but if you take this method seriously, you’ll see benefits. You can find guest blogging opportunities with these key terms in Mention or Google: Your keyword + inurl:write-for-us Your keyword + intitle: write for us Your keyword + guest posts Your keyword + become a contributor Your keyword + inurl:contribute 5. Build a solid internal linking structure Internal links are an important part of backlinks management and can be used to increase the overall usability of your website. While they won’t give you a major SEO boost, they can be a great way to build links while using your preferred anchor text. Just be careful not to overuse this technique – creating more than 100 internal links per page can make your website look suspicious. 6. Outreach and promote your best content everywhere Great content won’t get backlinks if no one knows it exists. You have to do your best to find people interested in linking to and sharing your content on social media. Use influencer research tools to find people willing to share your content. The more bloggers you talk to, the higher the chances of getting your content shared. Things will be much easier once you create a few good relationships with well-known bloggers from your field. 7. Give interviews There are websites in virtually any niche that run interviews with experts. If you’re not well-known enough to be invited, reach out and pitch the interviewer on why they should interview you. Sites that run such roundups are always looking for great content, so you have an okay chance at getting accepted. Along with your answers, you can also link out to your website. To find websites that run interview roundups, you can search for these key terms: Your keyword + roundup Your keyword + interview 8. Broken link building A lesser-known way to build backlinks is called the broken link building technique.

      "content": "DigiGrow 12 ways to build backlinks without paying for them Backlinking campaigns can get super-expensive. As of 2023, businesses pay between $25 to $18,000 for one backlink. Now, the effectiveness of these links is debatable, but Google certainly equates backlinking campaigns with link spam – as per Google’s November office hours session. Backlinking has lost steam as a ranking factor since the early days of Google search, and now hundreds of other ranking factors share the space that backlinks once occupied. With all that said, backlinks are still a ranking factor, albeit less important, so you still need them. Ideally, you should get backlinks naturally. And if you don’t, you should definitely not have to pay for them. You might be thinking, ‘how on earth can you get backlinks from other websites through outreach without paying?!’ Simply by offering an undeniable value proposition that compels a website owner or operator to log into the backend and add a link to your website. In this blog post, we cover some ways to highlight value propositions – other than money – to get those links. Here is how to build backlinks without paying for them: 1. Link building through HARO and similar websites HARO (Help A Reporter Out) is a powerful PR channel that can generate high-quality backlinks to your website. It is a platform where journalists submit queries for sources to answer. A journalist can be anyone writing an article. They are often on a tight deadline, looking for quality content that they can get for free. And that’s your chance to promote your content to them. Here’s how it works: Whom does HARO link building work for? HARO link building works for all websites. It, however, is a gold mine for businesses with low domain authority. HARO outreach can get you links from powerful domains like Forbes, NYT, and websites relevant to your niche, and it remains one of the most effective ways to get good quality backlinks.Most websites get so many guest posting requests every day that they direct them all to trash. With HARO, you know the exact content these websites are looking for, so your pitch gets seen, to the least. Challenges with HARO link building. 1. Competition HARO is a popular newsletter for everything PR. Many people submit pitches for all queries, even those from low-domain websites. So Forbes and its famous cousins get thousands of pitches per query. Even a perfect pitch may not make it to the final copy because of the intense competition. Yet, this backlinking method is better than most alternatives listed here. Alternatively, Terkel has lesser competition, but fewer quality websites submit their pitches there. 2. You can mostly build links only to your homepage Google wants to see contextual links with relevant anchor text. With HARO, journalists use your homepage as the landing page when they link. You might get a lot of links, but if they point to the homepage, they might not be topical. You must invest time in adding internal links to distribute link juice. HARO pitch email template At DigiGrow, we have seen a success rate of 8% with HARO with this template. Hi {Journalist’s name}, I am {Your name}, and I own a {Your service}. Please find my response to your query below. ========= {Your query -limited to the word count suggested by the journalist} ========= I hope this was useful. Please let me know if you have any questions. I would be happy to answer them. Please find my full name, title, image, and company URL in my signature. Thank you. — {Your details} 2. Broken link building Broken link building is one of the oldest link building techniques. In this method, a backlink seeker reaches out to the target website with information on a broken link with a recommendation to replace it with the seeker’s content. For example, if I were to have a broken link on DigiGrow and someone were to want backlinks from my website, they would look for links returning 404 error on my domain, notify me about its existence and share their content to replace the broken link. Through this method, the value the backlink seeker offers is an improvement in the technical health of the target website. Whom does broken link building work for? This method is almost as old as the concept of backlinking campaigns and doesn’t work much for anyone. New websites and those with low domain authority have a tough time seeing any success with this method. We saw a poor conversion rate of 1.5% with broken link building. Challenges with broken link building Additionally, this method’s popularity has attracted tonnes of ready-to-use templates that most target websites are familiar with. Some websites also add them to the spam list. This method has become a joke – we don’t recommend it. It still makes it to the list because it’s one of the options available in case nothing else works. 3. The method that works the best Creating a statistics page is the best method to get backlinks without paying for them – and get them in bulk, fast! A statistics page is a trend-based article on a specific industry pain point. For example, a data point on what percentage of successful people wake up early might be of great interest to many. If you have that number in your blog post, people will link to it while mentioning it in their blog posts. With the statistics page, you provide data to content writers that no other website has. You get backlinks for your originality. Whom does statistics page link building work for? It works well for businesses that already have a decent domain rating. Their domain authority gives people an impetus to respond to their survey as a backlink from them holds high value. Smaller websites will have a tough time convincing people to respond to their survey. The only workaround is giving Amazon gift cards or something else that requires a budget – which disqualifies this method as a free method. Challenges with statistics page backlinking strategy Creating a statistics page involves qualifying leads and reaching out to them for data, cleaning the data, deriving insights, writing blog posts, and more. It might be a month-long effort, but the results are usually brilliant. 4. Free Guest Posting The guest posting method belongs to the bronze age of link building campaigns. In this method, you write a blog post with a link to your website. Whom does guest posting work for? Guest posting is no longer an effective method for building backlinks for any business. Think about it – you essentially give away your content for just a backlink! You could get a lot more by hosting the same content on your website. You can get traffic and backlinks by getting the page to rank. Challenges with guest posting Even if you pick good websites to submit a guest post to, this method may fail you because: 1. Like the broken link-building method, website owners are overwhelmed with outreach mail and direct them all to the trash bin. The success rate is too low. 2. Every blog post is worth more than a backlink. 3. It is not a scalable method. 5. Link exchange Link exchange is the technique in which the target domain links to your website if you link to theirs. Many consider this method to be grey-hat, and they are right. If done sparingly, this can be a very convenient method to build links. This practice is quite prevalent today. Whom does link exchange work for? Link exchange works for any website, but you can build links from websites with similar domain authority. A low-authority website will not have enough bargaining chips for a link exchange with a high-authority domain. Challenges with link exchange 1. Link exchange is seen as a grey-hat method – Google doesn’t like it. 2. It works for websites with similar authority – if you want to get links from high-authority domains, this method will not yield results. 6. Link building through social media Google rankings depend on the E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) of a website. And social media plays a key role in SEO by providing a signal to Google about the authority of your brand. When Google registers you as the author and owner of the content, you rank better. Not just that, social media can help you build backlinks without paying. This method involves creating valuable content on social media, building a follower base, and generating backlinks in the process. It takes time but once you have enough clout on any one social media platform, you can build backlinks consistently. By building a network and providing value over a long time, you increase the probability of a follower clicking on the links you share. Moreover, even if you don’t have links in your posts, people might link to your post in their content. All in all, the more people see your post, the more visits to your profile page and click on your links. Whom does link building through social media work for? This method works for all businesses because, for the most part, it has nothing to do with domain authority. Challenges with link building through social media There is no way to predict if link-building through social media would ever work. It involves creating a lot of content without seeing immediate results. Additionally, you need to invest time in writing content, engaging with your audience, and building your subscriber base. You won’t see success overnight. It might take many months. 7. Promote target domain through your newsletter Your website may not have a good domain authority but you may have a decent newsletter subscriber base. You can offer relevant high-domain websites to submit content to be promoted through your newsletter in return for a backlink. Through this method, you offer exposure to target domains in return for a backlink. Whom does this method of link building work for? Anyone who has a good subscriber base or newsletters can use this technique. Brand new websites with fewer than a thousand newsletter subscribers may not see any success with this method. Challenges with this method Building an audience is the most difficult bit of this method but selecting content for your newsletters can be even more challenging. Your subscriber base expects high-quality content but the target domain may want to get away with a substandard piece. You need to be able to say no even to high authority domains if the quality of content is subpar. 8. Create infographics Infographics are snackable. And thus shareable. Bloggers use them in their content to drive the point home effectively and often give a link-back to the owner. Whom does this method of link building work for? Infographics are a great way of getting backlinks without paying for them. They work well for any domain but the main challenge is getting the link. At times, people may post your infographic without giving you credit. You won’t find such instances until you do a Google image search. You sure can claim copyright or ask for a backlink but it’s often not worth the effort. Challenges with this method Designing an infographic might be a challenge. However, with Freemium tools like Canva, creating high-quality infographics is easy. You can access free templates and modify them as per your taste and brand colors. That’s it! 9. Start a podcast or feature in one Podcasting has become a killer method of promoting content. You can start your podcast when you talk about your niche or reach out to industry leaders and try to feature in popular podcasts. Podcasting will give you exposure. Additionally, you often get to mention the name of your website or link your content in the description and get referral traffic. The more you get that, the higher the probability of people linking to it because of the value it offers. Whom does podcast link building work for? You must have some domain authority to leverage this method of backlinking. Most podcast owners do not entertain newbies. Once you have a good domain authority or enough customer testimonials that highlight your expertise, getting onto a podcast without paying the owner becomes easy. Challenges with backlinking through podcasts If you plan to start your own podcast, be prepared to spend at least 6 months in getting a sizable subscriber-base. You won’t get followers until you build some clout through other channels of promotion. 10. Write business reviews Very few websites adopt this easy method of getting backlinks without paying for them. However, this one really works because you offer value to businesses before reaching out to them for backlinks. This is how this method works: First, you finalize 10-15 product or service based websites you hope to get a link from. Let’s assume that you seek backlinks from gardening based websites in the US. To attract their attention, you can create service-based listicles. For example, the keyword – best nursery in Seattle – is important for most nurseries. A post with them listed in it makes for good PR. You can get the list of nurseries from Google maps, select those that don’t rank on the map pack, and reach out to them for inputs. You can ask for details like Pricing, Quality, Distance from city center, employee count, etc. You can also assign a star-rating. This way you establish contact and give them something of value. Finally, once the article is ready, let the listed websites know about it. You can ask for a backlink but most of them will share your content, one way or another, by themselves. Whom does business review link building work for? Businesses with decent domain rating – and thus a chance to rank the listicle would see the most success with this method. You need to have samples of top ranking pages for businesses to evaluate your proposal. Challenges with this link building method The biggest challenge of this free link building method is that most listicle keywords are super-competitive. They are quite difficult to rank for. 11. Use an affiliate network An affiliate network can help you generate loads of relevant referral traffic through backlinks. It makes it easy to find the right affiliates to promote your business who also link to your website while promoting it. How this works is, the affiliate network creates unique links for every affiliate who chooses to promote your business. Those links find themselves in the media of promotion that the affiliates choose. For example, someone might promote your product through social media, in which case you just get a brand mention. However, if someone does it through a blog, you get backlinks. Who does affiliate link building work for? This method of link building works from businesses that pay a high commission and have a good reputation. It may not work for new websites. Challenges of building links through affiliates Most affiliates will add a nofollow or sponsored tag to your links because that’s what Google wants them to do. Any link that involves a monetary transaction needs to carry those tags otherwise Google might penalize them. A nofollow tag does not carry forward the link-juice which means you won’t see an improvement in your domain rating. However, these links might drive quality traffic which improves your authoritativeness. So these still are valuable links. 12. Try Slack Groups Slack groups are a gold-mine of backlinks and content collaboration in general. These groups are like HARO without competition. This method of generating backlinks without paying shows a high conversion rate. Essentially, someone who needs content for their next article puts a request in a popular slack group. You, if the niche is relevant, can respond to those requests with a quote in return for a backlink. Who does this free link building method work for? This method works for all websites big or small, old or new. Low domain authority websites may see a lower success rate but this method works much better than most others. Challenges with Slack group link building Finding vibrant slack communities is the biggest challenge of all. You will find hundreds of communities relevant to your niche, but few of them have a responsive audience. But the effort invested in finding one functional group will yield great results. FAQs Is paying for backlinks worth it? Buying backlinks is helpful only if the invested amount generates backlinks organically. It is a legit practice to pay someone to create content that generates links naturally. But paying someone to link to your website in their content is risky. That is because it can result in a manual action from Google. Does Google allow buying backlinks? No, it is a black-hat method of link-building. Google released a link-spam update in December 2023 that helps the search algorithm identify and penalize purchased backlinks. Today, websites find it difficult to buy backlinks and keep safe from Google’s manual action. How much should backlinks cost? Getting backlinks from individual domains should cost $0, meaning you should not pay for backlinks nor sell them. Paying for links is a black-hat method that can get you trapped in the link-spam update, resulting in deindexing of your website. There’s no easy or fast way to come back from that.

It is a platform where journalists submit queries for sources to answer. A journalist can be anyone writing an article. They are often on a tight deadline, looking for quality content that they can get for free. And that’s your chance to promote your content to them. Here’s how it works: Whom does HARO link building work for? HARO link building works for all websites. It, however, is a gold mine for businesses with low domain authority. HARO outreach can get you links from powerful domains like Forbes, NYT, and websites relevant to your niche, and it remains one of the most effective ways to get good quality backlinks.Most websites get so many guest posting requests every day that they direct them all to trash. With HARO, you know the exact content these websites are looking for, so your pitch gets seen, to the least. Challenges with HARO link building. 1. Competition HARO is a popular newsletter for everything PR. Many people submit pitches for all queries, even those from low-domain websites. So Forbes and its famous cousins get thousands of pitches per query. Even a perfect pitch may not make it to the final copy because of the intense competition. Yet, this backlinking method is better than most alternatives listed here. Alternatively, Terkel has lesser competition, but fewer quality websites submit their pitches there. 2. You can mostly build links only to your homepage Google wants to see contextual links with relevant anchor text. With HARO, journalists use your homepage as the landing page when they link. You might get a lot of links, but if they point to the homepage, they might not be topical. You must invest time in adding internal links to distribute link juice. HARO pitch email template At DigiGrow, we have seen a success rate of 8% with HARO with this template. Hi {Journalist’s name}, I am {Your name}, and I own a {Your service}. Please find my response to your query below. ========= {Your query -limited to the word count suggested by the journalist} ========= I hope this was useful. Please let me know if you have any questions. I would be happy to answer them. Please find my full name, title, image, and company URL in my signature. Thank you. — {Your details} 2. Broken link building Broken link building is one of the oldest link building techniques. In this method, a backlink seeker reaches out to the target website with information on a broken link with a recommendation to replace it with the seeker’s content. For example, if I were to have a broken link on DigiGrow and someone were to want backlinks from my website, they would look for links returning 404 error on my domain, notify me about its existence and share their content to replace the broken link. Through this method, the value the backlink seeker offers is an improvement in the technical health of the target website. Whom does broken link building work for? This method is almost as old as the concept of backlinking campaigns and doesn’t work much for anyone. New websites and those with low domain authority have a tough time seeing any success with this method. We saw a poor conversion rate of 1.5% with broken link building. Challenges with broken link building Additionally, this method’s popularity has attracted tonnes of ready-to-use templates that most target websites are familiar with. Some websites also add them to the spam list. This method has become a joke – we don’t recommend it. It still makes it to the list because it’s one of the options available in case nothing else works. 3. The method that works the best Creating a statistics page is the best method to get backlinks without paying for them – and get them in bulk, fast! A statistics page is a trend-based article on a specific industry pain point. For example, a data point on what percentage of successful people wake up early might be of great interest to many. If you have that number in your blog post, people will link to it while mentioning it in their blog posts. With the statistics page, you provide data to content writers that no other website has. You get backlinks for your originality. Whom does statistics page link building work for? It works well for businesses that already have a decent domain rating. Their domain authority gives people an impetus to respond to their survey as a backlink from them holds high value. Smaller websites will have a tough time convincing people to respond to their survey. The only workaround is giving Amazon gift cards or something else that requires a budget – which disqualifies this method as a free method. Challenges with statistics page backlinking strategy Creating a statistics page involves qualifying leads and reaching out to them for data, cleaning the data, deriving insights, writing blog posts, and more. It might be a month-long effort, but the results are usually brilliant. 4. Free Guest Posting The guest posting method belongs to the bronze age of link building campaigns. In this method, you write a blog post with a link to your website. Whom does guest posting work for? Guest posting is no longer an effective method for building backlinks for any business. Think about it – you essentially give away your content for just a backlink! You could get a lot more by hosting the same content on your website. You can get traffic and backlinks by getting the page to rank. Challenges with guest posting Even if you pick good websites to submit a guest post to, this method may fail you because: 1. Like the broken link-building method, website owners are overwhelmed with outreach mail and direct them all to the trash bin. The success rate is too low. 2. Every blog post is worth more than a backlink. 3. It is not a scalable method. 5. Link exchange Link exchange is the technique in which the target domain links to your website if you link to theirs. Many consider this method to be grey-hat, and they are right. If done sparingly, this can be a very convenient method to build links. This practice is quite prevalent today. Whom does link exchange work for? Link exchange works for any website, but you can build links from websites with similar domain authority. A low-authority website will not have enough bargaining chips for a link exchange with a high-authority domain. Challenges with link exchange 1. Link exchange is seen as a grey-hat method – Google doesn’t like it. 2. It works for websites with similar authority – if you want to get links from high-authority domains, this method will not yield results. 6. Link building through social media Google rankings depend on the E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) of a website. And social media plays a key role in SEO by providing a signal to Google about the authority of your brand. When Google registers you as the author and owner of the content, you rank better. Not just that, social media can help you build backlinks without paying. This method involves creating valuable content on social media, building a follower base, and generating backlinks in the process. It takes time but once you have enough clout on any one social media platform, you can build backlinks consistently. By building a network and providing value over a long time, you increase the probability of a follower clicking on the links you share. Moreover, even if you don’t have links in your posts, people might link to your post in their content. All in all, the more people see your post, the more visits to your profile page and click on your links. Whom does link building through social media work for? This method works for all businesses because, for the most part, it has nothing to do with domain authority. Challenges with link building through social media There is no way to predict if link-building through social media would ever work. It involves creating a lot of content without seeing immediate results. Additionally, you need to invest time in writing content, engaging with your audience, and building your subscriber base. You won’t see success overnight. It might take many months. 7. Promote target domain through your newsletter Your website may not have a good domain authority but you may have a decent newsletter subscriber base. You can offer relevant high-domain websites to submit content to be promoted through your newsletter in return for a backlink. Through this method, you offer exposure to target domains in return for a backlink. Whom does this method of link building work for? Anyone who has a good subscriber base or newsletters can use this technique. Brand new websites with fewer than a thousand newsletter subscribers may not see any success with this method. Challenges with this method Building an audience is the most difficult bit of this method but selecting content for your newsletters can be even more challenging. Your subscriber base expects high-quality content but the target domain may want to get away with a substandard piece. You need to be able to say no even to high authority domains if the quality of content is subpar. 8. Create infographics Infographics are snackable. And thus shareable. Bloggers use them in their content to drive the point home effectively and often give a link-back to the owner. Whom does this method of link building work for? Infographics are a great way of getting backlinks without paying for them. They work well for any domain but the main challenge is getting the link. At times, people may post your infographic without giving you credit. You won’t find such instances until you do a Google image search. You sure can claim copyright or ask for a backlink but it’s often not worth the effort. Challenges with this method Designing an infographic might be a challenge. However, with Freemium tools like Canva, creating high-quality infographics is easy. You can access free templates and modify them as per your taste and brand colors. That’s it! 9. Start a podcast or feature in one Podcasting has become a killer method of promoting content. You can start your podcast when you talk about your niche or reach out to industry leaders and try to feature in popular podcasts. Podcasting will give you exposure. Additionally, you often get to mention the name of your website or link your content in the description and get referral traffic. The more you get that, the higher the probability of people linking to it because of the value it offers. Whom does podcast link building work for? You must have some domain authority to leverage this method of backlinking. Most podcast owners do not entertain newbies. Once you have a good domain authority or enough customer testimonials that highlight your expertise, getting onto a podcast without paying the owner becomes easy. Challenges with backlinking through podcasts If you plan to start your own podcast, be prepared to spend at least 6 months in getting a sizable subscriber-base. You won’t get followers until you build some clout through other channels of promotion. 10. Write business reviews Very few websites adopt this easy method of getting backlinks without paying for them. However, this one really works because you offer value to businesses before reaching out to them for backlinks. This is how this method works: First, you finalize 10-15 product or service based websites you hope to get a link from. Let’s assume that you seek backlinks from gardening based websites in the US. To attract their attention, you can create service-based listicles. For example, the keyword – best nursery in Seattle – is important for most nurseries. A post with them listed in it makes for good PR. You can get the list of nurseries from Google maps, select those that don’t rank on the map pack, and reach out to them for inputs. You can ask for details like Pricing, Quality, Distance from city center, employee count, etc. You can also assign a star-rating. This way you establish contact and give them something of value. Finally, once the article is ready, let the listed websites know about it. You can ask for a backlink but most of them will share your content, one way or another, by themselves. Whom does business review link building work for? Businesses with decent domain rating – and thus a chance to rank the listicle would see the most success with this method. You need to have samples of top ranking pages for businesses to evaluate your proposal. Challenges with this link building method The biggest challenge of this free link building method is that most listicle keywords are super-competitive. They are quite difficult to rank for. 11. Use an affiliate network An affiliate network can help you generate loads of relevant referral traffic through backlinks. It makes it easy to find the right affiliates to promote your business who also link to your website while promoting it. How this works is, the affiliate network creates unique links for every affiliate who chooses to promote your business. Those links find themselves in the media of promotion that the affiliates choose. For example, someone might promote your product through social media, in which case you just get a brand mention. However, if someone does it through a blog, you get backlinks. Who does affiliate link building work for? This method of link building works from businesses that pay a high commission and have a good reputation. It may not work for new websites. Challenges of building links through affiliates Most affiliates will add a nofollow or sponsored tag to your links because that’s what Google wants them to do. Any link that involves a monetary transaction needs to carry those tags otherwise Google might penalize them. A nofollow tag does not carry forward the link-juice which means you won’t see an improvement in your domain rating. However, these links might drive quality traffic which improves your authoritativeness. So these still are valuable links. 12. Try Slack Groups Slack groups are a gold-mine of backlinks and content collaboration in general. These groups are like HARO without competition. This method of generating backlinks without paying shows a high conversion rate. Essentially, someone who needs content for their next article puts a request in a popular slack group. You, if the niche is relevant, can respond to those requests with a quote in return for a backlink. Who does this free link building method work for? This method works for all websites big or small, old or new. Low domain authority websites may see a lower success rate but this method works much better than most others. Challenges with Slack group link building Finding vibrant slack communities is the biggest challenge of all. You will find hundreds of communities relevant to your niche, but few of them have a responsive audience. But the effort invested in finding one functional group will yield great results. FAQs Is paying for backlinks worth it? Buying backlinks is helpful only if the invested amount generates backlinks organically. It is a legit practice to pay someone to create content that generates links naturally. But paying someone to link to your website in their content is risky. That is because it can result in a manual action from Google. Does Google allow buying backlinks? No, it is a black-hat method of link-building. Google released a link-spam update in December 2023 that helps the search algorithm identify and penalize purchased backlinks. Today, websites find it difficult to buy backlinks and keep safe from Google’s manual action. How much should backlinks cost? Getting backlinks from individual domains should cost $0, meaning you should not pay for backlinks nor sell them. Paying for links is a black-hat method that can get you trapped in the link-spam update, resulting in deindexing of your website. There’s no easy or fast way to come back from that.

And anyway, what exactly are they? In order to find out, keep reading! Quality Backlinks - What are they and how do they work? A backlink is a hyperlink on an external website that leads to your site. Often, external backlinks or inbound links are called backlinks. To help you understand, here's an instance of a Quality Backlinks: Example of backlinks As you can see, our creativethinksmedia.com website has backlinks to various blogs, services, portfolios, etc. Well, think about it in this particular way: Having a backlink is like getting a vote for your site from an external website. The more votes you have the higher the search engine results will rank on your blog. However, not all backlinks are equivalent. If you want to improve your search engine rating, there are some forms of backlinks you need to get; it's not just about quantity. You need to get backlinks to your content or industry from authoritative sites and backlinks that are important. Relevant Quality Backlinks from other authoritative sources when your website has consistency Search engines are able to identify your website as authoritative and important to the subject for which you are also ranked. If search engines consider your site to be authoritative, they will move you higher on the results page of the search engine. How to create backlinks for SEO Now that you know the significance of backlinks in SEO, let's dive into 15 ways for your website to get more backlinks. 1. Standard of Writing, Link-Worthy Material Offer other bloggers and business leaders the opportunity to connect back to your site by creating your own content. You can't write just any form of content, but by writing quality, link-worthy content, you need to earn those backlinks. If it's useful, actionable, unique, and important, other bloggers and websites will only connect to your content. Do you want to learn how better content can be created? Check out our basic tips for writing conversion blog posts. Some forms of content are also available that get more shares and backlinks than others. Here are several instances of material that receives the most number of backlinks For getting Quality Backlinks to your website, how to articles that show readers how to do something are perfect. For example, you can write a \"How to Save Money for a Holiday\" blog post that can be linked to via travel blogs, websites for budgeting and finance, websites for travel agents, and more. Articles from the list often referred to as lists, are merely articles published as lists. Articles on the list are immensely popular online because they are so simple to read. Readers can quickly search the article and read the sections that are important to them because of the numerical list. Some of the examples for the list article are: Quizzes go online for a lot of shares because well, they're fun! Like many quizzes of popular social media pages and websites like Scoopwhoop and Buzzfeed. Using quizzes to get more backlinks But, if you want to get more backlinks to your blog, no matter how fun it is, you probably shouldn't make a quiz like this. You need to get relevant backlinks, as we described previously. But instead of making a cute Buzzfeed-Esque questionnaire, to get more backlinks from relevant websites, create a quiz that's relevant to your niche. Bloggers love to connect to authoritative guides because without having to go into too much detail themselves, it helps them illustrate a concept to their readers. So, to get more Quality Backlinks, create lengthy, informative guides. We've built several common definitive guides at Creative Thinks Media, such as: Statistics are also used to back up their arguments with data from other bloggers and websites. Take advantage of this and build your own statistical roundup message. Like this website named IsItWP, a pretty impressive blog was developed by them. They created a blog post with figures and information from 100+ WordPress. This post gets lots of backlinks from other blogs and posts related to WordPress. Any of these ideas for blog posts will help you get free and natural backlinks quickly, but we also have to note another unique form of content called content from Skyscraper. Let's explore the material of Skyscraper in the next segment. 2. Build Content from Skyscraper Skyscraper content is a connection building technique that includes identifying, enhancing, and duplicating the backlinks to existing common content online. Simply search for your subject of choice on Google. For example, type \"social media marketing\" into the search bar if you want to write a guide on social media marketing. The findings that appear on the first page are the most common and should have the most backlinks. From the first search results page, pick an article and write your own post that is 10X better. You can make your article longer and more in-depth, add photos of a quality that are missing in the original article, or add additional material that has not been included. Your fresh and enhanced content on search engines should soar well beyond the current content. Then to locate the original article's backlinks, use a backlink checker tool like the one from Ahrefs. You can reach out to those sites until you find all of the sites that connect to the original post, add your superior article, and ask them instead to link to your article. 3. Start Blogging for Guest Guest blogging is a tried-and-true way to attract a whole new audience to your company and every guest post you land will also give you at least 1 byline backlink to your web. The author of the guest posts, for example, gets to tell the readers a little about their experience and knowledge in the byline below and they get to add a link pointing back to their own website. In addition, several publications allow guest bloggers to also connect to their own website within the post. This implies that you have power over which particular pages or articles in the article are connected to on your website. Reach out to famous blogs that welcome guest entries. Only do a quick Google search for phrases like to find blogs that welcome guest posts, It's time to submit your pitch until you find blogs that you can contribute to! Come up with a great idea for the subject, provide a brief overview of the article, and persuade the owner of the site that their readers will be helpful with your content. You will create a lot of backlinks and get a boost in website traffic from a good guest blogging strategy. 4. Build Infographics You can also use infographics to create connections, aside from writing lengthy, in-depth blog posts, which can take a lot of time. Infographics are visual representations of information or information that are used to rapidly display details. They are one of the most shared content formats online since infographics are visual. This infographic, The Everyday Lives of Popular Creative People for instance, currently has 656 links from other pages to it. Informative, entertaining infographics can be used by other blogs and publications to spice up their own content and connect back to the original author, you. Don't worry, to make an awesome-looking infographic, you don't need to be a pro artist. There is a range of tools for the development of visual content that let you create infographics easily. Canva and Piktochart are a pair that you can use free of charge. 5. Comment on Blogs of high quality Commenting on blogs is one of the best methods of having backlinks. But, blog comments have to be done correctly. If you comment on a lot of blogs without any justification behind it other than having spam, you might come across spammy. Think of blog commenting as a way to connect with the community in order to avoid coming across as a spammer. Leaving comments on blogs gives you the ability to connect and add your opinions or advice to your peers. Follow these measures when leaving a blog comment: Be mindful, though that the blog owner might trash your comment when adding a link, thinking your link is spam. You should have a commenting account or use the comment tool to add your URL in the right place to prevent this. On any blog, don't just comment though. Be sure to choose high-quality blogs that have a 60+ domain authority. Using a tool like MozBar, you can verify the domain authority of a blog. For online forums, this approach works just as well. Try to search the web for forums relevant to your niche and enter the discussion there as well. 6. Reply to Quora Questions Quality Backlinks You can also respond to questions on Quora, similar to commenting on blogs. Quora is a question-and-answer forum where users on the Internet ask, answer, and edit questions. Questions relating to your niche on Quora can be found, answered with your expert advice, and linked back to your website. Not only does this allow you to get more backlinks for your website, but Quora users are encouraged to visit your website to see what other advice you have to share. 7. Giving testimonials Quality Backlinks By giving other companies some love, you can also get more backlinks to your blog. You can agree to send a testimonial to that business in return for a connection back to your website if you love a product/service. Many businesses use social evidence testimonials and they will feature them prominently on their homepage or a page devoted to customer success tales. These satisfied users of Shopify, for example, posted their testimonials and got a connection back to their own websites. 8. Look for Pages for Tools Resource pages contain a list of tools and connections that the owners of websites feel are useful to their audience. For example, a fly fishing website can have a resource page containing links to recommended fishing equipment, lists of the best fishing spots, and fly fishing tips for beginners. You can reach out to the owners of these resource pages and ask them to add you to the list if you blog about fishing or your company sells fishing-related items. Bear in mind that many sites only placed items that they know and use on their resource pages. Try proposing a partnership instead of straight-up asking for a mention. This helps the owner of the website to get to know the product and you have a much greater opportunity to build that relationship. Do a quick Google search for your niche keyword with words like \"helpful resource pages\" to find related resource pages. Or try searches like “useful links’’ and “resource list.” It will help you create more backlinks to your site and generate more traffic from your ideal customers or readers by being added to the appropriate resource pages. 9. Help out a Reporter Quality Backlinks Help a Reporter Out (HARO) is an online forum for journalists to gain public input to use in their upcoming reports. Not only does this support reporters with their reports, but it provides you with chances for your website to get backlinks. For instance, you might give a reporter your advice if you own a snow removal business to help homeowners prepare for heavy snowfall. To their post, they can add your thoughts and of course, provide a link back to your blog. All you have to do is register with HARO and they will send source requests directly to your inbox that are important to your industry knowledge or experience. Pitch it to them and if they're interested, the reporter can contact you. 10. Be Interviewed You may even reach out to magazines, blogs, and even vloggers to get interviewed, besides signing up for HARO. A perfect way to receive a backlink to your site is to have an online interview written. 11. Using Marketing by Influencers Marketing for influencers has become increasingly common in recent years. When you make a deal with an influencer, your website can be advertised, linked to, written about, posted on social media, and more. It might seem costly to pay an influencer to promote your website, especially for influencers with millions of followers. But happily, at a more affordable price and usually, more interaction, you can work with micro-influencers (with follow-ups ranging from 10,000 to 100,000). Plus, in exchange for free goods instead of cash, some influencers are willing to promote your website. So, hammer out a compromise that both sides profit from. You should check out a website like BuzzStream to find influencers relevant to your industry. To research influencers and create relationships with them, you can use Buzzstream. 12. Reclaim Your Notes If you mention your website but do not link to it with the website, then is a lost opportunity to find a back-link to your website. To solve this problem, you need to make it your task to collect your mentions. You can use an Awario tool to find out if your company has mentions floating around on the web without a connection. Anytime you're listed on the web, Awario will give you a warning. It's time to take action if you find a reference without a link. Since your company was listed by the author of the material, they already know who you are. Therefore all you need to do is contact them with a nice email asking them to add a connection to the guide. Just make sure you're just reaching out in a supportive way to writers who have listed your company. For example, if you find a blog writer who badly rated your product, you don't need to mention that. 13. Fixing the links which are broken Did you ever click on a web connection that led you to a 404 error page? Maybe it's because it's fairly popular. But, did you know that in order to get more backlinks to your site, you can use a 404 error? It's the perfect opportunity to replace the broken link with your own when you come across a resource page that has a broken link. The consequence of a website being taken down is a 404 error. And for the SEO of that website, the broken link is not pleasant. So, reach out to the owner of the website and let them know that on their resource page you have found a broken connection. To replace it you can give the website owner your own content. Finding broken ties on resource sites, of course, is like finding a needle in a haystack. Luckily, to make finding broken links easier, you can use a Chrome extension like Search My Links. 14. Using the Form of Moving Man The Moving Man Approach, a term coined by Brian Dean at Backlinko, is a similar technique for repairing broken ties. This time, you're searching for websites or services with links to websites that have shut down, changed titles, relocated, or discontinued a product/service, instead of looking for 404 pages. Usually, when a site connects to another site that has undergone either of these modifications, it will take users to a blank page. This is different from the creation of broken ties because the relations are not necessarily broken, they are merely obsolete. You can do a quick Google search to find pages that have changed or relocated, like: KEYWORD + 'page no longer exists' or KEYWORD + 'service no longer available' Once you find a page that fits the requirements, you can find all the links leading to the obsolete page using a tool like Ahrefs. Then, inform the owner of the site that links to it and offer to replace it with your own content. Chances are they're going to be pleased with your backlink to update their site. 15. Competitor Spying Finally, it's smart to learn from the best if you want to get more backlinks to your webpage. You can see the link-building methods that make them so effective by spying on your competitors. There are a variety of ways that you can spy on the link-building strategies of your rivals, such as: Spying on your rivals will allow you to become just as good as they are at building backlinks. Soon, in the search engine rankings, you can overtake them with time and some practice. You've got it there! You now have 15 new ways to get more backlinks and boost the rating of your search engine.

      "title": "How To Create More Backlinks And Boost Your SEO – 15 Methods To Do It SEO Quality Backlinks Techniques 2024 - Ritz Media World ‘Quality Backlinks for my website’- Are you curious about how to create website backlinks and how it lets you improve the rating of your search engine. With a higher search engine rating, the website will see a major traffic boom. It can be tricky to get links to your site, you don't actually need to buy backlinks, although many creators of content do. So you should know that there are many quick ways you can get more Quality Backlinks for free before you break the bank on backlinks. We'll share 15 ways to get more backlinks and improve your search engine ranking in this post. First, we all know that it's important to have backlinks, right? Hey, but why? And anyway, what exactly are they? In order to find out, keep reading! Quality Backlinks - What are they and how do they work? A backlink is a hyperlink on an external website that leads to your site. Often, external backlinks or inbound links are called backlinks. To help you understand, here's an instance of a Quality Backlinks: Example of backlinks As you can see, our creativethinksmedia.com website has backlinks to various blogs, services, portfolios, etc. Well, think about it in this particular way: Having a backlink is like getting a vote for your site from an external website. The more votes you have the higher the search engine results will rank on your blog. However, not all backlinks are equivalent. If you want to improve your search engine rating, there are some forms of backlinks you need to get; it's not just about quantity. You need to get backlinks to your content or industry from authoritative sites and backlinks that are important. Relevant Quality Backlinks from other authoritative sources when your website has consistency Search engines are able to identify your website as authoritative and important to the subject for which you are also ranked. If search engines consider your site to be authoritative, they will move you higher on the results page of the search engine. How to create backlinks for SEO Now that you know the significance of backlinks in SEO, let's dive into 15 ways for your website to get more backlinks. 1. Standard of Writing, Link-Worthy Material Offer other bloggers and business leaders the opportunity to connect back to your site by creating your own content. You can't write just any form of content, but by writing quality, link-worthy content, you need to earn those backlinks. If it's useful, actionable, unique, and important, other bloggers and websites will only connect to your content. Do you want to learn how better content can be created? Check out our basic tips for writing conversion blog posts. Some forms of content are also available that get more shares and backlinks than others. Here are several instances of material that receives the most number of backlinks For getting Quality Backlinks to your website, how to articles that show readers how to do something are perfect. For example, you can write a \"How to Save Money for a Holiday\" blog post that can be linked to via travel blogs, websites for budgeting and finance, websites for travel agents, and more. Articles from the list often referred to as lists, are merely articles published as lists. Articles on the list are immensely popular online because they are so simple to read. Readers can quickly search the article and read the sections that are important to them because of the numerical list. Some of the examples for the list article are: Quizzes go online for a lot of shares because well, they're fun! Like many quizzes of popular social media pages and websites like Scoopwhoop and Buzzfeed. Using quizzes to get more backlinks But, if you want to get more backlinks to your blog, no matter how fun it is, you probably shouldn't make a quiz like this. You need to get relevant backlinks, as we described previously. But instead of making a cute Buzzfeed-Esque questionnaire, to get more backlinks from relevant websites, create a quiz that's relevant to your niche. Bloggers love to connect to authoritative guides because without having to go into too much detail themselves, it helps them illustrate a concept to their readers. So, to get more Quality Backlinks, create lengthy, informative guides. We've built several common definitive guides at Creative Thinks Media, such as: Statistics are also used to back up their arguments with data from other bloggers and websites. Take advantage of this and build your own statistical roundup message. Like this website named IsItWP, a pretty impressive blog was developed by them. They created a blog post with figures and information from 100+ WordPress. This post gets lots of backlinks from other blogs and posts related to WordPress. Any of these ideas for blog posts will help you get free and natural backlinks quickly, but we also have to note another unique form of content called content from Skyscraper. Let's explore the material of Skyscraper in the next segment. 2. Build Content from Skyscraper Skyscraper content is a connection building technique that includes identifying, enhancing, and duplicating the backlinks to existing common content online. Simply search for your subject of choice on Google. For example, type \"social media marketing\" into the search bar if you want to write a guide on social media marketing. The findings that appear on the first page are the most common and should have the most backlinks. From the first search results page, pick an article and write your own post that is 10X better. You can make your article longer and more in-depth, add photos of a quality that are missing in the original article, or add additional material that has not been included. Your fresh and enhanced content on search engines should soar well beyond the current content. Then to locate the original article's backlinks, use a backlink checker tool like the one from Ahrefs. You can reach out to those sites until you find all of the sites that connect to the original post, add your superior article, and ask them instead to link to your article. 3. Start Blogging for Guest Guest blogging is a tried-and-true way to attract a whole new audience to your company and every guest post you land will also give you at least 1 byline backlink to your web. The author of the guest posts, for example, gets to tell the readers a little about their experience and knowledge in the byline below and they get to add a link pointing back to their own website. In addition, several publications allow guest bloggers to also connect to their own website within the post. This implies that you have power over which particular pages or articles in the article are connected to on your website. Reach out to famous blogs that welcome guest entries. Only do a quick Google search for phrases like to find blogs that welcome guest posts, It's time to submit your pitch until you find blogs that you can contribute to! Come up with a great idea for the subject, provide a brief overview of the article, and persuade the owner of the site that their readers will be helpful with your content. You will create a lot of backlinks and get a boost in website traffic from a good guest blogging strategy. 4. Build Infographics You can also use infographics to create connections, aside from writing lengthy, in-depth blog posts, which can take a lot of time. Infographics are visual representations of information or information that are used to rapidly display details. They are one of the most shared content formats online since infographics are visual. This infographic, The Everyday Lives of Popular Creative People for instance, currently has 656 links from other pages to it. Informative, entertaining infographics can be used by other blogs and publications to spice up their own content and connect back to the original author, you. Don't worry, to make an awesome-looking infographic, you don't need to be a pro artist. There is a range of tools for the development of visual content that let you create infographics easily. Canva and Piktochart are a pair that you can use free of charge. 5. Comment on Blogs of high quality Commenting on blogs is one of the best methods of having backlinks. But, blog comments have to be done correctly. If you comment on a lot of blogs without any justification behind it other than having spam, you might come across spammy. Think of blog commenting as a way to connect with the community in order to avoid coming across as a spammer. Leaving comments on blogs gives you the ability to connect and add your opinions or advice to your peers. Follow these measures when leaving a blog comment: Be mindful, though that the blog owner might trash your comment when adding a link, thinking your link is spam. You should have a commenting account or use the comment tool to add your URL in the right place to prevent this. On any blog, don't just comment though. Be sure to choose high-quality blogs that have a 60+ domain authority. Using a tool like MozBar, you can verify the domain authority of a blog. For online forums, this approach works just as well. Try to search the web for forums relevant to your niche and enter the discussion there as well. 6. Reply to Quora Questions Quality Backlinks You can also respond to questions on Quora, similar to commenting on blogs. Quora is a question-and-answer forum where users on the Internet ask, answer, and edit questions. Questions relating to your niche on Quora can be found, answered with your expert advice, and linked back to your website. Not only does this allow you to get more backlinks for your website, but Quora users are encouraged to visit your website to see what other advice you have to share. 7. Giving testimonials Quality Backlinks By giving other companies some love, you can also get more backlinks to your blog. You can agree to send a testimonial to that business in return for a connection back to your website if you love a product/service. Many businesses use social evidence testimonials and they will feature them prominently on their homepage or a page devoted to customer success tales. These satisfied users of Shopify, for example, posted their testimonials and got a connection back to their own websites. 8. Look for Pages for Tools Resource pages contain a list of tools and connections that the owners of websites feel are useful to their audience. For example, a fly fishing website can have a resource page containing links to recommended fishing equipment, lists of the best fishing spots, and fly fishing tips for beginners. You can reach out to the owners of these resource pages and ask them to add you to the list if you blog about fishing or your company sells fishing-related items. Bear in mind that many sites only placed items that they know and use on their resource pages. Try proposing a partnership instead of straight-up asking for a mention. This helps the owner of the website to get to know the product and you have a much greater opportunity to build that relationship. Do a quick Google search for your niche keyword with words like \"helpful resource pages\" to find related resource pages. Or try searches like “useful links’’ and “resource list.” It will help you create more backlinks to your site and generate more traffic from your ideal customers or readers by being added to the appropriate resource pages. 9. Help out a Reporter Quality Backlinks Help a Reporter Out (HARO) is an online forum for journalists to gain public input to use in their upcoming reports. Not only does this support reporters with their reports, but it provides you with chances for your website to get backlinks. For instance, you might give a reporter your advice if you own a snow removal business to help homeowners prepare for heavy snowfall.

      "content": "Published Time: 2024-11-20T12:21:00.000Z How to Get Free Backlinks: 9 Best Tactics for 2025 - Ranking Raccoon blog How It WorksPricingBlogLog inSign up How to Get Free Backlinks: 9 Best Tactics for 2025 Link Building Strategies Natalia Toth NOVEMBER 20, 2024 Do you feel that getting quality backlinks, especially on a tight budget, is like chasing a unicorn? The average cost of a backlink ranges from $100 to $500 and growing. Some companies spend thousands of dollars per month (!) on link-building - but you don’t have to be among them! It might sound hard to believe, but you can snag strong links without drilling a hole in your marketing budget. In this post, we’re suggesting nine ways to do just that. 1. Invest in Original Content Let’s start with the basics: create something so valuable that people want to link to it. A Reddit user shared: “It’s all about the content. I created a resource page for a niche topic, and it got picked up by several industry blogs without me having to lift a finger.” Here are some proven magnets for organic backlinks: Product comparisons Glossaries Industry reports and studies Infographics Articles with real-world examples and ready-to-use templates Example: SaaS companies can create “Ultimate Guides” on niche topics like data encryption or CRM best practices, with fresh stats and actionable insights. E-commerce businesses can publish detailed case studies on customer success stories, making them irresistible for industry bloggers to reference. We loved the example from Tidio, an AI customer service platform. They published a post on writing apology letters to customers, complete with seven ready-to-use templates. In just five months, this article earned backlinks from 78 domains, showcasing the power of practical content. Tidio's article with apology email examples is a real link magnet 2. Build connections with site admins on Ranking Raccoon Sadly, it's not enough to just produce great content to start getting backlinks naturally. You still need to be proactive and reach out to relevant sites with backlink requests. If link-building outreach fills you with very little enthusiasm, you’re among the 68% of marketers who feel the same. Prospecting and cold emailing take up a lot of your time, you never know if you’re writing to the right people, and 95% of your emails get no answer. Ranking Raccoon was created to take the unnecessary struggle out of your link-building campaigns. It’s a platform that connects you directly with credible site admins in SaaS, eCommerce, Business Services, Design, and 50 more niches. All you have to do is send a link request in a few clicks, discuss the details, get the backlink live, and see your rankings go up. And on top of getting that backlink, you can foster a lasting business relationship and profit from other joint marketing activities. 3. Leverage Digital PR Digital PR connects journalists with sources, and it’s a goldmine for getting backlinks from high-authority websites like Forbes or The New York Times, but also from smaller, niche blogs in your industry. Studies show that 55% of companies that use digital PR see notable increases in their search rankings within 6 months. Digital PR is a powerful way to boost your rankings Given the sunset of Connectively (featured by HARO), here are some solid freemium alternatives you can explore: Featured Sourcebottle Qwoted PitchRate Terkel “Answering HARO requests regularly has landed me backlinks from major publications,” one Quora user mentioned. “It’s a bit time-consuming, but totally worth it.” Example: A SaaS company specializing in cybersecurity could answer a journalist's query on emerging threats, and in return, land a backlink from a major tech publication. 4. Guest Blogging – Done in a Smart Way Guest blogging is a white hat link-building strategy that’s still alive. The key is to focus on quality over quantity. You want to guest blog on sites that are relevant to your industry and have a decent domain authority (DA). Instead of blasting out generic pitches, personalize your outreach by showing how your content can provide value to their audience. One Reddit user remarked: “Guest posting works if you target the right blogs and offer something valuable. It’s not just about getting the link, but also establishing your authority.” Example: A SaaS company offering AI tools could contribute to marketing blogs about how AI is reshaping digital marketing strategies. E-commerce brands can guest post about trends in consumer behavior or sustainability in retail. Here are the search operators you can apply to find guest posting opportunities: ‘write for us + {niche}’ {keyword} intitle:”write for us” {keyword} intitle:”write for me” {keyword} intitle:”contribute to” {keyword} intitle:”submit” + inurl:blog {keyword} “submit a guest post” {keyword} “accepting guest posts” {keyword} “guest author” {keyword} “become a contributor” inpostauthor:guest {keyword} 5. Take Advantage of Broken Link-Building Broken link-building is one of those underutilized tactics that can yield high-quality backlinks at zero expense if done right. It’s simple: find broken links on websites in your niche, then offer the webmaster a piece of your content as a replacement. This approach offers value to both sides: the website owner gets to fix a broken link, and you get a new backlink. It’s a win-win. One Quora user shared: “Broken link-building works really well if you’re in a niche where people don’t update their sites often.” Example: An e-commerce business selling eco-friendly products could search for outdated links on sustainability blogs. By offering updated, high-quality content, they can secure a backlink from an established source. Broken link-building is one of the easiest ways to get free, relevant backlinks To encourage you more, 94% of webmasters appreciate being notified about broken links because it helps improve their website performance and SEO. This makes it a low-risk, high-reward tactic. 6. Write Testimonials and Reviews Many companies love showcasing testimonials from their users or customers. It’s an easy way for them to build trust, and they often link back to your website in return. This strategy requires a bit of proactivity—write reviews for tools or services that you genuinely use and appreciate, then reach out to the company to let them know. Not only do you get a backlink for free, but you also nurture a potential relationship with that company. A user on Reddit noted: “I’ve gotten some good backlinks from writing testimonials for tools I use daily. It’s a super low-effort way to get links.” 7. Create Infographics or Visual Data Did you know that visual content is three times more likely to be shared than plain text? Infographics, in particular, are great for generating backlinks. People love to use them in their own content, especially if they are well-researched and visually appealing. You don’t have to be a design wizard to create these. Tools like Canva, Figma, or Piktochart can help you design professional-looking infographics in no time. When someone uses your infographic, they’re more likely to credit you with a free backlink. Example: A SaaS company could create a data-rich infographic on the “State of Cloud Security,” while an e-commerce brand might develop an infographic comparing traditional retail with online shopping trends. An straight-to-the-point infographics is exactly how Act! earned a backlink to their \"Best CRM for Small Business\" blog post from EngageBay’s article. Infographics by Act gets featured in external articles 8. Offer Free Tools or Resources If you’ve got the development bandwidth, creating a niche-specific tool is an awesome way to earn free backlinks. Think about what your audience would find helpful—a calculator, a checklist, or even a free downloadable template. If your tool genuinely provides value, people will link to it naturally. A Quora user mentioned: “I built a simple SEO audit tool and, within weeks, I had backlinks from several high-authority blogs. Free tools are a huge magnet for backlinks.” Example: If you work in the SEO space, consider creating a free SEO analysis tool. If you're in e-commerce, you might offer a “Home Décor Style Quiz.” Take PrimePay, for instance — they built a Bonus Tax Calculator that grabbed 100 backlinks from 12 Fintech domains within a year. It’s now their top-performing page for organic traffic, proving how powerful a well-designed tool can be! Primepay's Bonus Tax Calculator is a link magnet 9. Repurpose Content for Different Formats Content repurposing is a killer way to generate backlinks across different platforms. Take a blog post, turn it into a video, an infographic, or even a podcast episode. Each new format you create opens up new opportunities for backlinks from different channels. One Reddit user shared: “I turned my blog posts into slide decks and uploaded them to SlideShare—ended up getting several backlinks from people embedding them on their own blogs.” Repurposing content keeps it fresh and increases its reach, helping you generate more backlinks without creating new content from scratch every time. Wrapping Up: Get Free Backlinks Without Breaking the Bank Getting free backlinks takes creativity, persistence, and a bit of hustle. It’s not as simple as buying them outright, but the payoff can be much greater in the long run—both in terms of authority and sustainability. By applying the strategies above, you can start building a robust backlink profile without breaking the bank. As one Redditor put it: \"SEO is a marathon, not a sprint. You’ll see results over time if you’re consistent with these tactics.\" The best way to get free backlinks is to create content worth linking to and build genuine relationships within your industry.

Invest in Original Content Let’s start with the basics: create something so valuable that people want to link to it. A Reddit user shared: “It’s all about the content. I created a resource page for a niche topic, and it got picked up by several industry blogs without me having to lift a finger.” Here are some proven magnets for organic backlinks: Product comparisons Glossaries Industry reports and studies Infographics Articles with real-world examples and ready-to-use templates Example: SaaS companies can create “Ultimate Guides” on niche topics like data encryption or CRM best practices, with fresh stats and actionable insights. E-commerce businesses can publish detailed case studies on customer success stories, making them irresistible for industry bloggers to reference. We loved the example from Tidio, an AI customer service platform. They published a post on writing apology letters to customers, complete with seven ready-to-use templates. In just five months, this article earned backlinks from 78 domains, showcasing the power of practical content. Tidio's article with apology email examples is a real link magnet 2. Build connections with site admins on Ranking Raccoon Sadly, it's not enough to just produce great content to start getting backlinks naturally. You still need to be proactive and reach out to relevant sites with backlink requests. If link-building outreach fills you with very little enthusiasm, you’re among the 68% of marketers who feel the same. Prospecting and cold emailing take up a lot of your time, you never know if you’re writing to the right people, and 95% of your emails get no answer. Ranking Raccoon was created to take the unnecessary struggle out of your link-building campaigns. It’s a platform that connects you directly with credible site admins in SaaS, eCommerce, Business Services, Design, and 50 more niches. All you have to do is send a link request in a few clicks, discuss the details, get the backlink live, and see your rankings go up. And on top of getting that backlink, you can foster a lasting business relationship and profit from other joint marketing activities. 3. Leverage Digital PR Digital PR connects journalists with sources, and it’s a goldmine for getting backlinks from high-authority websites like Forbes or The New York Times, but also from smaller, niche blogs in your industry. Studies show that 55% of companies that use digital PR see notable increases in their search rankings within 6 months. Digital PR is a powerful way to boost your rankings Given the sunset of Connectively (featured by HARO), here are some solid freemium alternatives you can explore: Featured Sourcebottle Qwoted PitchRate Terkel “Answering HARO requests regularly has landed me backlinks from major publications,” one Quora user mentioned. “It’s a bit time-consuming, but totally worth it.” Example: A SaaS company specializing in cybersecurity could answer a journalist's query on emerging threats, and in return, land a backlink from a major tech publication. 4. Guest Blogging – Done in a Smart Way Guest blogging is a white hat link-building strategy that’s still alive. The key is to focus on quality over quantity. You want to guest blog on sites that are relevant to your industry and have a decent domain authority (DA). Instead of blasting out generic pitches, personalize your outreach by showing how your content can provide value to their audience. One Reddit user remarked: “Guest posting works if you target the right blogs and offer something valuable. It’s not just about getting the link, but also establishing your authority.” Example: A SaaS company offering AI tools could contribute to marketing blogs about how AI is reshaping digital marketing strategies. E-commerce brands can guest post about trends in consumer behavior or sustainability in retail. Here are the search operators you can apply to find guest posting opportunities: ‘write for us + {niche}’ {keyword} intitle:”write for us” {keyword} intitle:”write for me” {keyword} intitle:”contribute to” {keyword} intitle:”submit” + inurl:blog {keyword} “submit a guest post” {keyword} “accepting guest posts” {keyword} “guest author” {keyword} “become a contributor” inpostauthor:guest {keyword} 5. Take Advantage of Broken Link-Building Broken link-building is one of those underutilized tactics that can yield high-quality backlinks at zero expense if done right. It’s simple: find broken links on websites in your niche, then offer the webmaster a piece of your content as a replacement. This approach offers value to both sides: the website owner gets to fix a broken link, and you get a new backlink. It’s a win-win. One Quora user shared: “Broken link-building works really well if you’re in a niche where people don’t update their sites often.” Example: An e-commerce business selling eco-friendly products could search for outdated links on sustainability blogs. By offering updated, high-quality content, they can secure a backlink from an established source. Broken link-building is one of the easiest ways to get free, relevant backlinks To encourage you more, 94% of webmasters appreciate being notified about broken links because it helps improve their website performance and SEO. This makes it a low-risk, high-reward tactic. 6. Write Testimonials and Reviews Many companies love showcasing testimonials from their users or customers. It’s an easy way for them to build trust, and they often link back to your website in return. This strategy requires a bit of proactivity—write reviews for tools or services that you genuinely use and appreciate, then reach out to the company to let them know. Not only do you get a backlink for free, but you also nurture a potential relationship with that company. A user on Reddit noted: “I’ve gotten some good backlinks from writing testimonials for tools I use daily. It’s a super low-effort way to get links.” 7. Create Infographics or Visual Data Did you know that visual content is three times more likely to be shared than plain text? Infographics, in particular, are great for generating backlinks. People love to use them in their own content, especially if they are well-researched and visually appealing. You don’t have to be a design wizard to create these. Tools like Canva, Figma, or Piktochart can help you design professional-looking infographics in no time. When someone uses your infographic, they’re more likely to credit you with a free backlink. Example: A SaaS company could create a data-rich infographic on the “State of Cloud Security,” while an e-commerce brand might develop an infographic comparing traditional retail with online shopping trends. An straight-to-the-point infographics is exactly how Act! earned a backlink to their \"Best CRM for Small Business\" blog post from EngageBay’s article. Infographics by Act gets featured in external articles 8. Offer Free Tools or Resources If you’ve got the development bandwidth, creating a niche-specific tool is an awesome way to earn free backlinks. Think about what your audience would find helpful—a calculator, a checklist, or even a free downloadable template. If your tool genuinely provides value, people will link to it naturally. A Quora user mentioned: “I built a simple SEO audit tool and, within weeks, I had backlinks from several high-authority blogs. Free tools are a huge magnet for backlinks.” Example: If you work in the SEO space, consider creating a free SEO analysis tool. If you're in e-commerce, you might offer a “Home Décor Style Quiz.” Take PrimePay, for instance — they built a Bonus Tax Calculator that grabbed 100 backlinks from 12 Fintech domains within a year. It’s now their top-performing page for organic traffic, proving how powerful a well-designed tool can be! Primepay's Bonus Tax Calculator is a link magnet 9. Repurpose Content for Different Formats Content repurposing is a killer way to generate backlinks across different platforms. Take a blog post, turn it into a video, an infographic, or even a podcast episode. Each new format you create opens up new opportunities for backlinks from different channels. One Reddit user shared: “I turned my blog posts into slide decks and uploaded them to SlideShare—ended up getting several backlinks from people embedding them on their own blogs.” Repurposing content keeps it fresh and increases its reach, helping you generate more backlinks without creating new content from scratch every time. Wrapping Up: Get Free Backlinks Without Breaking the Bank Getting free backlinks takes creativity, persistence, and a bit of hustle. It’s not as simple as buying them outright, but the payoff can be much greater in the long run—both in terms of authority and sustainability. By applying the strategies above, you can start building a robust backlink profile without breaking the bank. As one Redditor put it: \"SEO is a marathon, not a sprint. You’ll see results over time if you’re consistent with these tactics.\" The best way to get free backlinks is to create content worth linking to and build genuine relationships within your industry.

It helps assess domain authority, search ranking potential, and the effectiveness of outreach efforts.Data Sources:Google Search Console, Ahrefs, Moz, SEMrush, MajesticFrequencyWeekly, Monthly, Quarterly Example target Gain 50+ high-authority backlinks in Q2 (focusing on links from sites with DA 50+) Example Reports Use Case Link-building KPIs help SEO teams evaluate backlink quality and refine outreach strategies. If backlink acquisition slows, adjustments to content marketing or outreach efforts may be needed. A SEO Manager may track this KPI monthly to report on link-building success, while a content marketer may analyze backlink trends to optimize future content strategies. KPI Example Best Practices for Link Building 📊 Track Your Link Building Success 📊 Earn High-Quality Backlinks Focus on securing links from authoritative and relevant websites to boost your site’s credibility and search rankings. 📈 Create Link-Worthy Content Develop high-value content like guides, infographics, and research studies that naturally attract backlinks. 🔄 Build Relationships for Outreach Engage with industry leaders, bloggers, and websites to foster link-building opportunities through guest posts and collaborations. 📅 Monitor & Maintain Backlinks Regularly track your backlinks to remove spammy links and ensure your site maintains a strong and healthy link profile. What is Link Building Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in link building are specific, measurable values that show how effectively your backlink strategy achieves key business objectives. These aren’t just random numbers—they’re the compass guiding your entire link building journey. Good link building management depends on these indicators to tell you whether your efforts are actually paying off. Without clear KPIs, you’re basically building links in the dark, with no way to know if your hard work translates to real business results. A thoughtful link building report includes these metrics to show progress and ROI to clients or stakeholders. The right KPIs help you connect your link building work directly to business outcomes like increased traffic, better rankings, and ultimately, more conversions. The Role of KPIs in Achieving Link Building Goals KPIs serve as both the roadmap and measuring stick for your link building strategy. They transform vague goals like “get more backlinks” into specific, trackable objectives. When used properly, these indicators help you focus your resources on the most productive link building tactics. Link building reporting becomes much more valuable when it centers around meaningful KPIs rather than just raw numbers. According to research compiled by Databox.com, the most valuable metrics to track include the number of new backlinks earned, average link quality, and the number of referring domains. These indicators provide actionable insights that help you refine your approach over time. For SEO agencies, establishing clear KPIs from the start sets proper expectations with clients and provides a framework for showing success. When everyone agrees on what success looks like, it’s easier to build trust and showcase the value of your link building services. Key Link Building KPIs to Monitor Number of Backlinks When developing your link building management strategy, the debate between quantity and quality is crucial. While tracking the total number of backlinks gives you a baseline metric, the quality of those links determines their actual impact on your site’s authority. A good link building report should highlight not just how many backlinks you’ve acquired, but their quality distribution. Research shows that 76% of SEO professionals use Ahrefs specifically for link building purposes, allowing them to assess metrics like Domain Rating (DR) alongside raw backlink counts. This combination creates a more meaningful picture of link profile strength. For effective link metrics tracking, try categorizing backlinks by authority levels. High-quality backlinks from authoritative sites in your niche deliver significantly more value than dozens of links from low-quality sources. According to data gathered by Databox, the average link quality (measuring both authority and relevance) ranks as one of the most critical KPIs to monitor in your link building efforts. Referring Domains The number of unique referring domains often proves more valuable than raw backlink counts. This metric reveals the breadth of your link profile and serves as a stronger indicator of your site’s perceived authority across the web. In link building reporting, highlighting growth in unique referring domains shows meaningful progress to clients or stakeholders. Search engines interpret links from diverse sources as multiple independent “votes of confidence” in your content. According to Databox research, the number of referring domains is considered one of the top link building metrics by industry experts. For SEO agencies, prioritizing domain diversity over sheer backlink volume often yields better results. One effective approach is tracking the ratio of referring domains to total backlinks—a healthy profile shows steady growth in both areas without excessive links from a small number of sources. Anchor Text Variation The distribution of anchor text in your backlink profile significantly impacts your SEO performance. Natural variation in anchor text helps search engines understand what your content is about while avoiding over-optimization penalties. When preparing your link building report, include anchor text distribution analysis to identify potential issues or opportunities. Databox insights confirm that anchor text distribution is among the key metrics valued by SEO professionals for evaluating link building success. Aim for a natural mix of branded terms (your company name), naked URLs, generic phrases (“click here,” “learn more”), and relevant keywords. Too many exact-match keyword anchors can trigger spam filters, while too many generic anchors might limit the contextual value of your links. Link Relevancy and Contextual Value Link relevancy has become increasingly important as search algorithms grow more sophisticated. Backlinks from websites in related industries or discussing similar topics carry more weight than random links from unrelated sources. In your link building management dashboard, include metrics that assess contextual relevance—not just domain authority. This might involve categorizing backlinks by industry, content type, or topical overlap with your site. The contextual value of a link often determines its true impact on your rankings more than raw authority metrics. For SEO agencies, showing the relevancy of acquired links adds another dimension to client reporting. Beyond showing that you’ve secured links from high-authority sites, you can highlight how these links come from sources that align with the client’s industry and audience interests. Follow vs. Nofollow Links Modern link building strategies should balance follow links (which pass SEO value) with nofollow links (which typically don’t). While follow links remain the priority for direct ranking benefits, nofollow links still contribute to a natural-looking backlink profile. When tracking link metrics, categorize links by their attribute type to ensure a balanced distribution. Too many follow links from low-quality sources can appear manipulative, while a profile containing only follow links looks unnatural in today’s linking environment. According to Databox data, successful link building campaigns typically track both follow and nofollow acquisition separately while maintaining focus on high-quality links regardless of attribute. Even nofollow links from respected sources can drive significant referral traffic and brand visibility. Traffic and Engagement from Backlinks Beyond their SEO impact, high-quality backlinks should generate direct referral traffic and engagement. Monitoring these downstream effects provides a more complete picture of your link building ROI. Effective link building reporting connects backlink acquisition to actual business outcomes by tracking metrics like referral traffic, time on site from referral sources, and conversion rates from backlink traffic. This approach demonstrates value beyond simple link counts or domain authority scores. For SEO agencies, showcasing traffic generation alongside traditional link metrics creates more compelling client reports. Using tools like Google Analytics alongside specialized SEO platforms provides this comprehensive view. As Databox research indicates, both Google Analytics and Google Search Console are essential tools for evaluating the true impact of link building efforts on website performance. Measuring and Analyzing Link Building KPIs Essential Tools for Tracking Link Building Metrics Effective link building management requires robust tools that provide comprehensive data on your backlink profile. According to research from Databox, Ahrefs stands out as the most popular tool for link building campaigns, used by 80% of surveyed contributors. Its comprehensive backlink analysis makes it an industry standard for tracking link metrics. Beyond Ahrefs, SEMrush and Moz offer similar capabilities for backlink analysis, with each providing unique features that may better suit certain organizational needs. For SEO agencies handling multiple clients, these tools offer efficient ways to monitor progress across various campaigns simultaneously. Interestingly, while Ahrefs is widely used for link building specifically, 51.3% of SEO professionals prefer SEMrush as their favorite overall SEO tool. For thorough link building reporting, don’t overlook free tools like Google Search Console, which provides valuable data on how search engines view your backlinks. Combining data from multiple sources into a unified dashboard using tools like Databox can streamline your reporting process, creating clear visualizations that help clients understand progress at a glance. For outreach tracking, tools like Hunter have become popular for gathering prospect email addresses and managing communication efforts. Interpreting Complex Data for Clear Insights The challenge in link building reporting isn’t collecting data—it’s transforming that data into actionable insights. Start by establishing baseline measurements for each KPI before launching new campaigns. This creates a reference point for measuring progress and identifying trends over time. When analyzing link data, focus on correlation patterns between different metrics. For instance, if referring domains increase but organic traffic remains flat, this might indicate you’re acquiring links from irrelevant or low-quality sources. Look beyond surface-level numbers to understand the story your data is telling about your link building effectiveness. For link building management purposes, segment your data by campaign, content type, or acquisition method. This granular approach reveals which strategies deliver the best results and deserve more resources. According to Databox research, successful SEO professionals track metrics like response rate to outreach emails alongside traditional link metrics to optimize their processes from end to end. Benchmarking Against Industry Standards Establishing realistic expectations requires understanding how your link building performance compares to industry standards. While every website starts from a different baseline, certain benchmarks can guide your strategy development and goal-setting process. For SEO agencies, contextualizing link building reports with industry averages helps manage client expectations. For example, highly competitive industries like finance or health typically require more authoritative backlinks to see movement in rankings compared to less competitive niches. Understanding these differences prevents setting unrealistic targets that lead to perceived failure. Research from Databox indicates that tracking Domain Rating (DR) of acquired backlinks provides valuable context when benchmarking link quality. By comparing your DR distribution against competitors, you can identify gaps and opportunities in your link building strategy. Additionally, tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush offer industry-specific benchmarking features that allow you to measure your performance against similar websites. When establishing benchmarks, consider factors beyond raw link counts. Metrics like link growth rate, referring domain diversity, and traffic from backlinks often provide more meaningful comparisons than absolute numbers. For SEO agencies, creating custom benchmarking reports that account for client-specific factors like site age, existing authority, and competitive landscape delivers more valuable insights than generic industry averages. Remember that benchmarking isn’t about matching exact numbers but understanding relative performance. A new website might celebrate acquiring ten high-quality backlinks in a month, while an established authority site might consider that same number disappointing. The key is establishing realistic, contextual goals based on where you start and where your competitors stand. Strategies to Optimize Link Building through KPIs Enhancing Domain Authority Domain authority remains one of the most coveted link metrics in SEO. To boost this critical indicator, focus your link building management efforts on quality rather than quantity. Start by identifying high-authority websites in your niche that could provide valuable backlinks. According to Databox research, tracking Domain Rating (DR) of acquired backlinks is a practice followed by 67% of marketers when measuring the quality of their links. Implement a tiered outreach strategy that prioritizes high-authority targets while maintaining a steady flow of mid-level acquisitions. For effective link building reporting, track how each new backlink impacts your overall domain authority over time. This approach demonstrates clear value to clients or stakeholders by connecting specific link building efforts to measurable authority growth. Consider establishing topic clusters in your content strategy, creating comprehensive resource pages that naturally attract links from authoritative sources. This approach not only enhances domain authority but also establishes topical relevance—another factor search engines increasingly value. For SEO agencies, highlighting topic authority growth alongside domain authority in your link building reports provides clients with a more complete picture of campaign success. Improving Anchor Text Distribution Anchor text distribution directly impacts how search engines interpret your backlink profile. Your link metrics should include detailed anchor text analysis to identify potential optimization opportunities or overoptimization risks. According to Databox, anchor text distribution is among the key link building reporting metrics valued by SEO professionals. To optimize your anchor text strategy, aim for a natural distribution that includes: Branded anchors (your brand name) Naked URLs (your exact website address) Generic phrases (“click here,” “learn more”) Partial-match keywords (variations of target terms) Exact-match keywords (used sparingly) Avoid excessive exact-match keyword anchors, which can trigger algorithm penalties. Instead, focus on diversification that mimics natural linking patterns. When conducting link building for SEO agencies, educate clients about the importance of varied anchor text rather than fixating on exact-match keywords. Regular anchor text audits should be part of your link building management process. These reviews help identify potential risk areas before they become problems. If your analysis reveals an overreliance on specific anchor types, adjust your outreach strategy to request more diverse anchor text in future link building efforts. Strategies for Acquiring High-Quality Backlinks High-quality backlinks form the backbone of effective link building campaigns. Start by creating truly exceptional, linkable content assets—comprehensive guides, original research, or interactive tools that naturally attract references. These resources should address specific pain points in your industry or provide unique insights not available elsewhere. Targeted outreach remains essential for acquiring premium backlinks. Tools like Hunter, mentioned in Databox research, can streamline your outreach process by gathering prospect email addresses efficiently. Track your outreach response rates as part of your link building report to continuously refine your approach and messaging. For SEO agencies, demonstrating the quality of acquired links goes beyond domain metrics. Consider including additional contextual information in your link building reporting, such as: Topic relevance to client’s industry Estimated monthly traffic of linking pages Social engagement metrics of linking domains Editorial standards of linking publications These quality indicators provide clients with a more comprehensive understanding of your link acquisition strategy and value. Remember that a single high-quality, contextually relevant backlink often delivers more value than multiple lower-quality links. Managing and Mitigating Spammy Links Even the most careful link building strategies can attract unwanted backlinks. Proactive link profile monitoring should be a core component of your link building management approach. According to Databox findings, successful SEO professionals regularly audit their backlink profiles to identify potential toxic links before they harm rankings. Implement a systematic process for identifying and addressing problematic links: Conduct regular backlink audits (monthly or quarterly) Flag suspicious links based on quality metrics and relevance Attempt outreach for removal when appropriate Use Google’s Disavow Tool for links that cannot be removed Document all actions in your link building report For clients, explain that some toxic link accumulation is normal and doesn’t indicate a problem with your strategy. Instead, emphasize how your proactive management protects their site from potential penalties. When presenting link metrics, include a “toxicity trend” that shows how your efforts keep harmful links under control over time. SEO agencies should consider including regular backlink audits as a standard service offering. This proactive approach demonstrates value beyond just link acquisition and positions your agency as a comprehensive link building management partner rather than simply a link builder. As search algorithms continue to emphasize quality over quantity, this protective service becomes increasingly valuable to clients concerned about their long-term search visibility. Addressing Common Challenges and FAQs How Long Does It Take to See Improvements in Link Building KPIs? One of the most common questions in link building management is about timeline expectations. The truth is that improvements in link metrics vary widely depending on several factors. Typically, you’ll notice changes in direct link KPIs (like referring domains or backlink counts) immediately, but their impact on authority metrics and rankings often takes longer. For most sites, expect to see meaningful movement in domain authority metrics within 3-6 months of consistent, quality link building. However, competitive niches may require longer timeframes. When creating a link building report for clients or stakeholders, it’s crucial to set realistic expectations about these timelines from the beginning. Several factors influence how quickly you’ll see results: Your site’s existing authority (higher authority sites often see faster impacts) The quality and relevance of acquired links Consistency of link acquisition over time Competitive landscape in your niche According to Databox research, tracking both immediate metrics (new backlinks earned, referring domains) and lagging indicators (domain rating, organic traffic) provides a more complete picture of progress. This approach helps manage expectations while still demonstrating incremental wins along the way. Is It Necessary to Remove Low-Quality Links? Proper backlink hygiene remains essential in 2024’s SEO landscape. While Google has improved its ability to ignore low-quality links rather than penalizing sites for them, proactive management of your link profile is still a best practice in link building reporting. For SEO agencies, regular link audits should be part of your standard service offering. These audits help identify potentially harmful links before they impact client performance. When toxic links are discovered, you have several options: Contact webmasters requesting removal (effective but time-consuming) Use Google’s Disavow Tool (especially for links that can’t be removed) Monitor without action (for borderline cases where disavowal might do more harm than good) The key is developing a consistent process for evaluating link quality. Not every “low-quality” link requires action—focus on truly spammy or manipulative links that could trigger algorithmic or manual penalties. Document your decisions in your link building management system to maintain a clear history of actions taken. Impact of Internal and Social Media Links on KPIs While external backlinks often get the spotlight, internal linking and social media signals play important supporting roles in comprehensive link building strategies. Internal links help distribute page authority throughout your site and establish topical relevance clusters that complement your external link building efforts. In your link building report, consider including internal linking metrics alongside external backlink data. This holistic approach demonstrates how your overall link strategy (both internal and external) works together to improve site authority and user experience. Social media links typically carry “nofollow” attributes, limiting their direct SEO impact. However, they deliver other benefits worth tracking in your link metrics dashboard: Increased content visibility and amplification Potential for attracting natural backlinks from social audiences Direct referral traffic that can lead to conversions Brand awareness and reputation building For SEO agencies, explaining this ecosystem approach helps clients understand how different types of links contribute to overall performance. Tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console can help attribute traffic and engagement from these various link sources. FAQs Link Building Metrics “More links always mean better rankings.” This persistent myth needs addressing in client education. Quality and relevance now far outweigh quantity. A focused strategy targeting fewer, higher-quality links often delivers better results than mass acquisition of mediocre links. “Only follow links matter for SEO.” While follow links pass more direct ranking power, nofollow links still provide brand exposure, referral traffic, and diversification of your link profile. A natural link profile includes both types. “Domain Authority is an official Google metric.” Many clients confuse third-party authority metrics (like Moz’s DA or Ahrefs’ DR) with Google’s actual ranking factors. Explain in your link building reporting that these are useful comparative tools but not direct Google rankings factors. “All link building happens quickly.” Sustainable link building is a marathon, not a sprint. Educate stakeholders that quality link acquisition takes time and rushing typically leads to lower-quality links that deliver less long-term value. “Anchor text should always include keywords.” Excessive keyword-rich anchor text can appear manipulative. A diverse, natural-looking anchor text profile performs better long-term than one over-optimized for keywords. Related Topics for Further Exploration To deepen your link building expertise, consider exploring these related areas: Digital PR for Link Acquisition Public relations strategies increasingly overlap with link building. Techniques like data-driven stories, expert commentary, and newsworthy content can attract high-authority links from media outlets. Content-Driven Link Building Creating linkable assets—comprehensive guides, original research, or interactive tools—can generate passive link acquisition over time. This approach complements active outreach strategies. Technical SEO’s Impact on Link Equity How your site handles redirects, canonicalization, and internal linking directly affects how link equity flows through your site. Technical optimizations can maximize the value of your link building efforts. Competitive Link Analysis Techniques Advanced competitive analysis helps identify link gaps and opportunities. Learning to effectively analyze competitor backlink profiles can reveal valuable strategic insights. Local Link Building Strategies For businesses with physical locations, local link building techniques focused on community relationships and geographic relevance offer unique opportunities. For SEO agencies looking to enhance their link building services, staying current with these evolving topics helps maintain a competitive edge. Consider incorporating educational content about these areas in your client communications and link building reporting to demonstrate your ongoing expertise and value.

The right KPIs help you connect your link building work directly to business outcomes like increased traffic, better rankings, and ultimately, more conversions. The Role of KPIs in Achieving Link Building Goals KPIs serve as both the roadmap and measuring stick for your link building strategy. They transform vague goals like “get more backlinks” into specific, trackable objectives. When used properly, these indicators help you focus your resources on the most productive link building tactics. Link building reporting becomes much more valuable when it centers around meaningful KPIs rather than just raw numbers. According to research compiled by Databox.com, the most valuable metrics to track include the number of new backlinks earned, average link quality, and the number of referring domains. These indicators provide actionable insights that help you refine your approach over time. For SEO agencies, establishing clear KPIs from the start sets proper expectations with clients and provides a framework for showing success. When everyone agrees on what success looks like, it’s easier to build trust and showcase the value of your link building services. Key Link Building KPIs to Monitor Number of Backlinks When developing your link building management strategy, the debate between quantity and quality is crucial. While tracking the total number of backlinks gives you a baseline metric, the quality of those links determines their actual impact on your site’s authority. A good link building report should highlight not just how many backlinks you’ve acquired, but their quality distribution. Research shows that 76% of SEO professionals use Ahrefs specifically for link building purposes, allowing them to assess metrics like Domain Rating (DR) alongside raw backlink counts. This combination creates a more meaningful picture of link profile strength. For effective link metrics tracking, try categorizing backlinks by authority levels. High-quality backlinks from authoritative sites in your niche deliver significantly more value than dozens of links from low-quality sources. According to data gathered by Databox, the average link quality (measuring both authority and relevance) ranks as one of the most critical KPIs to monitor in your link building efforts. Referring Domains The number of unique referring domains often proves more valuable than raw backlink counts. This metric reveals the breadth of your link profile and serves as a stronger indicator of your site’s perceived authority across the web. In link building reporting, highlighting growth in unique referring domains shows meaningful progress to clients or stakeholders. Search engines interpret links from diverse sources as multiple independent “votes of confidence” in your content. According to Databox research, the number of referring domains is considered one of the top link building metrics by industry experts. For SEO agencies, prioritizing domain diversity over sheer backlink volume often yields better results. One effective approach is tracking the ratio of referring domains to total backlinks—a healthy profile shows steady growth in both areas without excessive links from a small number of sources. Anchor Text Variation The distribution of anchor text in your backlink profile significantly impacts your SEO performance. Natural variation in anchor text helps search engines understand what your content is about while avoiding over-optimization penalties. When preparing your link building report, include anchor text distribution analysis to identify potential issues or opportunities. Databox insights confirm that anchor text distribution is among the key metrics valued by SEO professionals for evaluating link building success. Aim for a natural mix of branded terms (your company name), naked URLs, generic phrases (“click here,” “learn more”), and relevant keywords. Too many exact-match keyword anchors can trigger spam filters, while too many generic anchors might limit the contextual value of your links. Link Relevancy and Contextual Value Link relevancy has become increasingly important as search algorithms grow more sophisticated. Backlinks from websites in related industries or discussing similar topics carry more weight than random links from unrelated sources. In your link building management dashboard, include metrics that assess contextual relevance—not just domain authority. This might involve categorizing backlinks by industry, content type, or topical overlap with your site. The contextual value of a link often determines its true impact on your rankings more than raw authority metrics. For SEO agencies, showing the relevancy of acquired links adds another dimension to client reporting. Beyond showing that you’ve secured links from high-authority sites, you can highlight how these links come from sources that align with the client’s industry and audience interests. Follow vs. Nofollow Links Modern link building strategies should balance follow links (which pass SEO value) with nofollow links (which typically don’t). While follow links remain the priority for direct ranking benefits, nofollow links still contribute to a natural-looking backlink profile. When tracking link metrics, categorize links by their attribute type to ensure a balanced distribution. Too many follow links from low-quality sources can appear manipulative, while a profile containing only follow links looks unnatural in today’s linking environment. According to Databox data, successful link building campaigns typically track both follow and nofollow acquisition separately while maintaining focus on high-quality links regardless of attribute. Even nofollow links from respected sources can drive significant referral traffic and brand visibility. Traffic and Engagement from Backlinks Beyond their SEO impact, high-quality backlinks should generate direct referral traffic and engagement. Monitoring these downstream effects provides a more complete picture of your link building ROI. Effective link building reporting connects backlink acquisition to actual business outcomes by tracking metrics like referral traffic, time on site from referral sources, and conversion rates from backlink traffic. This approach demonstrates value beyond simple link counts or domain authority scores. For SEO agencies, showcasing traffic generation alongside traditional link metrics creates more compelling client reports. Using tools like Google Analytics alongside specialized SEO platforms provides this comprehensive view. As Databox research indicates, both Google Analytics and Google Search Console are essential tools for evaluating the true impact of link building efforts on website performance. Measuring and Analyzing Link Building KPIs Essential Tools for Tracking Link Building Metrics Effective link building management requires robust tools that provide comprehensive data on your backlink profile. According to research from Databox, Ahrefs stands out as the most popular tool for link building campaigns, used by 80% of surveyed contributors. Its comprehensive backlink analysis makes it an industry standard for tracking link metrics. Beyond Ahrefs, SEMrush and Moz offer similar capabilities for backlink analysis, with each providing unique features that may better suit certain organizational needs. For SEO agencies handling multiple clients, these tools offer efficient ways to monitor progress across various campaigns simultaneously. Interestingly, while Ahrefs is widely used for link building specifically, 51.3% of SEO professionals prefer SEMrush as their favorite overall SEO tool. For thorough link building reporting, don’t overlook free tools like Google Search Console, which provides valuable data on how search engines view your backlinks. Combining data from multiple sources into a unified dashboard using tools like Databox can streamline your reporting process, creating clear visualizations that help clients understand progress at a glance. For outreach tracking, tools like Hunter have become popular for gathering prospect email addresses and managing communication efforts. Interpreting Complex Data for Clear Insights The challenge in link building reporting isn’t collecting data—it’s transforming that data into actionable insights. Start by establishing baseline measurements for each KPI before launching new campaigns. This creates a reference point for measuring progress and identifying trends over time. When analyzing link data, focus on correlation patterns between different metrics. For instance, if referring domains increase but organic traffic remains flat, this might indicate you’re acquiring links from irrelevant or low-quality sources. Look beyond surface-level numbers to understand the story your data is telling about your link building effectiveness. For link building management purposes, segment your data by campaign, content type, or acquisition method. This granular approach reveals which strategies deliver the best results and deserve more resources. According to Databox research, successful SEO professionals track metrics like response rate to outreach emails alongside traditional link metrics to optimize their processes from end to end. Benchmarking Against Industry Standards Establishing realistic expectations requires understanding how your link building performance compares to industry standards. While every website starts from a different baseline, certain benchmarks can guide your strategy development and goal-setting process. For SEO agencies, contextualizing link building reports with industry averages helps manage client expectations. For example, highly competitive industries like finance or health typically require more authoritative backlinks to see movement in rankings compared to less competitive niches. Understanding these differences prevents setting unrealistic targets that lead to perceived failure. Research from Databox indicates that tracking Domain Rating (DR) of acquired backlinks provides valuable context when benchmarking link quality. By comparing your DR distribution against competitors, you can identify gaps and opportunities in your link building strategy. Additionally, tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush offer industry-specific benchmarking features that allow you to measure your performance against similar websites. When establishing benchmarks, consider factors beyond raw link counts. Metrics like link growth rate, referring domain diversity, and traffic from backlinks often provide more meaningful comparisons than absolute numbers. For SEO agencies, creating custom benchmarking reports that account for client-specific factors like site age, existing authority, and competitive landscape delivers more valuable insights than generic industry averages. Remember that benchmarking isn’t about matching exact numbers but understanding relative performance. A new website might celebrate acquiring ten high-quality backlinks in a month, while an established authority site might consider that same number disappointing. The key is establishing realistic, contextual goals based on where you start and where your competitors stand. Strategies to Optimize Link Building through KPIs Enhancing Domain Authority Domain authority remains one of the most coveted link metrics in SEO. To boost this critical indicator, focus your link building management efforts on quality rather than quantity. Start by identifying high-authority websites in your niche that could provide valuable backlinks. According to Databox research, tracking Domain Rating (DR) of acquired backlinks is a practice followed by 67% of marketers when measuring the quality of their links. Implement a tiered outreach strategy that prioritizes high-authority targets while maintaining a steady flow of mid-level acquisitions. For effective link building reporting, track how each new backlink impacts your overall domain authority over time. This approach demonstrates clear value to clients or stakeholders by connecting specific link building efforts to measurable authority growth. Consider establishing topic clusters in your content strategy, creating comprehensive resource pages that naturally attract links from authoritative sources. This approach not only enhances domain authority but also establishes topical relevance—another factor search engines increasingly value. For SEO agencies, highlighting topic authority growth alongside domain authority in your link building reports provides clients with a more complete picture of campaign success. Improving Anchor Text Distribution Anchor text distribution directly impacts how search engines interpret your backlink profile. Your link metrics should include detailed anchor text analysis to identify potential optimization opportunities or overoptimization risks. According to Databox, anchor text distribution is among the key link building reporting metrics valued by SEO professionals. To optimize your anchor text strategy, aim for a natural distribution that includes: Branded anchors (your brand name) Naked URLs (your exact website address) Generic phrases (“click here,” “learn more”) Partial-match keywords (variations of target terms) Exact-match keywords (used sparingly) Avoid excessive exact-match keyword anchors, which can trigger algorithm penalties. Instead, focus on diversification that mimics natural linking patterns. When conducting link building for SEO agencies, educate clients about the importance of varied anchor text rather than fixating on exact-match keywords. Regular anchor text audits should be part of your link building management process. These reviews help identify potential risk areas before they become problems. If your analysis reveals an overreliance on specific anchor types, adjust your outreach strategy to request more diverse anchor text in future link building efforts. Strategies for Acquiring High-Quality Backlinks High-quality backlinks form the backbone of effective link building campaigns. Start by creating truly exceptional, linkable content assets—comprehensive guides, original research, or interactive tools that naturally attract references. These resources should address specific pain points in your industry or provide unique insights not available elsewhere. Targeted outreach remains essential for acquiring premium backlinks. Tools like Hunter, mentioned in Databox research, can streamline your outreach process by gathering prospect email addresses efficiently. Track your outreach response rates as part of your link building report to continuously refine your approach and messaging. For SEO agencies, demonstrating the quality of acquired links goes beyond domain metrics. Consider including additional contextual information in your link building reporting, such as: Topic relevance to client’s industry Estimated monthly traffic of linking pages Social engagement metrics of linking domains Editorial standards of linking publications These quality indicators provide clients with a more comprehensive understanding of your link acquisition strategy and value. Remember that a single high-quality, contextually relevant backlink often delivers more value than multiple lower-quality links. Managing and Mitigating Spammy Links Even the most careful link building strategies can attract unwanted backlinks. Proactive link profile monitoring should be a core component of your link building management approach. According to Databox findings, successful SEO professionals regularly audit their backlink profiles to identify potential toxic links before they harm rankings. Implement a systematic process for identifying and addressing problematic links: Conduct regular backlink audits (monthly or quarterly) Flag suspicious links based on quality metrics and relevance Attempt outreach for removal when appropriate Use Google’s Disavow Tool for links that cannot be removed Document all actions in your link building report For clients, explain that some toxic link accumulation is normal and doesn’t indicate a problem with your strategy. Instead, emphasize how your proactive management protects their site from potential penalties. When presenting link metrics, include a “toxicity trend” that shows how your efforts keep harmful links under control over time. SEO agencies should consider including regular backlink audits as a standard service offering. This proactive approach demonstrates value beyond just link acquisition and positions your agency as a comprehensive link building management partner rather than simply a link builder. As search algorithms continue to emphasize quality over quantity, this protective service becomes increasingly valuable to clients concerned about their long-term search visibility. Addressing Common Challenges and FAQs How Long Does It Take to See Improvements in Link Building KPIs? One of the most common questions in link building management is about timeline expectations. The truth is that improvements in link metrics vary widely depending on several factors. Typically, you’ll notice changes in direct link KPIs (like referring domains or backlink counts) immediately, but their impact on authority metrics and rankings often takes longer. For most sites, expect to see meaningful movement in domain authority metrics within 3-6 months of consistent, quality link building. However, competitive niches may require longer timeframes. When creating a link building report for clients or stakeholders, it’s crucial to set realistic expectations about these timelines from the beginning. Several factors influence how quickly you’ll see results: Your site’s existing authority (higher authority sites often see faster impacts) The quality and relevance of acquired links Consistency of link acquisition over time Competitive landscape in your niche According to Databox research, tracking both immediate metrics (new backlinks earned, referring domains) and lagging indicators (domain rating, organic traffic) provides a more complete picture of progress. This approach helps manage expectations while still demonstrating incremental wins along the way. Is It Necessary to Remove Low-Quality Links? Proper backlink hygiene remains essential in 2024’s SEO landscape. While Google has improved its ability to ignore low-quality links rather than penalizing sites for them, proactive management of your link profile is still a best practice in link building reporting. For SEO agencies, regular link audits should be part of your standard service offering. These audits help identify potentially harmful links before they impact client performance. When toxic links are discovered, you have several options: Contact webmasters requesting removal (effective but time-consuming) Use Google’s Disavow Tool (especially for links that can’t be removed) Monitor without action (for borderline cases where disavowal might do more harm than good) The key is developing a consistent process for evaluating link quality. Not every “low-quality” link requires action—focus on truly spammy or manipulative links that could trigger algorithmic or manual penalties. Document your decisions in your link building management system to maintain a clear history of actions taken. Impact of Internal and Social Media Links on KPIs While external backlinks often get the spotlight, internal linking and social media signals play important supporting roles in comprehensive link building strategies. Internal links help distribute page authority throughout your site and establish topical relevance clusters that complement your external link building efforts. In your link building report, consider including internal linking metrics alongside external backlink data. This holistic approach demonstrates how your overall link strategy (both internal and external) works together to improve site authority and user experience. Social media links typically carry “nofollow” attributes, limiting their direct SEO impact. However, they deliver other benefits worth tracking in your link metrics dashboard: Increased content visibility and amplification Potential for attracting natural backlinks from social audiences Direct referral traffic that can lead to conversions Brand awareness and reputation building For SEO agencies, explaining this ecosystem approach helps clients understand how different types of links contribute to overall performance. Tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console can help attribute traffic and engagement from these various link sources. FAQs Link Building Metrics “More links always mean better rankings.” This persistent myth needs addressing in client education. Quality and relevance now far outweigh quantity. A focused strategy targeting fewer, higher-quality links often delivers better results than mass acquisition of mediocre links. “Only follow links matter for SEO.” While follow links pass more direct ranking power, nofollow links still provide brand exposure, referral traffic, and diversification of your link profile. A natural link profile includes both types. “Domain Authority is an official Google metric.” Many clients confuse third-party authority metrics (like Moz’s DA or Ahrefs’ DR) with Google’s actual ranking factors. Explain in your link building reporting that these are useful comparative tools but not direct Google rankings factors. “All link building happens quickly.” Sustainable link building is a marathon, not a sprint. Educate stakeholders that quality link acquisition takes time and rushing typically leads to lower-quality links that deliver less long-term value. “Anchor text should always include keywords.” Excessive keyword-rich anchor text can appear manipulative. A diverse, natural-looking anchor text profile performs better long-term than one over-optimized for keywords. Related Topics for Further Exploration To deepen your link building expertise, consider exploring these related areas: Digital PR for Link Acquisition Public relations strategies increasingly overlap with link building. Techniques like data-driven stories, expert commentary, and newsworthy content can attract high-authority links from media outlets. Content-Driven Link Building Creating linkable assets—comprehensive guides, original research, or interactive tools—can generate passive link acquisition over time. This approach complements active outreach strategies. Technical SEO’s Impact on Link Equity How your site handles redirects, canonicalization, and internal linking directly affects how link equity flows through your site. Technical optimizations can maximize the value of your link building efforts. Competitive Link Analysis Techniques Advanced competitive analysis helps identify link gaps and opportunities. Learning to effectively analyze competitor backlink profiles can reveal valuable strategic insights. Local Link Building Strategies For businesses with physical locations, local link building techniques focused on community relationships and geographic relevance offer unique opportunities. For SEO agencies looking to enhance their link building services, staying current with these evolving topics helps maintain a competitive edge. Consider incorporating educational content about these areas in your client communications and link building reporting to demonstrate your ongoing expertise and value.

Link Building Strategies That Work Tools that Help in Link Building Link Building: A Case Study From Stan Ventures Link Building Tactics You Should Avoid Backlinks are a must-have to improve your online visibility, drive more web traffic and position your website at the top of search engine results. In short, backlinks come in handy when you want to increase the authority of your website in the eyes of search engine giants like Google. Search engines discover new content via links and also leverage them as a parameter to determine the content quality. So, how does that work? Google considers a high-quality contextual backlink as a vote of confidence that testifies how worthy the content is. That said, it isn’t a surprise that link building remains one of the crucial search engine ranking factors. A targeted strategy often makes things easier and link building is no exception. Yes, it doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or a pro, you need a definitive link building strategy in place to achieve significant results. If not, your link-building efforts may end up a disaster. Worry not! If you understand the what, why, how, dos and don’ts of link building, it isn’t tough to crack the hard nut. Let me walk you through link building and its aspects one step at a time. What is Link Building? Professional link building is the practice of gaining links from one or more websites to your own. These links help users navigate from one web page to the other to access more information relevant to their search on the internet. As for search engines, links make way for the bots to crawl, index, and rank web pages. Why is Link Building Important for SEO? Link building is one of the most powerful ways to get high-authority, niche-specific websites to vouch for your site. With an effective link acquisition strategy, you can build a bold and illustrative backlink profile. Based on the robustness of the link profile you create, your website can enamor Google’s algorithm and achieve higher rankings. Link building, despite all the rumor-mongering happening, is something you cannot overlook when optimizing your website for SEO. Spoiler Alert: Building a healthy link profile doesn’t happen overnight. White hat link building for SEO takes time, but it is always worth it. When you put in targeted and genuine efforts toward link building, it gets paid off with long-lasting results. That’s the gist of it. The concept of links is cardinal to how Google search works. Its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin came up with the beautiful concept of PageRank. PageRank algorithm helps Google identify new pages and rank them based on quality signals. So, what this means is that Google’s core algorithm weighs backlinks as one of the top-ranking factors, and ignoring it could bring a website’s growth to a standstill. How to Build Links? Now that you know how link building can complement your website’s SEO, it’s time to learn how to build links. So, let’s delve into it. Broadly speaking, link building happens in three ways: 1. Requesting for Links Do you want to link back to your website from a specific website? The best thing to do is request the website owner for a backlink. However, you need to make sure that linking back to the website fetches you benefits in terms of web traffic and authority. Here’s what you need to remember. The website has to be related to your industry/niche. The website should be credible and exhibit great performance. Craft a genuinely compelling email pitch to convenience the website owner to accept a backlink placement to your website. 2. Earning Links Earning links is when other website owners link back to your website without you contacting them regarding backlinks. This often happens when you feature high-quality, user-engaging content on your website that your target audience and industry experts find useful. As per Google Webmaster Guidelines, “Creating good content pays off: Links are usually editorial votes given by choice, and the more useful content you have, the greater the chances someone else will find that content valuable to their readers and link to it.” Earning backlinks to your website is the biggest reward and a clear sign that your link-building efforts are actually working. 3. Buying Links Buying links is yet another way to secure link placements in top-performing sites. When it comes to buying backlinks, you need to be quite choosy about the sites you pick as you are investing some money to make more of it. Make sure you follow a metric-specific approach to narrow down top sites from your niche to build backlinks. Once that’s done, get in touch with the website owner with a well-crafted email to gain backlink placements on a commercial basis. If you find the process time-consuming, you can avail the assistance of a trusted link-building service provider to purchase links from relevant sites on your behalf. Key Elements to Evaluate Link Prospects Before thinking about how to find backlink placements, you need to narrow down sites that suit your link building needs. That’s why you should consider the following elements related to host sites when you invest in link building for SEO. Content: Written and visual content for blogs, web pages, etc. Admin: Do they have advertising policies in place? Link Profile: What do the links pointing to the site look like? Reputation: Does the author have any reputation? Authorship: Who is responsible for the website content? Technical: How do users find and engage with the site? In addition to these metrics, you need to conduct your own manual research and backlink quality analysis to get an even deeper understanding of your link-building prospects. Metric Vs. Quality Understanding metrics and quality can help you set up link-building success. Certain metrics from top SEO tools can help evaluate a site for link-building prospects much easier. They are: Ahrefs Domain Rating. Moz Page Authority. Moz Domain Authority. Moz Page Authority. Majestic Trust Flow. Majestic Citation Flow. Majestic Trust Flow. SEMrushAuthority Score. Verve Link Score. In addition to these metrics, you need to conduct your own manual research to get an even deeper understanding of your link-building prospects. Quality The search quality raters guidelines by Google have dedicated a section for Overall Page Quality Rating that you can follow as well. It can help you cover the purpose of the content, the depth of the content, and find out credible sources for the content. How to Analyze a Site? As you go through the evaluation process, there are two important things to keep in mind: Weight Each Element Some aspects of the site are more important than others. Examine multiple elements that decide the site quality Here are the key elements to consider during the assessment: Content Commercial links: Check if there are links to money pages. Find whether links are not tagged with no follow or sponsor Navigation: Is it too generic for the site? Restricted Keywords: Check if the site uses gambling, payday loan, or pornographic keywords Infrequency: Does the website post infrequently, or are the old posts rarely updated? Admin About Us: Find if the links point to money pages Admin Pages: Find pages that directly advertise dofollow links in guest posts and avoid them at all costs Info: Phone number, address, and email Link Profile Excess links: See if too many links are pointing to a single page Low Authority: Find the site’s Domain Authority and Domain Rating using SEO tools Non-relevant links: Discover if there are links that don’t make sense for the page Authorship Byline: Is the byline set to the site name or the admin? Author Page Info: Is the information about the author incomplete? Nationality: Is the author from your target country or not? If you are dealing with YMYL pages, you have to be more stringent about the author’s reputation. Reputation Online presence: Does the website has a good social media presence Followers: What type of accounts are following the brand Engagement: Does the page have enough engagement? Technical Indexed: Does the website exist in Google’s index with more than just the home page? Geo: What is the focus of the audience’s country? Page Engagement: Does the site have ads and links within pages? Link Building Strategies That Work The strategy you devise is the major driving factor behind your link-building outcomes. So, here is a look at the top white hat link building strategies you can harness to achieve desired results. 1. Ultimate Guides Ultimate Guides usually cover in-depth information about a specific topic and comprise several subheadings, illustrations, and super-long content. Since Ultimate Guides provide users access to massive information in one place, they can be a go-to choice to earn backlinks. 2. Listicles Listicles or list posts are posts that feature a numbered list of facts, techniques, tips, reasons and so much more. Packed in chunks, these posts contain information that delivers value to the users. After analyzing 1 million pieces of content, BuzzSumo has arrived at the conclusion that list posts generate far more backlinks than other forms of content, including infographics, quizzes, and more. 3. Resource Page Link Building So, what are Resource Pages? Resource Pages are pages that contain a curated list of resources that solely link back to informative content from multiple websites. The more the number of backlinks on a page, the more authoritative it is. Resource page link building is a practice where you link back to your website from a resource page. Your chances of gaining link placements in resource pages depend heavily on the quality of your content. You can find resource pages easily by using the following Google search strings. “Keyword” + inurl:links “Keyword” + “helpful resources” “Keyword” + “useful resources” “Keyword” + “useful links” Let’s say your niche is medicine. You can use medicine in the keyword field followed by one of the above Google search strings. Once you have the resource pages, you need to find out if a particular resource page is suitable for your link-building purposes. Not everyone has the same link-building needs. You can use metrics such as page authority, domain authority, the web traffic of the page/domain to decide if a given resource page is the right fit for you. This will give you the ideal site for your resource page link-building process. Look for content that is worth linking back to from the resource page. Finally, draft an email stating how your content can be a valuable addition to the resource page and ask the website owner to link back to your site. 4. Broken Link Building Broken link building is a unique link building strategy. While other link building strategies are about asking people for backlinks, broken link building makes way for you to help add value to somebody’s website. So, how to get backlinks using this strategy? The first step is to identify broken links in a website. Install either Check My Links or LinkMiner chrome extension. Not sure which website to check for broken links? Pick a page with more links. If there are many links, it’s likely that one or more of them are broken. That’s the idea. A resource page from your niche should be the best fit. After all, it is fully loaded with links. You can use the Chrome extension to weed out broken links in the page easily. Finally, send the website owner a mail highlighting the broken links that you identified and suggest replacing the link with yours. 5. Guest Blogging Guest blogging is never out of trend. It is, of course, one of the classic link building methods. Use a search string such as “write for us” + keyword to find blogs and websites that currently accept guest posts in your niche. Run through the search results and shortlist the ones that are right for you. Use the contact form or email address to initiate a formal conversation asking for a guest post opportunity with backlink placement. Unfortunately, guest post opportunities aren’t available just for you but also for your competitors. Make sure you stand out from the crowd every step of the way. Getting professional assistance from a trusted guest blogging service provider can take the burden off your shoulders and help you achieve desired results to outperform the other players in your industry. 6. Blogger Outreach Blogger outreach is one of the best strategies to build your backlink profile. You would have received outreach emails too. Doubt that? Check the spam folder of your mailbox. You will likely find at least a few outreach emails in there, only that they failed to grab your attention. If you’re wondering why these emails are dropped straight into the spam box, it’s because they may not be relevant to you. Suppose you run a website that specializes in e-commerce. An email targeting finance experts and investors is certainly not your cup of tea. That’s why your outreach campaigns should be targeting the right people. Your link success depends on it as well. In fact, outreach emails witness a response rate of only 10%, while the other 90% of them go unanswered. Having said that, if you want your outreach emails answered, you need to keep yourself updated about the latest outreach techniques and master them. Are you still using standard/traditional email templates for your outreach purposes? If your answer is yes, then it’s high time to break away. Let me tell you how to switch to non-conventional email outreach. Draft 100% personalized and original emails. Leverage your unique brand voice. Apart from increasing the response rate for your outreach campaigns, these emails also help you create a positive outlook toward your brand. So, who do you start with? Trustworthiness is the lifeline of blogger outreach. Start with people who trust you and are already aware of your business. They may include Your industry partners. People who have subscribed to your newsletter. People who have mentioned your links or brand name in their content. Bloggers/influencers who are connected with you on social media. Who else do you reach out to? Look for people who share something in common with you. For instance, you can reach out to bloggers who share a similar customer base. Link placement in niche-specific blogs can drive qualified leads and help you achieve more tractions for your business. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and others are also ideal to find people whose interests are similar to yours. Do you think outreach is eating up too much of your time? That’s why Stan Ventures shortlists sites based on 25+ link building metrics and offers a genuine blogger outreach service to help you earn high-quality backlinks seamlessly. 7. Unlinked Brand Mentions Every business gets its brand mentioned somewhere on the internet. These brand mentions need not necessarily be linked back to the corresponding website. Why not use your unlinked brand mentions to your link-building advantage? Yes, you can translate unlinked brand mentions to gain backlink placements across websites with minimal effort in the right direction. Use a brand monitoring tool like Semrush to keep track of your brand mentions across the internet. Once you find people who have mentioned your brand name in their web space, reach out to them and ask for backlink placements. However, you need to ensure that these links add value to the visitors of the corresponding domain. That way, the link juice is rightly passed on, having a positive impact on your website’s authority. 8. Podcast Links Links are everywhere. You just need to have a keen eye for them. What if I told you you could get backlinks without writing content or initiating outreach campaigns? It’s definitely possible. All it takes is one word: Podcasts. You just have to show up and talk about things you know and you get a link just like that. A podcast can be about anything, as long as it adds value to the listeners. Talk about something your target audience wants to learn and you get the job done without lifting your finger. 9. HARO Links HARO or Help A Reporter Out is an ideal place for you to connect with big shots from high authority, trusted websites. Once you sign up, you start receiving emails on a daily basis. Set a time frame, say, 30 to 45 minutes every day and look for queries within your expertise and respond to them. If your answer gets featured, you get a link placement on a high-authority website. It isn’t a sure-shot that your answers will be cited, but when it happens, the impact will be high. That’s how HARO links bolster your SEO efforts. 10. Infographic & Image Link Building Visual assets such as infographics, images, and diagrams make way for seamless link building. They present huge chunks of information in a comprehensive way. Users are fond of visual assets as well. So, how do infographics and images simplify link building? Let’s say you include a graph or chart on one of your web pages. Every time someone shares the graph, you automatically get a link from their website to your own. From this standpoint, visual assets hold greater good for link building than text-based content. 11. Getting competitor’s links using tools like AHREFs Link Intersect feature Did you know your competitors can help you strengthen your backlink profile? Here’s how: If a website links back to one or more of your competitors, chances are they can link back to your site. So, how do you find these sites that link back to your competitors? Ahrefs Link Intersect tool can simplify the process for you. Enter a few of your major competitors in the tool. Choose “all of the below targets” -> Show link opportunities. You will see a list of websites that all of them link back to. Check them out to find the best fit for building links. Make sure you pick sites where your potential prospects are likely to hang out. That’s precisely where you should establish your presence. Is that it? Not yet. I’ll tell you another way to refine your search for domains that link back to your competitors. Link Intersect -> Enter domains -> Click “any of the below targets” -> Show link opportunities. Now, you will get more results based on the number of intersects. Shortlist the websites you are going to contact for link-building opportunities. 12. Content Promotion Creating link-worthy content is important. However, you cannot stop there, especially if your aim is to create a great link profile. People should be able to discover your web pages in order to link back to them. That’s exactly why content promotion is mandatory. So, how do you promote your content? Advertising Outreach Communities/ Forums Advertising Invest in platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and others to improve the visibility of your content. The more the visibility, the greater the chances of someone showing interest to link back to your content. Well-written content can fetch you multiple backlinks in the long run. Investing a small sum of money to advertise your content isn’t a problem when it can fetch you more links and grow your business, right? Outreach Advertising is, of course, a good way to promote your content. Even so, reaching out to people with an email pitch makes the process sound more formal. Also, when it comes to content promotion via outreach, you add more value to the recipients of your mail and their target audience (who are your prospects too). If you can convince the website owners that linking back to your content fetches mutual benefits, it is a win-win scenario. Communities/ Forums You have niche-specific forum sites where you can promote your content among your target audience. Social media groups and communities are also good places for content promotion. However, it isn’t as easy as joining a forum and dropping your content links just like that. You need to become an active member and take part in discussions that happen there. Once you have built a reputation for yourself among the forum members, you can post your content in the community. If the audiences find the content good enough, they will link back to it. Remember, you must not post links in the group every time you publish new content. Doing it frequently can annoy people and they might not check out your content at all. Make your moves wisely when promoting your content across communities. 13. Reverse Image Search Is someone using your visual asset without your knowledge? Don’t worry. I look at it as an opportunity rather than a problem. What if you can use the scenario to build a backlink while fixing the copyright breach? Reverse image search is the key. Reverse image search refers to the practice of searching for all indexed URLs across the internet containing the same or similar image. You can perform a reverse image search using Google Images or Bing Images. Alternatively, you can do it directly from Chrome. So, how do you harness reverse image search to build backlinks? Most website owners do not want to remove copied images because it delivers value to their users. That said, it is a cakewalk to secure a backlink from their website through the image. All you have to do is send them a friendly email asking for a backlink in return. 14. Skyscraper Technique Have you ever thought about creating something better than the top-performing content in your niche? That’s the root of the skyscraper technique. This technique emphasizes improvising on the top-performing content with a great number of backlinks. You do that to steal your competitor’s backlinks so that you can drive more traffic to your website and skyrocket your search engine ranking, all by creating a more enhanced version of the existing content. The first step is to identify the best-performing content loaded with backlinks. Perform a Google search with a broad keyword for top-ranked content and analyze it for backlinks using tools like Ahrefs. The next thing is to create an improved version of the content. Here’s what you should do. Increase the length of the content Add updated information and relevant images Implement a simple and appealing design Provide in-depth information about the topic Once you have created your version of the content, it’s time for email outreach. Now, let’s do some smart work. Instead of reaching out to random bloggers, contact people who have already linked to the content. As they’ve linked to similar content, the chances of them linking to your content are high. That’s the idea. 15. Internal Linking Strategy Link building isn’t just about linking from or to other sites. It is also about linking pages within your website. So, why is internal link building crucial? Your visitors are your top priority. A bad user experience can drive them away as soon as they come in. This includes increased bounce rate and a higher bounce rate, which are a threat to your website’s SEO. The smoother the user experience, the longer the time they spend on your website. With channelized internal link building, you help your visitors navigate across your web pages seamlessly while offering a promising user experience. Your users aren’t the only ones navigating across your site. Search engine spiders do the same and when you link internal pages, you make way for them to understand the context better and rank pages higher. The more the internal links directing to a particular web page, the more important the page is in the eyes of the search engine bots. Tools that Help in Link Building As you know, link building is a time-consuming process. However, the results are long-lasting if done right. Your link-building toolkit is your magic wand.

Link Building: A Case Study From Stan Ventures Actions speak better than words. Let me give you a practical example of how we helped one of our clients rank #1 in SERPs in just 2 weeks. Kitchenroom, a UK-based website offering fitted kitchen services, found it difficult to generate organic traffic despite having a great website with unique content and being in business since 2017. Jason, the founder of Kitchenroom, wanted more prospects across Oxfordshire to contact him and also needed to rank on top of the search. Our SEOs rolled up their sleeves to figure out the challenges we will meet going forward. The major challenge we faced was that some of the client’s competitors had a robust online presence with 10x more referring domains compared to Kitchenroom. On the other hand, Kitchenroom was lagging behind in terms of authority due to fewer backlinks. After a thorough competitor analysis, we found that even though the competitors leveraged backlinks to stay at the top of the search, those links lacked authority. And that was our trump card. We figured out that building high-quality backlinks through genuine blogger outreach will help the client’s website rank higher. Proceeding further, our outreach experts started contacting niche-specific bloggers to ensure link placements for Kitchenroom on relevant sites. Once the sites were narrowed down and approved by Jason, our native content writers produced content with the anchor text placed naturally. We shared the content with the bloggers and received the live link shortly. Within two weeks, Jason started receiving more calls while the original traffic was going up. The keywords we wanted Kitchenroom to rank for were in the top 3 positions and the overall traffic of the site increased by 79%. Here’s a look at the numbers. Traffic – 387 +40% Keywords – 111 +107% Traffic Value – $739 +3X Link Building Tactics You Should Avoid It isn’t always about knowing the dos. You also need to know the don’ts so that you dodge or unlearn them in time. This holds true for link building as well. Let me pinpoint some black hat practices you should avoid in the course of your link-building journey. Paying for Links Paid link building manipulates search engine algorithms and is clearly a violation of Google’s webmaster guidelines. So, you may end up with a penalty and that’s very risky. A majority of paid links come from sites with a lot of outbound links and are naturally of low quality. Again, low-quality links can negatively impact your SEO. If you purchase paid links to outdo your competitors, remember they can buy links too. In that case, your investment may bear no fruit. However, if paid marketing isn’t the chief focus for your SEO strategy or if you want to buy links just to boost your brand authority, you can opt for paid links. Remember to include rel=“nofollow” or rel=“sponsored” attributes to your paid links so that they don’t affect your website’s SEO. If you leverage paid links purely to boost your search engine rankings, it is, of course, a red flag. Unnatural Links Are you placing links just because you want to increase your backlink count and rank higher on searches? Don’t do that. The tactic can backfire on you. Low-quality, unnatural backlinks are enlisted as spammy links and you may face a penalty for the same. That said, your backlink has to add value to the users and the website. It should either drive users to a relevant source of information or allow search engine crawlers to comprehend the context better. Want to dig deeper? Check out our extensive blog post covering how to check backlink quality in detail PBN Links Private blog networks (PBN) intend to create lots of links from a cluster of websites (often with no authority) to a money-making website. This is done to pass link juice to the money-making site and improve its ranking unethically. Google hates PBN as it tricks the search engine algorithm into ranking a site higher using unfair means. If you use a PBN to get your site ranked better, the whole strategy will collapse when Google finds and imposes a penalty upon it. Wrapping Up Link building is a consistent process and you can never expect to arrive at a dead-end. While it may seem like demanding more effort than any other SEO strategy, the reward is huge and lasts in the long run. Once you achieve success in link building for SEO, your site will already be generating considerable organic traffic. Then, you may not be required to put in as much effort as you did initially. After all, you don’t have to start from scratch every time. All you need to do is maintain your website’s standard while featuring user-focused content and keeping a constant eye on search engine algorithm updates. Link building is an ocean and I have touched upon all possible aspects of it to give you a 360-degree view of it. Hopefully, all your link building questions have been answered. Stay tuned for more.

Link Building Strategies That Work Tools that Help in Link Building Link Building: A Case Study From Stan Ventures Link Building Tactics You Should Avoid Backlinks are a must-have to improve your online visibility, drive more web traffic and position your website at the top of search engine results. In short, backlinks come in handy when you want to increase the authority of your website in the eyes of search engine giants like Google. Search engines discover new content via links and also leverage them as a parameter to determine the content quality. So, how does that work? Google considers a high-quality contextual backlink as a vote of confidence that testifies how worthy the content is. That said, it isn’t a surprise that link building remains one of the crucial search engine ranking factors. A targeted strategy often makes things easier and link building is no exception. Yes, it doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or a pro, you need a definitive link building strategy in place to achieve significant results. If not, your link-building efforts may end up a disaster. Worry not! If you understand the what, why, how, dos and don’ts of link building, it isn’t tough to crack the hard nut. Let me walk you through link building and its aspects one step at a time. What is Link Building? Professional link building is the practice of gaining links from one or more websites to your own. These links help users navigate from one web page to the other to access more information relevant to their search on the internet. As for search engines, links make way for the bots to crawl, index, and rank web pages. Why is Link Building Important for SEO? Link building is one of the most powerful ways to get high-authority, niche-specific websites to vouch for your site. With an effective link acquisition strategy, you can build a bold and illustrative backlink profile. Based on the robustness of the link profile you create, your website can enamor Google’s algorithm and achieve higher rankings. Link building, despite all the rumor-mongering happening, is something you cannot overlook when optimizing your website for SEO. Spoiler Alert: Building a healthy link profile doesn’t happen overnight. White hat link building for SEO takes time, but it is always worth it. When you put in targeted and genuine efforts toward link building, it gets paid off with long-lasting results. That’s the gist of it. The concept of links is cardinal to how Google search works. Its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin came up with the beautiful concept of PageRank. PageRank algorithm helps Google identify new pages and rank them based on quality signals. So, what this means is that Google’s core algorithm weighs backlinks as one of the top-ranking factors, and ignoring it could bring a website’s growth to a standstill. How to Build Links? Now that you know how link building can complement your website’s SEO, it’s time to learn how to build links. So, let’s delve into it. Broadly speaking, link building happens in three ways: 1. Requesting for Links Do you want to link back to your website from a specific website? The best thing to do is request the website owner for a backlink. However, you need to make sure that linking back to the website fetches you benefits in terms of web traffic and authority. Here’s what you need to remember. The website has to be related to your industry/niche. The website should be credible and exhibit great performance. Craft a genuinely compelling email pitch to convenience the website owner to accept a backlink placement to your website. 2. Earning Links Earning links is when other website owners link back to your website without you contacting them regarding backlinks. This often happens when you feature high-quality, user-engaging content on your website that your target audience and industry experts find useful. As per Google Webmaster Guidelines, “Creating good content pays off: Links are usually editorial votes given by choice, and the more useful content you have, the greater the chances someone else will find that content valuable to their readers and link to it.” Earning backlinks to your website is the biggest reward and a clear sign that your link-building efforts are actually working. 3. Buying Links Buying links is yet another way to secure link placements in top-performing sites. When it comes to buying backlinks, you need to be quite choosy about the sites you pick as you are investing some money to make more of it. Make sure you follow a metric-specific approach to narrow down top sites from your niche to build backlinks. Once that’s done, get in touch with the website owner with a well-crafted email to gain backlink placements on a commercial basis. If you find the process time-consuming, you can avail the assistance of a trusted link-building service provider to purchase links from relevant sites on your behalf. Key Elements to Evaluate Link Prospects Before thinking about how to find backlink placements, you need to narrow down sites that suit your link building needs. That’s why you should consider the following elements related to host sites when you invest in link building for SEO. Content: Written and visual content for blogs, web pages, etc. Admin: Do they have advertising policies in place? Link Profile: What do the links pointing to the site look like? Reputation: Does the author have any reputation? Authorship: Who is responsible for the website content? Technical: How do users find and engage with the site? In addition to these metrics, you need to conduct your own manual research and backlink quality analysis to get an even deeper understanding of your link-building prospects. Metric Vs. Quality Understanding metrics and quality can help you set up link-building success. Certain metrics from top SEO tools can help evaluate a site for link-building prospects much easier. They are: Ahrefs Domain Rating. Moz Page Authority. Moz Domain Authority. Moz Page Authority. Majestic Trust Flow. Majestic Citation Flow. Majestic Trust Flow. SEMrushAuthority Score. Verve Link Score. In addition to these metrics, you need to conduct your own manual research to get an even deeper understanding of your link-building prospects. Quality The search quality raters guidelines by Google have dedicated a section for Overall Page Quality Rating that you can follow as well. It can help you cover the purpose of the content, the depth of the content, and find out credible sources for the content. How to Analyze a Site? As you go through the evaluation process, there are two important things to keep in mind: Weight Each Element Some aspects of the site are more important than others. Examine multiple elements that decide the site quality Here are the key elements to consider during the assessment: Content Commercial links: Check if there are links to money pages. Find whether links are not tagged with no follow or sponsor Navigation: Is it too generic for the site? Restricted Keywords: Check if the site uses gambling, payday loan, or pornographic keywords Infrequency: Does the website post infrequently, or are the old posts rarely updated? Admin About Us: Find if the links point to money pages Admin Pages: Find pages that directly advertise dofollow links in guest posts and avoid them at all costs Info: Phone number, address, and email Link Profile Excess links: See if too many links are pointing to a single page Low Authority: Find the site’s Domain Authority and Domain Rating using SEO tools Non-relevant links: Discover if there are links that don’t make sense for the page Authorship Byline: Is the byline set to the site name or the admin? Author Page Info: Is the information about the author incomplete? Nationality: Is the author from your target country or not? If you are dealing with YMYL pages, you have to be more stringent about the author’s reputation. Reputation Online presence: Does the website has a good social media presence Followers: What type of accounts are following the brand Engagement: Does the page have enough engagement? Technical Indexed: Does the website exist in Google’s index with more than just the home page? Geo: What is the focus of the audience’s country? Page Engagement: Does the site have ads and links within pages? Link Building Strategies That Work The strategy you devise is the major driving factor behind your link-building outcomes. So, here is a look at the top white hat link building strategies you can harness to achieve desired results. 1. Ultimate Guides Ultimate Guides usually cover in-depth information about a specific topic and comprise several subheadings, illustrations, and super-long content. Since Ultimate Guides provide users access to massive information in one place, they can be a go-to choice to earn backlinks. 2. Listicles Listicles or list posts are posts that feature a numbered list of facts, techniques, tips, reasons and so much more. Packed in chunks, these posts contain information that delivers value to the users. After analyzing 1 million pieces of content, BuzzSumo has arrived at the conclusion that list posts generate far more backlinks than other forms of content, including infographics, quizzes, and more. 3. Resource Page Link Building So, what are Resource Pages? Resource Pages are pages that contain a curated list of resources that solely link back to informative content from multiple websites. The more the number of backlinks on a page, the more authoritative it is. Resource page link building is a practice where you link back to your website from a resource page. Your chances of gaining link placements in resource pages depend heavily on the quality of your content. You can find resource pages easily by using the following Google search strings. “Keyword” + inurl:links “Keyword” + “helpful resources” “Keyword” + “useful resources” “Keyword” + “useful links” Let’s say your niche is medicine. You can use medicine in the keyword field followed by one of the above Google search strings. Once you have the resource pages, you need to find out if a particular resource page is suitable for your link-building purposes. Not everyone has the same link-building needs. You can use metrics such as page authority, domain authority, the web traffic of the page/domain to decide if a given resource page is the right fit for you. This will give you the ideal site for your resource page link-building process. Look for content that is worth linking back to from the resource page. Finally, draft an email stating how your content can be a valuable addition to the resource page and ask the website owner to link back to your site. 4. Broken Link Building Broken link building is a unique link building strategy. While other link building strategies are about asking people for backlinks, broken link building makes way for you to help add value to somebody’s website. So, how to get backlinks using this strategy? The first step is to identify broken links in a website. Install either Check My Links or LinkMiner chrome extension. Not sure which website to check for broken links? Pick a page with more links. If there are many links, it’s likely that one or more of them are broken. That’s the idea. A resource page from your niche should be the best fit. After all, it is fully loaded with links. You can use the Chrome extension to weed out broken links in the page easily. Finally, send the website owner a mail highlighting the broken links that you identified and suggest replacing the link with yours. 5. Guest Blogging Guest blogging is never out of trend. It is, of course, one of the classic link building methods. Use a search string such as “write for us” + keyword to find blogs and websites that currently accept guest posts in your niche. Run through the search results and shortlist the ones that are right for you. Use the contact form or email address to initiate a formal conversation asking for a guest post opportunity with backlink placement. Unfortunately, guest post opportunities aren’t available just for you but also for your competitors. Make sure you stand out from the crowd every step of the way. Getting professional assistance from a trusted guest blogging service provider can take the burden off your shoulders and help you achieve desired results to outperform the other players in your industry. 6. Blogger Outreach Blogger outreach is one of the best strategies to build your backlink profile. You would have received outreach emails too. Doubt that? Check the spam folder of your mailbox. You will likely find at least a few outreach emails in there, only that they failed to grab your attention. If you’re wondering why these emails are dropped straight into the spam box, it’s because they may not be relevant to you. Suppose you run a website that specializes in e-commerce. An email targeting finance experts and investors is certainly not your cup of tea. That’s why your outreach campaigns should be targeting the right people. Your link success depends on it as well. In fact, outreach emails witness a response rate of only 10%, while the other 90% of them go unanswered. Having said that, if you want your outreach emails answered, you need to keep yourself updated about the latest outreach techniques and master them. Are you still using standard/traditional email templates for your outreach purposes? If your answer is yes, then it’s high time to break away. Let me tell you how to switch to non-conventional email outreach. Draft 100% personalized and original emails. Leverage your unique brand voice. Apart from increasing the response rate for your outreach campaigns, these emails also help you create a positive outlook toward your brand. So, who do you start with? Trustworthiness is the lifeline of blogger outreach. Start with people who trust you and are already aware of your business. They may include Your industry partners. People who have subscribed to your newsletter. People who have mentioned your links or brand name in their content. Bloggers/influencers who are connected with you on social media. Who else do you reach out to? Look for people who share something in common with you. For instance, you can reach out to bloggers who share a similar customer base. Link placement in niche-specific blogs can drive qualified leads and help you achieve more tractions for your business. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and others are also ideal to find people whose interests are similar to yours. Do you think outreach is eating up too much of your time? That’s why Stan Ventures shortlists sites based on 25+ link building metrics and offers a genuine blogger outreach service to help you earn high-quality backlinks seamlessly. 7. Unlinked Brand Mentions Every business gets its brand mentioned somewhere on the internet. These brand mentions need not necessarily be linked back to the corresponding website. Why not use your unlinked brand mentions to your link-building advantage? Yes, you can translate unlinked brand mentions to gain backlink placements across websites with minimal effort in the right direction. Use a brand monitoring tool like Semrush to keep track of your brand mentions across the internet. Once you find people who have mentioned your brand name in their web space, reach out to them and ask for backlink placements. However, you need to ensure that these links add value to the visitors of the corresponding domain. That way, the link juice is rightly passed on, having a positive impact on your website’s authority. 8. Podcast Links Links are everywhere. You just need to have a keen eye for them. What if I told you you could get backlinks without writing content or initiating outreach campaigns? It’s definitely possible. All it takes is one word: Podcasts. You just have to show up and talk about things you know and you get a link just like that. A podcast can be about anything, as long as it adds value to the listeners. Talk about something your target audience wants to learn and you get the job done without lifting your finger. 9. HARO Links HARO or Help A Reporter Out is an ideal place for you to connect with big shots from high authority, trusted websites. Once you sign up, you start receiving emails on a daily basis. Set a time frame, say, 30 to 45 minutes every day and look for queries within your expertise and respond to them. If your answer gets featured, you get a link placement on a high-authority website. It isn’t a sure-shot that your answers will be cited, but when it happens, the impact will be high. That’s how HARO links bolster your SEO efforts. 10. Infographic & Image Link Building Visual assets such as infographics, images, and diagrams make way for seamless link building. They present huge chunks of information in a comprehensive way. Users are fond of visual assets as well. So, how do infographics and images simplify link building? Let’s say you include a graph or chart on one of your web pages. Every time someone shares the graph, you automatically get a link from their website to your own. From this standpoint, visual assets hold greater good for link building than text-based content. 11. Getting competitor’s links using tools like AHREFs Link Intersect feature Did you know your competitors can help you strengthen your backlink profile? Here’s how: If a website links back to one or more of your competitors, chances are they can link back to your site. So, how do you find these sites that link back to your competitors? Ahrefs Link Intersect tool can simplify the process for you. Enter a few of your major competitors in the tool. Choose “all of the below targets” -> Show link opportunities. You will see a list of websites that all of them link back to. Check them out to find the best fit for building links. Make sure you pick sites where your potential prospects are likely to hang out. That’s precisely where you should establish your presence. Is that it? Not yet. I’ll tell you another way to refine your search for domains that link back to your competitors. Link Intersect -> Enter domains -> Click “any of the below targets” -> Show link opportunities. Now, you will get more results based on the number of intersects. Shortlist the websites you are going to contact for link-building opportunities. 12. Content Promotion Creating link-worthy content is important. However, you cannot stop there, especially if your aim is to create a great link profile. People should be able to discover your web pages in order to link back to them. That’s exactly why content promotion is mandatory. So, how do you promote your content? Advertising Outreach Communities/ Forums Advertising Invest in platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and others to improve the visibility of your content. The more the visibility, the greater the chances of someone showing interest to link back to your content. Well-written content can fetch you multiple backlinks in the long run. Investing a small sum of money to advertise your content isn’t a problem when it can fetch you more links and grow your business, right? Outreach Advertising is, of course, a good way to promote your content. Even so, reaching out to people with an email pitch makes the process sound more formal. Also, when it comes to content promotion via outreach, you add more value to the recipients of your mail and their target audience (who are your prospects too). If you can convince the website owners that linking back to your content fetches mutual benefits, it is a win-win scenario. Communities/ Forums You have niche-specific forum sites where you can promote your content among your target audience. Social media groups and communities are also good places for content promotion. However, it isn’t as easy as joining a forum and dropping your content links just like that. You need to become an active member and take part in discussions that happen there. Once you have built a reputation for yourself among the forum members, you can post your content in the community. If the audiences find the content good enough, they will link back to it. Remember, you must not post links in the group every time you publish new content. Doing it frequently can annoy people and they might not check out your content at all. Make your moves wisely when promoting your content across communities. 13. Reverse Image Search Is someone using your visual asset without your knowledge? Don’t worry. I look at it as an opportunity rather than a problem. What if you can use the scenario to build a backlink while fixing the copyright breach? Reverse image search is the key. Reverse image search refers to the practice of searching for all indexed URLs across the internet containing the same or similar image. You can perform a reverse image search using Google Images or Bing Images. Alternatively, you can do it directly from Chrome. So, how do you harness reverse image search to build backlinks? Most website owners do not want to remove copied images because it delivers value to their users. That said, it is a cakewalk to secure a backlink from their website through the image. All you have to do is send them a friendly email asking for a backlink in return. 14. Skyscraper Technique Have you ever thought about creating something better than the top-performing content in your niche? That’s the root of the skyscraper technique. This technique emphasizes improvising on the top-performing content with a great number of backlinks. You do that to steal your competitor’s backlinks so that you can drive more traffic to your website and skyrocket your search engine ranking, all by creating a more enhanced version of the existing content. The first step is to identify the best-performing content loaded with backlinks. Perform a Google search with a broad keyword for top-ranked content and analyze it for backlinks using tools like Ahrefs. The next thing is to create an improved version of the content. Here’s what you should do. Increase the length of the content Add updated information and relevant images Implement a simple and appealing design Provide in-depth information about the topic Once you have created your version of the content, it’s time for email outreach. Now, let’s do some smart work. Instead of reaching out to random bloggers, contact people who have already linked to the content. As they’ve linked to similar content, the chances of them linking to your content are high. That’s the idea. 15. Internal Linking Strategy Link building isn’t just about linking from or to other sites. It is also about linking pages within your website. So, why is internal link building crucial? Your visitors are your top priority. A bad user experience can drive them away as soon as they come in. This includes increased bounce rate and a higher bounce rate, which are a threat to your website’s SEO. The smoother the user experience, the longer the time they spend on your website. With channelized internal link building, you help your visitors navigate across your web pages seamlessly while offering a promising user experience. Your users aren’t the only ones navigating across your site. Search engine spiders do the same and when you link internal pages, you make way for them to understand the context better and rank pages higher. The more the internal links directing to a particular web page, the more important the page is in the eyes of the search engine bots. Tools that Help in Link Building As you know, link building is a time-consuming process. However, the results are long-lasting if done right. Your link-building toolkit is your magic wand.

Link Building: A Case Study From Stan Ventures Actions speak better than words. Let me give you a practical example of how we helped one of our clients rank #1 in SERPs in just 2 weeks. Kitchenroom, a UK-based website offering fitted kitchen services, found it difficult to generate organic traffic despite having a great website with unique content and being in business since 2017. Jason, the founder of Kitchenroom, wanted more prospects across Oxfordshire to contact him and also needed to rank on top of the search. Our SEOs rolled up their sleeves to figure out the challenges we will meet going forward. The major challenge we faced was that some of the client’s competitors had a robust online presence with 10x more referring domains compared to Kitchenroom. On the other hand, Kitchenroom was lagging behind in terms of authority due to fewer backlinks. After a thorough competitor analysis, we found that even though the competitors leveraged backlinks to stay at the top of the search, those links lacked authority. And that was our trump card. We figured out that building high-quality backlinks through genuine blogger outreach will help the client’s website rank higher. Proceeding further, our outreach experts started contacting niche-specific bloggers to ensure link placements for Kitchenroom on relevant sites. Once the sites were narrowed down and approved by Jason, our native content writers produced content with the anchor text placed naturally. We shared the content with the bloggers and received the live link shortly. Within two weeks, Jason started receiving more calls while the original traffic was going up. The keywords we wanted Kitchenroom to rank for were in the top 3 positions and the overall traffic of the site increased by 79%. Here’s a look at the numbers. Traffic – 387 +40% Keywords – 111 +107% Traffic Value – $739 +3X Link Building Tactics You Should Avoid It isn’t always about knowing the dos. You also need to know the don’ts so that you dodge or unlearn them in time. This holds true for link building as well. Let me pinpoint some black hat practices you should avoid in the course of your link-building journey. Paying for Links Paid link building manipulates search engine algorithms and is clearly a violation of Google’s webmaster guidelines. So, you may end up with a penalty and that’s very risky. A majority of paid links come from sites with a lot of outbound links and are naturally of low quality. Again, low-quality links can negatively impact your SEO. If you purchase paid links to outdo your competitors, remember they can buy links too. In that case, your investment may bear no fruit. However, if paid marketing isn’t the chief focus for your SEO strategy or if you want to buy links just to boost your brand authority, you can opt for paid links. Remember to include rel=“nofollow” or rel=“sponsored” attributes to your paid links so that they don’t affect your website’s SEO. If you leverage paid links purely to boost your search engine rankings, it is, of course, a red flag. Unnatural Links Are you placing links just because you want to increase your backlink count and rank higher on searches? Don’t do that. The tactic can backfire on you. Low-quality, unnatural backlinks are enlisted as spammy links and you may face a penalty for the same. That said, your backlink has to add value to the users and the website. It should either drive users to a relevant source of information or allow search engine crawlers to comprehend the context better. Want to dig deeper? Check out our extensive blog post covering how to check backlink quality in detail PBN Links Private blog networks (PBN) intend to create lots of links from a cluster of websites (often with no authority) to a money-making website. This is done to pass link juice to the money-making site and improve its ranking unethically. Google hates PBN as it tricks the search engine algorithm into ranking a site higher using unfair means. If you use a PBN to get your site ranked better, the whole strategy will collapse when Google finds and imposes a penalty upon it. Wrapping Up Link building is a consistent process and you can never expect to arrive at a dead-end. While it may seem like demanding more effort than any other SEO strategy, the reward is huge and lasts in the long run. Once you achieve success in link building for SEO, your site will already be generating considerable organic traffic. Then, you may not be required to put in as much effort as you did initially. After all, you don’t have to start from scratch every time. All you need to do is maintain your website’s standard while featuring user-focused content and keeping a constant eye on search engine algorithm updates. Link building is an ocean and I have touched upon all possible aspects of it to give you a 360-degree view of it. Hopefully, all your link building questions have been answered. Stay tuned for more.

You got it? The world of backlinks is wild, my friend. Picture me sitting in a dimly lit diner, channeling all my energy into this rant. Buckle up because we’re hitting this topic from both ends.Listen, backlinks are like oxygen for your website. Without them, you’re gasping for air, stuck in the depths of page two (or worse) of search results. It’s not just about climbing that SEO ladder; it’s about building a reputation, establishing your presence, and doing it all ethically. We’re ripping past the fluff and getting into the raw shit about creating content that genuinely offers value—not just jargon-filled pages chasing the latest SEO trend.This isn’t a game of manipulation or shortcuts. Trust me, I've been there and done that, and it blew up in my face harder than my cousin Tony’s epic paint mishap! That dude thought he was some kind of Picasso and trashed his whole setup with paint everywhere when he tried to DIY. I’d swear, I didn’t think it was possible to mess up so badly. Paint on the ceiling? Yeah, that happened.But Tony’s moment of chaos taught me something vital. If you don’t take the time to lay down a solid foundation, the entire structure can come crashing down in a colorful frenzy of regret. Same goes for your website; if you’re not building those backlinks ethically, you’ll be cleaning up a mess you didn’t even see coming.Now, let’s strap in because it’s a rollercoaster—here’s the full damn ride…Why Quick Fixes Aren’t EnoughLet’s hit the ground running. Quick fixes are like a sugar rush; they feel great for a hot minute but leave you crashing hard. Picture my buddy Tony again, who started that eco-friendly paint company. Dude went viral",
