For free. Start free trial Selling products online can be done through numerous specialized and general marketplaces, each with their own opportunities and fees. Building your own online store gives you more control and higher profit potential, free from fees and restrictions imposed by other platforms. Shopify is highlighted as an accessible platform for creating your own store, where you can also integrate sales across various marketplaces and social media channels. The main takeaway is to use a combination of marketplaces for exposure and your own store for brand growth and profitability. There are hundreds of places to sell things online. Some selling sites are focused on specific niches, like video games or tech. Other marketplaces let retailers sell anything from clothing to books to furniture and beyond. While there are many benefits to selling through online marketplaces, it‚Äôs important to consider factors such as selling fees when deciding where to list your items. Ahead, find links to the most popular online selling sites, the benefits of starting your own online store, and how using both approaches can boost your sales. Building your own store The Dawn theme in the Shopify store editor. Starting an online store can be rewarding and, when done right, bring in more profit than is possible with a marketplace. When you run an ecommerce store, you don‚Äôt pay fees on each sale or have to follow another website's rules. Shopify is the easiest way to create your own store. As an ecommerce platform, Shopify helps sellers get up and running at a low cost, with no tech skills required. Creating a store with Shopify is simple thanks to more 100 pre-built website templates. Each store comes with a checkout, SSL security certifications, and beginner-friendly marketing tools. You can sell on your website, across marketplaces like Amazon and eBay, and on social media‚Äîand manage everything from your Shopify dashboard. Set up your store to start selling today. Top websites to sell products online in 2025 eBay Bonanza Ruby Lane Etsy Chairish Swappa Poshmark Decluttr Amazon eBay eBay introduced online selling to users and continues to lead the market. eBay is one of the original destinations for people who want to sell merchandise online, having been around since 1995‚Äîand it‚Äôs still thriving. The marketplace has over two billion listings and 133 million active buyers worldwide. You can sell anything on eBay, from everyday items like shoes and watches to weird stuff (yes, that‚Äôs a product category) like popcorn-scented pillows, bottles of air, and vintage ‚Äô70s giant-hand chairs. There‚Äôs a continuous flow of motivated customers and easy ways to integrate eBay as an additional sales channel for your online store. eBay fees If you plan to sell on eBay, take the online selling site‚Äôs fees into consideration. It charges a non-refundable listing fee for each product and another insertion fee if you list the same items in two different categories. It also charges a final value fee (usually between 10% and 15%), calculated as a percentage of the total amount of the sale, including any shipping costs and handling charges. Bonanza Bonanza is a newer online selling site based out of Seattle. Bonanza is an online selling site that‚Äôs growing in popularity as an eBay alternative. You can sell pretty much anything on the platform, and it receives nearly 1.5 million monthly visits to its website. Think of Bonanza as the middle ground between the online selling sites Amazon and eBay. There are more unique and handmade items for sale on Bonanza than on eBay, but fewer branded names than on Amazon. For example, you can sell the latest Nike Air Max model or a handmade copper necklace and find active buyers for each. Buyers can add products to their cart for a set price or negotiate an offer with you through the platform. Bonanza fees Bonanza charges you nothing to list your products on its site. It takes only a small percentage of your final sale price after you sell. And since many Bonanza sellers also have their own online stores, you can integrate Bonanza with platforms like Shopify to manage and sell products more easily. Ruby Lane Ruby Lane is a place to connect with passionate buyers. Ruby Lane is an online marketplace for vintage and antiques. Selling on Ruby Lane gives you access to highly targeted buyers for categories like antiques and collectibles, vintage and art, dolls, and jewelry. Whether you‚Äôre an antiques and collectibles store owner or just want online selling sites, Ruby Lane is a good place to connect with passionate buyers. Ruby Lane fees Fees and payments for Ruby Lane are straightforward. It‚Äôs free to set up and list your products. But you need to pay a monthly maintenance fee of $45. In addition, Ruby Lane charges a 9.9% service fee based on total purchase order, which is capped at $2,500. Etsy Etsy includes tools to help market your business on the platform. Etsy is a selling site for handcrafted and vintage items. In 2015, it began including maker-developed manufactured goods, but only for select accounts on the marketplace. Currently, there are over 96 million active buyers on Etsy, making it a potentially lucrative way to start selling online. If you‚Äôre new to online selling sites, Etsy provides access to an active buyer network, a pop-up storefront, and tools to help market your business on the platform. Etsy fees You‚Äôll be charged a $0.20 listing fee for each item you sell on Etsy. Listings expire every four months. So if your item doesn‚Äôt sell and you renew the listing, you‚Äôll be charged an additional additional $0.20. When you make a sale, you‚Äôll be charged a transaction fee of 6.5% of the display price, plus the amount you charge for shipping and gift wrapping. Find the most popular Etsy alternatives. Chairish Chairish can help you connect with collectors to make more sales online. Chairish is an online consignment shop made for high-quality home decor and furniture. It takes minutes to list an item (for free), and depending on your seller plan, between 70% and 80% of the selling price goes back to you. If you have design-oriented furniture or home decor to sell online, this is a relevant online selling site. It can quickly land your business in front of ideal customers. Chairish fees Chairish has free and paid plans, with differing commission rates depending on product type and plan tier. When you list your items, Chairish‚Äôs curatorial team reviews your listings to ensure they meet the marketplace‚Äôs standards. They also handle shipping, so you never have to worry about logistics when selling on Chairish. Swappa Swappa vets all products that get sold on the marketplace. Got an old iPhone sitting around that you want to get rid of? Or a Nintendo Switch you don‚Äôt use much anymore? Turn your tech into cash on Swappa, a buy-and-sell website for phones, laptops, cameras, and more. Swappa vets all the products that get sold on its marketplace, so everything you submit must be in good working condition. Payments are protected by PayPal. Swappa fees There are no fees to create a listing, but you can choose to have your items featured for $5. When you make a sale, you pay a 3% fee, along with the buyer. Poshmark Poshmark is a popular selling site for clothing. Launched more than a decade ago, Poshmark is one of the most popular social commerce marketplaces for users who want to sell clothing and lifestyle accessories. With more than 80 million registered users, sellers on the platform benefit from a large community of eager buyers. Poshmark sellers can also share their items on social media. Poshmark fees As stated in its FAQ, sales under $15 accrue a flat commission of $2.95. For sales over $15 Poshmark's commission is 20%. Decluttr Declutter is also a tech-focused marketplace. Decluttr is another platform that focuses on electronics, but it‚Äôs also a selling site for books, game consoles, and other home entertainment items. Decluttr fees Unlike some of the other marketplaces on this list, Decluttr buys your electronics directly. Using their app, scan the barcode of the items you wish to sell for a quote. Decluttr handles all shipping costs and pays for your items as soon as they‚Äôre received. Amazon Amazon pioneered the concept of online marketplaces and continues to reign supreme. As global ecommerce sales continue to grow, Amazon remains the go-to selling site for many. It‚Äôs reported that Amazon sells over 4,000 products per minute, providing sellers with an active, built-in audience. Amazon fees The cost to sell on Amazon depends on your plan, product category, fulfillment strategy, and other variables. At minimum, you‚Äôll pay $39.99 per month for a Professional Seller plan. Local online selling sites If you plan to sell in your community, here are the top online sites to sell stuff locally for free: Facebook Marketplace Craigslist Nextdoor VarageSale Offerup Facebook Marketplace Facebook Marketplace can be integrated with Shopify stores. Facebook Marketplace from Meta is an online selling site where individual people can discover, buy, and sell items on Facebook. More than one in three people in the US use Marketplace each month, offering a huge opportunity for sellers to reach an active audience. It‚Äôs free to list and Meta takes no fees, but there are guidelines you need to follow to sell on the platform. Meta has also partnered with platforms like Shopify to let merchants show their inventory, advertise items, and find new customers for their business. Craigslist For many, Craigslist is the quintessential selling site, but it‚Äôs light on features. Craigslist is one of the earlier online selling sites. Started in 1995 by Craig Newmark, it began as an email distribution list between friends featuring local events in the San Francisco Bay Area. It quickly became a web-based marketplace and, over the years, expanded into 700 cities across 70 countries. It‚Äôs free and pretty basic but definitely not the best online store to sell items at scale. It‚Äôs essentially a big local forum with a lot of stuff. Craigslist is a higher-risk online marketplace. Because of the platform‚Äôs ‚Äúhands-off‚Äù approach to buying and selling, scams can happen easily, and if they do, you don‚Äôt get any help from the company. Nextdoor Nextdoor shares some features with both Facebook and Craigslist. Nextdoor is similar to Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist in that it‚Äôs focused on community selling. Nextdoor also enables the ‚Äúfriendly neighbor‚Äù feel by letting people post about what‚Äôs going on in their neighborhood‚Äîwhether it's traffic delays or restaurant recommendations. It acts as the hub for any given area. Nextdoor also offers a free forum to sell your items online. It‚Äôs similar to Facebook Marketplace: there are no listing fees and you‚Äôll have to meet buyers in person. It feels a little safer too, because you need to make an account before you can access the platform. VarageSale VarageSale‚Äôs manual ID confirmation process helps reduce fraud. VarageSale is a virtual garage sale buy and sell app. It was started in Canada by an ex-elementary school teacher fed up with scams and fake listings on other classified sites. VarageSale user profiles are based on real identities‚Äîeveryone goes through a manual review process before you‚Äôre allowed to buy or sell. Buyers can browse seller ratings and message sellers to connect before making the sale. They can ask questions and schedule pick-up in the app. People sell everything including furniture, clothing, shoes, and more on VarageSale. It‚Äôs also free for members. Offerup Using a marketplace like Offerup can help reduce the risks of in-person transactions. Offerup allows users to browse electronics, clothing, and even automobiles based on ZIP code. Interested buyers can contact sellers through the app to negotiate price and set up a location to meet. Like VarageSale, Offerup has procedures to ensure the safety of users. Before you agree to meet up, you can browse user profiles and read a seller‚Äôs reviews. Offerup uses TruYou to verify identities of their users helping to further increase safety. They also recommend community meetup spots to make the transaction as reassuring as possible. Best global online selling sites Want to sell to an international audience?

MyDeal is an Australian marketplace offering more than one million products across 3,500 categories, welcoming over two million visitors per month.

While you can sell products in various categories, the platform tends to focus on furniture, homewares, and other big items. MyDeal doesn‚Äôt offer any fulfillment services, so sellers must coordinate their own shipping or use an outside logistics company.

For free. Start free trial Selling products online can be done through numerous specialized and general marketplaces, each with their own opportunities and fees. Building your own online store gives you more control and higher profit potential, free from fees and restrictions imposed by other platforms. Shopify is highlighted as an accessible platform for creating your own store, where you can also integrate sales across various marketplaces and social media channels. The main takeaway is to use a combination of marketplaces for exposure and your own store for brand growth and profitability. There are hundreds of places to sell things online. Some selling sites are focused on specific niches, like video games or tech. Other marketplaces let retailers sell anything from clothing to books to furniture and beyond. While there are many benefits to selling through online marketplaces, it‚Äôs important to consider factors such as selling fees when deciding where to list your items. Ahead, find links to the most popular online selling sites, the benefits of starting your own online store, and how using both approaches can boost your sales. Building your own store The Dawn theme in the Shopify store editor. Starting an online store can be rewarding and, when done right, bring in more profit than is possible with a marketplace. When you run an ecommerce store, you don‚Äôt pay fees on each sale or have to follow another website's rules. Shopify is the easiest way to create your own store. As an ecommerce platform, Shopify helps sellers get up and running at a low cost, with no tech skills required. Creating a store with Shopify is simple thanks to more 100 pre-built website templates. Each store comes with a checkout, SSL security certifications, and beginner-friendly marketing tools. You can sell on your website, across marketplaces like Amazon and eBay, and on social media‚Äîand manage everything from your Shopify dashboard. Set up your store to start selling today. Top websites to sell products online in 2025 eBay Bonanza Ruby Lane Etsy Chairish Swappa Poshmark Decluttr Amazon eBay eBay introduced online selling to users and continues to lead the market. eBay is one of the original destinations for people who want to sell merchandise online, having been around since 1995‚Äîand it‚Äôs still thriving. The marketplace has over two billion listings and 133 million active buyers worldwide. You can sell anything on eBay, from everyday items like shoes and watches to weird stuff (yes, that‚Äôs a product category) like popcorn-scented pillows, bottles of air, and vintage ‚Äô70s giant-hand chairs. There‚Äôs a continuous flow of motivated customers and easy ways to integrate eBay as an additional sales channel for your online store. eBay fees If you plan to sell on eBay, take the online selling site‚Äôs fees into consideration. It charges a non-refundable listing fee for each product and another insertion fee if you list the same items in two different categories. It also charges a final value fee (usually between 10% and 15%), calculated as a percentage of the total amount of the sale, including any shipping costs and handling charges. Bonanza Bonanza is a newer online selling site based out of Seattle. Bonanza is an online selling site that‚Äôs growing in popularity as an eBay alternative. You can sell pretty much anything on the platform, and it receives nearly 1.5 million monthly visits to its website. Think of Bonanza as the middle ground between the online selling sites Amazon and eBay. There are more unique and handmade items for sale on Bonanza than on eBay, but fewer branded names than on Amazon. For example, you can sell the latest Nike Air Max model or a handmade copper necklace and find active buyers for each. Buyers can add products to their cart for a set price or negotiate an offer with you through the platform. Bonanza fees Bonanza charges you nothing to list your products on its site. It takes only a small percentage of your final sale price after you sell. And since many Bonanza sellers also have their own online stores, you can integrate Bonanza with platforms like Shopify to manage and sell products more easily. Ruby Lane Ruby Lane is a place to connect with passionate buyers. Ruby Lane is an online marketplace for vintage and antiques. Selling on Ruby Lane gives you access to highly targeted buyers for categories like antiques and collectibles, vintage and art, dolls, and jewelry. Whether you‚Äôre an antiques and collectibles store owner or just want online selling sites, Ruby Lane is a good place to connect with passionate buyers. Ruby Lane fees Fees and payments for Ruby Lane are straightforward. It‚Äôs free to set up and list your products. But you need to pay a monthly maintenance fee of $45. In addition, Ruby Lane charges a 9.9% service fee based on total purchase order, which is capped at $2,500. Etsy Etsy includes tools to help market your business on the platform. Etsy is a selling site for handcrafted and vintage items. In 2015, it began including maker-developed manufactured goods, but only for select accounts on the marketplace. Currently, there are over 96 million active buyers on Etsy, making it a potentially lucrative way to start selling online. If you‚Äôre new to online selling sites, Etsy provides access to an active buyer network, a pop-up storefront, and tools to help market your business on the platform. Etsy fees You‚Äôll be charged a $0.20 listing fee for each item you sell on Etsy. Listings expire every four months. So if your item doesn‚Äôt sell and you renew the listing, you‚Äôll be charged an additional additional $0.20. When you make a sale, you‚Äôll be charged a transaction fee of 6.5% of the display price, plus the amount you charge for shipping and gift wrapping. Find the most popular Etsy alternatives. Chairish Chairish can help you connect with collectors to make more sales online. Chairish is an online consignment shop made for high-quality home decor and furniture. It takes minutes to list an item (for free), and depending on your seller plan, between 70% and 80% of the selling price goes back to you. If you have design-oriented furniture or home decor to sell online, this is a relevant online selling site. It can quickly land your business in front of ideal customers. Chairish fees Chairish has free and paid plans, with differing commission rates depending on product type and plan tier. When you list your items, Chairish‚Äôs curatorial team reviews your listings to ensure they meet the marketplace‚Äôs standards. They also handle shipping, so you never have to worry about logistics when selling on Chairish. Swappa Swappa vets all products that get sold on the marketplace. Got an old iPhone sitting around that you want to get rid of? Or a Nintendo Switch you don‚Äôt use much anymore? Turn your tech into cash on Swappa, a buy-and-sell website for phones, laptops, cameras, and more. Swappa vets all the products that get sold on its marketplace, so everything you submit must be in good working condition. Payments are protected by PayPal. Swappa fees There are no fees to create a listing, but you can choose to have your items featured for $5. When you make a sale, you pay a 3% fee, along with the buyer. Poshmark Poshmark is a popular selling site for clothing. Launched more than a decade ago, Poshmark is one of the most popular social commerce marketplaces for users who want to sell clothing and lifestyle accessories. With more than 80 million registered users, sellers on the platform benefit from a large community of eager buyers. Poshmark sellers can also share their items on social media. Poshmark fees As stated in its FAQ, sales under $15 accrue a flat commission of $2.95. For sales over $15 Poshmark's commission is 20%. Decluttr Declutter is also a tech-focused marketplace.

A 2024 study shows that marketplaces are the leading channel for product search worldwide, beating out in-store browsing, and branded websites. Today, millions of sellers leverage online marketplaces to expand their reach and boost sales by integrating marketplace listings with their web stores and advertising strategies. When we say marketplaces, we‚Äôre referring to channels where transactions and product discovery happen on the same platform. This includes traditional marketplaces like Amazon, Walmart, and eBay, niche marketplaces like Etsy, NewEgg, and Houzz, and social commerce channels like TikTok Shop, Instagram Shop, and Facebook Shops. In this blog, we‚Äôll explain why sellers list their products on online marketplaces, show you which marketplaces are best suited for your business, and help you avoid some common pitfalls that slow down sellers from truly scalable growth. Key benefits of selling on online marketplaces Best online marketplaces in 2025 Factors to consider when choosing an online marketplace Challenges of selling on marketplaces Ecommerce strategies to help you win on online marketplaces How Feedonomics supports selling on marketplaces Conclusion FAQs The key benefits of selling on online marketplaces Selling on marketplaces offers many benefits to ecommerce businesses that want to diversify their revenue streams, reach more customers, and grow cost-effectively. Here are some of the key advantages you should know about: Access to built-in customer bases Marketplaces like Amazon, Walmart, and eBay have millions of active users, providing sellers with a pre-existing audience. This increased visibility helps you reach new customers without having to invest as heavily on marketing efforts. Established marketplaces are trusted by consumers, reducing the need for sellers to build brand credibility from scratch. Features like secure payment gateways, return policies, and review sections make customers more comfortable when making a purchase. Additionally, many marketplaces operate internationally, allowing you to more easily tap into global markets. Marketplaces like Alibaba and Mercado Libre are particularly effective for expanding into regions like Asia and Latin America while Amazon alone ships to over 100 countries worldwide. Leverage existing infrastructure Marketplaces provide a ready-made infrastructure for listing, selling, and shipping products. Tools and services like Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) and Walmart Fulfillment Services (WFS) handle logistics, eliminating the costs involved with building out your own delivery infrastructure. Marketplaces also handle payment processing, minimizing the risk of fraud and ensuring secure transactions for both buyers and sellers. Increase discoverability Advanced search and recommendation algorithms help sellers connect with customers who are actively searching for their products or similar ones. Sellers can also leverage marketplace ads and promotional tools to improve visibility. Marketplaces like Amazon, Walmart, and Target have been steadily growing their advertising capabilities. They enable sellers to increase visibility for specific products and appear in search results or product detail pages, or leverage their platform‚Äôs data to retarget to users externally. For example, Walmart has pay-per-click sponsored search ads, which allow you to promote a specific product, brand, or video. Similarly, Amazon offers sponsored product, brand, and display ads. Also, cross-selling and upselling opportunities often arise naturally through recommended and ‚Äúfrequently bought together‚Äù sections. Scale and diversify your revenue streams Sellers can start with a small catalog and scale up as they grow, leveraging the marketplace‚Äôs resources to manage larger operations. Listing on multiple channels also reduces your dependency on any single sales channel, mitigating risks like algorithm changes or website downtime. Access to analytics and insights Most marketplaces provide detailed performance metrics, helping sellers track sales, customer behavior, and advertising effectiveness. Insights into trends and customer preferences can guide your product and marketing strategies everywhere you sell, not just on the marketplaces you list on. Best online marketplaces in 2025 By leveraging the established infrastructure, vast customer bases, and built-in trust of online marketplaces, merchants can quickly access new audiences and streamline their operations. However, not all marketplaces are created equal. Each has its unique strengths, audience demographics, and seller requirements, making it crucial to choose the right one based on your business goals.

Sell on more marketplaces and automate product listing, optimization, and order management with Feedonomics Learn more Factors to consider when choosing an online marketplace Before adding a new marketplace to your channel mix, you should evaluate how well it fits with your brand, target audience, profitability, and operational strategy: Target audience and niche Each online marketplace attracts a specific type of shopper, often dictated by product categories, pricing, and demographics. For example, marketplaces like Etsy cater to artisans and handmade goods enthusiasts, while platforms like Amazon appeal to a broader audience seeking convenience and variety. Sellers should evaluate whether a platform aligns with their product offerings and target customer profiles. Fees, commissions, and pricing structure Most marketplaces operate on a fee-based model that includes listing fees, commission fees, or subscription charges. These costs vary significantly; for instance, Amazon charges referral fees based on product categories, while eBay combines insertion fees and final value fees. Sellers must account for these costs when pricing products to maintain profitability. Fulfillment and logistics Some marketplaces offer fulfillment services, such as Amazon FBA or Walmart Fulfillment Services, which can simplify inventory storage, shipping, and returns. Sellers should assess whether leveraging a marketplace‚Äôs logistics aligns with their operational capabilities and cost structure. Marketplace rules and regulations Marketplaces enforce strict rules regarding product listings, pricing policies, and customer interactions. Sellers who fail to comply risk penalties or account suspension. Reviewing and understanding these rules is critical for long-term success on the platform. Integration with existing ecommerce platforms Seamless integration between your ecommerce website and the chosen marketplace simplifies listing management, inventory synchronization, and order processing. Many platforms, such as BigCommerce and Shopify, offer plugins or APIs to connect with major ecommerce marketplaces. Compatibility with your tech stack ensures smoother operations and reduces manual effort. Ability to scale with feed management software As sales grow across multiple marketplaces, managing product data manually becomes inefficient and error-prone. Feed management software allows sellers to automate and optimize their product feeds for each marketplace. This scalability ensures that listings are accurate, up-to-date, and optimized for visibility, enabling sellers to manage larger catalogs and expand to new channels effectively. Make sure that your feed management service provider is able to integrate with your marketplaces of choice. Challenges of selling on marketplaces Marketplaces, just like any other channel, come with their own set of challenges that should be planned for and mitigated against: High competition and saturated categories Popular marketplaces often have crowded categories, making it hard for new sellers to stand out. Competing with established sellers who offer similar products at lower prices requires innovative marketing strategies, such as promotions or unique value propositions. Optimizing product listings with relevant keywords, high-quality images, and competitive pricing is critical for visibility. However, marketplaces often have their own algorithms and requirements, which makes listing optimization an ongoing challenge. Consistently updating and refining listings is necessary to maintain competitive listings, higher search rankings, and attract customers. Fees and commissions impacting profit margins Marketplace fees, transaction fees, commission fees, and additional costs for optional services like fulfillment or advertising can significantly reduce profit margins. Sellers must carefully calculate costs and consider whether these expenses align with their pricing strategies. Scaling order management As order volumes increase, keeping track of inventory, shipping, and returns across multiple marketplaces can become overwhelming. Poorly managed order workflows risk stockouts, late deliveries, or errors, which can negatively impact seller ratings and customer satisfaction. Investing in scalable order management solutions is essential for scalable growth. Risk of marketplace dependence Relying heavily on a single marketplace for sales can be risky, as changes in policies, fees, or algorithms can disrupt operations. Diversifying sales channels and maintaining an independent ecommerce presence is critical for mitigating these risks and ensuring sustainable growth. Related article 5 mistakes to avoid when adding new ecommerce channels Ecommerce strategies to help you win on online marketplaces Thriving on online marketplaces requires a combination of strategic planning and execution. Success comes from leveraging best practices to stand out in competitive spaces, optimize your listings, and ensure smooth fulfillment. Below are actionable strategies to help you excel. Building your brand A strong brand sets your products apart, building trust and loyalty with customers. Use cohesive brand stories, professional images, and engaging product descriptions to captivate shoppers. Maximize marketplace tools like customizable storefronts, enhanced content, and live shopping features to amplify your brand‚Äôs presence. Leverage programs like Amazon Vine and Walmart Review Accelerator to boost reviews, and protect your brand with IP registration services like Amazon Brand Registry or Walmart Brand Portal. Winning the buy box If multiple sellers list the same product on a marketplace, their listings can be grouped together. When this happens, one seller‚Äôs offer may be prominently displayed over the rest on the product page. We can say that that seller has ‚Äúwon the buy box.‚Äù Winning the buy box, also known as the ‚ÄúFeatured Offer‚Äù on Amazon, significantly boosts a seller‚Äôs visibility and sales potential. This coveted spot highlights one seller‚Äôs listing on a product page when multiple sellers offer the same item. Marketplaces take multiple factors into consideration when determining who receives the buy box. Let‚Äôs take a look at Amazon and Walmart as two examples. Amazon‚Äôs Featured Offer is influenced by factors such as competitive pricing, fulfillment methods, seller performance (order defect rate, cancellation rate, and late shipment rate), and inventory availability. The buy box rotates among eligible sellers meeting these criteria. On Walmart, the buy box prioritizes low prices, fast shipping, and seller performance metrics. Walmart also recommends tools like Repricer to help sellers stay competitive. Some marketplaces like eBay and TargetPlus don‚Äôt have a buy box at all. On eBay sellers have individual product pages and Target Plus assigns one seller per barcode, avoiding direct competition for the same listing. Optimizing your product data Optimizing product data is essential to increasing your product visibility and attracting shoppers on online marketplaces. Key areas of focus include images, titles, descriptions, and categorization. Rich, accurate content in listings ensures products appear in relevant search results and next to related items. High-quality images, well-structured titles, and detailed descriptions help shoppers quickly understand what they‚Äôre buying, while optimized data improves trust and conversion rates. Each marketplace has specific feed requirements, making it critical for businesses to submit accurate, scalable product data feeds rather than relying on manual uploads. Getting your fulfillment right A seamless fulfillment process is critical for success on marketplaces, particularly if you‚Äôre managing sales across multiple channels. Proper fulfillment ensures orders are processed accurately and on time, reducing returns, boosting customer satisfaction, and avoiding negative reviews. Meeting marketplace standards for metrics like order defect rates is essential to maintaining seller performance and the visibility of your listings. Leveraging automation and integration tools can streamline fulfillment. Automated order management systems minimize manual errors, pulling and syncing order data directly with marketplaces. These tools also support strategies like inventory buffers, where sellers list slightly less stock than available to avoid overselling, especially during peak seasons or promotions. This ensures a smoother fulfillment process and reduces the risk of cancellations. Additionally, monitoring customer feedback can provide valuable insights for fulfillment improvements. Addressing common complaints, such as sizing issues or unclear product details, helps reduce returns and enhances the shopping experience.

Sell on more marketplaces and automate product listing, optimization, and order management with Feedonomics Learn more Factors to consider when choosing an online marketplace Before adding a new marketplace to your channel mix, you should evaluate how well it fits with your brand, target audience, profitability, and operational strategy: Target audience and niche Each online marketplace attracts a specific type of shopper, often dictated by product categories, pricing, and demographics. For example, marketplaces like Etsy cater to artisans and handmade goods enthusiasts, while platforms like Amazon appeal to a broader audience seeking convenience and variety. Sellers should evaluate whether a platform aligns with their product offerings and target customer profiles. Fees, commissions, and pricing structure Most marketplaces operate on a fee-based model that includes listing fees, commission fees, or subscription charges. These costs vary significantly; for instance, Amazon charges referral fees based on product categories, while eBay combines insertion fees and final value fees. Sellers must account for these costs when pricing products to maintain profitability. Fulfillment and logistics Some marketplaces offer fulfillment services, such as Amazon FBA or Walmart Fulfillment Services, which can simplify inventory storage, shipping, and returns. Sellers should assess whether leveraging a marketplace‚Äôs logistics aligns with their operational capabilities and cost structure. Marketplace rules and regulations Marketplaces enforce strict rules regarding product listings, pricing policies, and customer interactions. Sellers who fail to comply risk penalties or account suspension. Reviewing and understanding these rules is critical for long-term success on the platform. Integration with existing ecommerce platforms Seamless integration between your ecommerce website and the chosen marketplace simplifies listing management, inventory synchronization, and order processing. Many platforms, such as BigCommerce and Shopify, offer plugins or APIs to connect with major ecommerce marketplaces. Compatibility with your tech stack ensures smoother operations and reduces manual effort. Ability to scale with feed management software As sales grow across multiple marketplaces, managing product data manually becomes inefficient and error-prone. Feed management software allows sellers to automate and optimize their product feeds for each marketplace. This scalability ensures that listings are accurate, up-to-date, and optimized for visibility, enabling sellers to manage larger catalogs and expand to new channels effectively. Make sure that your feed management service provider is able to integrate with your marketplaces of choice. Challenges of selling on marketplaces Marketplaces, just like any other channel, come with their own set of challenges that should be planned for and mitigated against: High competition and saturated categories Popular marketplaces often have crowded categories, making it hard for new sellers to stand out. Competing with established sellers who offer similar products at lower prices requires innovative marketing strategies, such as promotions or unique value propositions. Optimizing product listings with relevant keywords, high-quality images, and competitive pricing is critical for visibility. However, marketplaces often have their own algorithms and requirements, which makes listing optimization an ongoing challenge. Consistently updating and refining listings is necessary to maintain competitive listings, higher search rankings, and attract customers. Fees and commissions impacting profit margins Marketplace fees, transaction fees, commission fees, and additional costs for optional services like fulfillment or advertising can significantly reduce profit margins. Sellers must carefully calculate costs and consider whether these expenses align with their pricing strategies. Scaling order management As order volumes increase, keeping track of inventory, shipping, and returns across multiple marketplaces can become overwhelming. Poorly managed order workflows risk stockouts, late deliveries, or errors, which can negatively impact seller ratings and customer satisfaction. Investing in scalable order management solutions is essential for scalable growth. Risk of marketplace dependence Relying heavily on a single marketplace for sales can be risky, as changes in policies, fees, or algorithms can disrupt operations. Diversifying sales channels and maintaining an independent ecommerce presence is critical for mitigating these risks and ensuring sustainable growth. Related article 5 mistakes to avoid when adding new ecommerce channels Ecommerce strategies to help you win on online marketplaces Thriving on online marketplaces requires a combination of strategic planning and execution. Success comes from leveraging best practices to stand out in competitive spaces, optimize your listings, and ensure smooth fulfillment. Below are actionable strategies to help you excel. Building your brand A strong brand sets your products apart, building trust and loyalty with customers. Use cohesive brand stories, professional images, and engaging product descriptions to captivate shoppers. Maximize marketplace tools like customizable storefronts, enhanced content, and live shopping features to amplify your brand‚Äôs presence. Leverage programs like Amazon Vine and Walmart Review Accelerator to boost reviews, and protect your brand with IP registration services like Amazon Brand Registry or Walmart Brand Portal. Winning the buy box If multiple sellers list the same product on a marketplace, their listings can be grouped together. When this happens, one seller‚Äôs offer may be prominently displayed over the rest on the product page. We can say that that seller has ‚Äúwon the buy box.‚Äù Winning the buy box, also known as the ‚ÄúFeatured Offer‚Äù on Amazon, significantly boosts a seller‚Äôs visibility and sales potential. This coveted spot highlights one seller‚Äôs listing on a product page when multiple sellers offer the same item. Marketplaces take multiple factors into consideration when determining who receives the buy box. Let‚Äôs take a look at Amazon and Walmart as two examples. Amazon‚Äôs Featured Offer is influenced by factors such as competitive pricing, fulfillment methods, seller performance (order defect rate, cancellation rate, and late shipment rate), and inventory availability. The buy box rotates among eligible sellers meeting these criteria. On Walmart, the buy box prioritizes low prices, fast shipping, and seller performance metrics. Walmart also recommends tools like Repricer to help sellers stay competitive. Some marketplaces like eBay and TargetPlus don‚Äôt have a buy box at all. On eBay sellers have individual product pages and Target Plus assigns one seller per barcode, avoiding direct competition for the same listing. Optimizing your product data Optimizing product data is essential to increasing your product visibility and attracting shoppers on online marketplaces. Key areas of focus include images, titles, descriptions, and categorization. Rich, accurate content in listings ensures products appear in relevant search results and next to related items. High-quality images, well-structured titles, and detailed descriptions help shoppers quickly understand what they‚Äôre buying, while optimized data improves trust and conversion rates. Each marketplace has specific feed requirements, making it critical for businesses to submit accurate, scalable product data feeds rather than relying on manual uploads. Getting your fulfillment right A seamless fulfillment process is critical for success on marketplaces, particularly if you‚Äôre managing sales across multiple channels. Proper fulfillment ensures orders are processed accurately and on time, reducing returns, boosting customer satisfaction, and avoiding negative reviews. Meeting marketplace standards for metrics like order defect rates is essential to maintaining seller performance and the visibility of your listings. Leveraging automation and integration tools can streamline fulfillment. Automated order management systems minimize manual errors, pulling and syncing order data directly with marketplaces. These tools also support strategies like inventory buffers, where sellers list slightly less stock than available to avoid overselling, especially during peak seasons or promotions. This ensures a smoother fulfillment process and reduces the risk of cancellations. Additionally, monitoring customer feedback can provide valuable insights for fulfillment improvements. Addressing common complaints, such as sizing issues or unclear product details, helps reduce returns and enhances the shopping experience.

Choosing the right platform to sell your products is a crucial step in launching your business. With so many options available, you can find the perfect fit for your needs‚Äîwhether you're selling custom print-on-demand items, vintage treasures, or handmade creations. Let‚Äôs dive into the top online selling platforms for 2025, including an overview of their fees, features, and what you can expect from each one. ‚Äç Key Takeaways Etsy and eBay provide access to both niche and global audiences but come with high fees and intense competition. Amazon offers massive reach and robust fulfillment options, but sellers face high fees and strong competition across most product categories. Facebook Marketplace allows you to sell locally with no listing fees, though it lacks advanced eCommerce tools for scaling your business. Shopify and BigCommerce are highly scalable platforms, ideal for building your own store. However, fees can increase as your business expands. Wix and Squarespace are user-friendly and perfect for design-driven businesses, but they offer limited scalability for larger operations. TikTok Shop provides exciting viral marketing potential, especially for younger audiences, though its features are still evolving. ‚Äç Best online marketplaces to sell Looking to reach your customers without the hassle of building an online store from the ground up? Online marketplaces offer a fantastic solution, packed with numerous advantages and features. 1.Etsy Etsy began as a platform dedicated to handmade and vintage goods but has since expanded to accommodate a wide variety of products, including custom apparel and downloadable items. Sellers can also use Etsy Pattern to create a personalized website, offering more branding options to stand out. However, the platform‚Äôs high fees mean careful pricing is needed to stay profitable. Pros: Access to over 90 million active buyers, mainly seeking unique or custom products Easy-to-use platform for beginners and experienced sellers Built-in marketing tools like Etsy Ads and offsite ads Cons: High transaction and processing fees Strong competition can make it hard to stand out Limited customization for storefronts Sellers handle inventory and fulfillment themselves Etsy Fees: Listing fee: $0.20 per item, renewed every 4 months Transaction fee: 6.5% of the sale price Payment processing fee: 3% + $0.25 (US) or up to 6.5% + $0.30 (varies by country) Etsy Plus: $10/month for extra features Etsy Pattern: $15/month for a custom website with domain fees ‚Äç 2.eBay As one of the first online auction platforms, eBay remains a dominant force in eCommerce. Known for its global reach, eBay connects sellers to millions of buyers worldwide. Whether you‚Äôre selling auction-style or fixed-price listings, eBay offers flexibility in how you do business. You can also integrate Tapstitch for print-on-demand items. Popular categories on eBay include electronics, collectibles, and second-hand products, making it a great platform for diverse inventories. Sellers can optimize profits by experimenting with various strategies and utilizing store subscriptions to lower fees. Pros: Global exposure to millions of buyers Auction-style listings allow for competitive bidding, which can drive higher prices Ideal for selling second-hand items, electronics, and collectibles Cons: Intense competition across many categories Insertion and selling fees can quickly add up, especially for large inventories No dedicated fulfillment services eBay Fees: Insertion fee: 250 free listings per month for non-subscribers; $0.35 per listing afterward. Store subscribers get additional free listings based on their plan Final value fee: 13.25% of the total sale price (including shipping) for sales up to $7,500, and 2.35% for amounts above that. Additional $0.40 fee per order for sales over $10 Optional upgrades: Bold text costs $2, Subtitles range from $1.50 to $6 Advertising fees: Promoted Listings only charges a fee when the item sells International fees: 1.65% of the total sale when selling internationally, plus an additional 2.5%-3.5% currency conversion fee ‚Äç 3.Amazon As one of the largest and most trusted eCommerce platforms globally, Amazon offers sellers access to an enormous customer base and an unmatched reputation. Known for its vast product categories, Amazon is a go-to marketplace for sellers looking to expand their reach and sales. The platform‚Äôs success is driven by its focus on customer satisfaction and the use of cutting-edge technologies like AI, robotics, and even drones in some regions. For sellers, Amazon provides tools and services like Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), which takes care of inventory storage, shipping, and customer service. However, sellers must carefully evaluate the costs associated with FBA and consider Seller Fulfilled Prime (SFP) if they wish to retain more control over their logistics. Pros: Trusted platform with strong brand credibility Access to millions of customers worldwide Robust seller tools for inventory management, advertising, and reporting FBA simplifies storage, shipping, and customer service Cons: High fees, especially for FBA (8%-15% referral fee per sale, plus storage fees) Highly competitive marketplace with many sellers FBA can simplify logistics but also increase costs and limit control over the customer experience Amazon Fees: Individual plan: $0.99 per item sold (ideal for sellers with fewer than 40 sales per month) Professional plan: $39.99/month (for sellers with more than 40 sales per month, offering advanced tools and insights) Referral fees: Varies by product category, typically ranging from 8% to 15% Example: 15% for most items in clothing and accessories, 8% for electronics FBA fees: Fulfillment fee: Starts at $2.50 for small standard items, with higher rates for oversized items Storage fee: $0.75 to $2.40 per cubic foot, depending on the season (higher fees from October to December) ‚Äç 4.Facebook Marketplace Facebook Marketplace allows sellers to reach local buyers with no listing fees. It‚Äôs ideal for selling both new and second-hand items and leverages Facebook‚Äôs large user base for easy exposure. However, it lacks advanced tools for scaling and doesn‚Äôt offer fulfillment services, so you‚Äôll need to manage shipping and customer service yourself.

Criteria for choosing the right selling platform in 2025 Several key criteria must be considered when selecting the right selling platform for your business. Understanding these criteria will help you make an informed decision that aligns with your business objectives and maximizes your chances of success. Here are some factors to bear in mind: Target audience and market reach Choose a platform that aligns with your audience's demographics and geographical reach, as some platforms cater to specific regions or industries. Be aware of fees and pricing structures to ensure profitability, from sales commissions to subscription or transaction fees. Platform capabilities and features Assess if the platform offers key features like inventory management, order tracking, and marketing tools. Integrations with other business tools, such as accounting and shipping services, can streamline operations and save time. User experience and customer support Opt for a platform with a user-friendly interface and strong customer support to ensure smooth operations and quick assistance when needed. This will enhance the selling experience and minimize disruptions in managing your store. Advantages and disadvantages of selling on multiple platforms Selling in online marketplaces through multiple platforms can expand your reach to potential customers. However, it's important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages before working on a multi-platform strategy. Key advantages Broader customer base: Selling on multiple platforms lets you reach new audiences, reducing dependence on a single platform for sales stability. Increased brand exposure: More platforms mean greater brand visibility, with each offering unique promotional tools like ads and influencer partnerships. Market insights: Each platform provides valuable data on customer behavior, helping you refine strategies and make data-driven decisions. Key disadvantages Operational complexity: Managing multiple platforms requires time and resources for inventory, order fulfillment, and customer service. Inventory management challenges: Tracking and syncing inventory across platforms can be tricky, so tools to streamline this process are essential. Brand Identity dilution: Consistent branding across different platforms is crucial to maintain brand recognition and customer trust. Pricing conflicts: Varying fees and promotional structures across platforms challenge coordinated pricing and promotions. To maximize your success, weigh these pros and cons carefully, optimize your strategy, and develop a plan that minimizes risks in an omnichannel approach.
