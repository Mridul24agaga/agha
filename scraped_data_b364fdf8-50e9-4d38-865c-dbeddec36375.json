Conclusion: Building a Sustainable Link Profile on a Budget Understanding the Value of Backlinks in SEO Before getting into cost-effective link building techniques, let’s consider what makes backlinks valuable in the first place. In the eyes of search engines like Google, backlinks signal that your content is valuable and trustworthy, especially if they come from highly authoritative sources. When reputable sites link to your page, it sends a strong message to search algorithms that your content is worth showing to their users more than other matching pages. Backlinks are one of the most important SEO ranking factors. Google’s algorithm specifically weighs backlinks heavily when determining whether a website should appear in search results and how highly. The more high-quality backlinks you have, the more likely you are to rank for competitive keywords, because Google interprets backlinks as third-party endorsements, essentially vouching for the reliability and usefulness of your context (unless they are nofollow links). The Challenges of Budget Link Building While link building is a vital part of SEO, it’s often seen as one of the most challenging and expensive aspects of digital marketing. For many businesses, especially small or growing ones, allocating a large budget to SEO and link-building efforts can feel out of reach. High-authority backlinks don’t come easily or cheaply, and the time and resources needed to build an effective backlink profile can quickly add up. Is it possible to build quality backlinks on a limited budget, then? The answer is yes, but it’s important to understand the obstacles that make budget-friendly link building difficult. What Makes Link Building Potentially Expensive? Many factors, such as the time-consuming nature of outreach, the cost of creating link-worthy content, and the challenges of acquiring links from high-authority sites, contribute to the perception that effective link building is expensive. While the concept of getting backlinks seems straightforward—other websites linking to your content—the reality is much more complex. There are significant costs associated with time, resources, and sometimes money when it comes to building a sustainable, high-quality backlink profile. One of the primary reasons link building is considered expensive is the sheer amount of time it requires. Securing backlinks is not a process that happens overnight. It involves extensive research, outreach, and relationship-building. Researching potential sites, personalized outreach, and follow-up all take time and effort. Then comes content creation, which requires content types specifically designed to attract backlinks, along with costs associated (hiring writers, design and development costs, media promotion, etc.). Securing high-authority backlink opportunities is also notoriously difficult. These sites receive pitches from countless websites daily, and standing out from the crowd with a compelling value proposition is the only way to get their attention. While third-party link-building services can be an option, avoid directly purchasing links, as this violates Google’s guidelines and can lead to severe penalties, including complete removal from search results. Common Misconceptions About Affordable Link Building Many businesses immediately assume that only expensive link-building services can deliver results, leading them to shy away from pursuing cost-effective strategies that bring long-term benefits. It’s important to remember that budget-friendly link building doesn’t have to mean low-quality. One of the biggest misconceptions is that inexpensive links are inherently low-quality and harmful to your SEO. This belief stems from an overgeneralization based on unethical practices like purchasing links from link farms or low-quality directories, which indeed offer poor value and can hurt your rankings. However, cost-effectiveness doesn’t have to mean cutting corners. Many niche blogs, even with strong domain authority, accept guest posts without charging a fee. Networking with industry peers and engaging with bloggers, offering value to other businesses through collaborations, can also help you naturally earn backlinks over time. Creating high-quality, linkable content requires few things except from a competent writer. You can even audit and repurpose existing content to reduce costs and optimize what you already have. These strategies require effort and time, but not necessarily large financial investments. The key takeaway is that the value of a backlink is determined by its relevance, authority, and natural placement—not by how much money was spent to obtain it. DIY link building is definitely a viable solution, it only needs careful strategizing and execution. Quality Over Quantity: The Power of Building Fewer, Better Links The phrase “less is more” is definitely true in link building. Search engines, particularly Google, prioritize backlinks that are both relevant and authoritative. A few links from high-authority, well-respected websites in your niche can significantly boost your website’s rankings, whereas a large volume of low-quality or irrelevant links can provide little to no SEO benefit—and may even hurt your rankings. High-quality backlinks come from authoritative and trustworthy websites that are relevant to your industry. While domain authority (DA), a metric developed by Moz, isn't an official ranking factor used by Google, it serves as a useful indicator of a site's credibility. In addition to authority, relevance is crucial—links from websites related to your niche hold more value than those from unrelated sources. For example, if you run a health and fitness blog, a backlink from a reputable health website is more valuable than one from a generic business directory or unrelated blog. Cost-Effective Link Building Strategies As we mentioned a few times already, link building doesn’t have to come with a hefty price tag. While many traditional link-building methods can be expensive, there are numerous cost-effective strategies that can help you secure high-quality backlinks without overspending. The key is to focus on creativity, value, and strategic outreach. Below, we explore 13 practical and affordable link-building techniques that can help improve your SEO and boost your website’s authority without breaking the bank. 1. Create Shareable, High-Quality Content One of the most effective and sustainable ways to build backlinks is to create linkable assets—high-quality, shareable content that naturally earns backlinks because it provides value to readers, answers common questions, or offers unique insights. This approach not only reduces the need for extensive outreach but also ensures that the backlinks you receive are relevant and authoritative. Linkable assets are pieces of content designed to be so valuable, informative, or engaging that other websites are compelled to link to them. These assets can come in various forms, but their common feature is that they offer something unique or highly useful to the target audience. They could include: In-depth guides and tutorials Original research and data Infographics and other visual data and trend representations Case studies Lists of resources, helpful material, tools, etc. 2. Use Link Building platforms Link-building platforms like WhitePress are powerful, cost-effective tools for acquiring high-quality backlinks without the need for extensive manual outreach. These platforms connect marketers, SEO professionals, and businesses with reputable websites open to content collaborations, offering opportunities for organic and strategic link-building. One of the major advantages is the clear cost visibility they offer, allowing users to see exactly how much they'll spend upfront, making it easier to manage budgets. Additionally, they save significant time by streamlining the entire process, which contributes to reducing overall costs. WhitePress connects you to thousands of websites across multiple industries and geographic regions. This allows you to diversify your backlink profile by acquiring links from a variety of sources, which is beneficial for SEO. Whether your focus is on local, national, or international markets, WhitePress platform offers ample opportunities to expand your reach while staying in control of costs. 3. Leverage Social Media for Link Opportunities Social media platforms are a powerful yet often underutilized tool for link building. While social media links themselves may not directly impact SEO due to their \"nofollow\" attribute, social media activity can indirectly lead to valuable backlinks. By promoting your content, engaging with influencers, and leveraging your social media presence, you can create opportunities for others to discover and link to your website. One of the most effective ways to leverage social media for link building is by engaging with influencers in your niche. Influencers have the power to amplify your content, and their followers often trust and act on their recommendations, leading to organic backlinks. Start by following influencers who are relevant to your industry on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Engage with their posts by commenting thoughtfully, retweeting, and liking their content. This helps you get on their radar and establishes a connection without directly asking for anything upfront. You can track social media mentions with tools like Google Alerts, Mention, Brand24, or BuzzSumo. 4. Guest Posting on Relevant Websites Guest posting is one of the most effective and budget-friendly link-building strategies, allowing you to gain high-quality backlinks, build relationships, and establish authority within your niche. By contributing valuable content to reputable websites in your industry, you not only earn backlinks but also reach new audiences. However, it’s important to approach guest posting strategically to avoid common pitfalls. To find guest posting opportunities, search for reputable blogs in your niche that accept guest contributions. You can use tools like Ahrefs to analyze potential sites or perform Google searches with phrases such as \"your niche + write for us\" to discover relevant websites. Analyzing your competitors' backlinks can also reveal where they have published guest posts, offering additional opportunities. 5. Utilize Connectively (Formerly known as HARO - Help a Reporter Out) Connectively, formerly known as HARO (Help a Reporter Out), is a platform that connects journalists with sources for their stories. It offers a valuable opportunity for businesses to gain media exposure and earn high-quality backlinks by providing expert insights and quotes to reporters. Connectively sends out daily queries from journalists seeking information on various topics, and if your response is selected, you can earn a mention and a backlink from reputable media outlets. To use Connectively effectively, it’s crucial to craft compelling responses. Start by responding quickly, as reporters often work on tight deadlines. Tailor your response specifically to the journalist's query by providing concise, valuable, and relevant information. Avoid generic responses and ensure that your expertise directly addresses the question. 6. The Art of Ethical Link Exchange Reciprocal linking, or link exchange, involves two websites agreeing to link to each other, often in a mutually beneficial arrangement. When done ethically, it can provide benefits such as increased referral traffic and an enhanced backlink profile, as long as the exchanged links are relevant and valuable to both audiences. Here, the key is to focus on quality over quantity. Only exchange links with websites that are relevant to your niche and provide value to your visitors. Always make sure the link placement is natural and adds context, rather than appearing as a forced attempt to manipulate rankings. Avoid large-scale or automated link exchanges, which can trigger penalties from search engines like Google. 7. Converting Brand Mentions into Backlinks To find unlinked mentions of your brand, you can use tools like Google Alerts, Mention, or Ahrefs. These tools monitor the web for any mention of your brand name, products, or services. Once you've identified unlinked mentions, the next step is to reach out to the webmaster or content creator. When reaching out, keep your request polite and professional. Acknowledge that you appreciate the mention of your brand, and politely ask if they could include a link back to your website. 8. Broken Link Building Broken link building is a strategy that involves finding broken links on other websites and offering your own relevant content as a replacement. This helps webmasters fix their broken links while providing you with a valuable backlink in return. It’s a win-win, as the website owner improves their user experience, and you earn a high-quality link. To implement broken link building, start by identifying broken links on websites in your niche. Tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Check My Links can help you scan websites for broken links. The easiest approach is to analyze your competitors’ backlink profiles to find broken backlinks leading to dead pages. Once you have identified a broken link, check if you already have content that could serve as a replacement. If not, consider creating a new resource that aligns with the broken link. Crafting effective outreach emails is key to this strategy. When reaching out to the site owner, be polite and highlight the issue with the broken link. Offer your content as a helpful replacement and explain how it would provide value to their readers. Keep the message concise and professional, focusing on the mutual benefits of fixing the broken link and using your resource as a replacement. 9. Competitive Link Analysis: Learning from Your Rivals Competitive link analysis involves examining your competitors' backlink profiles to uncover valuable insights into their link-building strategies. By analyzing where your competitors are getting their backlinks, you can identify potential opportunities for your own site and replicate their success. To conduct a competitor backlink analysis, use tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Moz. These tools allow you to explore the backlinks your competitors have acquired, revealing linking domains, anchor text, and link authority. Start by identifying your top competitors and inputting their URLs into these tools to analyze their backlink profiles. Once you’ve uncovered their backlinks, focus on replicating the ones that are relevant and high-quality. For example, if they have earned links through guest posting, reach out to the same publications or websites with your own unique content pitch. Also, look for unique link opportunities your competitors may have missed by analyzing gaps in their strategy. 10. Build Relationships with Industry Influencers Relationship-based link building focuses on forming long-term connections with industry influencers, which can lead to organic backlinks and increased exposure over time. Rather than one-off link exchanges, building genuine relationships with influencers can result in sustained collaboration, content sharing, and mutual promotion. When using social media and email for outreach, keep the communication concise and clear. Personalize every message, avoid generic requests, and focus on building a relationship over time rather than pushing for immediate links. This approach creates a foundation for ongoing collaborations, which naturally leads to more link opportunities. 11. Engage in Online Communities and Forums Participating in online communities and forums can be a valuable way to build links while establishing authority in your niche. The key is to engage genuinely, offering meaningful contributions rather than simply dropping links. Communities like Reddit, Quora, and niche-specific forums such as Stack Overflow (for tech) or specialized industry boards are great places to start. When including links, do so naturally and only when relevant to the discussion. You can include links in responses when they directly add value to the conversation or provide additional resources. Some forums also allow you to add links in your signature, but this should be done sparingly and only in a professional manner. 12. Leveraging Business Directories for Quality Backlinks Business directories still play a valuable role in modern SEO, providing opportunities for quality backlinks while increasing your online visibility. When listed in reputable, industry-specific directories, your site can benefit from both the authority of the directory and increased referral traffic. Some examples of reputable directories include Yelp, TripAdvisor, and niche-specific directories such as Clutch (for B2B services) and Houzz (for home improvement professionals). 13. Outreach Outreach involves connecting with website owners to secure backlinks by offering valuable resources like expert insights, data, or well-crafted content. The key to successful outreach is personalization and relevance. Identify websites in your niche that could benefit from your resource and craft a message that highlights the specific value it adds to their audience or content. Instead of generic requests, tailor your pitch to the site’s needs, showing genuine interest in their work. Be respectful of their time, keep your message concise, and clearly outline how your resource benefits their readers. Maximizing your link-building efforts on a budget often requires a strategic approach, and one effective method to consider is tiered link building. This strategy involves creating layers of backlinks to amplify the authority passed to your target pages, helping you achieve better rankings without overspending. By combining high-quality links with secondary tiers that support them, you can create a cost-efficient and scalable system. Measuring the Success of Your Link Building Campaign To know whether your link building efforts are actually succeeding in achieving your set goals, you’ll need a way to measure their impact. Thankfully, there is a range of tools that help track key metrics and provide insights into the effectiveness of your backlink profile. Google Analytics is a powerful tool for tracking the performance of your backlinks. By navigating to the Acquisition > All Traffic > Referrals section, you can see the websites that are sending traffic to your site through backlinks. Additionally, you can set up Goals in Google Analytics to track how referral traffic from specific backlinks converts into desired actions on your site, such as sign-ups, purchases, or downloads. When tracking your performance, keep these metrics in mind: Domain Authority (DA) or Domain Rating (DR): These are metrics provided by tools like Moz (DA) or Ahrefs (DR) that estimate the strength and authority of a website’s backlink profile. Number of Backlinks: Tracking the number of new backlinks over time helps you see how well your campaign is acquiring links. However, quality should be prioritized over quantity, so focus on authoritative links from relevant sites. Referral Traffic: Backlinks can drive direct traffic to your site. Google Analytics can help you track how much referral traffic is coming from the links you’ve built. An increase in referral traffic shows that your links are placed on websites with engaged audiences. Keyword Rankings: High-quality backlinks can improve your rankings for targeted keywords. Monitor the search engine rankings of your key terms to see if your link-building efforts are positively impacting your SEO. Linking Domains: This metric tracks the number of unique domains that link back to your website. Having diverse, authoritative linking domains is more valuable than getting many links from a single source. For budget-conscious campaigns, setting realistic and achievable goals is essential. Instead of focusing on rapid domain authority growth or hundreds of backlinks, prioritize smaller, attainable targets, such as building a set number of high-quality links from niche-relevant sites within a certain timeframe. Aim for steady, incremental growth rather than expecting immediate results. Common Pitfalls to Avoid in Budget Link Building While budget-friendly link-building can be effective, there are several pitfalls that can undermine your efforts and even harm your website’s SEO. Black-hat SEO techniques often promise quick and cheap backlinks, but they come with significant risks. Tactics such as buying links, using automated link-building tools, or participating in link schemes may offer short-term gains but can lead to penalties from search engines, especially Google. Link farms and private blog networks (PBNs) are often marketed as inexpensive solutions to quickly build a large number of backlinks. However, links from these sources are generally low-quality, and Google is becoming increasingly adept at identifying these networks and penalizing sites that participate in them. Instead of relying on these shortcuts, it’s important to seek out high-quality backlinks from relevant, authoritative websites that provide real value to their audience. A few strong, reputable backlinks are far more beneficial than a large number of low-quality ones. Conclusion: Building a Sustainable Link Profile on a Budget Developing a strong link profile on a budget is entirely achievable with the right strategies and a focus on quality over quantity. Budget-friendly link-building requires patience and creativity—by prioritizing high-quality backlinks over low-quality alternatives, you can enhance your website’s SEO incrementally without breaking the bank. Throughout this guide, we’ve explored a variety of cost-effective link-building strategies, such as creating shareable content, leveraging link-building platforms, guest posting, and engaging in online communities. We’ve also emphasized the importance of avoiding black-hat techniques like link farms and PBNs, which can lead to search engine penalties, and the need to maintain a natural link profile by earning backlinks from diverse and authoritative sources. Ultimately, building a sustainable link profile on a budget is about consistency, strategic outreach, and long-term relationship building. Stay focused on high-quality, relevant backlinks, and you’ll see your site’s authority grow and your search engine rankings improve—all without overspending.

The Challenges of Budget Link Building While link building is a vital part of SEO, it’s often seen as one of the most challenging and expensive aspects of digital marketing. For many businesses, especially small or growing ones, allocating a large budget to SEO and link-building efforts can feel out of reach. High-authority backlinks don’t come easily or cheaply, and the time and resources needed to build an effective backlink profile can quickly add up. Is it possible to build quality backlinks on a limited budget, then? The answer is yes, but it’s important to understand the obstacles that make budget-friendly link building difficult. What Makes Link Building Potentially Expensive? Many factors, such as the time-consuming nature of outreach, the cost of creating link-worthy content, and the challenges of acquiring links from high-authority sites, contribute to the perception that effective link building is expensive. While the concept of getting backlinks seems straightforward—other websites linking to your content—the reality is much more complex. There are significant costs associated with time, resources, and sometimes money when it comes to building a sustainable, high-quality backlink profile. One of the primary reasons link building is considered expensive is the sheer amount of time it requires. Securing backlinks is not a process that happens overnight. It involves extensive research, outreach, and relationship-building. Researching potential sites, personalized outreach, and follow-up all take time and effort. Then comes content creation, which requires content types specifically designed to attract backlinks, along with costs associated (hiring writers, design and development costs, media promotion, etc.). Securing high-authority backlink opportunities is also notoriously difficult. These sites receive pitches from countless websites daily, and standing out from the crowd with a compelling value proposition is the only way to get their attention. While third-party link-building services can be an option, avoid directly purchasing links, as this violates Google’s guidelines and can lead to severe penalties, including complete removal from search results. Common Misconceptions About Affordable Link Building Many businesses immediately assume that only expensive link-building services can deliver results, leading them to shy away from pursuing cost-effective strategies that bring long-term benefits. It’s important to remember that budget-friendly link building doesn’t have to mean low-quality. One of the biggest misconceptions is that inexpensive links are inherently low-quality and harmful to your SEO. This belief stems from an overgeneralization based on unethical practices like purchasing links from link farms or low-quality directories, which indeed offer poor value and can hurt your rankings. However, cost-effectiveness doesn’t have to mean cutting corners. Many niche blogs, even with strong domain authority, accept guest posts without charging a fee. Networking with industry peers and engaging with bloggers, offering value to other businesses through collaborations, can also help you naturally earn backlinks over time. Creating high-quality, linkable content requires few things except from a competent writer. You can even audit and repurpose existing content to reduce costs and optimize what you already have. These strategies require effort and time, but not necessarily large financial investments. The key takeaway is that the value of a backlink is determined by its relevance, authority, and natural placement—not by how much money was spent to obtain it. DIY link building is definitely a viable solution, it only needs careful strategizing and execution. Quality Over Quantity: The Power of Building Fewer, Better Links The phrase “less is more” is definitely true in link building. Search engines, particularly Google, prioritize backlinks that are both relevant and authoritative. A few links from high-authority, well-respected websites in your niche can significantly boost your website’s rankings, whereas a large volume of low-quality or irrelevant links can provide little to no SEO benefit—and may even hurt your rankings. High-quality backlinks come from authoritative and trustworthy websites that are relevant to your industry. While domain authority (DA), a metric developed by Moz, isn't an official ranking factor used by Google, it serves as a useful indicator of a site's credibility. In addition to authority, relevance is crucial—links from websites related to your niche hold more value than those from unrelated sources. For example, if you run a health and fitness blog, a backlink from a reputable health website is more valuable than one from a generic business directory or unrelated blog. Cost-Effective Link Building Strategies As we mentioned a few times already, link building doesn’t have to come with a hefty price tag. While many traditional link-building methods can be expensive, there are numerous cost-effective strategies that can help you secure high-quality backlinks without overspending. The key is to focus on creativity, value, and strategic outreach. Below, we explore 13 practical and affordable link-building techniques that can help improve your SEO and boost your website’s authority without breaking the bank. 1. Create Shareable, High-Quality Content One of the most effective and sustainable ways to build backlinks is to create linkable assets—high-quality, shareable content that naturally earns backlinks because it provides value to readers, answers common questions, or offers unique insights. This approach not only reduces the need for extensive outreach but also ensures that the backlinks you receive are relevant and authoritative. Linkable assets are pieces of content designed to be so valuable, informative, or engaging that other websites are compelled to link to them. These assets can come in various forms, but their common feature is that they offer something unique or highly useful to the target audience. They could include: In-depth guides and tutorials Original research and data Infographics and other visual data and trend representations Case studies Lists of resources, helpful material, tools, etc. 2. Use Link Building platforms Link-building platforms like WhitePress are powerful, cost-effective tools for acquiring high-quality backlinks without the need for extensive manual outreach. These platforms connect marketers, SEO professionals, and businesses with reputable websites open to content collaborations, offering opportunities for organic and strategic link-building. One of the major advantages is the clear cost visibility they offer, allowing users to see exactly how much they'll spend upfront, making it easier to manage budgets. Additionally, they save significant time by streamlining the entire process, which contributes to reducing overall costs. WhitePress connects you to thousands of websites across multiple industries and geographic regions. This allows you to diversify your backlink profile by acquiring links from a variety of sources, which is beneficial for SEO. Whether your focus is on local, national, or international markets, WhitePress platform offers ample opportunities to expand your reach while staying in control of costs. 3. Leverage Social Media for Link Opportunities Social media platforms are a powerful yet often underutilized tool for link building. While social media links themselves may not directly impact SEO due to their \"nofollow\" attribute, social media activity can indirectly lead to valuable backlinks. By promoting your content, engaging with influencers, and leveraging your social media presence, you can create opportunities for others to discover and link to your website. One of the most effective ways to leverage social media for link building is by engaging with influencers in your niche. Influencers have the power to amplify your content, and their followers often trust and act on their recommendations, leading to organic backlinks. Start by following influencers who are relevant to your industry on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Engage with their posts by commenting thoughtfully, retweeting, and liking their content. This helps you get on their radar and establishes a connection without directly asking for anything upfront. You can track social media mentions with tools like Google Alerts, Mention, Brand24, or BuzzSumo. 4. Guest Posting on Relevant Websites Guest posting is one of the most effective and budget-friendly link-building strategies, allowing you to gain high-quality backlinks, build relationships, and establish authority within your niche. By contributing valuable content to reputable websites in your industry, you not only earn backlinks but also reach new audiences. However, it’s important to approach guest posting strategically to avoid common pitfalls. To find guest posting opportunities, search for reputable blogs in your niche that accept guest contributions. You can use tools like Ahrefs to analyze potential sites or perform Google searches with phrases such as \"your niche + write for us\" to discover relevant websites. Analyzing your competitors' backlinks can also reveal where they have published guest posts, offering additional opportunities. 5. Utilize Connectively (Formerly known as HARO - Help a Reporter Out) Connectively, formerly known as HARO (Help a Reporter Out), is a platform that connects journalists with sources for their stories. It offers a valuable opportunity for businesses to gain media exposure and earn high-quality backlinks by providing expert insights and quotes to reporters. Connectively sends out daily queries from journalists seeking information on various topics, and if your response is selected, you can earn a mention and a backlink from reputable media outlets. To use Connectively effectively, it’s crucial to craft compelling responses. Start by responding quickly, as reporters often work on tight deadlines. Tailor your response specifically to the journalist's query by providing concise, valuable, and relevant information. Avoid generic responses and ensure that your expertise directly addresses the question. 6. The Art of Ethical Link Exchange Reciprocal linking, or link exchange, involves two websites agreeing to link to each other, often in a mutually beneficial arrangement. When done ethically, it can provide benefits such as increased referral traffic and an enhanced backlink profile, as long as the exchanged links are relevant and valuable to both audiences. Here, the key is to focus on quality over quantity. Only exchange links with websites that are relevant to your niche and provide value to your visitors. Always make sure the link placement is natural and adds context, rather than appearing as a forced attempt to manipulate rankings. Avoid large-scale or automated link exchanges, which can trigger penalties from search engines like Google. 7. Converting Brand Mentions into Backlinks To find unlinked mentions of your brand, you can use tools like Google Alerts, Mention, or Ahrefs. These tools monitor the web for any mention of your brand name, products, or services. Once you've identified unlinked mentions, the next step is to reach out to the webmaster or content creator. When reaching out, keep your request polite and professional. Acknowledge that you appreciate the mention of your brand, and politely ask if they could include a link back to your website. 8. Broken Link Building Broken link building is a strategy that involves finding broken links on other websites and offering your own relevant content as a replacement. This helps webmasters fix their broken links while providing you with a valuable backlink in return. It’s a win-win, as the website owner improves their user experience, and you earn a high-quality link. To implement broken link building, start by identifying broken links on websites in your niche. Tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Check My Links can help you scan websites for broken links. The easiest approach is to analyze your competitors’ backlink profiles to find broken backlinks leading to dead pages. Once you have identified a broken link, check if you already have content that could serve as a replacement. If not, consider creating a new resource that aligns with the broken link. Crafting effective outreach emails is key to this strategy. When reaching out to the site owner, be polite and highlight the issue with the broken link. Offer your content as a helpful replacement and explain how it would provide value to their readers. Keep the message concise and professional, focusing on the mutual benefits of fixing the broken link and using your resource as a replacement. 9. Competitive Link Analysis: Learning from Your Rivals Competitive link analysis involves examining your competitors' backlink profiles to uncover valuable insights into their link-building strategies. By analyzing where your competitors are getting their backlinks, you can identify potential opportunities for your own site and replicate their success. To conduct a competitor backlink analysis, use tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Moz. These tools allow you to explore the backlinks your competitors have acquired, revealing linking domains, anchor text, and link authority. Start by identifying your top competitors and inputting their URLs into these tools to analyze their backlink profiles. Once you’ve uncovered their backlinks, focus on replicating the ones that are relevant and high-quality. For example, if they have earned links through guest posting, reach out to the same publications or websites with your own unique content pitch. Also, look for unique link opportunities your competitors may have missed by analyzing gaps in their strategy. 10. Build Relationships with Industry Influencers Relationship-based link building focuses on forming long-term connections with industry influencers, which can lead to organic backlinks and increased exposure over time. Rather than one-off link exchanges, building genuine relationships with influencers can result in sustained collaboration, content sharing, and mutual promotion. When using social media and email for outreach, keep the communication concise and clear. Personalize every message, avoid generic requests, and focus on building a relationship over time rather than pushing for immediate links. This approach creates a foundation for ongoing collaborations, which naturally leads to more link opportunities. 11. Engage in Online Communities and Forums Participating in online communities and forums can be a valuable way to build links while establishing authority in your niche. The key is to engage genuinely, offering meaningful contributions rather than simply dropping links. Communities like Reddit, Quora, and niche-specific forums such as Stack Overflow (for tech) or specialized industry boards are great places to start. When including links, do so naturally and only when relevant to the discussion. You can include links in responses when they directly add value to the conversation or provide additional resources. Some forums also allow you to add links in your signature, but this should be done sparingly and only in a professional manner. 12. Leveraging Business Directories for Quality Backlinks Business directories still play a valuable role in modern SEO, providing opportunities for quality backlinks while increasing your online visibility. When listed in reputable, industry-specific directories, your site can benefit from both the authority of the directory and increased referral traffic. Some examples of reputable directories include Yelp, TripAdvisor, and niche-specific directories such as Clutch (for B2B services) and Houzz (for home improvement professionals). 13. Outreach Outreach involves connecting with website owners to secure backlinks by offering valuable resources like expert insights, data, or well-crafted content. The key to successful outreach is personalization and relevance. Identify websites in your niche that could benefit from your resource and craft a message that highlights the specific value it adds to their audience or content. Instead of generic requests, tailor your pitch to the site’s needs, showing genuine interest in their work. Be respectful of their time, keep your message concise, and clearly outline how your resource benefits their readers. Maximizing your link-building efforts on a budget often requires a strategic approach, and one effective method to consider is tiered link building. This strategy involves creating layers of backlinks to amplify the authority passed to your target pages, helping you achieve better rankings without overspending. By combining high-quality links with secondary tiers that support them, you can create a cost-efficient and scalable system. Measuring the Success of Your Link Building Campaign To know whether your link building efforts are actually succeeding in achieving your set goals, you’ll need a way to measure their impact. Thankfully, there is a range of tools that help track key metrics and provide insights into the effectiveness of your backlink profile. Google Analytics is a powerful tool for tracking the performance of your backlinks. By navigating to the Acquisition > All Traffic > Referrals section, you can see the websites that are sending traffic to your site through backlinks. Additionally, you can set up Goals in Google Analytics to track how referral traffic from specific backlinks converts into desired actions on your site, such as sign-ups, purchases, or downloads. When tracking your performance, keep these metrics in mind: Domain Authority (DA) or Domain Rating (DR): These are metrics provided by tools like Moz (DA) or Ahrefs (DR) that estimate the strength and authority of a website’s backlink profile. Number of Backlinks: Tracking the number of new backlinks over time helps you see how well your campaign is acquiring links. However, quality should be prioritized over quantity, so focus on authoritative links from relevant sites. Referral Traffic: Backlinks can drive direct traffic to your site. Google Analytics can help you track how much referral traffic is coming from the links you’ve built. An increase in referral traffic shows that your links are placed on websites with engaged audiences. Keyword Rankings: High-quality backlinks can improve your rankings for targeted keywords. Monitor the search engine rankings of your key terms to see if your link-building efforts are positively impacting your SEO. Linking Domains: This metric tracks the number of unique domains that link back to your website. Having diverse, authoritative linking domains is more valuable than getting many links from a single source. For budget-conscious campaigns, setting realistic and achievable goals is essential. Instead of focusing on rapid domain authority growth or hundreds of backlinks, prioritize smaller, attainable targets, such as building a set number of high-quality links from niche-relevant sites within a certain timeframe. Aim for steady, incremental growth rather than expecting immediate results. Common Pitfalls to Avoid in Budget Link Building While budget-friendly link-building can be effective, there are several pitfalls that can undermine your efforts and even harm your website’s SEO. Black-hat SEO techniques often promise quick and cheap backlinks, but they come with significant risks. Tactics such as buying links, using automated link-building tools, or participating in link schemes may offer short-term gains but can lead to penalties from search engines, especially Google. Link farms and private blog networks (PBNs) are often marketed as inexpensive solutions to quickly build a large number of backlinks. However, links from these sources are generally low-quality, and Google is becoming increasingly adept at identifying these networks and penalizing sites that participate in them. Instead of relying on these shortcuts, it’s important to seek out high-quality backlinks from relevant, authoritative websites that provide real value to their audience. A few strong, reputable backlinks are far more beneficial than a large number of low-quality ones. Conclusion: Building a Sustainable Link Profile on a Budget Developing a strong link profile on a budget is entirely achievable with the right strategies and a focus on quality over quantity. Budget-friendly link-building requires patience and creativity—by prioritizing high-quality backlinks over low-quality alternatives, you can enhance your website’s SEO incrementally without breaking the bank. Throughout this guide, we’ve explored a variety of cost-effective link-building strategies, such as creating shareable content, leveraging link-building platforms, guest posting, and engaging in online communities. We’ve also emphasized the importance of avoiding black-hat techniques like link farms and PBNs, which can lead to search engine penalties, and the need to maintain a natural link profile by earning backlinks from diverse and authoritative sources. Ultimately, building a sustainable link profile on a budget is about consistency, strategic outreach, and long-term relationship building. Stay focused on high-quality, relevant backlinks, and you’ll see your site’s authority grow and your search engine rankings improve—all without overspending.

KPI Example Best Practices for Link Building 📊 Track Your Link Building Success 📊 Earn High-Quality Backlinks Focus on securing links from authoritative and relevant websites to boost your site’s credibility and search rankings. 📈 Create Link-Worthy Content Develop high-value content like guides, infographics, and research studies that naturally attract backlinks. 🔄 Build Relationships for Outreach Engage with industry leaders, bloggers, and websites to foster link-building opportunities through guest posts and collaborations. 📅 Monitor & Maintain Backlinks Regularly track your backlinks to remove spammy links and ensure your site maintains a strong and healthy link profile. What is Link Building Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in link building are specific, measurable values that show how effectively your backlink strategy achieves key business objectives. These aren’t just random numbers—they’re the compass guiding your entire link building journey. Good link building management depends on these indicators to tell you whether your efforts are actually paying off. Without clear KPIs, you’re basically building links in the dark, with no way to know if your hard work translates to real business results. A thoughtful link building report includes these metrics to show progress and ROI to clients or stakeholders. The right KPIs help you connect your link building work directly to business outcomes like increased traffic, better rankings, and ultimately, more conversions. The Role of KPIs in Achieving Link Building Goals KPIs serve as both the roadmap and measuring stick for your link building strategy. They transform vague goals like “get more backlinks” into specific, trackable objectives. When used properly, these indicators help you focus your resources on the most productive link building tactics. Link building reporting becomes much more valuable when it centers around meaningful KPIs rather than just raw numbers. According to research compiled by Databox.com, the most valuable metrics to track include the number of new backlinks earned, average link quality, and the number of referring domains. These indicators provide actionable insights that help you refine your approach over time. For SEO agencies, establishing clear KPIs from the start sets proper expectations with clients and provides a framework for showing success. When everyone agrees on what success looks like, it’s easier to build trust and showcase the value of your link building services. Key Link Building KPIs to Monitor Number of Backlinks When developing your link building management strategy, the debate between quantity and quality is crucial. While tracking the total number of backlinks gives you a baseline metric, the quality of those links determines their actual impact on your site’s authority. A good link building report should highlight not just how many backlinks you’ve acquired, but their quality distribution. Research shows that 76% of SEO professionals use Ahrefs specifically for link building purposes, allowing them to assess metrics like Domain Rating (DR) alongside raw backlink counts. This combination creates a more meaningful picture of link profile strength. For effective link metrics tracking, try categorizing backlinks by authority levels. High-quality backlinks from authoritative sites in your niche deliver significantly more value than dozens of links from low-quality sources. According to data gathered by Databox, the average link quality (measuring both authority and relevance) ranks as one of the most critical KPIs to monitor in your link building efforts. Referring Domains The number of unique referring domains often proves more valuable than raw backlink counts. This metric reveals the breadth of your link profile and serves as a stronger indicator of your site’s perceived authority across the web. In link building reporting, highlighting growth in unique referring domains shows meaningful progress to clients or stakeholders. Search engines interpret links from diverse sources as multiple independent “votes of confidence” in your content. According to Databox research, the number of referring domains is considered one of the top link building metrics by industry experts. For SEO agencies, prioritizing domain diversity over sheer backlink volume often yields better results. One effective approach is tracking the ratio of referring domains to total backlinks—a healthy profile shows steady growth in both areas without excessive links from a small number of sources. Anchor Text Variation The distribution of anchor text in your backlink profile significantly impacts your SEO performance. Natural variation in anchor text helps search engines understand what your content is about while avoiding over-optimization penalties. When preparing your link building report, include anchor text distribution analysis to identify potential issues or opportunities. Databox insights confirm that anchor text distribution is among the key metrics valued by SEO professionals for evaluating link building success. Aim for a natural mix of branded terms (your company name), naked URLs, generic phrases (“click here,” “learn more”), and relevant keywords. Too many exact-match keyword anchors can trigger spam filters, while too many generic anchors might limit the contextual value of your links. Link Relevancy and Contextual Value Link relevancy has become increasingly important as search algorithms grow more sophisticated. Backlinks from websites in related industries or discussing similar topics carry more weight than random links from unrelated sources. In your link building management dashboard, include metrics that assess contextual relevance—not just domain authority. This might involve categorizing backlinks by industry, content type, or topical overlap with your site. The contextual value of a link often determines its true impact on your rankings more than raw authority metrics. For SEO agencies, showing the relevancy of acquired links adds another dimension to client reporting. Beyond showing that you’ve secured links from high-authority sites, you can highlight how these links come from sources that align with the client’s industry and audience interests. Follow vs. Nofollow Links Modern link building strategies should balance follow links (which pass SEO value) with nofollow links (which typically don’t). While follow links remain the priority for direct ranking benefits, nofollow links still contribute to a natural-looking backlink profile. When tracking link metrics, categorize links by their attribute type to ensure a balanced distribution. Too many follow links from low-quality sources can appear manipulative, while a profile containing only follow links looks unnatural in today’s linking environment. According to Databox data, successful link building campaigns typically track both follow and nofollow acquisition separately while maintaining focus on high-quality links regardless of attribute. Even nofollow links from respected sources can drive significant referral traffic and brand visibility. Traffic and Engagement from Backlinks Beyond their SEO impact, high-quality backlinks should generate direct referral traffic and engagement. Monitoring these downstream effects provides a more complete picture of your link building ROI. Effective link building reporting connects backlink acquisition to actual business outcomes by tracking metrics like referral traffic, time on site from referral sources, and conversion rates from backlink traffic. This approach demonstrates value beyond simple link counts or domain authority scores. For SEO agencies, showcasing traffic generation alongside traditional link metrics creates more compelling client reports. Using tools like Google Analytics alongside specialized SEO platforms provides this comprehensive view. As Databox research indicates, both Google Analytics and Google Search Console are essential tools for evaluating the true impact of link building efforts on website performance. Measuring and Analyzing Link Building KPIs Essential Tools for Tracking Link Building Metrics Effective link building management requires robust tools that provide comprehensive data on your backlink profile. According to research from Databox, Ahrefs stands out as the most popular tool for link building campaigns, used by 80% of surveyed contributors. Its comprehensive backlink analysis makes it an industry standard for tracking link metrics. Beyond Ahrefs, SEMrush and Moz offer similar capabilities for backlink analysis, with each providing unique features that may better suit certain organizational needs. For SEO agencies handling multiple clients, these tools offer efficient ways to monitor progress across various campaigns simultaneously. Interestingly, while Ahrefs is widely used for link building specifically, 51.3% of SEO professionals prefer SEMrush as their favorite overall SEO tool. For thorough link building reporting, don’t overlook free tools like Google Search Console, which provides valuable data on how search engines view your backlinks. Combining data from multiple sources into a unified dashboard using tools like Databox can streamline your reporting process, creating clear visualizations that help clients understand progress at a glance. For outreach tracking, tools like Hunter have become popular for gathering prospect email addresses and managing communication efforts. Interpreting Complex Data for Clear Insights The challenge in link building reporting isn’t collecting data—it’s transforming that data into actionable insights. Start by establishing baseline measurements for each KPI before launching new campaigns. This creates a reference point for measuring progress and identifying trends over time. When analyzing link data, focus on correlation patterns between different metrics. For instance, if referring domains increase but organic traffic remains flat, this might indicate you’re acquiring links from irrelevant or low-quality sources. Look beyond surface-level numbers to understand the story your data is telling about your link building effectiveness. For link building management purposes, segment your data by campaign, content type, or acquisition method. This granular approach reveals which strategies deliver the best results and deserve more resources. According to Databox research, successful SEO professionals track metrics like response rate to outreach emails alongside traditional link metrics to optimize their processes from end to end. Benchmarking Against Industry Standards Establishing realistic expectations requires understanding how your link building performance compares to industry standards. While every website starts from a different baseline, certain benchmarks can guide your strategy development and goal-setting process. For SEO agencies, contextualizing link building reports with industry averages helps manage client expectations. For example, highly competitive industries like finance or health typically require more authoritative backlinks to see movement in rankings compared to less competitive niches. Understanding these differences prevents setting unrealistic targets that lead to perceived failure. Research from Databox indicates that tracking Domain Rating (DR) of acquired backlinks provides valuable context when benchmarking link quality. By comparing your DR distribution against competitors, you can identify gaps and opportunities in your link building strategy. Additionally, tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush offer industry-specific benchmarking features that allow you to measure your performance against similar websites. When establishing benchmarks, consider factors beyond raw link counts. Metrics like link growth rate, referring domain diversity, and traffic from backlinks often provide more meaningful comparisons than absolute numbers. For SEO agencies, creating custom benchmarking reports that account for client-specific factors like site age, existing authority, and competitive landscape delivers more valuable insights than generic industry averages. Remember that benchmarking isn’t about matching exact numbers but understanding relative performance. A new website might celebrate acquiring ten high-quality backlinks in a month, while an established authority site might consider that same number disappointing. The key is establishing realistic, contextual goals based on where you start and where your competitors stand. Strategies to Optimize Link Building through KPIs Enhancing Domain Authority Domain authority remains one of the most coveted link metrics in SEO. To boost this critical indicator, focus your link building management efforts on quality rather than quantity. Start by identifying high-authority websites in your niche that could provide valuable backlinks. According to Databox research, tracking Domain Rating (DR) of acquired backlinks is a practice followed by 67% of marketers when measuring the quality of their links. Implement a tiered outreach strategy that prioritizes high-authority targets while maintaining a steady flow of mid-level acquisitions. For effective link building reporting, track how each new backlink impacts your overall domain authority over time. This approach demonstrates clear value to clients or stakeholders by connecting specific link building efforts to measurable authority growth. Consider establishing topic clusters in your content strategy, creating comprehensive resource pages that naturally attract links from authoritative sources. This approach not only enhances domain authority but also establishes topical relevance—another factor search engines increasingly value. For SEO agencies, highlighting topic authority growth alongside domain authority in your link building reports provides clients with a more complete picture of campaign success. Improving Anchor Text Distribution Anchor text distribution directly impacts how search engines interpret your backlink profile. Your link metrics should include detailed anchor text analysis to identify potential optimization opportunities or overoptimization risks. According to Databox, anchor text distribution is among the key link building reporting metrics valued by SEO professionals. To optimize your anchor text strategy, aim for a natural distribution that includes: Branded anchors (your brand name) Naked URLs (your exact website address) Generic phrases (“click here,” “learn more”) Partial-match keywords (variations of target terms) Exact-match keywords (used sparingly) Avoid excessive exact-match keyword anchors, which can trigger algorithm penalties. Instead, focus on diversification that mimics natural linking patterns. When conducting link building for SEO agencies, educate clients about the importance of varied anchor text rather than fixating on exact-match keywords. Regular anchor text audits should be part of your link building management process. These reviews help identify potential risk areas before they become problems. If your analysis reveals an overreliance on specific anchor types, adjust your outreach strategy to request more diverse anchor text in future link building efforts. Strategies for Acquiring High-Quality Backlinks High-quality backlinks form the backbone of effective link building campaigns. Start by creating truly exceptional, linkable content assets—comprehensive guides, original research, or interactive tools that naturally attract references. These resources should address specific pain points in your industry or provide unique insights not available elsewhere. Targeted outreach remains essential for acquiring premium backlinks. Tools like Hunter, mentioned in Databox research, can streamline your outreach process by gathering prospect email addresses efficiently. Track your outreach response rates as part of your link building report to continuously refine your approach and messaging. For SEO agencies, demonstrating the quality of acquired links goes beyond domain metrics. Consider including additional contextual information in your link building reporting, such as: Topic relevance to client’s industry Estimated monthly traffic of linking pages Social engagement metrics of linking domains Editorial standards of linking publications These quality indicators provide clients with a more comprehensive understanding of your link acquisition strategy and value. Remember that a single high-quality, contextually relevant backlink often delivers more value than multiple lower-quality links. Managing and Mitigating Spammy Links Even the most careful link building strategies can attract unwanted backlinks. Proactive link profile monitoring should be a core component of your link building management approach. According to Databox findings, successful SEO professionals regularly audit their backlink profiles to identify potential toxic links before they harm rankings. Implement a systematic process for identifying and addressing problematic links: Conduct regular backlink audits (monthly or quarterly) Flag suspicious links based on quality metrics and relevance Attempt outreach for removal when appropriate Use Google’s Disavow Tool for links that cannot be removed Document all actions in your link building report For clients, explain that some toxic link accumulation is normal and doesn’t indicate a problem with your strategy. Instead, emphasize how your proactive management protects their site from potential penalties. When presenting link metrics, include a “toxicity trend” that shows how your efforts keep harmful links under control over time. SEO agencies should consider including regular backlink audits as a standard service offering. This proactive approach demonstrates value beyond just link acquisition and positions your agency as a comprehensive link building management partner rather than simply a link builder. As search algorithms continue to emphasize quality over quantity, this protective service becomes increasingly valuable to clients concerned about their long-term search visibility. Addressing Common Challenges and FAQs How Long Does It Take to See Improvements in Link Building KPIs? One of the most common questions in link building management is about timeline expectations. The truth is that improvements in link metrics vary widely depending on several factors. Typically, you’ll notice changes in direct link KPIs (like referring domains or backlink counts) immediately, but their impact on authority metrics and rankings often takes longer. For most sites, expect to see meaningful movement in domain authority metrics within 3-6 months of consistent, quality link building. However, competitive niches may require longer timeframes. When creating a link building report for clients or stakeholders, it’s crucial to set realistic expectations about these timelines from the beginning. Several factors influence how quickly you’ll see results: Your site’s existing authority (higher authority sites often see faster impacts) The quality and relevance of acquired links Consistency of link acquisition over time Competitive landscape in your niche According to Databox research, tracking both immediate metrics (new backlinks earned, referring domains) and lagging indicators (domain rating, organic traffic) provides a more complete picture of progress. This approach helps manage expectations while still demonstrating incremental wins along the way. Is It Necessary to Remove Low-Quality Links? Proper backlink hygiene remains essential in 2024’s SEO landscape. While Google has improved its ability to ignore low-quality links rather than penalizing sites for them, proactive management of your link profile is still a best practice in link building reporting. For SEO agencies, regular link audits should be part of your standard service offering. These audits help identify potentially harmful links before they impact client performance. When toxic links are discovered, you have several options: Contact webmasters requesting removal (effective but time-consuming) Use Google’s Disavow Tool (especially for links that can’t be removed) Monitor without action (for borderline cases where disavowal might do more harm than good) The key is developing a consistent process for evaluating link quality. Not every “low-quality” link requires action—focus on truly spammy or manipulative links that could trigger algorithmic or manual penalties. Document your decisions in your link building management system to maintain a clear history of actions taken. Impact of Internal and Social Media Links on KPIs While external backlinks often get the spotlight, internal linking and social media signals play important supporting roles in comprehensive link building strategies. Internal links help distribute page authority throughout your site and establish topical relevance clusters that complement your external link building efforts. In your link building report, consider including internal linking metrics alongside external backlink data. This holistic approach demonstrates how your overall link strategy (both internal and external) works together to improve site authority and user experience. Social media links typically carry “nofollow” attributes, limiting their direct SEO impact. However, they deliver other benefits worth tracking in your link metrics dashboard: Increased content visibility and amplification Potential for attracting natural backlinks from social audiences Direct referral traffic that can lead to conversions Brand awareness and reputation building For SEO agencies, explaining this ecosystem approach helps clients understand how different types of links contribute to overall performance. Tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console can help attribute traffic and engagement from these various link sources. FAQs Link Building Metrics “More links always mean better rankings.” This persistent myth needs addressing in client education. Quality and relevance now far outweigh quantity. A focused strategy targeting fewer, higher-quality links often delivers better results than mass acquisition of mediocre links. “Only follow links matter for SEO.” While follow links pass more direct ranking power, nofollow links still provide brand exposure, referral traffic, and diversification of your link profile. A natural link profile includes both types. “Domain Authority is an official Google metric.” Many clients confuse third-party authority metrics (like Moz’s DA or Ahrefs’ DR) with Google’s actual ranking factors. Explain in your link building reporting that these are useful comparative tools but not direct Google rankings factors. “All link building happens quickly.” Sustainable link building is a marathon, not a sprint. Educate stakeholders that quality link acquisition takes time and rushing typically leads to lower-quality links that deliver less long-term value. “Anchor text should always include keywords.” Excessive keyword-rich anchor text can appear manipulative. A diverse, natural-looking anchor text profile performs better long-term than one over-optimized for keywords.

Techniques like data-driven stories, expert commentary, and newsworthy content can attract high-authority links from media outlets.

This approach complements active outreach strategies. Technical SEO’s Impact on Link Equity How your site handles redirects, canonicalization, and internal linking directly affects how link equity flows through your site. Technical optimizations can maximize the value of your link building efforts. Competitive Link Analysis Techniques Advanced competitive analysis helps identify link gaps and opportunities.

If backlink acquisition slows, adjustments to content marketing or outreach efforts may be needed. A SEO Manager may track this KPI monthly to report on link-building success, while a content marketer may analyze backlink trends to optimize future content strategies. KPI Example Best Practices for Link Building 📊 Track Your Link Building Success 📊 Earn High-Quality Backlinks Focus on securing links from authoritative and relevant websites to boost your site’s credibility and search rankings. 📈 Create Link-Worthy Content Develop high-value content like guides, infographics, and research studies that naturally attract backlinks. 🔄 Build Relationships for Outreach Engage with industry leaders, bloggers, and websites to foster link-building opportunities through guest posts and collaborations. 📅 Monitor & Maintain Backlinks Regularly track your backlinks to remove spammy links and ensure your site maintains a strong and healthy link profile. What is Link Building Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in link building are specific, measurable values that show how effectively your backlink strategy achieves key business objectives. These aren’t just random numbers—they’re the compass guiding your entire link building journey. Good link building management depends on these indicators to tell you whether your efforts are actually paying off. Without clear KPIs, you’re basically building links in the dark, with no way to know if your hard work translates to real business results. A thoughtful link building report includes these metrics to show progress and ROI to clients or stakeholders. The right KPIs help you connect your link building work directly to business outcomes like increased traffic, better rankings, and ultimately, more conversions. The Role of KPIs in Achieving Link Building Goals KPIs serve as both the roadmap and measuring stick for your link building strategy. They transform vague goals like “get more backlinks” into specific, trackable objectives. When used properly, these indicators help you focus your resources on the most productive link building tactics. Link building reporting becomes much more valuable when it centers around meaningful KPIs rather than just raw numbers. According to research compiled by Databox.com, the most valuable metrics to track include the number of new backlinks earned, average link quality, and the number of referring domains. These indicators provide actionable insights that help you refine your approach over time. For SEO agencies, establishing clear KPIs from the start sets proper expectations with clients and provides a framework for showing success. When everyone agrees on what success looks like, it’s easier to build trust and showcase the value of your link building services. Key Link Building KPIs to Monitor Number of Backlinks When developing your link building management strategy, the debate between quantity and quality is crucial. While tracking the total number of backlinks gives you a baseline metric, the quality of those links determines their actual impact on your site’s authority. A good link building report should highlight not just how many backlinks you’ve acquired, but their quality distribution. Research shows that 76% of SEO professionals use Ahrefs specifically for link building purposes, allowing them to assess metrics like Domain Rating (DR) alongside raw backlink counts. This combination creates a more meaningful picture of link profile strength. For effective link metrics tracking, try categorizing backlinks by authority levels. High-quality backlinks from authoritative sites in your niche deliver significantly more value than dozens of links from low-quality sources. According to data gathered by Databox, the average link quality (measuring both authority and relevance) ranks as one of the most critical KPIs to monitor in your link building efforts. Referring Domains The number of unique referring domains often proves more valuable than raw backlink counts. This metric reveals the breadth of your link profile and serves as a stronger indicator of your site’s perceived authority across the web. In link building reporting, highlighting growth in unique referring domains shows meaningful progress to clients or stakeholders. Search engines interpret links from diverse sources as multiple independent “votes of confidence” in your content. According to Databox research, the number of referring domains is considered one of the top link building metrics by industry experts. For SEO agencies, prioritizing domain diversity over sheer backlink volume often yields better results. One effective approach is tracking the ratio of referring domains to total backlinks—a healthy profile shows steady growth in both areas without excessive links from a small number of sources. Anchor Text Variation The distribution of anchor text in your backlink profile significantly impacts your SEO performance. Natural variation in anchor text helps search engines understand what your content is about while avoiding over-optimization penalties. When preparing your link building report, include anchor text distribution analysis to identify potential issues or opportunities. Databox insights confirm that anchor text distribution is among the key metrics valued by SEO professionals for evaluating link building success. Aim for a natural mix of branded terms (your company name), naked URLs, generic phrases (“click here,” “learn more”), and relevant keywords. Too many exact-match keyword anchors can trigger spam filters, while too many generic anchors might limit the contextual value of your links. Link Relevancy and Contextual Value Link relevancy has become increasingly important as search algorithms grow more sophisticated. Backlinks from websites in related industries or discussing similar topics carry more weight than random links from unrelated sources. In your link building management dashboard, include metrics that assess contextual relevance—not just domain authority. This might involve categorizing backlinks by industry, content type, or topical overlap with your site. The contextual value of a link often determines its true impact on your rankings more than raw authority metrics. For SEO agencies, showing the relevancy of acquired links adds another dimension to client reporting. Beyond showing that you’ve secured links from high-authority sites, you can highlight how these links come from sources that align with the client’s industry and audience interests. Follow vs. Nofollow Links Modern link building strategies should balance follow links (which pass SEO value) with nofollow links (which typically don’t). While follow links remain the priority for direct ranking benefits, nofollow links still contribute to a natural-looking backlink profile. When tracking link metrics, categorize links by their attribute type to ensure a balanced distribution. Too many follow links from low-quality sources can appear manipulative, while a profile containing only follow links looks unnatural in today’s linking environment. According to Databox data, successful link building campaigns typically track both follow and nofollow acquisition separately while maintaining focus on high-quality links regardless of attribute. Even nofollow links from respected sources can drive significant referral traffic and brand visibility. Traffic and Engagement from Backlinks Beyond their SEO impact, high-quality backlinks should generate direct referral traffic and engagement. Monitoring these downstream effects provides a more complete picture of your link building ROI. Effective link building reporting connects backlink acquisition to actual business outcomes by tracking metrics like referral traffic, time on site from referral sources, and conversion rates from backlink traffic. This approach demonstrates value beyond simple link counts or domain authority scores. For SEO agencies, showcasing traffic generation alongside traditional link metrics creates more compelling client reports. Using tools like Google Analytics alongside specialized SEO platforms provides this comprehensive view. As Databox research indicates, both Google Analytics and Google Search Console are essential tools for evaluating the true impact of link building efforts on website performance. Measuring and Analyzing Link Building KPIs Essential Tools for Tracking Link Building Metrics Effective link building management requires robust tools that provide comprehensive data on your backlink profile. According to research from Databox, Ahrefs stands out as the most popular tool for link building campaigns, used by 80% of surveyed contributors. Its comprehensive backlink analysis makes it an industry standard for tracking link metrics. Beyond Ahrefs, SEMrush and Moz offer similar capabilities for backlink analysis, with each providing unique features that may better suit certain organizational needs. For SEO agencies handling multiple clients, these tools offer efficient ways to monitor progress across various campaigns simultaneously. Interestingly, while Ahrefs is widely used for link building specifically, 51.3% of SEO professionals prefer SEMrush as their favorite overall SEO tool. For thorough link building reporting, don’t overlook free tools like Google Search Console, which provides valuable data on how search engines view your backlinks. Combining data from multiple sources into a unified dashboard using tools like Databox can streamline your reporting process, creating clear visualizations that help clients understand progress at a glance. For outreach tracking, tools like Hunter have become popular for gathering prospect email addresses and managing communication efforts. Interpreting Complex Data for Clear Insights The challenge in link building reporting isn’t collecting data—it’s transforming that data into actionable insights. Start by establishing baseline measurements for each KPI before launching new campaigns. This creates a reference point for measuring progress and identifying trends over time. When analyzing link data, focus on correlation patterns between different metrics. For instance, if referring domains increase but organic traffic remains flat, this might indicate you’re acquiring links from irrelevant or low-quality sources. Look beyond surface-level numbers to understand the story your data is telling about your link building effectiveness. For link building management purposes, segment your data by campaign, content type, or acquisition method.

According to Databox research, successful SEO professionals track metrics like response rate to outreach emails alongside traditional link metrics to optimize their processes from end to end.

For SEO agencies, creating custom benchmarking reports that account for client-specific factors like site age, existing authority, and competitive landscape delivers more valuable insights than generic industry averages. Remember that benchmarking isn’t about matching exact numbers but understanding relative performance. A new website might celebrate acquiring ten high-quality backlinks in a month, while an established authority site might consider that same number disappointing.

How to create backlinks for SEO Now that you know the significance of backlinks in SEO, let's dive into 15 ways for your website to get more backlinks. 1. Standard of Writing, Link-Worthy Material Offer other bloggers and business leaders the opportunity to connect back to your site by creating your own content. You can't write just any form of content, but by writing quality, link-worthy content, you need to earn those backlinks. If it's useful, actionable, unique, and important, other bloggers and websites will only connect to your content. Do you want to learn how better content can be created? Check out our basic tips for writing conversion blog posts. Some forms of content are also available that get more shares and backlinks than others. Here are several instances of material that receives the most number of backlinks For getting Quality Backlinks to your website, how to articles that show readers how to do something are perfect. For example, you can write a \"How to Save Money for a Holiday\" blog post that can be linked to via travel blogs, websites for budgeting and finance, websites for travel agents, and more. Articles from the list often referred to as lists, are merely articles published as lists. Articles on the list are immensely popular online because they are so simple to read. Readers can quickly search the article and read the sections that are important to them because of the numerical list. Some of the examples for the list article are: Quizzes go online for a lot of shares because well, they're fun! Like many quizzes of popular social media pages and websites like Scoopwhoop and Buzzfeed. Using quizzes to get more backlinks But, if you want to get more backlinks to your blog, no matter how fun it is, you probably shouldn't make a quiz like this. You need to get relevant backlinks, as we described previously. But instead of making a cute Buzzfeed-Esque questionnaire, to get more backlinks from relevant websites, create a quiz that's relevant to your niche. Bloggers love to connect to authoritative guides because without having to go into too much detail themselves, it helps them illustrate a concept to their readers. So, to get more Quality Backlinks, create lengthy, informative guides. We've built several common definitive guides at Creative Thinks Media, such as: Statistics are also used to back up their arguments with data from other bloggers and websites. Take advantage of this and build your own statistical roundup message. Like this website named IsItWP, a pretty impressive blog was developed by them. They created a blog post with figures and information from 100+ WordPress. This post gets lots of backlinks from other blogs and posts related to WordPress. Any of these ideas for blog posts will help you get free and natural backlinks quickly, but we also have to note another unique form of content called content from Skyscraper. Let's explore the material of Skyscraper in the next segment. 2. Build Content from Skyscraper Skyscraper content is a connection building technique that includes identifying, enhancing, and duplicating the backlinks to existing common content online. Simply search for your subject of choice on Google. For example, type \"social media marketing\" into the search bar if you want to write a guide on social media marketing. The findings that appear on the first page are the most common and should have the most backlinks. From the first search results page, pick an article and write your own post that is 10X better. You can make your article longer and more in-depth, add photos of a quality that are missing in the original article, or add additional material that has not been included. Your fresh and enhanced content on search engines should soar well beyond the current content. Then to locate the original article's backlinks, use a backlink checker tool like the one from Ahrefs. You can reach out to those sites until you find all of the sites that connect to the original post, add your superior article, and ask them instead to link to your article. 3. Start Blogging for Guest Guest blogging is a tried-and-true way to attract a whole new audience to your company and every guest post you land will also give you at least 1 byline backlink to your web. The author of the guest posts, for example, gets to tell the readers a little about their experience and knowledge in the byline below and they get to add a link pointing back to their own website. In addition, several publications allow guest bloggers to also connect to their own website within the post. This implies that you have power over which particular pages or articles in the article are connected to on your website. Reach out to famous blogs that welcome guest entries. Only do a quick Google search for phrases like to find blogs that welcome guest posts, It's time to submit your pitch until you find blogs that you can contribute to! Come up with a great idea for the subject, provide a brief overview of the article, and persuade the owner of the site that their readers will be helpful with your content. You will create a lot of backlinks and get a boost in website traffic from a good guest blogging strategy. 4. Build Infographics You can also use infographics to create connections, aside from writing lengthy, in-depth blog posts, which can take a lot of time. Infographics are visual representations of information or information that are used to rapidly display details. They are one of the most shared content formats online since infographics are visual. This infographic, The Everyday Lives of Popular Creative People for instance, currently has 656 links from other pages to it. Informative, entertaining infographics can be used by other blogs and publications to spice up their own content and connect back to the original author, you. Don't worry, to make an awesome-looking infographic, you don't need to be a pro artist. There is a range of tools for the development of visual content that let you create infographics easily. Canva and Piktochart are a pair that you can use free of charge. 5. Comment on Blogs of high quality Commenting on blogs is one of the best methods of having backlinks. But, blog comments have to be done correctly. If you comment on a lot of blogs without any justification behind it other than having spam, you might come across spammy. Think of blog commenting as a way to connect with the community in order to avoid coming across as a spammer. Leaving comments on blogs gives you the ability to connect and add your opinions or advice to your peers. Follow these measures when leaving a blog comment: Be mindful, though that the blog owner might trash your comment when adding a link, thinking your link is spam. You should have a commenting account or use the comment tool to add your URL in the right place to prevent this. On any blog, don't just comment though. Be sure to choose high-quality blogs that have a 60+ domain authority. Using a tool like MozBar, you can verify the domain authority of a blog. For online forums, this approach works just as well. Try to search the web for forums relevant to your niche and enter the discussion there as well. 6. Reply to Quora Questions Quality Backlinks You can also respond to questions on Quora, similar to commenting on blogs. Quora is a question-and-answer forum where users on the Internet ask, answer, and edit questions. Questions relating to your niche on Quora can be found, answered with your expert advice, and linked back to your website. Not only does this allow you to get more backlinks for your website, but Quora users are encouraged to visit your website to see what other advice you have to share. 7. Giving testimonials Quality Backlinks By giving other companies some love, you can also get more backlinks to your blog. You can agree to send a testimonial to that business in return for a connection back to your website if you love a product/service. Many businesses use social evidence testimonials and they will feature them prominently on their homepage or a page devoted to customer success tales. These satisfied users of Shopify, for example, posted their testimonials and got a connection back to their own websites. 8. Look for Pages for Tools Resource pages contain a list of tools and connections that the owners of websites feel are useful to their audience. For example, a fly fishing website can have a resource page containing links to recommended fishing equipment, lists of the best fishing spots, and fly fishing tips for beginners. You can reach out to the owners of these resource pages and ask them to add you to the list if you blog about fishing or your company sells fishing-related items. Bear in mind that many sites only placed items that they know and use on their resource pages. Try proposing a partnership instead of straight-up asking for a mention. This helps the owner of the website to get to know the product and you have a much greater opportunity to build that relationship. Do a quick Google search for your niche keyword with words like \"helpful resource pages\" to find related resource pages. Or try searches like “useful links’’ and “resource list.” It will help you create more backlinks to your site and generate more traffic from your ideal customers or readers by being added to the appropriate resource pages. 9. Help out a Reporter Quality Backlinks Help a Reporter Out (HARO) is an online forum for journalists to gain public input to use in their upcoming reports. Not only does this support reporters with their reports, but it provides you with chances for your website to get backlinks. For instance, you might give a reporter your advice if you own a snow removal business to help homeowners prepare for heavy snowfall. To their post, they can add your thoughts and of course, provide a link back to your blog. All you have to do is register with HARO and they will send source requests directly to your inbox that are important to your industry knowledge or experience. Pitch it to them and if they're interested, the reporter can contact you. 10. Be Interviewed You may even reach out to magazines, blogs, and even vloggers to get interviewed, besides signing up for HARO. A perfect way to receive a backlink to your site is to have an online interview written. 11. Using Marketing by Influencers Marketing for influencers has become increasingly common in recent years. When you make a deal with an influencer, your website can be advertised, linked to, written about, posted on social media, and more. It might seem costly to pay an influencer to promote your website, especially for influencers with millions of followers. But happily, at a more affordable price and usually, more interaction, you can work with micro-influencers (with follow-ups ranging from 10,000 to 100,000). Plus, in exchange for free goods instead of cash, some influencers are willing to promote your website. So, hammer out a compromise that both sides profit from. You should check out a website like BuzzStream to find influencers relevant to your industry. To research influencers and create relationships with them, you can use Buzzstream. 12. Reclaim Your Notes If you mention your website but do not link to it with the website, then is a lost opportunity to find a back-link to your website. To solve this problem, you need to make it your task to collect your mentions. You can use an Awario tool to find out if your company has mentions floating around on the web without a connection. Anytime you're listed on the web, Awario will give you a warning. It's time to take action if you find a reference without a link. Since your company was listed by the author of the material, they already know who you are. Therefore all you need to do is contact them with a nice email asking them to add a connection to the guide. Just make sure you're just reaching out in a supportive way to writers who have listed your company. For example, if you find a blog writer who badly rated your product, you don't need to mention that. 13. Fixing the links which are broken Did you ever click on a web connection that led you to a 404 error page? Maybe it's because it's fairly popular. But, did you know that in order to get more backlinks to your site, you can use a 404 error? It's the perfect opportunity to replace the broken link with your own when you come across a resource page that has a broken link. The consequence of a website being taken down is a 404 error. And for the SEO of that website, the broken link is not pleasant. So, reach out to the owner of the website and let them know that on their resource page you have found a broken connection. To replace it you can give the website owner your own content. Finding broken ties on resource sites, of course, is like finding a needle in a haystack. Luckily, to make finding broken links easier, you can use a Chrome extension like Search My Links. 14. Using the Form of Moving Man The Moving Man Approach, a term coined by Brian Dean at Backlinko, is a similar technique for repairing broken ties. This time, you're searching for websites or services with links to websites that have shut down, changed titles, relocated, or discontinued a product/service, instead of looking for 404 pages. Usually, when a site connects to another site that has undergone either of these modifications, it will take users to a blank page. This is different from the creation of broken ties because the relations are not necessarily broken, they are merely obsolete. You can do a quick Google search to find pages that have changed or relocated, like: KEYWORD + 'page no longer exists' or KEYWORD + 'service no longer available' Once you find a page that fits the requirements, you can find all the links leading to the obsolete page using a tool like Ahrefs. Then, inform the owner of the site that links to it and offer to replace it with your own content. Chances are they're going to be pleased with your backlink to update their site. 15. Competitor Spying Finally, it's smart to learn from the best if you want to get more backlinks to your webpage. You can see the link-building methods that make them so effective by spying on your competitors. There are a variety of ways that you can spy on the link-building strategies of your rivals, such as: Spying on your rivals will allow you to become just as good as they are at building backlinks. Soon, in the search engine rankings, you can overtake them with time and some practice. You've got it there! You now have 15 new ways to get more backlinks and boost the rating of your search engine. Start putting into action some of these ideas and your website will quickly climb to the top of the search engine rankings.

I created a resource page for a niche topic, and it got picked up by several industry blogs without me having to lift a finger.” Here are some proven magnets for organic backlinks: Product comparisons Glossaries Industry reports and studies Infographics Articles with real-world examples and ready-to-use templates Example: SaaS companies can create “Ultimate Guides” on niche topics like data encryption or CRM best practices, with fresh stats and actionable insights. E-commerce businesses can publish detailed case studies on customer success stories, making them irresistible for industry bloggers to reference. We loved the example from Tidio, an AI customer service platform. They published a post on writing apology letters to customers, complete with seven ready-to-use templates. In just five months, this article earned backlinks from 78 domains, showcasing the power of practical content. Tidio's article with apology email examples is a real link magnet 2. Build connections with site admins on Ranking Raccoon Sadly, it's not enough to just produce great content to start getting backlinks naturally. You still need to be proactive and reach out to relevant sites with backlink requests. If link-building outreach fills you with very little enthusiasm, you’re among the 68% of marketers who feel the same. Prospecting and cold emailing take up a lot of your time, you never know if you’re writing to the right people, and 95% of your emails get no answer. Ranking Raccoon was created to take the unnecessary struggle out of your link-building campaigns. It’s a platform that connects you directly with credible site admins in SaaS, eCommerce, Business Services, Design, and 50 more niches. All you have to do is send a link request in a few clicks, discuss the details, get the backlink live, and see your rankings go up. And on top of getting that backlink, you can foster a lasting business relationship and profit from other joint marketing activities. 3. Leverage Digital PR Digital PR connects journalists with sources, and it’s a goldmine for getting backlinks from high-authority websites like Forbes or The New York Times, but also from smaller, niche blogs in your industry. Studies show that 55% of companies that use digital PR see notable increases in their search rankings within 6 months. Digital PR is a powerful way to boost your rankings Given the sunset of Connectively (featured by HARO), here are some solid freemium alternatives you can explore: Featured Sourcebottle Qwoted PitchRate Terkel “Answering HARO requests regularly has landed me backlinks from major publications,” one Quora user mentioned. “It’s a bit time-consuming, but totally worth it.” Example: A SaaS company specializing in cybersecurity could answer a journalist's query on emerging threats, and in return, land a backlink from a major tech publication. 4. Guest Blogging – Done in a Smart Way Guest blogging is a white hat link-building strategy that’s still alive. The key is to focus on quality over quantity. You want to guest blog on sites that are relevant to your industry and have a decent domain authority (DA). Instead of blasting out generic pitches, personalize your outreach by showing how your content can provide value to their audience. One Reddit user remarked: “Guest posting works if you target the right blogs and offer something valuable. It’s not just about getting the link, but also establishing your authority.” Example: A SaaS company offering AI tools could contribute to marketing blogs about how AI is reshaping digital marketing strategies. E-commerce brands can guest post about trends in consumer behavior or sustainability in retail. Here are the search operators you can apply to find guest posting opportunities: ‘write for us + {niche}’ {keyword} intitle:”write for us” {keyword} intitle:”write for me” {keyword} intitle:”contribute to” {keyword} intitle:”submit” + inurl:blog {keyword} “submit a guest post” {keyword} “accepting guest posts” {keyword} “guest author” {keyword} “become a contributor” inpostauthor:guest {keyword} 5. Take Advantage of Broken Link-Building Broken link-building is one of those underutilized tactics that can yield high-quality backlinks at zero expense if done right. It’s simple: find broken links on websites in your niche, then offer the webmaster a piece of your content as a replacement. This approach offers value to both sides: the website owner gets to fix a broken link, and you get a new backlink. It’s a win-win. One Quora user shared: “Broken link-building works really well if you’re in a niche where people don’t update their sites often.” Example: An e-commerce business selling eco-friendly products could search for outdated links on sustainability blogs. By offering updated, high-quality content, they can secure a backlink from an established source. Broken link-building is one of the easiest ways to get free, relevant backlinks To encourage you more, 94% of webmasters appreciate being notified about broken links because it helps improve their website performance and SEO. This makes it a low-risk, high-reward tactic. 6. Write Testimonials and Reviews Many companies love showcasing testimonials from their users or customers. It’s an easy way for them to build trust, and they often link back to your website in return. This strategy requires a bit of proactivity—write reviews for tools or services that you genuinely use and appreciate, then reach out to the company to let them know. Not only do you get a backlink for free, but you also nurture a potential relationship with that company. A user on Reddit noted: “I’ve gotten some good backlinks from writing testimonials for tools I use daily. It’s a super low-effort way to get links.” 7. Create Infographics or Visual Data Did you know that visual content is three times more likely to be shared than plain text? Infographics, in particular, are great for generating backlinks. People love to use them in their own content, especially if they are well-researched and visually appealing. You don’t have to be a design wizard to create these. Tools like Canva, Figma, or Piktochart can help you design professional-looking infographics in no time. When someone uses your infographic, they’re more likely to credit you with a free backlink. Example: A SaaS company could create a data-rich infographic on the “State of Cloud Security,” while an e-commerce brand might develop an infographic comparing traditional retail with online shopping trends. An straight-to-the-point infographics is exactly how Act! earned a backlink to their \"Best CRM for Small Business\" blog post from EngageBay’s article. Infographics by Act gets featured in external articles 8. Offer Free Tools or Resources If you’ve got the development bandwidth, creating a niche-specific tool is an awesome way to earn free backlinks. Think about what your audience would find helpful—a calculator, a checklist, or even a free downloadable template. If your tool genuinely provides value, people will link to it naturally. A Quora user mentioned: “I built a simple SEO audit tool and, within weeks, I had backlinks from several high-authority blogs. Free tools are a huge magnet for backlinks.” Example: If you work in the SEO space, consider creating a free SEO analysis tool. If you're in e-commerce, you might offer a “Home Décor Style Quiz.” Take PrimePay, for instance — they built a Bonus Tax Calculator that grabbed 100 backlinks from 12 Fintech domains within a year. It’s now their top-performing page for organic traffic, proving how powerful a well-designed tool can be! Primepay's Bonus Tax Calculator is a link magnet 9. Repurpose Content for Different Formats Content repurposing is a killer way to generate backlinks across different platforms. Take a blog post, turn it into a video, an infographic, or even a podcast episode. Each new format you create opens up new opportunities for backlinks from different channels. One Reddit user shared: “I turned my blog posts into slide decks and uploaded them to SlideShare—ended up getting several backlinks from people embedding them on their own blogs.” Repurposing content keeps it fresh and increases its reach, helping you generate more backlinks without creating new content from scratch every time. Wrapping Up: Get Free Backlinks Without Breaking the Bank Getting free backlinks takes creativity, persistence, and a bit of hustle. It’s not as simple as buying them outright, but the payoff can be much greater in the long run—both in terms of authority and sustainability. By applying the strategies above, you can start building a robust backlink profile without breaking the bank. As one Redditor put it: \"SEO is a marathon, not a sprint. You’ll see results over time if you’re consistent with these tactics.\" The best way to get free backlinks is to create content worth linking to and build genuine relationships within your industry.

Members Online • DrJigsaw How to build backlinks without the BS - lessons learned from 1,000+ backlinks built Case Study I see a ton of posts here (and other subs) about how link-building is a total pain (which it totally is btw). So, thought I'd write a very timely, 2023 edition on how to do outreach that gets you links these days. The problem: a LOT of the link-building guides are outdated or just impractical. The skyscraper technique (hey, you linked to resource A, I have resource B, pls link to me) doesn't work anymore. Everyone and their pet dog do this kinda outreach, and bloggers/site owners just kinda don't care anymore. I've built over 1,000 links in the past year for several client websites and learned a TON in the process. In this post, I'll do a very comprehensive review of link-building in 2023 and explain what really works. Table of contents (yes, this'll be a long way. Grab a coffee. Or a beer, I don't judge): Should I do link-building in the first place? All the link-building BS What kind of links WORK? How link-building is (heavily) niche-dependant The top-down link-building process 5-step guide to running a successful link-building campaign How to build backlinks with low resources Best tools for building backlinks FAQ Let's go! (If you loved this post, I run a no-bs SEO subreddit, r/seogrowth, check it out!) Should I do link-building in the first place? Starting with the most important question here: do you need link-building at your current stage? You should ONLY do link-building once you have: A solid SEO strategy in place A decent number of blog posts / resources Otherwise, you'll be building links on hard more, and you won't be generating results that are good enough for it to the worth your while. You should also avoid SEO as a marketing channel overall unless you're ready to commit to long-term work. While it IS possible to sometimes get results within 1-3 months of SEO work, those cases are pretty rare. If you need revenue TOMORROW or you go bankrupt, try content marketing, PPC, direct sales, email marketing, or any other channel. Now that we've got that out of the way... The BS There is a TON of outdated info about link-building on the net. Here's what DOESN'T work these days: Forum link-building. Most forums no-follow all outgoing backlinks. Web 2.0 links. People spamming their links on Reddit are 100% wasting their time. Google can tell a user-generated content site apart from all other sites. Hence, links from Reddit, Medium, etc. are devalued big-time. Blog comment links. Most blogs no-follow blog comment links, so that's a waste of time too. PBNs (ish). Well-built PBNs work just fine. The PBNs you bought from some sketchy forum, though, will crash your site big time. And before some of you go: \"But Jigsaw, I build web 2 links and rank just fine!\" Sure you do! But you're most likely not ranking because you've been building web 2/blog comment/whatever links. If you were building REAL backlinks, you'd rank faster. Another common misconception is that paying for links is going to get you penalized or it just doesn't work. The reality: Unless you're buying sketchy links, or you're building links in a sketchy way (e.g. building 20 links to ONE page exclusively in a short timeframe), there's no way for Google to tell a backlink was paid for. A lot of industries are just pay-to-play and nothing else. If you're in CBD, forex, gambling, etc. you'll 100% have to pay for backlinks or your competitors are going to outrank you big-time. So what DOES work? Real links from real, topically related websites. E.g. if you run a fitness site, you'd benefit from getting links from the following sites: Authoritative fitness blog/media Small-time yoga blog Weight loss blog/media/site You get the drift. As long as the site publishes topically related content to yours, then that's a good link prospect. Media backlinks also work even if they're not topically related. E.g. Mashable, Forbes, etc. Some green flags that a backlink is high quality are: Their site is driving 1,000+ traffic from Google Site publishes genuine, high-quality content Site does NOT publish dozens of guest posts per month or sells backlinks en masse Site has NOT been penalized lately (i.e. they didn't lose a big chunk of their traffic) Site does NOT publish backlinks/guest posts from gambling sites They have an \"about us\" page & there's a real person behind the blog/site Link-building is niche-dependant Before we dive into the actual process, thought this was important to cover. How you do link-building SERIOUSLY depends on your niche. #1. If you're blogging about, say, yoga then it'll be much easier than. There are a TON of blogs that are topically related to yours and can link back to your site: - Fitness blogs - Yoga blogs - Weight loss blogs These sites are also a lot more approachable. They're usually run by amateurs and w/ a good personalized email, they'll be happy to link to you. #2. If you're blogging in B2B, on the other hand, things are a bit more give-and-take. Websites will want something from you for a backlink. Usually, that's: - A high-quality guest post - Partnership in some way - Direct or indirect backlink exchange So tl;dr, link-building in B2B is mostly relationship-building. #3. If you're in a competitive niche (CBD, VPN, etc.) then it's pay-to-play. A good outreach game will definitely help, but you'll have to pay a good $ for them to place your backlinks. The link-building process Now let's talk practice! The typical link-building process, from a top-down perspective, looks like this: You come up with a link-building campaign type. At this stage, you decide on what you're pitching / promoting. For your campaign to be more successful, you want to promote a useful resource or blog post. People are hella more likely to link to your resources than your product pages. Also, I wouldn't recommend building links unless you already have some content / SEO strategy in place. VA collects link-building prospects based on certain criteria. E.g. blogs about, say, scrapbooking, tech reviews, whatever. Lots of ways to do this, but I'll cover it in detail below. VA finds the right point of contact for each prospect. They extract their email / contact info using some tool. Copywriter creates a personalized outreach template for the campaign. You DO NOT want to copy-paste something from the internet. Link-building specialist starts the outreach campaign. They keep track of responses and do what they need to do to secure link placements. Let's go through each step of this process one by one: 1. Campaign type ================= The most common types of link-building campaigns are: Link insertions Guest posts Broken link-building Unlinked mention 3 and #4 are very situational and require their own approach, so we'll skip that entirely. Same with guest posts. Those require a bit more manual emailing and pitching, so let's push that off for another time. But tl;dr here is this: you review the website's guest posting policy and get a content writer to create a tailored pitch. In this post, let's stick to link insertions since that's the most scalable tactic. You don't need a fresh guest post written for every backlink you want to build. Now, from there, you want to create a cool resource that people will want to link to. Some good examples: Infographic they can insert into an existing blog. e.g. Top 21 Benefits of Weight-Lifting As Proven by Science Long-form content. E.g. Top 101 Productivity Tips from Top Professionals Fresh research. E.g. We surveyed 1,000 of our users about their dating preferences. Here are our findings. Unique tool. E.g. Free tool to analyze your competitor's backlink profile in a click. Not sure what's a good link magnet for your niche? Run your competitors through Ahrefs and check their Top Pages by Links. You'll see which of their pages are driving the most backlinks. Once you've got your link magnet down, time for step 2: 2. Link prospecting ==================== Your VA collects hundreds of prospects that fit your criteria. So step 1 - you HAVE TO have a VA do this. The process is extremely time-consuming and if you, as a founder, are spending time on this, you won't have much time for anything else. Now as for prospecting, there are a TON of ways to go about this. The tactics: Pick several blog categories that you'd benefit from getting backlinks from. E.g. fitness => yoga, weight loss, dieting niches, and so on. Prospect for such blogs w/ basic Google queries. E.g. \"yoga blog,\" \"diet blog,\" etc. Pick out articles that would benefit from a long to your resource. E.g. if you're promoting, say, a bachelor party checklist infographic, you can look up keywords about organizing bachelor parties and extract those prospects. \"Organize bachelor party,\" \"bachelor party ideas,\" \"bachelor party examples,\" etc. Pro tip - you're more likely to get backlinks from articles ranking on page 2+ VS ones ranking on page 1. Pick out articles that can organically mention your product(s). E.g. find articles about \"top X gifts for year Y anniversary\" Run your competitors through Ahrefs and extract their backlink profile. If someone linked to your competitor, chances are, they might link to you, too (as long as your email copy is good). Run sites that already link to you through Ahrefs/Semrush and extract their backlink profile(s). Small-time bloggers usually link to each other so chances are, these sites will be willing to link to you, too. Most of these can either be done manually by a VA, automated via ScrapeBox or Link Assistant, or by using Pitchbox. 3. Finding the point of contact ================================ This one's pretty simple. Your point of contact depends on the size of the site: Big media => you want to contact the author of the post specifically Company of any size => you want to contact the head of content, editor-in-chief, or head of digital marketing Personal or small-time blog => owner of the blog Teach your VA how to find the right point of contact. From there, they can use Hunter to find the email of the contact. If Hunter does NOT find the email, you can simply find the email format (e.g. [firstname]@[company] dot com) and logically guess the email of a given prospect. Note: if you're reaching out to small blogs, general emails like info @ company dot com can still work. If you're reaching out to a company, though, or a media, general email basically means that no one's going to read your outreach. 4. Creating personalized email copy ==================================== One of the most common mistakes people make with link-building is copy-pasting a template from the internet. They read an article on link-building on some top blog like Ahrefs or Backlinko, find a template, copy-paste, send it to 200 people, and wonder why it didn't work. Here's why: Literally, everyone does the same exact thing. It goes a little something like this: \"Hey [Name], I just stumbled on your blog while looking for articles about [topic]. I (totally for real for real) read your article and it's like, really really cool! But you know what it's lacking? A link to my site, eyyy. Pls link?\" Bloggers/site owners get a TON of these emails. It's SO DAMN GENERIC that even if you're pitching the best resource ever created, you'll get ignored. So what you gotta do is create your own template for any given campaign you're pushing. Here are some tips on how to create great outreach copy: For your subject line: Mention the prospect's name/site name. E.g. [Name], recipes in [site] are mouthwatering! Tailor it to the niche. E.g. [name], I'm stuck in bronze, send help Make it look like a personal email. E.g. Question, [name]? Intro - [name] <> [name], etc. And the rest for your body copy: Give a compliment about their site/content that FEELS like a genuine compliment, but applies to most of your prospect list (sorry not sorry). E.g. \"Your recipes are mouthwatering! I'm planning on giving [latest recipe] a try for dinner with my [wife/husband]\" Mention jokes/references that someone in that niche might find funny or punny. E.g. As a budding green thumb enthusiast, I wanted to take a moment to leaf you a message and hopefully plant a few seeds of inspiration. Make it about something they mentioned in their post. Get a VA to make a custom column and add details from the post. E.g. \"Your post about 10-anniversary gifts really saved me in a clutch! I'm planning on getting my missus a [gift from a listicle]\" Keep it human. No corpo lingo. Your outreach emails should look like something you're sending to your BFF. Finally, (preferably), don't include images or links in your outreach emails. They hurt deliverability. If you have to include a pitch to a resource, you can make an exception (or add a CTA for \"drop me a thumbs up and I'll send you the post\"). Optionally, at the end of the outreach email, you can add an offer of what you can give in exchange for that backlink. Some examples I've seen that work: We'll link back to your site from a future guest post on a third-party site. We'll share your content with our Twitter audience of X people. We're going to literally pay you money for the link. Let's do a backlink exchange. We'll give you free access to our software for X months. We'll give you X free credits to our SaaS tool. 5. And launch! =============== Once you've got your prospects and email copy ready to go, launch your campaign. Some info on the technical stuff re: the outreach process: Use a dedicated outreach domain. DO NOT use your main domain. Some peeps on the internet WILL report you for spam just because they had a bad day. If this happens, your email deliverability for your main domain will suffer. Instead, use a dedicated outreach domain. E.g. if your brand is \"brand dot com\", you can do \"brand PR dot com\" Use either Google Workspace, private email, Office 365, or Zoho to create those private emails. Use a tool to warm up the email. Such tools automatically send/open/reply to emails from new domains to \"warm them up.\" This helps improve the deliverability rates of your fresh emails. Warm up for around 2 weeks per inbox. Don't send more than 60 emails per day per email. Yes, this includes follow-ups. The more you go over this limit, the more likely it is for the inbox to get \"burned\" and your deliverability to tank. Speaking of follow-ups, do NOT do more than 2 follow-ups per email. If the prospect doesn't reply after 2 emails, they're probably not interested at this time. Finally, don't include links in your outreach emails. This helps improve deliverability. If you're pitching a resource, you can make an exception there (or you can add a CTA like, \"just drop me a thumbs-up and I'll send you a link\"). How to build backlinks when you're broke I've had a ton of people ask me about this before so thought I'd cover it in a dedicated section. In a niche where links cost cash AND you're broke? Fortunately, there are options to bypass that backlink sponsorship fee. Some solid tactics: Do value-based guest posting. Most guest posts people pitch are, practically speaking, trash. 500 words, 0 value, and usually AI-generated. Pitch your prospects your experience and expertise and offer a post that they can actually benefit from. Good example is picking out a keyword they want to target and writing a guest post targeting that. That's value! Use HARO, Terkel, or similar platforms. Basically, these are platforms that match journalists with sources. They're a great way to sometimes land very high authority backlinks, or build up some homepage backlinks without too much hassle/outreach. Make friends with other bloggers. For real. Follow them on Twitter or LinkedIn. Engage with their content. Then shoot them a DM and offer a backlink collaboration. E.g. link exchange, ABC link exchange, etc. Friendship is magic. While this approach is time-consuming, it's ideal if you're building a niche site and don't have a lot of existing backlinks. Best tools for building backlinks Now, let's talk tools. You ain't doing all this manually: Semrush/Ahrefs as a general SEO tool. You can use both to extract competitor backlink profiles. You can also use either to evaluate whether a certain site is a good backlink prospect. Outreach tool. If you're just getting started with link-building, Snov is the most value deal there is (comes with email warmup, email finder credits, outreach tool, etc.). If you're looking for the best-in-class tool, that would be Pitchbox. Must-have if you're building links at scale or run an agency. Hunter dot io is great for finding prospect emails. Link Assistant or Scrapebox for help with prospecting. Warmup Inbox for email warmup. MailGenius to check email health. Might've missed a couple, but this is the gist. You can also use ChatGPT to write your email first lines if you're feeling spicy. Think there was a dedicated tool for this too, though. FAQ Got more questions? I foresaw this with my third eye of truth and 3rd coffee of the day. Hence, the FAQ section. How many emails should I send per day? This depends on the niche. Estimate your win rate per 100 emails. Then, work backward from there. If you win 5 links from 100 emails, and you want 20 links a month, you need 400 emails sent per month. How long does it take for backlinks to kick in? Links impact your site 1-3 months after being built (usually). How can I calculate the ROI of my link-building? It's really hard to estimate the dollar value of a given link, so hard to figure out link-building ROI. That said, if links can take you from page 2 to the top 3 rankings for your target keyword, very good chance you'll get good ROI. If you're targeting the right keywords, anyway. This is literally why the catchphrase of SEO is \"well, maybe, yes, but sometimes no, it depends...\" Can I rank without backlinks? This depends on the niche. If there's not much competition, yeah, that's possible. Otherwise, link quality/quantity will determine if you rank top 3, or page 2. Links also determine how fast you'll rank. Will I get penalized for exchanging links? According to a study by Ahrefs, most top websites have reciprocal links. That's just how the internet works. Unless all you have is direct link exchanges with hundreds of sites, you should be good/safe. Google said paying for links is bad, what do? :( Paying for links is extremely common and most link-builders do it. If you're doing it smart, you won't get penalized / affected negatively in any way. How do I get backlinks from big media sites / authority sites? Either through connections or digital PR, but that's a completely different topic VS conventional link-building.

Members Online • DrJigsaw How to build backlinks without the BS - lessons learned from 1,000+ backlinks built Case Study I see a ton of posts here (and other subs) about how link-building is a total pain (which it totally is btw). So, thought I'd write a very timely, 2023 edition on how to do outreach that gets you links these days. The problem: a LOT of the link-building guides are outdated or just impractical. The skyscraper technique (hey, you linked to resource A, I have resource B, pls link to me) doesn't work anymore. Everyone and their pet dog do this kinda outreach, and bloggers/site owners just kinda don't care anymore. I've built over 1,000 links in the past year for several client websites and learned a TON in the process. In this post, I'll do a very comprehensive review of link-building in 2023 and explain what really works. Table of contents (yes, this'll be a long way. Grab a coffee. Or a beer, I don't judge): Should I do link-building in the first place? All the link-building BS What kind of links WORK? How link-building is (heavily) niche-dependant The top-down link-building process 5-step guide to running a successful link-building campaign How to build backlinks with low resources Best tools for building backlinks FAQ Let's go! (If you loved this post, I run a no-bs SEO subreddit, r/seogrowth, check it out!) Should I do link-building in the first place? Starting with the most important question here: do you need link-building at your current stage? You should ONLY do link-building once you have: A solid SEO strategy in place A decent number of blog posts / resources Otherwise, you'll be building links on hard more, and you won't be generating results that are good enough for it to the worth your while. You should also avoid SEO as a marketing channel overall unless you're ready to commit to long-term work. While it IS possible to sometimes get results within 1-3 months of SEO work, those cases are pretty rare. If you need revenue TOMORROW or you go bankrupt, try content marketing, PPC, direct sales, email marketing, or any other channel. Now that we've got that out of the way... The BS There is a TON of outdated info about link-building on the net. Here's what DOESN'T work these days: Forum link-building. Most forums no-follow all outgoing backlinks. Web 2.0 links. People spamming their links on Reddit are 100% wasting their time. Google can tell a user-generated content site apart from all other sites. Hence, links from Reddit, Medium, etc. are devalued big-time. Blog comment links. Most blogs no-follow blog comment links, so that's a waste of time too. PBNs (ish). Well-built PBNs work just fine. The PBNs you bought from some sketchy forum, though, will crash your site big time. And before some of you go: \"But Jigsaw, I build web 2 links and rank just fine!\" Sure you do! But you're most likely not ranking because you've been building web 2/blog comment/whatever links. If you were building REAL backlinks, you'd rank faster. Another common misconception is that paying for links is going to get you penalized or it just doesn't work. The reality: Unless you're buying sketchy links, or you're building links in a sketchy way (e.g. building 20 links to ONE page exclusively in a short timeframe), there's no way for Google to tell a backlink was paid for. A lot of industries are just pay-to-play and nothing else. If you're in CBD, forex, gambling, etc. you'll 100% have to pay for backlinks or your competitors are going to outrank you big-time. So what DOES work? Real links from real, topically related websites. E.g. if you run a fitness site, you'd benefit from getting links from the following sites: Authoritative fitness blog/media Small-time yoga blog Weight loss blog/media/site You get the drift. As long as the site publishes topically related content to yours, then that's a good link prospect. Media backlinks also work even if they're not topically related. E.g. Mashable, Forbes, etc. Some green flags that a backlink is high quality are: Their site is driving 1,000+ traffic from Google Site publishes genuine, high-quality content Site does NOT publish dozens of guest posts per month or sells backlinks en masse Site has NOT been penalized lately (i.e. they didn't lose a big chunk of their traffic) Site does NOT publish backlinks/guest posts from gambling sites They have an \"about us\" page & there's a real person behind the blog/site Link-building is niche-dependant Before we dive into the actual process, thought this was important to cover. How you do link-building SERIOUSLY depends on your niche. #1. If you're blogging about, say, yoga then it'll be much easier than. There are a TON of blogs that are topically related to yours and can link back to your site: - Fitness blogs - Yoga blogs - Weight loss blogs These sites are also a lot more approachable. They're usually run by amateurs and w/ a good personalized email, they'll be happy to link to you. #2. If you're blogging in B2B, on the other hand, things are a bit more give-and-take. Websites will want something from you for a backlink. Usually, that's: - A high-quality guest post - Partnership in some way - Direct or indirect backlink exchange So tl;dr, link-building in B2B is mostly relationship-building. #3. If you're in a competitive niche (CBD, VPN, etc.) then it's pay-to-play. A good outreach game will definitely help, but you'll have to pay a good $ for them to place your backlinks. The link-building process Now let's talk practice! The typical link-building process, from a top-down perspective, looks like this: You come up with a link-building campaign type. At this stage, you decide on what you're pitching / promoting. For your campaign to be more successful, you want to promote a useful resource or blog post. People are hella more likely to link to your resources than your product pages. Also, I wouldn't recommend building links unless you already have some content / SEO strategy in place. VA collects link-building prospects based on certain criteria. E.g. blogs about, say, scrapbooking, tech reviews, whatever. Lots of ways to do this, but I'll cover it in detail below. VA finds the right point of contact for each prospect. They extract their email / contact info using some tool. Copywriter creates a personalized outreach template for the campaign. You DO NOT want to copy-paste something from the internet. Link-building specialist starts the outreach campaign. They keep track of responses and do what they need to do to secure link placements. Let's go through each step of this process one by one: 1.

Google said paying for links is bad, what do? :( Paying for links is extremely common and most link-builders do it. If you're doing it smart, you won't get penalized / affected negatively in any way. How do I get backlinks from big media sites / authority sites? Either through connections or digital PR, but that's a completely different topic VS conventional link-building.

Δ Blog › Promotion How To Get Backlinks: 15 Strategies That Scale Chris Boutté • Senior Content Marketing Specialist Last Updated: Sep 17, 2024 Subscribe Tweet Share Email The cost of a link is roughly the same price as sailing to the Caribbean. Content creation and promotion generally costs around $600-$800 per link in the short term. Meanwhile, routes that start from Florida and sail to the Bahamas cost roughly $1,000 on budget cruise lines — and those come with a piña colada on the beach. What I mean is, if you’re going to spend the price of a beach vacation on creating content, you better know how to get backlinks and quality backlinks at that. In this post, we reveal 15 link building tactics that we use for our clients to generate unmatched ROI through strategic backlinks. These tactics allow our 100-person content marketing agency to scale acquisition, generating 5,000+ links per month for our clients in total. Table of Contents: Competitor Links Link Moves Broken Link Building Reciprocal Linking Guest Posting Long-Form Resources Link Reclamation Resource Pages and Review Roundups Pitch Sites With Testimonials High-Tier News Coverage Organic Link Acquisition Create Image Assets People Want to Link To Utilize HARO Bring Additional Value to Popular Topics Build Free Tools Reach Out to Businesses and Organizations What Are Backlinks and Why Are They Important for SEO? In SEO, backlinks are when another website links to yours. This may be a hyperlink within the text, a button, or a clickable link on an image. Each of these counts as a backlink, which is one of the key factors for helping your website and its pages rank well. Google aims to show search results that have accurate information. Backlinks are a key Google ranking factor because they send out a signal of trust. Basically, the more people vouching for your content, the better. For example, a website with one backlink won’t be as trustworthy as one with 100. The quality of the backlinks matters, too. The value of a link depends on the authority, perceived quality, and relevancy of a site. A single link from a high-tier news site is worth inherently more than 10 links from low-authority guest posting sites. Now that you understand the importance of backlinks, we have 15 different strategies for you to get relevant backlinks for your content. A major part of these strategies is digital PR, which is reaching out to different websites to gain backlinks. 1. Competitor Links Believe it or not, sometimes getting backlinks is as easy as browsing sites that link to your competitor and borrowing that lead. This tactic can generate backlinks in three simple steps. Make a list: List your top 3 competitors that appear to be implementing a content strategy.(Pro tip → think about the frequency of posts, number of sites linking to posts, and terms they’re ranking for—are they all branded?) Find top-performing posts: Use tools like Content Explorer in Ahrefs and find posts that bring in the most traffic to your competitors. Send your pitch: Now, it’s time to craft a pitch. Send an outreach email briefly explaining the value the website’s audience will get if they include your brand in the post. For example, you may want to write a blog post to target the keyword “how to sell jewelry online”. Looking at the SERP, Forbes has the top post with 153 referring domains. Using a tool like Ahrefs, you can see each of the sites linking to this post. You can then filter them to find sites that are more likely to link back to your blog post. Some tips for using Ahrefs fillers include: Try websites with DRs close to yours Avoid sites using nofollow links Find sites that will find your content useful The idea behind this backlink strategy is to show evidence that the website links out to useful resources, so they may be interested in your post if it benefits their audience. 2. Link Moves Say you have a new product page that you optimized for conversions. A backlink to that page will become more valuable than a link to an older product or resource. Enter: link moves. This strategy involves repitching sites where you already have a link attributed to your brand. While the older link is still a worthwhile mention, a link to newer resources or product pages will do more for your brand regarding SEO value and conversions. Similar to link reclamation, the webmaster or journalist you’re reaching out to should see the immediate benefit for their audience by moving the link. Consider moving to location-specific pages depending on the audience demographic, existing product mentions in the copy, or informational pages that help explain a complicated sales process. 3. Broken Link Building (BLB) Tried and true, broken link building (BLB) is an O.G. promotion method that survived the Penguin Update and still sees success today. The tactic calls for finding resources that return a 404 or no longer exist and reaching out to the sites that have linked to that resource. To find sites with broken links, start by finding sites that have Resources pages. You can do this by searching for a keyword and adding -inurl:resources. Using a Chrome extension like LinkMiner, you can see which links are broken so you can craft your pitch email. You should frame your pitch as such, so your recipient sees that value as soon as they open the email. Here’s what I mean: BLB is a great way to get backlinks for your website because you’re bringing value to the webmaster (locating a broken link on their page) before you come in with your ask (adding a link to your resource). Before pitching a site with broken links, consider the relevance of your content. A resource page for storm chasers won’t care about your guide to financial resources for single parents, and it’s highly unlikely that you’ll generate a backlink. 4. Reciprocal Linking Do you have a large customer network or extensive list of vendors? Reciprocal linking is the process of requesting a link from known contacts. Think: the “order delivery” button at the bottom of your favorite restaurant’s website. While you shouldn’t rely on these types of links as a complete backlink strategy, a handful of thoughtful reciprocated link placements are an easy win. Let’s think of a less obvious example. Say you’re a local shop that provides toiletries and other amenities to cruise lines and hotel chains. You probably feature them as your client on your website, but do they? By linking to the hotel chains or vendors providing the amenities, they may link back to your page as well. Pitch the vendor with the value-add of your link. Not only will their customers have a direct source to learn more about your product, but you’ll have the extra link juice in tow. 5. Guest Posting Guest posts can be beneficial, but they can also be a double-edged sword. While these posts can be an effective way to get in front of new readers, you need to make sure you’re not engaging in tactical link building techniques, which can easily get devalued by Google. If you’re going to undertake guest posting as a backlink strategy, you have to be ready to go above and beyond. Only pitch sites where you have topical authority, and be prepared to write another high-quality post with around 800+ words. Here’s an example. I do a lot of backpacking, so I pitched camping printables for my client. I have topical authority from backpacking for 10+ months as a solo female, and it’s within my personal brand to write a guest post for a site that creates content around camping for women. The guest blog was genuine and drew from personal experiences, and I just happened to be able to tie in my client’s page with the piece without diluting authority. Typically, you’ll have editorial guidelines to follow as a guest blogger, and there will be a formal process to publish the piece. Take a look: Pro tip → make yourself available after the post goes live to answer comments. 6. Long-Form Resources Pitching long-form resources looks similar to finding sites with broken links. You’ll use the same types of Google search operators (ie., inurl:resources | intitle:helpful-links | inurl:links). However, rather than only focusing on broken links, you’ll be pitching your guide as a new resource instead of replacing a link. Site and post relevance is key here. Consider adding additional Google search operators that will narrow down your search. If you’re pitching a resource for veterans, you may want to use operators like intitle:military or intext:veteran. Your value add is crucial. You want to make sure the resource you’re pitching is better than existing content to provide value to your prospect’s audience. 7. Link Reclamation Link reclamation, or unlinked mentions, is the process of finding your brand referenced online without a backlink to your website. You’ll find these mentions in online publications, social media posts, product reviews, and everything in between. These tactics work when established brands already have some buzz and can create link opportunities to extremely valuable bottom-funnel pages. Link reclamation is unique to your brand, and your competitors can’t replicate these links because the websites are already talking about you. Let’s talk logistics. By reaching out to the person who wrote the post, you can present your link as a way for their readers to find more information and, therefore, provide value before your big ask. Here’s what it looks like: Notice that this email focuses on brevity. Journalists are busy, and they get hundreds of emails per day. Keep your pitch short so they can scan it easily. Make sure to include a link to the post your brand is mentioned in. Again, journalists are busy, and they won’t want to dig through old posts to do you a solid. 8. Resource Pages and Review Roundups You’re in an industry where relevant keywords ranking in the SERP are formatted as “Best [X].” Instead of trying to rank higher than the post with “136 Best …” it might be a better strategy to simply ask for your product to be included. Craft your pitch to make your value proposition apparent. If you’re a software booking company, and there’s a list of “X Best Booking Software for Cruise Lines,” you’ll want to feature why your software is different. If the post is missing a better booking system, they will likely include your link to create a more comprehensive guide for their audience. Disclaimer: Advertising or “publishing fees” may be requested. 9. Pitch Sites With Testimonials Similar to creating review roundups, you can also use this as an opportunity to pitch testimonials. Not only does “Best X” content often perform well, but your outgoing links present an opportunity for incoming links. Once the content is published, you can contact various sites that made the list to see if they’re willing to link back to your article. It’s self-promotion for them and a backlink for you, so everybody wins. This is also a strategy you can use when pitching news outlets. Here at Siege Media, we’ll sometimes write about relevant studies for our clients to create content. After publishing content like this, you can reach out to local reporters and news desks, highlighting that they’re among the top-ranking areas. Here’s an example pitch to news outlets for a ranked study: 10. High-Tier News Coverage In link building, the highest form of validation seems to be coverage from a high-end news source with a 90+ domain authority linking to your content. If BLB is the budget cruise line of link building, then high-tier news coverage is like a private yacht. But how do you get the attention of journalists who get hundreds of emails daily? Data + value-added pitch = coverage. Here comes the intimidating part. You have to gather data and create a piece that highlights enough points so journalists can spin it how they want to. You can do this by doing surveys, analyzing data from Google trends, or even using proprietary data. Take a look: This email cuts the fluff and pitches a piece offering interesting data handed to the journalist with a story idea on a silver platter. The easier you make it for a journalist to envision the headline, the more likely you will get that placement. 11. Organic Link Acquisition Organic link acquisition is arguably the strategy that generates the highest ROI and lowest cost per link over time. After you’re done with outreach, your post will continue generating organic placements and rank in a pitchable SERP. These SEO linking strategies can include statistics posts, definitional posts, top-funnel topics with high search intent, and a shareable asset. While these pieces don’t generate as many links up front, after more than six months, they reap SEO backlinks and gain traction in the SERP. For example, we have a post for must-know content marketing statistics that we update each year. It ranks #2 on the SERP for “content marketing statistics” and has gained over 800 links from 545 domains. Naturally, other sites will begin to reference your post as it gains more authority. Not only can these garner organic links from mid-tier sites, but they can also achieve top-tier coverage naturally. Not to mention, these links are the least likely to be devalued by Google should another core update come along to rock the content marketing boat. 12. Create Image Assets People Want to Link To Linking images counts as backlinks, which is why it’s a good strategy to create images people want to link to. One of the best ways you can do this is with shareable infographics. You can outline and write content specifically crafted to host a standout infographic, or you may find that a piece of content is great for an infographic after you finish writing it. When your infographic is complete, you can research pages that are discussing the same topic and then explain how the infographic may be useful for their audience. The infographic may fit perfectly with something the prospect wrote, but you can also offer to write a custom intro so their piece flows smoothly into your infographic. You don’t need to send the full infographic in the email, but it’s helpful to show a portion of it so the prospect has an idea of what it looks like. In the example below, you’ll see how we pitched this infographic, the section we included in the email, and a link to the full post with the infographic. 13. Utilize Connectively If you’re in the market for creating relevant backlinks, Connectively (formerly HARO) can be a gold mine. HARO stood for Help a Reporter Out, and they rebranded to Connectively in 2023. It’s a resource that journalists use to get expert quotes when they’re writing stories. When you sign up, click on the link for “I’m a Subject Matter Expert”, and then you’ll have access to all of the requests reporters, journalists, and bloggers have. 14. Bring Additional Value to Popular Topics Naturally, some topics will be more popular than others. Sometimes, these topics are evergreen; other times, they may end up being a trend. Either way, you can start creating backlinks by writing about popular topics and doing it better. For example, many top-ranking posts for the topic “how to get backlinks” have lists of 10, so we went with 15 to add more value. This is known as the “skyscraper technique.” It follows three simple steps: Step 1: Find content that’s earning a lot of links. Step 2: Write about the topic in a better way. Step 3: Promote it to websites linking to the original piece as well as others. To improve the content, you can showcase how you’re an expert in the field when you pitch it. You can also provide additional information that the top content isn’t providing. For example, if a top piece of content on the SERP is “10 simple 10-minute dinners”, you can write a piece with 15 simple 10-minute dinners. As long as it’s quality content, you may be able to outshine the others in the space. 15. Build Free Tools Free resources are great for backlinks, but free tools are even better. If you know how to program or can hire an affordable programmer to create a tool, these pieces of content can be a great way to increase backlinks. Maybe you can create a spreadsheet that has a built-in functionality to helps people, or you can create a helpful calculator. One of our clients is in the fintech space, and we created a free loan calculator. Calculating the cost of a loan with interest over the long term can involve a lot of math, so this is a helpful tool. This calculator is performing great when it comes to backlinks as well. As you can see, we’ve gained links from 130 unique domains. It’s also important to note that we didn’t simply guess that this would be a useful tool. We researched the keywords and found that they’d be valuable for generating traffic and backlinks. 16. Reach Out to Businesses and Organizations You don’t need to build links alone; consider contacting other businesses and partners to obtain backlinks. A local business association or chamber of commerce is likely available if you run a small or medium-sized business in a town or city. These organizations may be able to add your website to their directory, earning you a link from a reputable source. If you’re a store owner, contact product manufacturers and suppliers to see if they can add you to their website’s list of available product locations. As larger suppliers can have more domain authority, obtaining these links can have a healthy effect on how Google perceives your website. TL;DR In case you didn’t notice, there was a common theme throughout this post, and I’m not talking about cruises. You can learn how to get backlinks with one overarching content marketing strategy: add value for your prospects and their audience. Add value for your prospects and their audience. Acquiring backlinks from authoritative websites will help boost your site’s authority and generate the traffic you deserve. Backlink FAQ How To Get Backlinks for Your Website as a Beginner If you have a low DR website, some of the best strategies to begin getting backlinks are to become an expert source by using sites like Connectively and writing guest posts for blogs. How Do You Get Backlinks for Free? Many websites will link to your site for free if you’re providing them with value. In your pitch, emphasize why you think your link will help their readers and add value propositions like a guest post on the subject. Journalists are also a great way to get backlinks for free. Can You Create Your Own Backlinks? Each of your pages and blog posts should have internal links to other useful pages and posts on your site. A good rule of thumb is to have five inbound and five outbound links to and from each new page and post. Chris Boutté Chris is a Las Vegas-based Senior Content Marketing Specialist at Siege Media.

If you’re a software booking company, and there’s a list of “X Best Booking Software for Cruise Lines,” you’ll want to feature why your software is different. If the post is missing a better booking system, they will likely include your link to create a more comprehensive guide for their audience. Disclaimer: Advertising or “publishing fees” may be requested. 9. Pitch Sites With Testimonials Similar to creating review roundups, you can also use this as an opportunity to pitch testimonials. Not only does “Best X” content often perform well, but your outgoing links present an opportunity for incoming links. Once the content is published, you can contact various sites that made the list to see if they’re willing to link back to your article. It’s self-promotion for them and a backlink for you, so everybody wins. This is also a strategy you can use when pitching news outlets. Here at Siege Media, we’ll sometimes write about relevant studies for our clients to create content. After publishing content like this, you can reach out to local reporters and news desks, highlighting that they’re among the top-ranking areas. Here’s an example pitch to news outlets for a ranked study: 10. High-Tier News Coverage In link building, the highest form of validation seems to be coverage from a high-end news source with a 90+ domain authority linking to your content. If BLB is the budget cruise line of link building, then high-tier news coverage is like a private yacht. But how do you get the attention of journalists who get hundreds of emails daily? Data + value-added pitch = coverage. Here comes the intimidating part. You have to gather data and create a piece that highlights enough points so journalists can spin it how they want to. You can do this by doing surveys, analyzing data from Google trends, or even using proprietary data. Take a look: This email cuts the fluff and pitches a piece offering interesting data handed to the journalist with a story idea on a silver platter. The easier you make it for a journalist to envision the headline, the more likely you will get that placement. 11. Organic Link Acquisition Organic link acquisition is arguably the strategy that generates the highest ROI and lowest cost per link over time. After you’re done with outreach, your post will continue generating organic placements and rank in a pitchable SERP. These SEO linking strategies can include statistics posts, definitional posts, top-funnel topics with high search intent, and a shareable asset. While these pieces don’t generate as many links up front, after more than six months, they reap SEO backlinks and gain traction in the SERP. For example, we have a post for must-know content marketing statistics that we update each year. It ranks #2 on the SERP for “content marketing statistics” and has gained over 800 links from 545 domains. Naturally, other sites will begin to reference your post as it gains more authority. Not only can these garner organic links from mid-tier sites, but they can also achieve top-tier coverage naturally. Not to mention, these links are the least likely to be devalued by Google should another core update come along to rock the content marketing boat. 12. Create Image Assets People Want to Link To Linking images counts as backlinks, which is why it’s a good strategy to create images people want to link to. One of the best ways you can do this is with shareable infographics. You can outline and write content specifically crafted to host a standout infographic, or you may find that a piece of content is great for an infographic after you finish writing it. When your infographic is complete, you can research pages that are discussing the same topic and then explain how the infographic may be useful for their audience. The infographic may fit perfectly with something the prospect wrote, but you can also offer to write a custom intro so their piece flows smoothly into your infographic. You don’t need to send the full infographic in the email, but it’s helpful to show a portion of it so the prospect has an idea of what it looks like. In the example below, you’ll see how we pitched this infographic, the section we included in the email, and a link to the full post with the infographic. 13. Utilize Connectively If you’re in the market for creating relevant backlinks, Connectively (formerly HARO) can be a gold mine. HARO stood for Help a Reporter Out, and they rebranded to Connectively in 2023. It’s a resource that journalists use to get expert quotes when they’re writing stories. When you sign up, click on the link for “I’m a Subject Matter Expert”, and then you’ll have access to all of the requests reporters, journalists, and bloggers have. 14. Bring Additional Value to Popular Topics Naturally, some topics will be more popular than others. Sometimes, these topics are evergreen; other times, they may end up being a trend. Either way, you can start creating backlinks by writing about popular topics and doing it better. For example, many top-ranking posts for the topic “how to get backlinks” have lists of 10, so we went with 15 to add more value. This is known as the “skyscraper technique.” It follows three simple steps: Step 1: Find content that’s earning a lot of links. Step 2: Write about the topic in a better way. Step 3: Promote it to websites linking to the original piece as well as others. To improve the content, you can showcase how you’re an expert in the field when you pitch it. You can also provide additional information that the top content isn’t providing. For example, if a top piece of content on the SERP is “10 simple 10-minute dinners”, you can write a piece with 15 simple 10-minute dinners. As long as it’s quality content, you may be able to outshine the others in the space. 15. Build Free Tools Free resources are great for backlinks, but free tools are even better. If you know how to program or can hire an affordable programmer to create a tool, these pieces of content can be a great way to increase backlinks. Maybe you can create a spreadsheet that has a built-in functionality to helps people, or you can create a helpful calculator. One of our clients is in the fintech space, and we created a free loan calculator. Calculating the cost of a loan with interest over the long term can involve a lot of math, so this is a helpful tool. This calculator is performing great when it comes to backlinks as well. As you can see, we’ve gained links from 130 unique domains. It’s also important to note that we didn’t simply guess that this would be a useful tool. We researched the keywords and found that they’d be valuable for generating traffic and backlinks. 16. Reach Out to Businesses and Organizations You don’t need to build links alone; consider contacting other businesses and partners to obtain backlinks. A local business association or chamber of commerce is likely available if you run a small or medium-sized business in a town or city. These organizations may be able to add your website to their directory, earning you a link from a reputable source. If you’re a store owner, contact product manufacturers and suppliers to see if they can add you to their website’s list of available product locations. As larger suppliers can have more domain authority, obtaining these links can have a healthy effect on how Google perceives your website. TL;DR In case you didn’t notice, there was a common theme throughout this post, and I’m not talking about cruises. You can learn how to get backlinks with one overarching content marketing strategy: add value for your prospects and their audience. Add value for your prospects and their audience. Acquiring backlinks from authoritative websites will help boost your site’s authority and generate the traffic you deserve. Backlink FAQ How To Get Backlinks for Your Website as a Beginner If you have a low DR website, some of the best strategies to begin getting backlinks are to become an expert source by using sites like Connectively and writing guest posts for blogs. How Do You Get Backlinks for Free? Many websites will link to your site for free if you’re providing them with value. In your pitch, emphasize why you think your link will help their readers and add value propositions like a guest post on the subject. Journalists are also a great way to get backlinks for free. Can You Create Your Own Backlinks? Each of your pages and blog posts should have internal links to other useful pages and posts on your site. A good rule of thumb is to have five inbound and five outbound links to and from each new page and post. Chris Boutté Chris is a Las Vegas-based Senior Content Marketing Specialist at Siege Media.

You got it? The world of backlinks is wild, my friend. Picture me sitting in a dimly lit diner, channeling all my energy into this rant. Buckle up because we’re hitting this topic from both ends.Listen, backlinks are like oxygen for your website. Without them, you’re gasping for air, stuck in the depths of page two (or worse) of search results. It’s not just about climbing that SEO ladder; it’s about building a reputation, establishing your presence, and doing it all ethically. We’re ripping past the fluff and getting into the raw shit about creating content that genuinely offers value—not just jargon-filled pages chasing the latest SEO trend.This isn’t a game of manipulation or shortcuts. Trust me, I've been there and done that, and it blew up in my face harder than my cousin Tony’s epic paint mishap! That dude thought he was some kind of Picasso and trashed his whole setup with paint everywhere when he tried to DIY. I’d swear, I didn’t think it was possible to mess up so badly. Paint on the ceiling? Yeah, that happened.But Tony’s moment of chaos taught me something vital. If you don’t take the time to lay down a solid foundation, the entire structure can come crashing down in a colorful frenzy of regret. Same goes for your website; if you’re not building those backlinks ethically, you’ll be cleaning up a mess you didn’t even see coming.Now, let’s strap in because it’s a rollercoaster—here’s the full damn ride…Why Quick Fixes Aren’t EnoughLet’s hit the ground running. Quick fixes are like a sugar rush; they feel great for a hot minute but leave you crashing hard. Picture my buddy Tony again, who started that eco-friendly paint company. Dude went viral",
