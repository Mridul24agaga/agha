  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, so let’s break this down like we’re chillin’ at a bar talking about it. You hit me with this URL—https://transcript.study/. Right off the bat, it’s got that academic vibe goin’ on. You know how when you’re in school and you’re trying to dig up all that info for your essays or research papers? Yeah, that’s the kind of energy I’m getting from this site. First thought—transcripts. The word alone screams education. It's likely a hub where you can find transcripts from various courses or maybe even lectures. Think about it: students, researchers, and curious minds might be looking for some solid notes or reliable summaries of educational content. It’s probably a goldmine for anyone who doesn’t want to sift through hours of video lectures or reading dense textbooks. Now, “study” in the domain name? That’s a big indicator too. I’m picturing something that helps folks study more effectively. Maybe it's got tools or resources for note-taking, study guides, or even community-driven content where learners share their own transcripts and notes. It could be like a digital library where knowledge is shared freely, and you can tap into the collective wisdom of students from different backgrounds. Also, I'm thinking this site could be geared towards college students or lifelong learners who are trying to level up their game. You know how we all have that one friend who’s super organized and always knows where to find the best resources? This site could be that friend in the digital realm, helping people get their study game on point. Maybe they're offering something like services for creating personalized transcripts too? Like if you took a bunch of online courses or workshops, you might want something to show for it. So, this site could help compile that info into a neat little package. It's all about making learning more accessible and less of a headache. And let’s not forget the social aspect. If it’s a platform where you can connect with peers, that could totally enhance the learning experience. You might find study groups, discussion forums, or even mentorship opportunities. It’s always nice to have someone to share notes with over a cup of coffee, right? Lastly, in this age of information overload, a site like this must be all about clarity and ease of access. No one wants to wade through tons of outdated materials or poorly organized notes. My bet is they’ve got something slick going on—maybe a clean interface that feels welcoming and user-friendly, making it easy for users to find exactly what they need without the usual academic jargon that makes your head spin. So there you have it—a chill guess on what https://transcript.study/ might be about. I mean, it sounds pretty rad if you’re into learning, sharing knowledge, or just want to make that study grind a bit easier. Let’s hope Tavily gets it together because this seems like a site worth scraping if it’s all about making education more accessible and enjoyable! Cheers to that!",

Or maybe you don’t have a note-taking system in place at all, leaving you unable to locate the information you need when you need it. That’s where a study guide can help. Try these tips to keep your notes organized so that when that test comes up, your notes — and your mind — are prepared. Why is organizing study notes important? A proper organization method saves you time and effort in the long run. When your notes are disorganized, finding the information you need quickly can be challenging, and you may waste time searching for what you need instead of studying. Having a system in place lets you locate the information you need more easily, so you can spend more time studying and less time looking for notes. Different methods to organize notes. Effective note-taking is crucial for students of all ages, but figuring out the best way to organize your notes can be challenging. Fortunately, there are several methods you can use to keep your notes organized and easy to study. This article will explore various methods for organizing notes, including tips for high school and college students. How to organize school notes. Use a separate notebook for each class. Using one notebook for all your classes can be tempting, but it can quickly become disorganized. Instead, use separate notebooks for each class and label them clearly. Write clearly and legibly. Take the time to write your notes in a clear, legible manner so that you can read them later. Use bullet points, headings, and subheadings to make your notes more organized. Highlight important information. Use highlighters or colored pens to draw attention to important concepts or key terms. Highlighting helps to quickly find the most critical information when studying. Date your notes. Write the date on each page of your notes to help you track when you took the notes and which topics you covered on specific dates. How to organize college notes. Use a laptop or tablet. Many college students prefer to take notes on a laptop or tablet rather than using pen and paper. Laptops allow for faster typing and easier organization of digital notes. Create an outline. Before each lecture, outline the material you expect to cover to help you organize your notes more effectively and stay focused. Organize notes by topic. Organize your notes by topic rather than by date or lecture to make it easier to find the information you need when studying for exams. Summarize and condense. Rather than trying to write everything down, focus on summarizing and condensing the material. Writing a brief summary will help you retain the most important information and make studying more manageable. How to organize your notes for test prep and review. Summarize main ideas. Before exams, it’s important to review your notes and summarize the main ideas and concepts. Use bullet points, headings, and subheadings to make your notes more organized and easier to review. Create flashcards. Create flashcards to help you memorize key terms, definitions, and concepts. Flashcards are a highly effective way to prepare for exams and can make studying more manageable. Use color coding. Color coding your notes will help you quickly find the information you need when studying. Use different colors to highlight different types of information, such as dates, names, and definitions. Create a study guide. Create a study guide that summarizes the most essential information from your notes. Use headings and subheadings to organize the material and make studying easier. Review frequently. Review your notes frequently in the days leading up to the exam. Daily review before an exam will help reinforce the material and ensure you’re fully prepared. Don’t cram. Avoid cramming the night before the exam. Instead, prepare well in advance and review your notes consistently over time. Spreading out your review days can help you retain the material more effectively and reduce stress on exam day. Effective ways to take organized notes. When it comes to taking organized notes, there are various methods you can use depending on your learning style and personal preference. Each technique can be helpful in different situations. In this section, we’ll explore them in more detail and provide tips on using them effectively. How to organize notes in a notebook for school. When organizing your notes in a notebook for school, doing everything by hand can become cluttered. One of the simplest and most effective solutions is to use dividers to separate different subjects or topics in your notebook. Dividers can make it easier to find the information you need when studying. You can also color-code your notes to highlight different types of information, such as dates, names, and definitions. Color coding will help you quickly find the information you need when studying. Another helpful strategy is to use bullet points and headings to break down your notes into easily digestible chunks of information. Organizing your notes during the note-taking process will make it easier to review and study later on. Using these strategies, you can keep your notes organized and easy to navigate, making studying more efficient and effective. How to organize your typed notes. When organizing your notes on a computer, there are several ways to keep them organized and easy to navigate. One of the best strategies is to use headings and subheadings to organize your notes into easily navigable sections. Additionally, you can use bullet points and numbered lists to break down your notes into bite-sized pieces of information, making it easier to study and review later. Another idea is to use tables and charts to organize complex information and make it easier to understand. Using these strategies, you can keep your typed notes well organized and easy to navigate, making studying more efficient and effective. How to organize your notes on slides. Slides are a great way to keep your notes organized and easy to navigate. One way to organize your notes on slides is to use slide titles to divide your notes into different sections or topics. Adding titles makes it easier to navigate your notes and find the information you need when studying. Another strategy is to use bullet points and numbered lists to break down your notes into easily digestible chunks of information. Breaking down your notes will help you review and remember the material more effectively. Additionally, you can use images and diagrams to make your slides more visually engaging and memorable, which can help you understand and retain the information. How to organize notes using Acrobat tools. Using Adobe tools makes organizing your notes an easy process. One way to organize your notes on Adobe Acrobat is to create one PDF file per class to ensure that your notes are separated by subject. You can also use internal links to connect different sections of your notes, making it easier to navigate and study later. Numbered pages can also be helpful to keep your notes in order and to find specific information easily. Lastly, highlighting and annotation tools can be used to mark important information and make it stand out for review later. These Acrobat tools can help you create organized, numbered, linked study notes that will be invaluable when preparing for tests or exams. Well structured notes also make it easy to use study tools to ask your PDF questions and increase your ability to retain knowledge. Top tips for how to organize notes. Clearly label. Title each day of notes in the same format — order by date, class, and topic. That way, when sorting through them, you know you’re not missing anything. Choose your method. Understand how you best process information. Does the information stick better if you write it by hand and in separate notebooks for each class? Or, if that’s too slow or messy, do you prefer the clean outline of a computer document? Build your structure. Build a note-taking structure so that you can easily find them when you study. Maybe each class gets its own notebook. Or maybe you organize your notes into thematic folders on your desktop. Maybe it’s a hybrid where you scan your handwritten notes, merge them by topic, and compress them on your computer. Whatever the system, make sure you know where to find the information you’re looking for — and that the process helps you internalize the information as you go. Start now. It’s never too late to begin organizing. Start today by implementing these organizational habits moving forward. Once you have a solid, streamlined process, you might even feel inspired to backfill past notes into your system. More resources on notes.

Learn more about what this means. If there’s one thing a university student does a lot of, it’s taking notes. As a person with two university degrees under her belt, I know the value of having effectively organized notes. In fact, forgive me for humble-bragging, but I believe being able to organize my university notes is one of the things that led to me getting top honours twice. (That and an effectively organized planner.) By knowing how to effectively organize your university notes, you’ll be far better prepared when midterms and finals roll around. Exam prep is a breeze when everything is easy to find. During my time as a university student, I went through a few organization systems, always looking for ways to make my life easier. University is already stressful enough – why make it any worse with disorganized notes! In the end, I narrowed my preferences down to the three best! Each one has its pros and cons, and I’ve done lots of leg work so that you don’t have to. The Best Ways to Organize Your University Notes Notebooks This was the first system I tried, and I went through lots of variations. There are lots of great notebook options on the market today. Five-Subject Notebook A five-subject notebook contains five sections of notes separated by dividers. A good quality five-subject notebook, such as those from Five Star, will have a sturdy cover and handy pockets in the dividers. Pros: Could be used for most if not all of your courses at any given time. May be cheaper than buying several separate notebooks. I only ever needed to grab one notebook when leaving for class. The pockets in the dividers were a great place to keep the course syllabus, handouts, or any photocopies I’d made. Cons: Could sometimes be a tad heavy and unwieldy, especially if I also had lots of textbooks or other things to bring with me. Each section usually has less pages than you could get if you bought separate notebooks. I wrote a lot and would often run out of pages in a section, which was especially frustrating if I wrote more for one course than another so I couldn’t just replace the whole notebook all at once. While I quickly switched away from using a five-subject notebook for regular class use, I did consistently use one for my midterm and exam study notes. I could arrange them in order of the tests, compile information from various sources, re-create my notes based on an exam study guide, and have all my study material for that week (or month) of hell right in one place. Composition Books A classic notebook, often with an iconic marbled black and white cover. They feature sturdy covers and a sewn binding to keep pages secure. Pros: Very lightweight, so I could easily dedicate one to each course but still fit several in a bag without breaking my back. When the notebook inevitably filled up, it divided my notes into a date range, which often made it easier to find notes on a particular topic later. Cons: I used the classic black-and-white composition notebook, meaning all of them were identical. Even though I wrote the course code on the front of each, it still became very easy to mix them up and grab the wrong book in a hurry. (Some companies, such as Amazon, have released composition book with coloured covers, which does help solve this problem.) They were a bit cumbersome on those small desks attached to the chairs in lecture halls. I would have to fold the spine backwards to try and fit it onto the desk without jabbing it into the person sitting next to me. Those spines were not meant to fold like that, so it wouldn’t lie flat, which was annoying while writing. One-Subject Notebook Again I have to go with Five Star for their quality sturdy covers and pocket divider. (I also love the look of their Advance Spiral notebook, but have never actually tried it.) Pros: Not too bad as far as taking up valuable real estate in my bag, and was never any heavier than the five-subject notebook. Lots of pages – I almost never filled up a notebook. I could keep my lecture/seminar notes and reading notes in the same book. I started my lecture/seminar notes on the first page and went forwards as normal, and started my reading notes on the very back page and worked backwards. (Pro Tip: To differentiate between lecture and seminar notes, I used different pen colours and made sure everything was labelled and dated.) COLOUR-CODING! I’m a big colour-coder. I could assign each course a colour to use for my notebook, in my planner, and on my wall calendar. I could also coordinate each notebook with any other supplementary things I needed, like a folder of sheet music. When I was out the door, I just had to make sure I had the right colours in my bag. Cons: You may still be grabbing quite a few things when leaving for class each day, meaning there may be things you forget or that your bag may get quite heavy. If you have lots of loose sheets, it means your course materials could be spread across several different locations. Clipboards & Binders By the time I graduated with my first degree, this was the way I would organize my university notes. While it still had its pitfalls, I still felt that this system was best-suited to my needs at the time. How to use clipboards and binders to organize your university notes: Get a clipboard for each class – the kind that has a cover that folds over so it protects your papers. Bonus points if the cover also has a pocket and if you can coordinate each clipboard’s colour with your planner (see my comments on colour-coding under “one-subject notebooks” above). Honestly, the best clipboards I ever found were at my university’s campus store, so I stocked up! Stock each notebook with important papers as needed, like the course syllabus or assignment outlines. Keep a good supply of blank paper in each clipboard. I used lined paper the most, but I also needed music staff paper and graph paper. Use your clipboard for all lectures, seminars, etc. I chose a clipboard over a folder because it provided a hard back to write on, so I could easily use it in any setting. Date and label all notes. If your notes for one day stretch across several pages, number the pages. At the end of each week, empty out the clipboards and organize the notes into one big binder (or several smaller binders – again, colour-coded to match everything else). Make sure you re-stock the paper so you don’t run out! Pros: This saved a significant amount of space in my bag and wasn’t nearly so heavy to carry everything around. Grab the wrong clipboard by mistake? Not the end of the world – you still have paper and can still take notes, just make sure it’s extra-labelled so it isn’t mixed into the wrong course’s notes. The weekly ritual of transferring my notes to the binder was a great way of reviewing what I’d learned. By eventually having everything organized in a binder, I could easily integrate my notes with other things, like hand-outs, returned assignments, and reading notes. That way everything was together when it came time to review and make study notes for midterms and exams. Since everything was in a big binder, I always knew where my notes were. Plus I got to invest in some super cute dividers! Cons: The pages may get out of order if you’re not consistently dating and labelling every page. The clipboards may be too full to use or you may run out of usable paper if you don’t regularly transfer the pages into your binder(s). It is possible to do this with only one clipboard, but then you have to be even more careful with your labelling so you’re not confusing content from several different courses. This is particularly true if you have several courses that are similar (like near the end of my degree when I was taking nothing but music and literature). Laptop, Chromebook or Tablet You may be wondering – in the 21st century, why was I even bothering with pen and paper? That’s partly personal preference – I learn and retain information better when I’ve written it down – but also due to my technological issues at the time. When I started university, the laptop I had was unfortunate. It was old, it had zero battery life, it was big and clunky, and it was slow. It wasn’t until nearly the end of my first degree that I had a good laptop that could be carried around to classes, but my laptop bag wouldn’t fit a lot of books. I only really brought my laptop to campus if I had an assignment I needed to work on between classes. For teacher’s college, I finally had an iPad mini. I’ve since bought a cheap-but-great Chromebook that was perfect for the additional qualifications course I recently completed (and teaching and blogging). It was great to finally experience life as a student that didn’t involve hand cramps! Tips to Effectively Use Technology for Your Notes: Consider the size of the device you’re using. I much prefer a Chromebook because it’s a lot lighter to carry around than a laptop, but I also love being able to go even smaller and just bring my iPad places, too. Just make sure the device has the speed, power and capabilities you need. If using a tablet, get a decent Bluetooth keyboard to make typing easier and faster. If using a laptop or Chromebook, get a wireless mouse. This Jelly Comb mouse has a little USB receiver that can be stored in the mouse when not in use so it doesn’t get lost. Keep your devices safely secured with the appropriate cases, covers, and bags. Cracked screens are not your friend! Invest in Microsoft 365 and use OneNote to keep all of your notes organized in digital notebooks. (I originally used Evernote but wasn’t a fan.) Since everything is stored in the cloud, you can use it across all your devices. It’s particularly handy on a tablet, where you can take a photo of a lecture slide, notes on a whiteboard, or a chart in your textbook, and pop it right into your notes. Consider getting a stylus, if using a tablet or touchscreen device. OneNote lets you annotate your notes by using a stylus or your finger (but I’m not a fan of using my finger for writing – too messy!). The cloud is your friend! Between my OneNote and Google Drive, I know I’ll never lose data again. (If you’ve ever experienced the tragedy of losing a 5000-word essay at the last minute, you’ll know how important it is to make sure that never happens again.) Plus, again, then things are accessible no matter what device you’re on. Have a folder (and perhaps sub-folders) in your Google Drive for each course. OneNote is great, but you may still have separate files to keep track of – assignments, music files, PDFs of readings. Those still need to be kept well-organized, too! Organize Your University Notes – Which System is Best For You? To find which system helps you organize your university notes the best, you may need to experiment a bit. Goodness knows across my 6 years of university life, I kept changing my mind and trying to improve things. Here are some questions to consider to help you decide where to start: Do you prefer writing or typing? Does one help you learn and retain information better than the other? Are you a fast enough writer to keep up with even the fastest talking professor? How will you best study for exams? Will you want to have everything already contained in a notebook? Would you rather print your notes and highlight them? Is being paperless something you value? What is your budget? How much do you want to carry around with you from day to day? (Consider your mode of transportation – if you ride the bus, like I did, you might want to carry less than if you live on campus or own a car.) I really hope I’ve given you a good idea of how you might like to organize yourself for school. I really do think a solid organization system is key if you want to achieve big things.

Learn more about what this means. If there’s one thing a university student does a lot of, it’s taking notes. As a person with two university degrees under her belt, I know the value of having effectively organized notes. In fact, forgive me for humble-bragging, but I believe being able to organize my university notes is one of the things that led to me getting top honours twice. (That and an effectively organized planner.) By knowing how to effectively organize your university notes, you’ll be far better prepared when midterms and finals roll around. Exam prep is a breeze when everything is easy to find. During my time as a university student, I went through a few organization systems, always looking for ways to make my life easier. University is already stressful enough – why make it any worse with disorganized notes! In the end, I narrowed my preferences down to the three best! Each one has its pros and cons, and I’ve done lots of leg work so that you don’t have to. The Best Ways to Organize Your University Notes Notebooks This was the first system I tried, and I went through lots of variations. There are lots of great notebook options on the market today. Five-Subject Notebook A five-subject notebook contains five sections of notes separated by dividers. A good quality five-subject notebook, such as those from Five Star, will have a sturdy cover and handy pockets in the dividers. Pros: Could be used for most if not all of your courses at any given time. May be cheaper than buying several separate notebooks. I only ever needed to grab one notebook when leaving for class. The pockets in the dividers were a great place to keep the course syllabus, handouts, or any photocopies I’d made. Cons: Could sometimes be a tad heavy and unwieldy, especially if I also had lots of textbooks or other things to bring with me. Each section usually has less pages than you could get if you bought separate notebooks. I wrote a lot and would often run out of pages in a section, which was especially frustrating if I wrote more for one course than another so I couldn’t just replace the whole notebook all at once. While I quickly switched away from using a five-subject notebook for regular class use, I did consistently use one for my midterm and exam study notes. I could arrange them in order of the tests, compile information from various sources, re-create my notes based on an exam study guide, and have all my study material for that week (or month) of hell right in one place. Composition Books A classic notebook, often with an iconic marbled black and white cover. They feature sturdy covers and a sewn binding to keep pages secure. Pros: Very lightweight, so I could easily dedicate one to each course but still fit several in a bag without breaking my back. When the notebook inevitably filled up, it divided my notes into a date range, which often made it easier to find notes on a particular topic later. Cons: I used the classic black-and-white composition notebook, meaning all of them were identical. Even though I wrote the course code on the front of each, it still became very easy to mix them up and grab the wrong book in a hurry. (Some companies, such as Amazon, have released composition book with coloured covers, which does help solve this problem.) They were a bit cumbersome on those small desks attached to the chairs in lecture halls. I would have to fold the spine backwards to try and fit it onto the desk without jabbing it into the person sitting next to me. Those spines were not meant to fold like that, so it wouldn’t lie flat, which was annoying while writing. One-Subject Notebook Again I have to go with Five Star for their quality sturdy covers and pocket divider. (I also love the look of their Advance Spiral notebook, but have never actually tried it.) Pros: Not too bad as far as taking up valuable real estate in my bag, and was never any heavier than the five-subject notebook. Lots of pages – I almost never filled up a notebook. I could keep my lecture/seminar notes and reading notes in the same book. I started my lecture/seminar notes on the first page and went forwards as normal, and started my reading notes on the very back page and worked backwards. (Pro Tip: To differentiate between lecture and seminar notes, I used different pen colours and made sure everything was labelled and dated.) COLOUR-CODING! I’m a big colour-coder. I could assign each course a colour to use for my notebook, in my planner, and on my wall calendar. I could also coordinate each notebook with any other supplementary things I needed, like a folder of sheet music. When I was out the door, I just had to make sure I had the right colours in my bag. Cons: You may still be grabbing quite a few things when leaving for class each day, meaning there may be things you forget or that your bag may get quite heavy. If you have lots of loose sheets, it means your course materials could be spread across several different locations. Clipboards & Binders By the time I graduated with my first degree, this was the way I would organize my university notes. While it still had its pitfalls, I still felt that this system was best-suited to my needs at the time. How to use clipboards and binders to organize your university notes: Get a clipboard for each class – the kind that has a cover that folds over so it protects your papers. Bonus points if the cover also has a pocket and if you can coordinate each clipboard’s colour with your planner (see my comments on colour-coding under “one-subject notebooks” above). Honestly, the best clipboards I ever found were at my university’s campus store, so I stocked up! Stock each notebook with important papers as needed, like the course syllabus or assignment outlines. Keep a good supply of blank paper in each clipboard. I used lined paper the most, but I also needed music staff paper and graph paper. Use your clipboard for all lectures, seminars, etc. I chose a clipboard over a folder because it provided a hard back to write on, so I could easily use it in any setting. Date and label all notes. If your notes for one day stretch across several pages, number the pages. At the end of each week, empty out the clipboards and organize the notes into one big binder (or several smaller binders – again, colour-coded to match everything else). Make sure you re-stock the paper so you don’t run out! Pros: This saved a significant amount of space in my bag and wasn’t nearly so heavy to carry everything around. Grab the wrong clipboard by mistake? Not the end of the world – you still have paper and can still take notes, just make sure it’s extra-labelled so it isn’t mixed into the wrong course’s notes. The weekly ritual of transferring my notes to the binder was a great way of reviewing what I’d learned. By eventually having everything organized in a binder, I could easily integrate my notes with other things, like hand-outs, returned assignments, and reading notes. That way everything was together when it came time to review and make study notes for midterms and exams. Since everything was in a big binder, I always knew where my notes were. Plus I got to invest in some super cute dividers! Cons: The pages may get out of order if you’re not consistently dating and labelling every page. The clipboards may be too full to use or you may run out of usable paper if you don’t regularly transfer the pages into your binder(s). It is possible to do this with only one clipboard, but then you have to be even more careful with your labelling so you’re not confusing content from several different courses. This is particularly true if you have several courses that are similar (like near the end of my degree when I was taking nothing but music and literature). Laptop, Chromebook or Tablet You may be wondering – in the 21st century, why was I even bothering with pen and paper? That’s partly personal preference – I learn and retain information better when I’ve written it down – but also due to my technological issues at the time. When I started university, the laptop I had was unfortunate. It was old, it had zero battery life, it was big and clunky, and it was slow. It wasn’t until nearly the end of my first degree that I had a good laptop that could be carried around to classes, but my laptop bag wouldn’t fit a lot of books. I only really brought my laptop to campus if I had an assignment I needed to work on between classes. For teacher’s college, I finally had an iPad mini. I’ve since bought a cheap-but-great Chromebook that was perfect for the additional qualifications course I recently completed (and teaching and blogging). It was great to finally experience life as a student that didn’t involve hand cramps! Tips to Effectively Use Technology for Your Notes: Consider the size of the device you’re using. I much prefer a Chromebook because it’s a lot lighter to carry around than a laptop, but I also love being able to go even smaller and just bring my iPad places, too. Just make sure the device has the speed, power and capabilities you need. If using a tablet, get a decent Bluetooth keyboard to make typing easier and faster. If using a laptop or Chromebook, get a wireless mouse. This Jelly Comb mouse has a little USB receiver that can be stored in the mouse when not in use so it doesn’t get lost. Keep your devices safely secured with the appropriate cases, covers, and bags. Cracked screens are not your friend! Invest in Microsoft 365 and use OneNote to keep all of your notes organized in digital notebooks. (I originally used Evernote but wasn’t a fan.) Since everything is stored in the cloud, you can use it across all your devices. It’s particularly handy on a tablet, where you can take a photo of a lecture slide, notes on a whiteboard, or a chart in your textbook, and pop it right into your notes. Consider getting a stylus, if using a tablet or touchscreen device. OneNote lets you annotate your notes by using a stylus or your finger (but I’m not a fan of using my finger for writing – too messy!). The cloud is your friend! Between my OneNote and Google Drive, I know I’ll never lose data again. (If you’ve ever experienced the tragedy of losing a 5000-word essay at the last minute, you’ll know how important it is to make sure that never happens again.) Plus, again, then things are accessible no matter what device you’re on. Have a folder (and perhaps sub-folders) in your Google Drive for each course. OneNote is great, but you may still have separate files to keep track of – assignments, music files, PDFs of readings. Those still need to be kept well-organized, too! Organize Your University Notes – Which System is Best For You? To find which system helps you organize your university notes the best, you may need to experiment a bit. Goodness knows across my 6 years of university life, I kept changing my mind and trying to improve things. Here are some questions to consider to help you decide where to start: Do you prefer writing or typing? Does one help you learn and retain information better than the other? Are you a fast enough writer to keep up with even the fastest talking professor? How will you best study for exams? Will you want to have everything already contained in a notebook? Would you rather print your notes and highlight them? Is being paperless something you value? What is your budget? How much do you want to carry around with you from day to day? (Consider your mode of transportation – if you ride the bus, like I did, you might want to carry less than if you live on campus or own a car.) I really hope I’ve given you a good idea of how you might like to organize yourself for school. I really do think a solid organization system is key if you want to achieve big things. After all, like my Mom says, “You can’t get dishes clean in a dirty sink!” (Which isn’t a metaphor – she really doesn’t like dirty sinks – but I think it somewhat applies here, too.)

Investing the time to take notes systematically feels like an impediment to learning more by quickly moving on to the next book or article. But if you actually want to do something with the knowledge you encounter, not taking notes systematically is a waste of time. Many answers here provide good ideas for gradually improving what you are already doing, but serious note-taking, done right, will bump you up into a completely different league. A smart note-taking system will not only make you more efficient, but improve the way you read, think, learn and approach your projects. Let me introduce you to Niklas Luhmann and his unmatched note-taking system. Not well known in the English-speaking world, he is one of the most admired German social scientists of the 20th century. Trained as a lawyer and working in public administration in a nine-to-five job, he spent his evenings, like many of us, reading books in which he was interested. What set him apart was the way he took notes, which led to an offer for a professorship in sociology – something he never studied. Fast forward to his inauguration lecture in 1967 (he managed to get the formal requirements for this position within one year, which is a process that involves obtaining a sociology degree, defending a dissertation and handing in a second book as an habilitation). Asked about his project, he answered famously: “Theory of society; duration: 30 years; costs: none”. Twenty-nine and a half years later, he published what is deemed one of the most advanced and complex works in this field. In the meantime, he published around another 60 books plus hundreds of articles on a vast range of topics, including politics, law, art, business, science, epistemology and even love, with many of them becoming highly influential in their respective fields. Asked how he did it, his answer was always the same: with the help of his Zettelkasten – his slip-box with his collected notes (it is currently subject of a research project in Bielefeld, Germany: Niklas Luhmann-Archiv) Unfortunately, until recently, there have existed only a few descriptions of his Zettelkasten, with some of them being misleading and almost all exclusively in German. At some point, I just couldn’t bear watching my students struggle with taking notes in the usual wasteful manner anymore, so I grabbed my own Zettelkasten and wrote a book about how to take smart notes like Luhmann and translated it into English. The technique is actually quite simple, but understanding the principle behind it is also crucial. Here is how it works: Luhmann took literature notes during the day and kept them in one place, sorted alphabetically. His notes comprised just a small piece of paper with a list: On page x it says y. The bibliographic details were on the back. But this was just the preparation for the main and most important step that most people just don’t do: He would go through these (very brief) notes in the evening and think how these ideas connect to what he has thought and written before. Then he would take the related notes out of his Zettelkasten and write down how the new ideas contribute to, challenge or alter his previous thoughts – in full sentences and as clearly as possible. Instead of keeping notes separated by topics (or worse: formats), he collected all of them in one place and actively connected them. New notes would be placed behind the most related one and given a fixed number (note 4 behind note 3 or, if 4 already exists, 3a, then 3a1 etc., branching out with more and more note-sequences). He would then add a few links to other related notes and make an entry in an alphabetical index. It is easy to confuse this technique with the way hyperlinks or tags work on the Internet. But this is not a personal Wiki. It is not about storing knowledge, but about developing thoughts across a wide range of topics and building up long strings of interconnected notes that can easily be turned into manuscripts. We all know that we should elaborate on the things we read and make connections between heterogeneous ideas (as this is basically the only reliable and proven way to learn anything), but few turn this good intention into an actual, tangible everyday practice. A good note-taking system forces us to do what we know is right. The Zettelkasten does exactly that. It is not just about productivity. There is so much more to it! Take the problem of confirmation-bias for example: Most study-guides teach you to start with a research question or brainstorm an idea and then read and take notes relevant to this one project. This is not only wasteful (as you constantly encounter ideas that might not be relevant for this particular project, but for potential projects in the future), but most importantly it is a way of setting yourself up for confirmation bias big time. You create a conflict of interest between getting your paper done and changing your mind – i.e. having insight. If you start with an initial idea you cannot help but filter everything you encounter accordingly, even when you try hard to keep an open mind. Luhmann’s approach is exactly the opposite. The Zettelkasten has no preconceptions of what it is fed. Whatever is deemed interesting is written down and then compared to what was written before. It never ceases to amaze me how many new ideas and insights are produced just by comparing notes side by side. Questions can now emerge from the material, they shouldn’t be imposed on the material!

This one is for Materials Science: When I'm in the lecture, I'll write down my thought process. What is recorded is not neat. It's messy. I have arrows running back and forth across the page. I have breakdowns of the big ideas at play. I use red, blue, and black pens: Blue tends to represent the main stuff, black is for examples, and red is used to highlight the big ideas or to represent my own thoughts, ideas, and comparisons. It's a visual representation of my mind, which friends are either curious or frightened to see ;) Here's what one page looks like. It's from a lecture on a material's electrical behaviour. But you'll never able to read this come exam time! This isn't for studying! The purpose of this hodgepodge is to learn the stuff correctly in the first place. To lock it into place so that I never need to relearn it. Besides, I can read it quite well thank you very much :) You might notice that there's a massive red star. I'll use these sometimes for part two: making the notes neat. Once all lectures are done for the day, I open Evernote on my laptop and create a note for each lecture. Each class has its own notebook. Here's a screenshot of this corresponding lecture: Not a lot, is there? What I've found is, if learned in an interconnected way, each lecture can be summarised by five notes max. Anything more and you're getting into weedy details that may or may not be important. This creates excess waste. Each note is broken into a question-and-answer pair. This allows me to test myself via active recall. Active recall requires mental work on my part, while flat-out bullet points are too easy to lazily digest. For my engineering courses, each Q&A pair tends to focus on 'why is this idea important?' or 'how does this thing work?'. Anything else is too weedy and you're now wasting time revising things that don't deserve the mental RAM. Now, for the revision part. I use whats called Spaced Repetition Studying. The trick here is to revise notes just as they're about to be forgotten. For each day, I have a notebook containing notes that needs to be revised. You'll see the entire set of revision notebooks on the left and the list of notes for a particular day in the middle. For each note, I'll read the questions and attempt to give the answers. If I pass all the questions, then they are next revised even further into the future. Every note is revised the day after the note was made. If passed, it gets reviewed three days later. If it passes again, then it gets revised in a week. You'll notice that the 'next revision time' increases as it goes through more revisions. It's not linear (i.e. revised every three days). This gives me time for the information to erode away with time. This makes it harder, which is the idea of spaced repetition studying. The full list of revision times that I use reads as follows, measured in days, and assuming I answer all the questions correctly: 1, 3, 7, 21, 30, 45. By the 45 day mark, the semester tends to reach an end. What if I get a question wrong? The entire note goes back to the 'review tomorrow' bucket, and has to repeat the process. The cool thing with Evernote is that I can use the smartphone app and revise while walking to uni and between lectures. This means that I give my note system next to no time and oxygen, and it can still survive. Upvote · 999119 93 95 Sponsored by JetBrains DataGrip, a powerful GUI tool for SQL.

I think Evernote is my digital brain. It’s a backup base. It’s a reference base. Especially this helps to become paperless. I use it as my default bookmark, webclip app, note taker, recipe box, receipt box, repository of all my reference material, diary, meeting notes and so on. It’s great to have all the information I need indexed and searchable. Evernote has one big advantage over other tools: the more you add, the more useful it becomes. Though, if you don’t have a system for notebooks and tags from the start, these useful tool will become cluttered and messed up. The system shouldn’t be complex. I don’t recommend making system for the sake of the system itself. The problem with notebooks When I started with Evernote, I organized everything with notebooks, organized into stacks to create a hierarchy. This was huge. Additionally, I’ve met with 2 greatest limitations of organization system based of notebooks: A note can be nested in one notebook only. I always have more relationships for every note. If you want to include a note in two or more notebooks, you have to duplicate the note and put a copy in each notebook. This doesn’t sound like a good system. You’d say that adding tags solves this problem, but actually, it’s not a solution. If you organize notes in a hierarchy of notebook and add multiple tags, how would you search by tags effectively? Over a short period my tags list grew to over 200 and I simply forgot about the most of them, using just the simplest. Having a hierarchy for tags separately is more work than it’s worth. You can only create a hierarchy of notebooks that is one level deep: a stack with a group of Notebooks. You can’t nest notebook in the notebook which is in notebook. I want to be able to organize things in multiple levels. The solution is in minimization of notebook usage and building a wide hierarchy of tags, nested into several groups. I know that it might sound strange, but the system based of tags has some advantages: Notes can have multiple Tags, which means that a note can exist in multiple containers without duplication. For example, if I’m working on a note for a blog post about building personal brand in social media, I can tag it “blog draft”, “personal brand”, and “social media”. In this way, I can see this same note in different stacks, regardless of the tag I am using for search. Tags support multiple hierarchies. This allows organizing tags in a way better than notebooks. How I use notebooks in Evernote to organize study notes Here’s how I use each: Inbox — this notebook is used as place to put a note, which I don’t currently have time to categorize with tags and need to process later. Simply put, if I clip an article from web and which I want to read, but don’t know exactly which tag to appoint, I send it to the Inbox and review it later. Cupboard — this is where I put notes I have processed and want to keep. All these notes have completed compulsory cross-tagging. Logs— my default notebook for diary notes. I created a separate notebook just for the sake of convenience, because I write Logs almost every day. It’s much easier than I used before. Earlier I used almost the same notebooks as tags nowadays. How I use tags I created a hierarchy that reflects how I think about my life, learning, and business. These top levels are all collections. I begin each tag collection with a special character — a period, a carat, or a tilde. When tagging a note, this helps me know that there are more detailed tags under “.productivity” tag, thus I have to go deeper and find more precise one. Plus, special characters help me organize my tags. The best thing is that I can nest these tag collections as deep as I want to go. For example, under my .what tag, I have nested six additional collections. Under .how-to, I have six collections. Under .marketing , I have a set of 12 collections. In the .who collection, I have a tag for each of my teammates and relatives. They start with ^ sign, because this helps in searching and tagging. When a note includes something on Jannet, I simply start typing “^j” in search and result is here without overlaps with other “j” letters. In the ~miscellaneous collection I have twotags: !template — here I keep reusable notes. For example, I have templates for Incident Response, Ideas & Inspiration Collection, Interview Score Card. .checklists — here I store all the Employee Orientation Checklist, Personal Security Checklist, Meeting Notes Checklist, and more. My system is not perfect, but it works for me. How I quickly search for notes I know what you might think, “How does he find note with this ton of tags? Don’t notes with multiple tags appear in many searches which lowers the efficiency of search?” Yeah, agreed. It might be tough to find a note if you don’t know how to find. Here goes Evernote’s advanced search syntax. Let’s look at some examples. If I need to find notes tagged with my wife’s name, I’d type: tag:^jannet Adding complexity, if I need all noted tagged with ^alyona, created during last week, but the note shouldn’t be nested in “.future events” tag: tag:^jannet -tag:\".future events\" created:week-1 That’s useful, but you need to get used to it. Final thoughts The key to Evernote is to commit to it and jump in with both feet. It’s pretty rotten if you’re just using it for a few isolated tasks, because absolutely, it doesn’t do any one thing perfectly and it’s not as fast as other apps. So, if you want to give Evernote another shot, try putting everything in it that you want to hang onto. The more you add, the more useful Evernote becomes.

Whatever you need them for - writing an essay or revising for the upcoming test, it is essential to store them tidy and easily accessible. Here are some ideas to help you get organized with your notes. Using paper Colored paper exists not only for art projects of elementary school pupils. It would be best if you considered using it for your own study projects because it's creative and a fun thing to do. Just make all related notes on sheets of the same color, and don't forget to get yourself a binder and an eyelet puncher. The advantage of keeping all your notes in one place cannot be overestimated. If you are not an enthusiast of binders, you could use a sophisticated concertina file instead. Also, you could give a try to transparent folders with dividers, so you could seamlessly organize your notes according to a topic or as part of an assignment. If you prefer using loose paper, it will make sense to label and number all your pages, but it's a challenging task to stay organized without the help of files and folders. Using note-taking app Digital tools are on the rise today. Not just because of the pandemic crisis, but because of their efficiency, usability, and functionality. If you own a mobile device, give a try to a note-taking app. The best note-taking apps allow keeping all your notes organized in folders and subfolders effortlessly. You can enhance your notes with clipped web pages for further references and insert multimedia files. You can make audio records of the lectures and add such records to your notes as well. You can annotate your notes and share them with your friends if you work on the same project. You can store your notes in the cloud of your choice and access them from any device. If that sounds interesting, I recommend giving a shot to NoteLedge - one of the best note-taking apps out there designed for inventive professionals of all kinds and students. Besides all the features from above, NoteLedge supports Apple Pencil, so you can easily create handwritten notes or use brushes and pens for sketching within your notes, so staying creative is easy. Another great app is Evernote. It offers top-level functionality and a wide range of robust features. And if you write lots of essays, you should definitely consider Ulysses - an easy-to-use note-taking app for Apple users. It offers a sleek interface and a plethora of features (including text-to-Speech) that you can use to write down whatever crosses your mind, add links and images to your notes, and organize them by projects or categories. Hopefully, you will find the most suitable app for your needs and take your note-keeping experience to the next level.

For the actual learning process I still use paper notes. And not going to abandon them any time soon. I think it has something to do with how our memory works. We tend to memorize better when we write, and not type, something. This also explains the limitations of using online flashcards. It helps to some extent, but writing is still better. At least in my experience. So, if I need to memorize new vocabulary, I will try to do it step-by-step. (1) Write new phrases on a scratch paper. I don't keep these notes later, so they are rather messy. I will double-check the meaning of each phrase, ask questions to native speakers whenever I can, or find other examples of usage. (2) Re-write the phrases again in the notepad (and not iPad :), as I am trying to repeat them again and memorize them. (3) Re-write the final list in a small portable notepad that I can take with me and use as a reference or just for the repetition. Yes, it is a time-consuming method, but if you try it, you might also realize that it works better than flashcards or electronic applications. I tried this method for language learning only, but I guess it also works for other learning needs.

Investing the time to take notes systematically feels like an impediment to learning more by quickly moving on to the next book or article. But if you actually want to do something with the knowledge you encounter, not taking notes systematically is a waste of time. Many answers here provide good ideas for gradually improving what you are already doing, but serious note-taking, done right, will bump you up into a completely different league. A smart note-taking system will not only make you more efficient, but improve the way you read, think, learn and approach your projects. Let me introduce you to Niklas Luhmann and his unmatched note-taking system. Not well known in the English-speaking world, he is one of the most admired German social scientists of the 20th century. Trained as a lawyer and working in public administration in a nine-to-five job, he spent his evenings, like many of us, reading books in which he was interested. What set him apart was the way he took notes, which led to an offer for a professorship in sociology – something he never studied. Fast forward to his inauguration lecture in 1967 (he managed to get the formal requirements for this position within one year, which is a process that involves obtaining a sociology degree, defending a dissertation and handing in a second book as an habilitation). Asked about his project, he answered famously: “Theory of society; duration: 30 years; costs: none”. Twenty-nine and a half years later, he published what is deemed one of the most advanced and complex works in this field. In the meantime, he published around another 60 books plus hundreds of articles on a vast range of topics, including politics, law, art, business, science, epistemology and even love, with many of them becoming highly influential in their respective fields. Asked how he did it, his answer was always the same: with the help of his Zettelkasten – his slip-box with his collected notes (it is currently subject of a research project in Bielefeld, Germany: Niklas Luhmann-Archiv) Unfortunately, until recently, there have existed only a few descriptions of his Zettelkasten, with some of them being misleading and almost all exclusively in German. At some point, I just couldn’t bear watching my students struggle with taking notes in the usual wasteful manner anymore, so I grabbed my own Zettelkasten and wrote a book about how to take smart notes like Luhmann and translated it into English. The technique is actually quite simple, but understanding the principle behind it is also crucial. Here is how it works: Luhmann took literature notes during the day and kept them in one place, sorted alphabetically. His notes comprised just a small piece of paper with a list: On page x it says y. The bibliographic details were on the back. But this was just the preparation for the main and most important step that most people just don’t do: He would go through these (very brief) notes in the evening and think how these ideas connect to what he has thought and written before. Then he would take the related notes out of his Zettelkasten and write down how the new ideas contribute to, challenge or alter his previous thoughts – in full sentences and as clearly as possible. Instead of keeping notes separated by topics (or worse: formats), he collected all of them in one place and actively connected them. New notes would be placed behind the most related one and given a fixed number (note 4 behind note 3 or, if 4 already exists, 3a, then 3a1 etc., branching out with more and more note-sequences). He would then add a few links to other related notes and make an entry in an alphabetical index. It is easy to confuse this technique with the way hyperlinks or tags work on the Internet. But this is not a personal Wiki. It is not about storing knowledge, but about developing thoughts across a wide range of topics and building up long strings of interconnected notes that can easily be turned into manuscripts. We all know that we should elaborate on the things we read and make connections between heterogeneous ideas (as this is basically the only reliable and proven way to learn anything), but few turn this good intention into an actual, tangible everyday practice. A good note-taking system forces us to do what we know is right. The Zettelkasten does exactly that. It is not just about productivity. There is so much more to it! Take the problem of confirmation-bias for example: Most study-guides teach you to start with a research question or brainstorm an idea and then read and take notes relevant to this one project. This is not only wasteful (as you constantly encounter ideas that might not be relevant for this particular project, but for potential projects in the future), but most importantly it is a way of setting yourself up for confirmation bias big time. You create a conflict of interest between getting your paper done and changing your mind – i.e. having insight. If you start with an initial idea you cannot help but filter everything you encounter accordingly, even when you try hard to keep an open mind. Luhmann’s approach is exactly the opposite. The Zettelkasten has no preconceptions of what it is fed. Whatever is deemed interesting is written down and then compared to what was written before. It never ceases to amaze me how many new ideas and insights are produced just by comparing notes side by side. Questions can now emerge from the material, they shouldn’t be imposed on the material!

This one is for Materials Science: When I'm in the lecture, I'll write down my thought process. What is recorded is not neat. It's messy. I have arrows running back and forth across the page. I have breakdowns of the big ideas at play. I use red, blue, and black pens: Blue tends to represent the main stuff, black is for examples, and red is used to highlight the big ideas or to represent my own thoughts, ideas, and comparisons. It's a visual representation of my mind, which friends are either curious or frightened to see ;) Here's what one page looks like. It's from a lecture on a material's electrical behaviour. But you'll never able to read this come exam time! This isn't for studying! The purpose of this hodgepodge is to learn the stuff correctly in the first place. To lock it into place so that I never need to relearn it. Besides, I can read it quite well thank you very much :) You might notice that there's a massive red star. I'll use these sometimes for part two: making the notes neat. Once all lectures are done for the day, I open Evernote on my laptop and create a note for each lecture. Each class has its own notebook. Here's a screenshot of this corresponding lecture: Not a lot, is there? What I've found is, if learned in an interconnected way, each lecture can be summarised by five notes max. Anything more and you're getting into weedy details that may or may not be important. This creates excess waste. Each note is broken into a question-and-answer pair. This allows me to test myself via active recall. Active recall requires mental work on my part, while flat-out bullet points are too easy to lazily digest. For my engineering courses, each Q&A pair tends to focus on 'why is this idea important?' or 'how does this thing work?'. Anything else is too weedy and you're now wasting time revising things that don't deserve the mental RAM. Now, for the revision part. I use whats called Spaced Repetition Studying. The trick here is to revise notes just as they're about to be forgotten. For each day, I have a notebook containing notes that needs to be revised. You'll see the entire set of revision notebooks on the left and the list of notes for a particular day in the middle. For each note, I'll read the questions and attempt to give the answers. If I pass all the questions, then they are next revised even further into the future. Every note is revised the day after the note was made. If passed, it gets reviewed three days later. If it passes again, then it gets revised in a week. You'll notice that the 'next revision time' increases as it goes through more revisions. It's not linear (i.e. revised every three days). This gives me time for the information to erode away with time. This makes it harder, which is the idea of spaced repetition studying. The full list of revision times that I use reads as follows, measured in days, and assuming I answer all the questions correctly: 1, 3, 7, 21, 30, 45. By the 45 day mark, the semester tends to reach an end. What if I get a question wrong? The entire note goes back to the 'review tomorrow' bucket, and has to repeat the process. The cool thing with Evernote is that I can use the smartphone app and revise while walking to uni and between lectures. This means that I give my note system next to no time and oxygen, and it can still survive. Upvote · 999119 93 95 Sponsored by JetBrains DataGrip, a powerful GUI tool for SQL.

I think Evernote is my digital brain. It’s a backup base. It’s a reference base. Especially this helps to become paperless. I use it as my default bookmark, webclip app, note taker, recipe box, receipt box, repository of all my reference material, diary, meeting notes and so on. It’s great to have all the information I need indexed and searchable. Evernote has one big advantage over other tools: the more you add, the more useful it becomes. Though, if you don’t have a system for notebooks and tags from the start, these useful tool will become cluttered and messed up. The system shouldn’t be complex. I don’t recommend making system for the sake of the system itself. The problem with notebooks When I started with Evernote, I organized everything with notebooks, organized into stacks to create a hierarchy. This was huge. Additionally, I’ve met with 2 greatest limitations of organization system based of notebooks: A note can be nested in one notebook only. I always have more relationships for every note. If you want to include a note in two or more notebooks, you have to duplicate the note and put a copy in each notebook. This doesn’t sound like a good system. You’d say that adding tags solves this problem, but actually, it’s not a solution. If you organize notes in a hierarchy of notebook and add multiple tags, how would you search by tags effectively? Over a short period my tags list grew to over 200 and I simply forgot about the most of them, using just the simplest. Having a hierarchy for tags separately is more work than it’s worth. You can only create a hierarchy of notebooks that is one level deep: a stack with a group of Notebooks. You can’t nest notebook in the notebook which is in notebook. I want to be able to organize things in multiple levels. The solution is in minimization of notebook usage and building a wide hierarchy of tags, nested into several groups. I know that it might sound strange, but the system based of tags has some advantages: Notes can have multiple Tags, which means that a note can exist in multiple containers without duplication. For example, if I’m working on a note for a blog post about building personal brand in social media, I can tag it “blog draft”, “personal brand”, and “social media”. In this way, I can see this same note in different stacks, regardless of the tag I am using for search. Tags support multiple hierarchies. This allows organizing tags in a way better than notebooks. How I use notebooks in Evernote to organize study notes Here’s how I use each: Inbox — this notebook is used as place to put a note, which I don’t currently have time to categorize with tags and need to process later. Simply put, if I clip an article from web and which I want to read, but don’t know exactly which tag to appoint, I send it to the Inbox and review it later. Cupboard — this is where I put notes I have processed and want to keep. All these notes have completed compulsory cross-tagging. Logs— my default notebook for diary notes.

My system is not perfect, but it works for me. How I quickly search for notes I know what you might think, “How does he find note with this ton of tags? Don’t notes with multiple tags appear in many searches which lowers the efficiency of search?” Yeah, agreed. It might be tough to find a note if you don’t know how to find. Here goes Evernote’s advanced search syntax. Let’s look at some examples. If I need to find notes tagged with my wife’s name, I’d type: tag:^jannet Adding complexity, if I need all noted tagged with ^alyona, created during last week, but the note shouldn’t be nested in “.future events” tag: tag:^jannet -tag:\".future events\" created:week-1 That’s useful, but you need to get used to it. Final thoughts The key to Evernote is to commit to it and jump in with both feet. It’s pretty rotten if you’re just using it for a few isolated tasks, because absolutely, it doesn’t do any one thing perfectly and it’s not as fast as other apps. So, if you want to give Evernote another shot, try putting everything in it that you want to hang onto. The more you add, the more useful Evernote becomes.

Whatever you need them for - writing an essay or revising for the upcoming test, it is essential to store them tidy and easily accessible. Here are some ideas to help you get organized with your notes. Using paper Colored paper exists not only for art projects of elementary school pupils. It would be best if you considered using it for your own study projects because it's creative and a fun thing to do. Just make all related notes on sheets of the same color, and don't forget to get yourself a binder and an eyelet puncher. The advantage of keeping all your notes in one place cannot be overestimated. If you are not an enthusiast of binders, you could use a sophisticated concertina file instead. Also, you could give a try to transparent folders with dividers, so you could seamlessly organize your notes according to a topic or as part of an assignment. If you prefer using loose paper, it will make sense to label and number all your pages, but it's a challenging task to stay organized without the help of files and folders. Using note-taking app Digital tools are on the rise today. Not just because of the pandemic crisis, but because of their efficiency, usability, and functionality. If you own a mobile device, give a try to a note-taking app. The best note-taking apps allow keeping all your notes organized in folders and subfolders effortlessly. You can enhance your notes with clipped web pages for further references and insert multimedia files. You can make audio records of the lectures and add such records to your notes as well. You can annotate your notes and share them with your friends if you work on the same project. You can store your notes in the cloud of your choice and access them from any device. If that sounds interesting, I recommend giving a shot to NoteLedge - one of the best note-taking apps out there designed for inventive professionals of all kinds and students. Besides all the features from above, NoteLedge supports Apple Pencil, so you can easily create handwritten notes or use brushes and pens for sketching within your notes, so staying creative is easy. Another great app is Evernote. It offers top-level functionality and a wide range of robust features. And if you write lots of essays, you should definitely consider Ulysses - an easy-to-use note-taking app for Apple users. It offers a sleek interface and a plethora of features (including text-to-Speech) that you can use to write down whatever crosses your mind, add links and images to your notes, and organize them by projects or categories. Hopefully, you will find the most suitable app for your needs and take your note-keeping experience to the next level.

On a computer have separate folders for each Subjects and sub folders for tasks. (The below screenshot is from my own folders) Name your folders and files meaningfully and logically 6. If you have enough time - You can also prepare a master outline of all the notes that you have ie. you’ll have a clear outline of things that you have with you. 7.

But keeping too many notes is also hardly a productive thing. We need to find the balance. I use electronic notes only for links to websites I find useful. For the actual learning process I still use paper notes. And not going to abandon them any time soon. I think it has something to do with how our memory works. We tend to memorize better when we write, and not type, something. This also explains the limitations of using online flashcards. It helps to some extent, but writing is still better. At least in my experience. So, if I need to memorize new vocabulary, I will try to do it step-by-step. (1) Write new phrases on a scratch paper. I don't keep these notes later, so they are rather messy. I will double-check the meaning of each phrase, ask questions to native speakers whenever I can, or find other examples of usage. (2) Re-write the phrases again in the notepad (and not iPad :), as I am trying to repeat them again and memorize them. (3) Re-write the final list in a small portable notepad that I can take with me and use as a reference or just for the repetition. Yes, it is a time-consuming method, but if you try it, you might also realize that it works better than flashcards or electronic applications. I tried this method for language learning only, but I guess it also works for other learning needs. Let me know how it goes :) Upvote · 9916 Sin 8y Traditional Method: Buy notebooks for different subjects/modules. The sizes and stuff dosent matter, as long as you can write on it.

So much so that you can’t ever find what you need? You’re not alone. While notetaking can be used for school, work, to-do lists, and much more, none of your notes will do you any good if you can’t find them when you need them! Organizing your notes can be a challenge, but it’s not impossible. Here are 9 tips to help keep your notes accessible and ready for action. Make your iPad feel like paper. Get a Paperlike. The original paper-feel screen protector that started it all. Paperlike helps you write and draw on your iPad like on paper. Shop Paperlike Table of Contents⌄ Organization: physical vs. digital notes 1. Sort notes into folders/notebooks 2. Create a table of contents 3. Choose a notetaking method 4. Create a consistent notetaking process 5. Summarize your notes 6. Consider using a notetaking app 7. Make your notes easier to search 8. Utilize flashcards 9. Clean out or archive your notes Take better notes with Paperlike Organization: physical vs. digital notes No matter how you choose to take notes, staying organized is key to long-term success. At Paperlike, we use our iPads, Apple Pencils, and Screen Protectors to create digital notes and stay organized. But if you’re still taking notes by hand, don’t worry! From mind maps to bullet points, we still use a lot of the same techniques you’d use with pen and paper! While the images in this article are mostly focused on how to stay organized using digital notes, we’re talking about techniques that can be used to keep your physical notes in prime condition! 1. Sort notes into folders/notebooks The easiest and most obvious way to organize your notes is to sort them into different folders or notebooks by type. If you’re still using pen and paper, use separate notebooks for each class, subject, work project, or task. You can add tabs or dividers throughout the notebook to further separate topics. Digital notes can be divided and organized using the same system. Most notetaking apps allow you to sort your notes into different folders and subfolders for deeper organization. Color coding also comes in handy when trying to stay on top of your notes. Notability allows you to use different color covers to organize your notebooks into different subjects. If you’re taking notes by hand, you can buy a regular notebook with a solid color cover for each subject so that your notes for a given subject or project are easy to spot. You could also store additional handouts (syllabus, slides, etc.) in a folder of the same color, assuming that you can’t keep all of your documents together in a shared binder. You can do the same thing with digital notebooks by changing the cover in your notetaking app. For any handouts, simply scan the document and add it as a page or attachment in your digital notebook. 2. Create a table of contents Before you even start taking notes, set yourself up for success by creating a table of contents. This easy reference point will help you find the sections you’re looking for without having to search through the entire notebook. The best part? You can do this in regular or digital notebooks! In a regular notebook, you’ll just label the top of the first two or three pages “Table of Contents.” Then you’ll number the rest of the pages. But don’t worry! You can do that as you go along. Any time you start a note, write the subject and date at the top of the page. When you finish your notes, you’ll add the subject and coordinating page numbers to your table of contents. It’s that easy. Using a naming convention will also help to keep your titles consistent and distinguishable when you’re searching through them later. Digital notes offer a few more options for fast navigation. Evernote allows you to hyperlink to different pages in your notes, so you can easily create a table of contents. Some notetaking apps, like Evernote and Microsoft OneNote, allow you to create a table of contents with hyperlinks that will take you directly to the pages you need. Others, like GoodNotes, have a custom outline format that you can use by creating headers and subheads for your topics. When you upload a PDF that includes a table of contents, Noteshelf will use bookmarks to help you quickly navigate through the document. If you don’t love the idea of creating a table of contents, you could try something like a bullet journal instead. Bullet journaling is a unique and fun way to keep your calendar, to-do lists, notes, and everything else organized and separate. 3. Choose a notetaking method A good notetaking method will help you keep your notes structured and organized, regardless of whether you’re handwriting your notes or taking them down digitally. GoodNotes offers a built-in Cornell template to make taking notes in this method even easier. Select this from the page template, and you’re all set! There are a ton of great systems out there, but how do you know which one is right for you? Here are a few different approaches to consider: Outline - Pretty much everyone has tried this easy-to-use method at some point in their life. It’s the most structured, and its hierarchical nature helps students to get down the content and create relationships. If you choose this method, your notes will be neat and easy to review. The downside is you might be so focused on getting the information in the right locations that you’re not necessarily understanding it as you write it. Best for structured classes or lectures. Cornell - The Cornell method utilizes a split-page notetaking system with three sections. You’ll have a large column for your notes and a narrow column for cues or recall. This column should contain the key points, important connections, and relevant questions. You’ll also write a quick summary highlighting the main takeaways at the bottom of the page. Best for quick recall of key points. Visual - Visual notes, or sketchnoting, combine drawings, symbols, and handwritten notes to quickly get down the information in a visual way. Instead of transcribing or writing down information word for word, this method allows you to engage different parts of the brain and really pushes you to comprehend the material and make connections. Best for taking down notes fast and for visual learners. Want to learn more? Jump over to our article on how to take notes fast, for an in-depth look at other notetaking methods that we didn’t cover here. And, if you’re a digital notetaker, never fear! GoodNotes, Notability, and all the other notetaking apps are compatible with most of these methods. Some even have notetaking templates prebuilt into their template library, or you can pick out some awesome templates from around the web. 4. Create a consistent notetaking process The most important organizational hack is to build a consistent notetaking process. It doesn’t matter which of the tips on this list you choose to use, as long as you use them (or don’t) every time you take notes. What does this look like? Choose one of the above notetaking methods and stick to it. Switching back and forth between different styles can create a lot of confusion. Take your notes for each meeting or class in the same notebook every time, or file them in the appropriate folder when you’re done. Use the same colors, fonts, and themes. If your first note has all the main topics in red, subtopics in blue, and details in black, use those same colors every time. Use a naming convention or title your notes in the same way for each item. Make sure to put important features, such as the date and your summaries, in the same location every time, whether that’s in the top corner, at the bottom of the page, or anywhere else. Studies show that information workers regularly lose up to two hours a week searching for lost digital documents. If you have a consistent notetaking system, you can save yourself a lot of time and headaches. 5. Summarize your notes Taking effective notes and creating a summary at the end of your notes makes it easier to find the key pieces of information quickly and is the best method for comprehending the material you learn. Some of the notetaking methods we’ve talked about already utilize a summary. For the ones that don’t, it’s a good idea to add it at the end of your notetaking session. There are a couple of different ways you can do it: 1. Progressive summarization is a great way to capture the key points, and it doesn’t require a whole lot of rewriting. Instead, you’ll read through your notes and bold or underline the important points. Then, read through the sentences you’ve selected and highlight the best of the best. Now, you should have all the information you need to write a mini-summary. 2. Box off or highlight a section at the bottom of your notes for a quick summary. You’ll see this in any Cornell Notes template, but it’s useful in other formats, too. Your summary should include the main points of each section, so you can get the gist of what you’ve written in a few (brief!) sentences. Regardless of which method you choose, try to summarize your notes right after your class or meeting while the information is still fresh. If that’s not an option, try to get it done sometime the same day. Digital notetakers can create a separate notebook for summaries to keep them all in one place. When it’s time to study, you’ll know exactly where to look to find all the key points. 6. Consider using a notetaking app Going digital introduces a lot of quality-of-life features to speed up and refine the notetaking process. You’ll have plenty of choices when it comes to notetaking apps, so you’ll need to find one that suits your needs, your writing style, and helps you take your best notes. These apps are really useful for a number of reasons: Templates and duplication tools can help you save time on setup and stay consistent. Pens, highlighters, and other tools allow you to customize your notes on the fly. Lasso and selection tools make it easy to structure and arrange your notes in a logical way. Nesting structures like folders, subfolders, notebooks, and tags all allow you to easily organize your notes. Optical character recognition (OCR) scans and recognizes typed text, text in images, in PDFs, and even handwritten notes, increasing searchability. Automatic saving and syncing with the cloud make it easy to access your notes on multiple devices. On top of everything else, it’s much easier to carry a digital tablet to class than a stack of notebooks. To figure out which notetaking app will work best for you, you’ll need to determine what kinds of notes you’ll be taking the most. There are a ton of great options out there, and most of them are free to try. 7. Make your notes easier to search Taking great notes won’t matter if you can’t find what you need. Even if you’ve highlighted and boxed all the important bits, you can still end up rifling through pages upon pages of notes without some way to quickly identify critical information. To solve this, try adding something to your notes that will make them easier to spot. For paper notes, that might include: Drawings or symbols that represent key takeaways. Graphs or tables with relevant information. If you’re flipping through a paper notebook, looking for a specific drawing will be a lot easier than sifting through all the handwritten text for one sentence. With the Gallery View in Apple Notes, you can see pictures from your notes to easily spot the one you need. The same applies to digital notes, but you’ve got a few more options: Photos relating to the topic. PDFs that correlate with your notes. In fact, many notetaking apps, such as Apple Notes, use a grid view with inserted photos as the thumbnail image. You can also use OCR to search through these added images and PDFs, making it even faster to get to the right section of your notes. Most notetaking apps also offer bookmarking or allow you to flag/highlight important pages or sections of your notes. You can utilize these features to quickly navigate to those sections whenever you need them. 8. Utilize flashcards Organization doesn’t stop with keeping your notes in order. You can also use flashcards to organize your study notes into a system that will help you learn the content more effectively. With flashcards, you can: Organize your notes into smaller chunks of information that are easier to digest and remember. Use them to review, memorize information, or self-test to prepare for exams. These tools are very easy to make. Just buy some index cards and fill in vocabulary or key concepts on one side and the description details on the reverse. Cardflow allows you to create digital flashcards, a major timesaver when you want to study using digital tools. Digital index card options are available for digital notetakers. These tools function the same way as their paper counterparts, and most offer just as much flexibility, without the bulk of a stack of cards. You can even download these apps on your iOS and Android smartphones so that you can study while on the go. Utilizing flashcards to quiz yourself is a proven, step-by-step method that will help to improve your recall and your test scores. 9. Clean out or archive your notes Now that you’ve got nice, neat, organized notes, it’s important that you keep them that way by setting up an archival system. If you know you don’t need your notes anymore, don’t be afraid to throw them out. If you think you may need your notes at some point in the future, find a place to file or store them out of the way. This is trickier with physical notes because they take up space, but using the same system over several years will help you stay organized for the long term. For digital notes, look through your most recent notes to make sure everything is labeled and in the right place. If your notes are digital, look for untitled notes. Give them a title and move them to their proper folder. You should also go through all your notes every so often to delete or archive anything you don’t need anymore. Check for notebooks with only one or two notes and either combine them or delete them if they’re no longer necessary. A few of the types of notes that you can delete are: Finished checklists/to-do lists. Meeting notes that are no longer useful to your job. Any note that’s no longer relevant. Notes that can be archived include: Draft versions of your notes. These are the full notes that you took and either rewrote or summarized on a different page, so you don’t need the full text anymore. Notes from classes you’ve finished but might need to revisit someday (ex: Algebra 1 notes when you’re now in Algebra 2 class). The beauty of digital notes is that you can archive anything you’re not currently using without losing the information forever. This clears up some space in your app, allowing you to make new notes and keep only the ones that you need handy.

So much so that you can’t ever find what you need? You’re not alone. While notetaking can be used for school, work, to-do lists, and much more, none of your notes will do you any good if you can’t find them when you need them! Organizing your notes can be a challenge, but it’s not impossible. Here are 9 tips to help keep your notes accessible and ready for action. Make your iPad feel like paper. Get a Paperlike. The original paper-feel screen protector that started it all. Paperlike helps you write and draw on your iPad like on paper. Shop Paperlike Table of Contents⌄ Organization: physical vs. digital notes 1. Sort notes into folders/notebooks 2. Create a table of contents 3. Choose a notetaking method 4. Create a consistent notetaking process 5. Summarize your notes 6. Consider using a notetaking app 7. Make your notes easier to search 8. Utilize flashcards 9. Clean out or archive your notes Take better notes with Paperlike Organization: physical vs. digital notes No matter how you choose to take notes, staying organized is key to long-term success. At Paperlike, we use our iPads, Apple Pencils, and Screen Protectors to create digital notes and stay organized. But if you’re still taking notes by hand, don’t worry! From mind maps to bullet points, we still use a lot of the same techniques you’d use with pen and paper! While the images in this article are mostly focused on how to stay organized using digital notes, we’re talking about techniques that can be used to keep your physical notes in prime condition! 1. Sort notes into folders/notebooks The easiest and most obvious way to organize your notes is to sort them into different folders or notebooks by type. If you’re still using pen and paper, use separate notebooks for each class, subject, work project, or task. You can add tabs or dividers throughout the notebook to further separate topics. Digital notes can be divided and organized using the same system. Most notetaking apps allow you to sort your notes into different folders and subfolders for deeper organization. Color coding also comes in handy when trying to stay on top of your notes. Notability allows you to use different color covers to organize your notebooks into different subjects. If you’re taking notes by hand, you can buy a regular notebook with a solid color cover for each subject so that your notes for a given subject or project are easy to spot. You could also store additional handouts (syllabus, slides, etc.) in a folder of the same color, assuming that you can’t keep all of your documents together in a shared binder. You can do the same thing with digital notebooks by changing the cover in your notetaking app. For any handouts, simply scan the document and add it as a page or attachment in your digital notebook. 2. Create a table of contents Before you even start taking notes, set yourself up for success by creating a table of contents. This easy reference point will help you find the sections you’re looking for without having to search through the entire notebook. The best part? You can do this in regular or digital notebooks! In a regular notebook, you’ll just label the top of the first two or three pages “Table of Contents.” Then you’ll number the rest of the pages. But don’t worry! You can do that as you go along. Any time you start a note, write the subject and date at the top of the page. When you finish your notes, you’ll add the subject and coordinating page numbers to your table of contents. It’s that easy. Using a naming convention will also help to keep your titles consistent and distinguishable when you’re searching through them later. Digital notes offer a few more options for fast navigation. Evernote allows you to hyperlink to different pages in your notes, so you can easily create a table of contents. Some notetaking apps, like Evernote and Microsoft OneNote, allow you to create a table of contents with hyperlinks that will take you directly to the pages you need. Others, like GoodNotes, have a custom outline format that you can use by creating headers and subheads for your topics. When you upload a PDF that includes a table of contents, Noteshelf will use bookmarks to help you quickly navigate through the document. If you don’t love the idea of creating a table of contents, you could try something like a bullet journal instead. Bullet journaling is a unique and fun way to keep your calendar, to-do lists, notes, and everything else organized and separate. 3. Choose a notetaking method A good notetaking method will help you keep your notes structured and organized, regardless of whether you’re handwriting your notes or taking them down digitally. GoodNotes offers a built-in Cornell template to make taking notes in this method even easier. Select this from the page template, and you’re all set! There are a ton of great systems out there, but how do you know which one is right for you? Here are a few different approaches to consider: Outline - Pretty much everyone has tried this easy-to-use method at some point in their life. It’s the most structured, and its hierarchical nature helps students to get down the content and create relationships. If you choose this method, your notes will be neat and easy to review. The downside is you might be so focused on getting the information in the right locations that you’re not necessarily understanding it as you write it. Best for structured classes or lectures. Cornell - The Cornell method utilizes a split-page notetaking system with three sections. You’ll have a large column for your notes and a narrow column for cues or recall. This column should contain the key points, important connections, and relevant questions. You’ll also write a quick summary highlighting the main takeaways at the bottom of the page. Best for quick recall of key points. Visual - Visual notes, or sketchnoting, combine drawings, symbols, and handwritten notes to quickly get down the information in a visual way. Instead of transcribing or writing down information word for word, this method allows you to engage different parts of the brain and really pushes you to comprehend the material and make connections. Best for taking down notes fast and for visual learners. Want to learn more? Jump over to our article on how to take notes fast, for an in-depth look at other notetaking methods that we didn’t cover here. And, if you’re a digital notetaker, never fear! GoodNotes, Notability, and all the other notetaking apps are compatible with most of these methods. Some even have notetaking templates prebuilt into their template library, or you can pick out some awesome templates from around the web. 4. Create a consistent notetaking process The most important organizational hack is to build a consistent notetaking process. It doesn’t matter which of the tips on this list you choose to use, as long as you use them (or don’t) every time you take notes. What does this look like? Choose one of the above notetaking methods and stick to it. Switching back and forth between different styles can create a lot of confusion. Take your notes for each meeting or class in the same notebook every time, or file them in the appropriate folder when you’re done. Use the same colors, fonts, and themes. If your first note has all the main topics in red, subtopics in blue, and details in black, use those same colors every time. Use a naming convention or title your notes in the same way for each item. Make sure to put important features, such as the date and your summaries, in the same location every time, whether that’s in the top corner, at the bottom of the page, or anywhere else. Studies show that information workers regularly lose up to two hours a week searching for lost digital documents. If you have a consistent notetaking system, you can save yourself a lot of time and headaches. 5. Summarize your notes Taking effective notes and creating a summary at the end of your notes makes it easier to find the key pieces of information quickly and is the best method for comprehending the material you learn. Some of the notetaking methods we’ve talked about already utilize a summary. For the ones that don’t, it’s a good idea to add it at the end of your notetaking session. There are a couple of different ways you can do it: 1. Progressive summarization is a great way to capture the key points, and it doesn’t require a whole lot of rewriting. Instead, you’ll read through your notes and bold or underline the important points. Then, read through the sentences you’ve selected and highlight the best of the best. Now, you should have all the information you need to write a mini-summary. 2. Box off or highlight a section at the bottom of your notes for a quick summary. You’ll see this in any Cornell Notes template, but it’s useful in other formats, too. Your summary should include the main points of each section, so you can get the gist of what you’ve written in a few (brief!) sentences. Regardless of which method you choose, try to summarize your notes right after your class or meeting while the information is still fresh. If that’s not an option, try to get it done sometime the same day. Digital notetakers can create a separate notebook for summaries to keep them all in one place. When it’s time to study, you’ll know exactly where to look to find all the key points. 6. Consider using a notetaking app Going digital introduces a lot of quality-of-life features to speed up and refine the notetaking process. You’ll have plenty of choices when it comes to notetaking apps, so you’ll need to find one that suits your needs, your writing style, and helps you take your best notes. These apps are really useful for a number of reasons: Templates and duplication tools can help you save time on setup and stay consistent. Pens, highlighters, and other tools allow you to customize your notes on the fly. Lasso and selection tools make it easy to structure and arrange your notes in a logical way. Nesting structures like folders, subfolders, notebooks, and tags all allow you to easily organize your notes. Optical character recognition (OCR) scans and recognizes typed text, text in images, in PDFs, and even handwritten notes, increasing searchability. Automatic saving and syncing with the cloud make it easy to access your notes on multiple devices. On top of everything else, it’s much easier to carry a digital tablet to class than a stack of notebooks. To figure out which notetaking app will work best for you, you’ll need to determine what kinds of notes you’ll be taking the most. There are a ton of great options out there, and most of them are free to try. 7. Make your notes easier to search Taking great notes won’t matter if you can’t find what you need. Even if you’ve highlighted and boxed all the important bits, you can still end up rifling through pages upon pages of notes without some way to quickly identify critical information. To solve this, try adding something to your notes that will make them easier to spot. For paper notes, that might include: Drawings or symbols that represent key takeaways. Graphs or tables with relevant information. If you’re flipping through a paper notebook, looking for a specific drawing will be a lot easier than sifting through all the handwritten text for one sentence. With the Gallery View in Apple Notes, you can see pictures from your notes to easily spot the one you need. The same applies to digital notes, but you’ve got a few more options: Photos relating to the topic. PDFs that correlate with your notes. In fact, many notetaking apps, such as Apple Notes, use a grid view with inserted photos as the thumbnail image. You can also use OCR to search through these added images and PDFs, making it even faster to get to the right section of your notes. Most notetaking apps also offer bookmarking or allow you to flag/highlight important pages or sections of your notes. You can utilize these features to quickly navigate to those sections whenever you need them. 8. Utilize flashcards Organization doesn’t stop with keeping your notes in order. You can also use flashcards to organize your study notes into a system that will help you learn the content more effectively. With flashcards, you can: Organize your notes into smaller chunks of information that are easier to digest and remember. Use them to review, memorize information, or self-test to prepare for exams. These tools are very easy to make. Just buy some index cards and fill in vocabulary or key concepts on one side and the description details on the reverse. Cardflow allows you to create digital flashcards, a major timesaver when you want to study using digital tools. Digital index card options are available for digital notetakers. These tools function the same way as their paper counterparts, and most offer just as much flexibility, without the bulk of a stack of cards. You can even download these apps on your iOS and Android smartphones so that you can study while on the go. Utilizing flashcards to quiz yourself is a proven, step-by-step method that will help to improve your recall and your test scores. 9. Clean out or archive your notes Now that you’ve got nice, neat, organized notes, it’s important that you keep them that way by setting up an archival system. If you know you don’t need your notes anymore, don’t be afraid to throw them out. If you think you may need your notes at some point in the future, find a place to file or store them out of the way. This is trickier with physical notes because they take up space, but using the same system over several years will help you stay organized for the long term. For digital notes, look through your most recent notes to make sure everything is labeled and in the right place. If your notes are digital, look for untitled notes. Give them a title and move them to their proper folder. You should also go through all your notes every so often to delete or archive anything you don’t need anymore. Check for notebooks with only one or two notes and either combine them or delete them if they’re no longer necessary. A few of the types of notes that you can delete are: Finished checklists/to-do lists. Meeting notes that are no longer useful to your job. Any note that’s no longer relevant. Notes that can be archived include: Draft versions of your notes. These are the full notes that you took and either rewrote or summarized on a different page, so you don’t need the full text anymore. Notes from classes you’ve finished but might need to revisit someday (ex: Algebra 1 notes when you’re now in Algebra 2 class). The beauty of digital notes is that you can archive anything you’re not currently using without losing the information forever. This clears up some space in your app, allowing you to make new notes and keep only the ones that you need handy.

As with most facets of education, organizing is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Fortunately, there are many ways to organize school and study materials to keep mess at bay. To cover different personalities and organization styles, we’ve gathered 7 different ways to keep your schoolwork and study notes neat and tidy. Become a Better Student Equip yourself to succeed in studying with the right habits. Get the 10 key habits you need to develop (FREE)! SEND IT TO ME ⇨ Why Students Need to Keep Their Study Materials Organized Before we discuss how to be an organized student, let’s talk about why it’s important in the first place. Mastering an organization system for your notes has many benefits: Priority Assessment: Easily identify high-priority assignments and notes so you get the most important work done first. Stress Reduction: Reduce clutter and prevents feelings of panic by knowing where every item is the moment it is needed. Time Management: No more wasting time searching for notes that you need to complete an assignment or study for a test. As you can see, it’s important to know how to organize studying in such a way that allows you to focus on learning. Disarray is an ineffective study habit that only leads to frustration. No one wants to lose time on lost algebra formulas. A quick note before we move on: It’s even more critical to know how to study effectively. Learn how to study well with Study Skills Guide: Study less. understand more. It’s possible with the right strategies: BUY NOW ⇨ Next, let’s look at 7 effective organizing systems to suit any learning style. 1. Organize by Subject with Spiral-Bound Notebooks An inexpensive, well-tested way to organize your study notes is the humble spiral-bound notebook. The advantages of a spiral notebook: The spiral binding keeps all your notes in one place. If you need to remove a page, its perforated edges make it easy. That said, spiral notebooks work well for handwritten notes, but they do have some disadvantages: There’s nowhere to store loose notes and worksheets (even if you choose a notebook with a pocket—they don’t hold much). There’s no way to reorder pages. Once they’re torn out, they can’t be returned to the notebook. For these reasons, spiral-bound notebooks are typically used as part of a larger filing system. 2. Create an All-in-One Solution with a 3-Ring Binder and Dividers One of the best ways to organize school work is with a 3-ring binder and dividers. 3-ring binders are preferred by many students for several reasons: They allow you to separate each subject or topic, since you can easily move papers around. They store looseleaf paper, pages torn from the aforementioned spiral notebook, and worksheets all in one place. You can keep pens and highlighters handy right inside the binder in a 3-hole-punched pouch made for the purpose. Still, such binders are not perfect: Using one binder for all of your work can get cumbersome and heavy. You have to take the time to punch holes in everything. Opening and closing the rings for every item can be frustrating. 3. Use Digital Organization Options If you prefer to organize study time digitally, you have several options. You can store everything directly on your computer, utilizing digital folders to contain and separate each school subject. There are also online note-organizing apps, such as Google Drive, Evernote, and Trello. It’s certainly nice to reduce paper clutter, but there will always be worksheets and paperwork. Unless you plan on scanning and uploading every single item, you’ll still need some sort of paper system. Advantages of digital notetaking include: You can access your study materials from anywhere via an internet-based app or with a USB drive. You can upload photos and documents directly to your notetaking program and clip online articles for later reference. Depending on your device, talk-to-text allows you to input text more quickly. The disadvantages of digital organizing include: Syncing updates across all devices requires an internet connection. Overwriting a file is a distinct possibility. Google Drive has an “undo” feature, but it can be finicky. If your computer gets a virus or crashes for some other reason, you can lose all of your notes. That brings me to my next point…. Word of Caution: Create Backups for All Digital Notes If you use a digital notetaking method, always, always, always back up your files. (Did I mention always?) Backups ensure your hard work doesn’t disappear due to electronic failure or overwriting a document. 4. Organize by Topic with Index Card Rings Another way to organize study materials is with index card rings. This method is especially useful for memorizing and quizzing yourself via flashcards. Some students prefer index cards for notetaking because they’re easy to carry around and rearrange. Unfortunately, they are also easy to mix up, which is where the ring comes into play. Just hole-punch the corners and insert the index cards onto a ring that holds them together. Benefits: It’s a compact and portable method. The index cards can hang on a hook above your desk, making them easily accessible. You can easily rearrange, add to, or take away cards as needed. Drawbacks: You’ll need to keep a hole-punch handy. Sometimes, the rings can loosen, and index cards can fall out. You’ll still need a way to organize worksheets, outlines, etc. 5. Systematize with an Index Card Holder and Labeled Dividers As we mentioned, index cards are one of the best ways to get organized so study sessions are a breeze. If you prefer to organize your study materials with index cards but dislike the idea of a hole punch, try an index card holder with labeled dividers. This type of system allows you to quickly move cards around and keep them separated by topic. Its other advantages include: Dividers provide flexibility in how you arrange the cards—by date, chapter, subject, topic, etc. It’s portable, and typically secured with a lid. You can use color-coded dividers for further organization. A few disadvantages include: If you were to trip while carrying the holder, it can open and scatter index cards everywhere. It can’t fit in your pocket like an index card ring can. It’s a bit bulky and takes up space on a desk or shelf. 6. Keep Your Notes Orderly with an Expanding File Folder For fans of the 3-ring binder system who don’t want the extra work of hole-punching and opening binder rings, organized notes are still possible using an expanding file folder. I’ve used this type of organizing system for notes myself because I love how easy it is to tuck new paperwork into them. It’s like a mini, portable filing cabinet. Benefits of this type of system: It expands as needed, accommodating more and more paperwork. It has built-in dividers and tabs for labeling. You can carry it with you. Disadvantages of this type of system: When you need to access something, you may have to take several papers out to find what you need. It’s hard—nearly impossible—to keep notes in a specific order. It encourages “paper stuffing” with little to no further organization. Papers can be bulging out the top before you know it. 7. Utilize a Hanging File Organizer Every method we’ve discussed so far has been portable. If you have space for a more fixed organizing solution in your study area, try integrating a hanging file organizer. This type of system works especially well for students who need to keep their materials “in sight and in mind.” What I like about this method: You can see all of your files at one time and keep them safe and accessible. They’re available in different sizes from 3 “pockets” all the way to 20. You can use it with color-coded file folders for further organization. Potential drawbacks of this method: It’s not portable and not ideal if you do school “on the go.” For some students, keeping files “front and center” can feel intimidating. This method isn’t conducive to quizzing yourself quickly. If you’ve tried and failed to get organized as a student in the past, you may just need a new method. Try one or more of these creative ways to organize your study materials to find the system that’s best for you. Need help developing the skills to study well? Study less. understand more.

I use a combination of colors, diagrams, pictures, and questions to be able to distinguish between different classes, lecture topics, information, ideas, and important points. Surprisingly, it has taken me quite a long time to finally figure out that note taking is more about reviewing information from the class than just learning from the class material while it is being taught. After I finally perfected my system, I find myself actually wanting to review my notes every day. I am now able to connect my notes with my homework, reading assignments, and projects as well as be able to prepare for upcoming exams. Perhaps most importantly, however, I have been able to use my previous notes and note-taking skills to be able to study for much more important exams, such as the Fundamentals of Geology exam (first exam towards becoming a licensed professional geologist). I hope to be able to continue this pattern and be able to use my current and future notes to prepare for the Fundamentals of Engineering, Professional Geology, and Professional Engineering exams as well.

These are things that I use today to keep my notes looking colorfully organized. The Olden Chapters Student Printable Planner: This is a printable student planner that includes over 50 incredibly useful planning pages, including monthly and weekly calendars, study plans, budget sheets, assignment trackers and so much more. It is perfect to add the front of your binder! Staples Better Binder: I prefer this 1.5-inch binder with D-rings, incredibly durable and stops the paper from curling in the back. Pilot Juice Up Colored Pens: I have been loving these 0.4 point gel pens! They are incredible. If you’re super serious about pens, they even have a 22 pack. Staedtler Triplus Fineliner Pens: This is another great pen pack, these are felt tip and perfect for anyone looking to up their pen game! Zebra Mildliner Highlighters: My all-time favorite highlighters. I’ll never use a different highlighter again. They have two tips (regular sized tip and fine tip) and come in beautiful mild colors. Five-Star Reinforced College-Ruled Paper: This is incredibly nerdy but I swear by this paper. Very little bleed-through, it is 8.5×11 inches (surprisingly hard to find) and has reinforced holes so you don’t tear your pages! Avery 5-Tab Dividers: I do put washi tape over my dividers, but these are the ones I use. Tips for How to Take College Notes Now that we know WHAT to use to take great notes, let’s get into HOW to take college notes, shall we? Related: The Ultimate College Freshman Survival Guide 1. Use a Binder System After years of using spiral bound notebooks, I was frustrated with not being able to add handouts, move pages around, or be able to use single pages for study purposes. The binder system has completely solved this problem for me. I can now organize every class into one binder and am able to quickly flip through pages to find the information I need later on. As a bonus, this is incredibly important for archiving purposes. The binder system allows me to organize my notes after the class has completed. I am now able to reference it later on in future classes and in my career. Using binders is also a great way to keep handouts, returned quizzes, tests, labs, and all other related material organized in one place. When I set up my binder, I always have the following sections of each class: Handouts: syllabus, reading schedules, lab syllabus, class information, assignments, returned exams, and important general handouts such as the periodic table, geologic time scale, list of important math formulas, the unit circle, important vocab, etc. (more specific handouts are put into my notes section) Labs + Projects: here, I keep all future, graded, or current labs and projects in chronological order Notes: this is the meat of my binder where I keep all of my notes for each given class as well as notes on readings I have done, class handouts that are associated with specific lectures, etc. Related: Organize Your Life with the Only Student Printable Planner You’ll Ever Need in School Tip: I have found that in some classes, the desk is not large enough to accommodate an entire binder during lecture. To solve this, I usually keep loose-leaf paper tucked into my backpack and binder. Sometimes, I will also bring a clipboard or binder clip to keep all of my loose pages together. If you encounter this, the key is to always add your notes to the binder at the end of the day. Pin this post for later! 2. Color Code Each Class Color coding each class is a simple and effective way to organize. Each class in my binder is easily identifiable. You can use these colors, not only when dividing up your notes within your binder, but also on your calendar. Using these colors, you are able to easily plan out assignments, exams, etc. without having to write each class every time. In my binder, to distinguish my different classes, I make sure that the dividers, tabs, and reference material notes are in that given color. Many people will also use their class color for all of their notes or highlighted material as well. I don’t find that helpful myself (see below) but if you do, go for it! Related: The Ultimate Finals Week Survival Guide: 55 Secrets for Success 3. Combine Your Notes with Handouts Your notes should be a fluid and seamless stream of information. Throughout your lecture notes, you should add in relevant handouts that fill in any gaps your notes may be lacking. For example, let’s say you’re taking a physics class. This particular lecture is going over rotational kinematics. Your professor goes over multiple word problems and examples in class but covers multiple formulas. In your notes, you should follow along and take notes as usual. When you get home to review the material, you should print out a handout of all the rotational kinematic formulas and any relevant diagrams right after your last page of notes. Sometimes, I will look ahead in the lecture material and bring in printed handouts with me to be able to write on them during the lecture as well. But seriously, who has time to do that? Just print it afterward and I promise it will help you in the long run! Here is a list of potential information and printouts that can be added to your notes: In-class assignments Reading notes (your personal notes on assigned readings) Lecture slideshow printouts Pictures, graphics, etc. Scanned copies of important graphics in textbooks Vocabulary, formulas, or other important information only relevant to a particular lecture or section Photocopies of notes taken in other courses that are relevant Tip: If your handout is blank on the back, the next day, just start taking notes on that blank side, it will keep your notes looking consistent. 4. Create a Color Combo for each Topic Color coding can be also used to identify different lecture topics. This is crucial when going back to review for an exam or trying to quickly find a piece of information for an assignment or group project. For example, I always use the color purple to distinguish any physics class I am in. So the dividers and tabs are all purple. But when it comes to lectures, each lecture topic (in physics it usually represent each chapter in the textbook) is a different color. In order to keep a flow of different colors, I usually start with the class color for the first chapter/lecture topic, then go down the rainbow. This is what my notes would look like: Syllabus/calendar/tabs/dividers: Purple highlighters, pens, and dividers all used Chapter 1 (Concepts of Motion): Purple Chapter 2 (Kinematics in One Dimension): Pink Chapter 3 (Vectors): Red Chapter 4 (Kinematics in Two Dimension): Orange Chapter 5 (Force and Motion): Green (I skip yellow, it’s too light) And so on… For each section, I will use a dark color for titles and headers, a lighter color for the full text, an accent color for important topics, information, or formulas, and highlighters for material that will be on the exam. Often in class, the professor will say “this will be on the exam,” that is a good clue to highlight it… Pin this post for later! 5. Distinguish Crucial Information from Supporting Material Continuing on with color coding your different lecture topics, it is important to be able to identify what material is crucial to your understanding of the topic, and what is just supporting. I do this in two ways. First, like explained above, I use a highlighter only to highlight material that is either crucial or is distinctly given to us for an exam. The second way I do this is using the left-hand margin. I do not write anything on the left-hand margin except the date and crucial signifiers such as question marks (to review later), stars (will be on the exam), and asterisks (memorize). This way, when I quickly look down the margin, I will be able to identify anything crucial or review-worthy if I have only a few minutes to study. This can also help if you have to write an on this material later on. Related: The Ultimate Guide to Writing an A+ Research Paper 6. Write Your Own Tests and Study Guides This is college. Many many professors do not handout study guides for students to cram last minute. We need to take matters into our own hands. I will do this by creating my own test questions in my notes. I will write the question on a sticky note and put the answer behind it. This way, when I am reviewing my notes, I can easily and quickly test myself on the material in question. When test time rolls around, I am able to combine all of these questions into my own practice exam to quiz myself. Another way I use these questions are to create study guides. A combination of the crucial material in each section with the questions I have created gives a great overview of each topic and an easy way to study for exams and finals. Related: The Ultimate Guide to Studying for an Exam 7. Add Summaries Stretching your brain to review material without looking at your notes is a great way to learn. You can do this at the end of each lecture, end of each day, or at the end of each topic. I prefer to do only one summary per lecture topic in order to review the topic as a whole. I will do this by first writing a small summary paragraph without looking at my notes. Then I will read through my notes and correct any errors and expand any ideas. This is also a great way to create a quick reference for future you! I used all of my lecture summaries when studying for my licensing exam. It gave me the ability to know where I needed to find information quickly as well as an easy and quick review of each section. I have GREAT section review worksheets included in my Ultimate Student Printable Planner Bundle! 8. Add Mind-Maps After each summary, sketch up a quick mind-map for each topic. This will help fill in any gaps of material and help you connect each different topic to the main subject matter of the course. I love doing these so much! In fact, this is my favorite study technique! Related: A Colege List of FREE College Resources (59+ Included!) 9. Date your Notes Best friend skipped class two Wednesdays ago and needs to bum some notes? Professor says the exam will cover material from February 3rd to March 10th? There is a dozen reason to date your notes and surprisingly, a lot of students don’t. It’s so easy! Just do it! 10. Clearly Mark Exam Sections When I say “Exam Sections” I mean this: your professor says on the syllabus that Exam 1 will cover Lectures 1-4 and Exam 2 will cover 5-9 while the final will only cover lectures 3-8. Your exam section for Exam 1 would be lectures 1-4 (not the lectures themselves, the group of lectures). You should be able to distinguish between these sections easily. This will save you wasted study time. Trust me! I separate my exam sections by: Adding labeled sticky-tabs to the first and last page of each exam section and Adding a full blank page between each exam section. This way, when I am reading through my notes and end on a blank page, I know I have reached the end of the material I need to study. 11. Review Your Notes Everyday I know, I know. After a long day of classes, work, homework, group project meetings, labs, workouts, club activities, volunteer events, scholarship applications… all you want to do is jump on the couch and veg out. I’m with ya! But I promise you! If you take 5-10 extra minutes of brain activity to quickly review your notes (you have worked so hard on), you will actually be saving yourself SO MUCH TIME! Homework, quizzes, and projects will be so much easier for you to understand and when it comes to testing time? You will have most of the information down EASY! Pin this post for later! 12. Make Your Notes System Unique The list above is just the tips and tricks I have learned that work for me throughout my years in college. This is by no means a complete list of laws each student should follow for success. There are countless other great systems that work for other people. Trial and error are key. Keep working on your system and make it work for you. Good luck!

I use a combination of colors, diagrams, pictures, and questions to be able to distinguish between different classes, lecture topics, information, ideas, and important points. Surprisingly, it has taken me quite a long time to finally figure out that note taking is more about reviewing information from the class than just learning from the class material while it is being taught. After I finally perfected my system, I find myself actually wanting to review my notes every day. I am now able to connect my notes with my homework, reading assignments, and projects as well as be able to prepare for upcoming exams. Perhaps most importantly, however, I have been able to use my previous notes and note-taking skills to be able to study for much more important exams, such as the Fundamentals of Geology exam (first exam towards becoming a licensed professional geologist). I hope to be able to continue this pattern and be able to use my current and future notes to prepare for the Fundamentals of Engineering, Professional Geology, and Professional Engineering exams as well.

Tips for How to Take College Notes Now that we know WHAT to use to take great notes, let’s get into HOW to take college notes, shall we? Related: The Ultimate College Freshman Survival Guide 1. Use a Binder System After years of using spiral bound notebooks, I was frustrated with not being able to add handouts, move pages around, or be able to use single pages for study purposes. The binder system has completely solved this problem for me. I can now organize every class into one binder and am able to quickly flip through pages to find the information I need later on. As a bonus, this is incredibly important for archiving purposes. The binder system allows me to organize my notes after the class has completed. I am now able to reference it later on in future classes and in my career. Using binders is also a great way to keep handouts, returned quizzes, tests, labs, and all other related material organized in one place. When I set up my binder, I always have the following sections of each class: Handouts: syllabus, reading schedules, lab syllabus, class information, assignments, returned exams, and important general handouts such as the periodic table, geologic time scale, list of important math formulas, the unit circle, important vocab, etc. (more specific handouts are put into my notes section) Labs + Projects: here, I keep all future, graded, or current labs and projects in chronological order Notes: this is the meat of my binder where I keep all of my notes for each given class as well as notes on readings I have done, class handouts that are associated with specific lectures, etc. Related: Organize Your Life with the Only Student Printable Planner You’ll Ever Need in School Tip: I have found that in some classes, the desk is not large enough to accommodate an entire binder during lecture. To solve this, I usually keep loose-leaf paper tucked into my backpack and binder. Sometimes, I will also bring a clipboard or binder clip to keep all of my loose pages together. If you encounter this, the key is to always add your notes to the binder at the end of the day. Pin this post for later! 2. Color Code Each Class Color coding each class is a simple and effective way to organize. Each class in my binder is easily identifiable. You can use these colors, not only when dividing up your notes within your binder, but also on your calendar. Using these colors, you are able to easily plan out assignments, exams, etc. without having to write each class every time. In my binder, to distinguish my different classes, I make sure that the dividers, tabs, and reference material notes are in that given color. Many people will also use their class color for all of their notes or highlighted material as well. I don’t find that helpful myself (see below) but if you do, go for it! Related: The Ultimate Finals Week Survival Guide: 55 Secrets for Success 3. Combine Your Notes with Handouts Your notes should be a fluid and seamless stream of information. Throughout your lecture notes, you should add in relevant handouts that fill in any gaps your notes may be lacking. For example, let’s say you’re taking a physics class. This particular lecture is going over rotational kinematics. Your professor goes over multiple word problems and examples in class but covers multiple formulas. In your notes, you should follow along and take notes as usual. When you get home to review the material, you should print out a handout of all the rotational kinematic formulas and any relevant diagrams right after your last page of notes. Sometimes, I will look ahead in the lecture material and bring in printed handouts with me to be able to write on them during the lecture as well. But seriously, who has time to do that? Just print it afterward and I promise it will help you in the long run! Here is a list of potential information and printouts that can be added to your notes: In-class assignments Reading notes (your personal notes on assigned readings) Lecture slideshow printouts Pictures, graphics, etc. Scanned copies of important graphics in textbooks Vocabulary, formulas, or other important information only relevant to a particular lecture or section Photocopies of notes taken in other courses that are relevant Tip: If your handout is blank on the back, the next day, just start taking notes on that blank side, it will keep your notes looking consistent. 4.

      "content": "How to Organize Notes Like a Pro: Tips for Students - Mem Get Mem free ← Back Oct 28, 2024 How to Organize Notes Like a Pro: Tips for Students Effective note organization is a crucial skill for academic success and developing good study habits. Whether you're a high school student or pursuing higher education, mastering the art of organizing your notes can significantly improve your learning experience, boost your grades, and contribute to long-term retention of information. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore various note organization techniques and study tips to help you organize your notes like a pro and establish effective study practices. Why Organizing Notes Matters Before diving into the specifics, let's understand why organizing notes is so important for your academic journey: Improved retention of information Easier review and revision Better preparation for exams Enhanced understanding of complex topics Time-saving during study sessions Development of effective study habits Improved long-term memory recall Now, let's explore some effective methods to organize your notes and boost your study skills. Choose the Right Note-Taking Method Selecting an appropriate note-taking method is the first step toward effective organization. Here are some popular techniques to help you capture and organize important points: The Cornell Method The Cornell Method is a systematic approach that divides your page into three sections: Notes column (right side): Record lecture notes, main ideas, and key points. Cue column (left side): Write questions or keywords related to the notes. Summary section (bottom): Summarize the main ideas in a few sentences. This method helps in quick review and self-testing, making it ideal for active recall and effective study sessions. The Outline Method The Outline Method involves organizing information in a hierarchical structure: Main topics Subtopics Supporting details This method works well for well-structured lectures and helps in visualizing the relationships between different concepts. It's particularly useful for creating study guides and summarizing important points. Mind Mapping Mind mapping is a visual note-taking technique that uses diagrams to represent ideas and concepts: Start with a central topic in the middle of the page. Branch out with subtopics and related ideas. Use colors, symbols, and images to enhance visual appeal. This method is particularly useful for creative thinkers and visual learners, helping them connect various concepts and remember information more effectively. Bullet Point Method The Bullet Point Method is a simple yet effective way to organize notes: Use short, concise phrases or sentences Start each point with a bullet or dash Indent sub-points for better organization Use symbols to indicate importance or action items This method is excellent for capturing key information quickly and creating easy-to-review study materials. Digital vs. Handwritten Notes Choosing between digital and handwritten notes depends on personal preference and learning style. Here's a quick comparison to help you decide: Digital Notes: Easy to edit and organize Searchable content Sync across devices Integrate multimedia elements Convenient for long-term storage Handwritten Notes (Physical Notes): Better retention and recall More flexibility in formatting Fewer distractions Improved focus during lectures Tactile experience enhances memory Experiment with both methods to find what works best for you. Some students find that a combination of digital and physical notes suits their study habits best. Color-Coding and Highlighting Implementing a color-coding system can make your notes more visually appealing and easier to navigate: Assign specific colors to different types of information (e.g., definitions, examples, important concepts). Use highlighters or colored pens consistently across your notes. Create a color key at the beginning of your notebook for quick reference. Use different colors for headings, subheadings, and body text. Remember to use colors sparingly to avoid overwhelming your notes with too much visual information. The goal is to enhance readability and highlight important points, not to create a rainbow of distractions. Utilize Technology for Note Organization Several digital tools can help streamline your note organization process and support effective study habits: Evernote: A versatile note-taking app that allows you to create, organize, and sync notes across devices. OneNote: Microsoft's digital notebook that offers flexible organization and multimedia integration. Notion: A powerful all-in-one workspace for notes, tasks, and databases. Google Keep: A simple note-taking app with color-coding and labeling features. These tools offer features like tagging, search functionality, and cloud storage, making it easier to manage and access your notes for long-term use. Mem: A Powerful Note Organization Tool Mem is an innovative note-taking and knowledge management platform that offers several features to enhance your note organization and study habits: AI-powered organization: Mem uses artificial intelligence to automatically organize and connect your notes, making it easier to find related information. Daily notes: Capture thoughts, ideas, and important points throughout the day in a chronological format. Bi-directional linking: Create connections between different notes, helping you build a network of knowledge. Collaborative features: Share notes and collaborate with classmates on group projects or study sessions. Tags and mentions: Easily categorize and cross-reference your notes for efficient retrieval. Search functionality: Quickly find specific information within your notes using Mem's powerful search feature. Mobile app: Access your notes on-the-go, perfect for reviewing during short study breaks. By leveraging Mem's features, you can create a comprehensive and interconnected knowledge base that supports effective studying and long-term information retention. Create a Logical Filing System Whether you're using physical notebooks or digital files, a well-structured filing system is essential for effective note organization: Organize notes by subject or course. Use clear and consistent naming conventions for files and folders. Create subfolders for specific topics or units within each subject. Regularly archive old notes to keep your current materials easily accessible. Consider using a separate notebook for each subject to keep information compartmentalized. For physical notes, consider using binders with dividers or accordion files to keep subjects separate and easily accessible. Review and Revise Regularly Organizing notes isn't a one-time task. Make it a habit to review and revise your notes regularly to reinforce your learning and maintain effective study habits: Set aside time each week (at least 30 minutes) to go through your notes. Summarize key points and create concise study guides. Identify gaps in your understanding and seek clarification. Update your notes with additional information or examples. Create flashcards or practice questions based on your notes. This practice not only keeps your notes organized but also reinforces your learning and helps with long-term retention of information. Time Management for Effective Note Organization Incorporating note organization into your study routine requires good time management skills: Schedule dedicated time for organizing notes after each class or lecture. Spend 5-10 minutes at the end of each study session to tidy up and review your notes. Set aside 30 minutes each week for a comprehensive review and organization of all your notes. Use time-blocking techniques to allocate specific periods for note-taking, review, and organization. By making note organization a regular part of your study routine, you'll develop effective study habits that will serve you well throughout your academic career. Collaborate and Share Notes Collaborating with classmates can enhance your note-taking and organization skills: Form study groups to compare and discuss notes. Use collaborative tools like Google Docs or Mem to create shared study materials. Teach concepts to others to reinforce your understanding. Exchange notes with classmates to fill in gaps and gain different perspectives. Remember to always contribute equally and respect others' intellectual property when sharing notes. Collaborative note-taking can be especially useful for complex subjects or when preparing for exams. Adapting Note Organization for Different Types of Information Different subjects and types of information may require different organization techniques: Lecture Notes Focus on capturing the main ideas and important points. Use abbreviations and symbols to write quickly. Leave space for adding details or clarifications later. Reading Notes Summarize key concepts and arguments. Note page numbers for easy reference. Use quotes sparingly, focusing on paraphrasing the main ideas. Lab Notes Record procedures, observations, and results. Include diagrams or sketches when relevant. Note any deviations from expected outcomes. Meeting Notes Capture action items and decisions made. Note down questions or points for follow-up. Summarize key takeaways at the end of the meeting. By tailoring your note organization techniques to the specific type of information, you'll create more effective and useful study materials. Conclusion Organizing notes effectively is a skill that can significantly impact your academic performance and contribute to long-term learning. By implementing these strategies and finding what works best for you, you'll be well on your way to becoming a note-taking pro. Remember, consistency is key – stick to your chosen methods and refine them as you go along. With practice, these note organization techniques will become second nature, supporting your study habits and academic success for years to come. FAQs What is the best way to make notes for students?

      "title": "How to Organize Notes Like a Pro: Tips for Students - Mem Get Mem free ← Back Oct 28, 2024 How to Organize Notes Like a Pro: Tips for Students Effective note organization is a crucial skill for academic success and developing good study habits. Whether you're a high school student or pursuing higher education, mastering the art of organizing your notes can significantly improve your learning experience, boost your grades, and contribute to long-term retention of information. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore various note organization techniques and study tips to help you organize your notes like a pro and establish effective study practices. Why Organizing Notes Matters Before diving into the specifics, let's understand why organizing notes is so important for your academic journey: Improved retention of information Easier review and revision Better preparation for exams Enhanced understanding of complex topics Time-saving during study sessions Development of effective study habits Improved long-term memory recall Now, let's explore some effective methods to organize your notes and boost your study skills. Choose the Right Note-Taking Method Selecting an appropriate note-taking method is the first step toward effective organization. Here are some popular techniques to help you capture and organize important points: The Cornell Method The Cornell Method is a systematic approach that divides your page into three sections: Notes column (right side): Record lecture notes, main ideas, and key points. Cue column (left side): Write questions or keywords related to the notes. Summary section (bottom): Summarize the main ideas in a few sentences. This method helps in quick review and self-testing, making it ideal for active recall and effective study sessions. The Outline Method The Outline Method involves organizing information in a hierarchical structure: Main topics Subtopics Supporting details This method works well for well-structured lectures and helps in visualizing the relationships between different concepts. It's particularly useful for creating study guides and summarizing important points. Mind Mapping Mind mapping is a visual note-taking technique that uses diagrams to represent ideas and concepts: Start with a central topic in the middle of the page. Branch out with subtopics and related ideas. Use colors, symbols, and images to enhance visual appeal. This method is particularly useful for creative thinkers and visual learners, helping them connect various concepts and remember information more effectively. Bullet Point Method The Bullet Point Method is a simple yet effective way to organize notes: Use short, concise phrases or sentences Start each point with a bullet or dash Indent sub-points for better organization Use symbols to indicate importance or action items This method is excellent for capturing key information quickly and creating easy-to-review study materials. Digital vs. Handwritten Notes Choosing between digital and handwritten notes depends on personal preference and learning style. Here's a quick comparison to help you decide: Digital Notes: Easy to edit and organize Searchable content Sync across devices Integrate multimedia elements Convenient for long-term storage Handwritten Notes (Physical Notes): Better retention and recall More flexibility in formatting Fewer distractions Improved focus during lectures Tactile experience enhances memory Experiment with both methods to find what works best for you. Some students find that a combination of digital and physical notes suits their study habits best. Color-Coding and Highlighting Implementing a color-coding system can make your notes more visually appealing and easier to navigate: Assign specific colors to different types of information (e.g., definitions, examples, important concepts). Use highlighters or colored pens consistently across your notes. Create a color key at the beginning of your notebook for quick reference. Use different colors for headings, subheadings, and body text. Remember to use colors sparingly to avoid overwhelming your notes with too much visual information. The goal is to enhance readability and highlight important points, not to create a rainbow of distractions. Utilize Technology for Note Organization Several digital tools can help streamline your note organization process and support effective study habits: Evernote: A versatile note-taking app that allows you to create, organize, and sync notes across devices. OneNote: Microsoft's digital notebook that offers flexible organization and multimedia integration. Notion: A powerful all-in-one workspace for notes, tasks, and databases. Google Keep: A simple note-taking app with color-coding and labeling features. These tools offer features like tagging, search functionality, and cloud storage, making it easier to manage and access your notes for long-term use. Mem: A Powerful Note Organization Tool Mem is an innovative note-taking and knowledge management platform that offers several features to enhance your note organization and study habits: AI-powered organization: Mem uses artificial intelligence to automatically organize and connect your notes, making it easier to find related information. Daily notes: Capture thoughts, ideas, and important points throughout the day in a chronological format. Bi-directional linking: Create connections between different notes, helping you build a network of knowledge.

By leveraging Mem's features, you can create a comprehensive and interconnected knowledge base that supports effective studying and long-term information retention. Create a Logical Filing System Whether you're using physical notebooks or digital files, a well-structured filing system is essential for effective note organization: Organize notes by subject or course. Use clear and consistent naming conventions for files and folders. Create subfolders for specific topics or units within each subject. Regularly archive old notes to keep your current materials easily accessible. Consider using a separate notebook for each subject to keep information compartmentalized. For physical notes, consider using binders with dividers or accordion files to keep subjects separate and easily accessible. Review and Revise Regularly Organizing notes isn't a one-time task.
