  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, let’s kick back and unpack what we’ve got with this URL: https://getmorebacklinks.org/. Just looking at the name, it’s pretty clear what the main gig here is—backlinks. If you’re not in the SEO game, backlinks are basically links from one website to another. They’re like little endorsements that say, “Hey, this site knows what’s up!” Google loves them, and they’re a big part of how websites rank in search results. So, with a name like “Get More Backlinks,” you can bet this site is all about helping folks boost their website’s SEO mojo. Probably offering some kind of service or tools to help people get those all-important backlinks. Maybe they’ve got a range of strategies or methods laid out to bring traffic to your site and improve that ranking juice. I wouldn’t be surprised if they feature guides or articles explaining different tactics—like guest blogging, outreach, or even using social media to build up those links. I can imagine they’ve got testimonials from happy customers who’ve seen their rankings skyrocket after using the site. It’s the classic story of someone starting a blog or website and struggling to get noticed, then stumbling across this treasure trove of backlink advice and suddenly finding their niche audience. There’s probably a section where they break down the importance of having quality backlinks versus just having a bunch of them. Because let’s be real, not all backlinks are created equal. Some are like gold, while others might just be a distraction, dragging your rank down instead of lifting it up. They might throw in some case studies showing how specific strategies worked wonders for real-life sites. And knowing the online marketing scene, they could be sharing some free resources, like backlink checkers or calculators, tools to help you analyze your current standing. A chance to peek at your competitors' backlinks might be on the table too—because who doesn’t want that insider info, right? I wouldn’t be shocked if they also have a blog or resource center filled with tips and tricks, maybe even some SEO news to keep readers in the loop about the latest algorithm changes. You love to see a site that’s not just about selling a service but also about educating its visitors. Also, let’s not ignore the possibility of some kind of community element, where users can share their experiences, ask questions, and swap strategies. That adds a nice personal touch—like a pub for SEO enthusiasts, where you can kick back and chat about what’s working and what’s not. With all this talk about backlinks, I'd expect they might also touch on related topics—like content marketing, because let’s face it, killer content is often the bait that gets those backlinks in the first place. They might explain how crafting great content can attract natural backlinks over time, with lists of content types that shout “link me!” In short, I’m picturing a spot where site owners can come together, soak up the knowledge, and hopefully walk away with a game plan to dominate their niche. Whether they decide to go full-on backlink service or just arm visitors with knowledge, you can bet it’s all geared towards making their sites more visible and that’s a win in the SEO world. So yeah, if you’re looking to boost your online presence, that URL is likely a solid place to start. Grab a drink, browse around, and get ready to learn a thing or two about those precious backlinks! Cheers!",

Your ultimate guide to hiring an SEO expert in 2020 What's the difference between on-page and off-page SEO? 3 ways to build backlinks without breaking the bank Building backlinks is the key to off-page SEO but it's really tough to get them. We'll teach you how to do it without destroying your wallet buckle. Jun 21, 2019 • 5 minute read Updated on Jan 22, 2020 by Adam S. Adam S. @HomebrandAdam Content Manager at Freelancer.com Copy to clipboard failed, please try again after adjusting your permissions. Copied to clipboard. Getting links to your site doesn’t have to cost you time, money or integrity. Backlinks building is one of the most watertight SEO strategies you can commit time and resources to. So many websites break their backs trying to figure out the strange alchemy of search engine optimisation. But as most people know the tides of Google are unpredictable; tricks and hacks that work one day might not work (or even work against you) the next. So it’s wise to batten down the hatches and hold on tight to the strategies we know will weather the storm of Google’s next update. Links from sites with high domain authority tell Google you’re a source to be trusted and Google will always trust the word of a weathered sea captain. The problem is, building backlinks on your own watch can be time-consuming and the siren’s call of shady link-building businesses can be all too tempting. But charting that route is a fool’s errand and most shortcuts lead to despair (and low-quality links). Lucky for you landlubbers, we know of some seaworthy strategies that will help you land the big links. Hunting down broken or out of date links Let’s say you’ve just published a fresh page or tool. You’ve poured blood, sweat and tears into your page, right? So it’s safe to assume that, whatever the use case, your guide, app or tool is at this moment in time, the most reliable and accurate version available on the internet. So why wouldn’t people want to link to it? For example, let’s just say you’ve just launched a new tool that compares pricing on sneakers. As slick as your idea might be, you’re not the first to think of it. But let’s say for the sake of this article that the fine folks at ShoeKicker have decided that monitoring price changes just isn’t worth their time. That would make your tool the most relevant on the market and the one big publications would much rather link to. Featured Work in SEO 1st page - Pool Construction Canada by calciustech Our Client's Organic Traffic Report by MasterRewathi SEO for Insulation Company (Canada) by calciustech SEO for Cleaning Supplies Site in UK by calciustech ShoeKicker would make your job fairly easy in this case as they, like most other tools and services, list the big-name publications that have provided coverage for their tool. All you would need to do in this case is tailor your Google search using the ‘site:search’ function. Let’s say ShoeKicker’s website mentions The Boston Globe in its coverage section. To find that particular article, all you need to do is type ‘site:https://www.bostonglobe.com shoekicker’ into Google’s search bar and it should return the exact post/page that mentions ShoeKicker. Now in this sad, hypothetical timeline, ShoeKicker just ain’t cutting the mustard any more. Worst case scenario, the site is no longer operational. That’s when it's time to swoop in, like some kind of sneaker-obsessed savior. If you believe your tool is more up to date or more relevant, you might suggest this in an email to The Boston Globe’s webmaster. And if the link is dead, it’s in The Boston Globe’s best interest to replace it. If it’s the latter, the friendly Bostonians might thank your eagle-eyed link monitoring with a link back to your new and improved tool. It can be a little trickier with the former, as this particular post is quite clearly a news article of the time, specifically about the company ShoeKick. So that’s not as simple as swapping out a link and will require a little extra effort on the webmaster’s behalf. But who is this mysterious webmaster? Did they create the web? Or are they simply another pawn in weblord’s sick game? It’s always a bit of a mystery, to be honest. And reaching out to massive publishers will often result in heartbreak. For a site like The Boston Globe or Lifehacker, we’d recommend reaching out to the author of the article (so long as they're staff and not freelance). If it’s a smaller site or blog you’re angling, there are three methods for getting in touch ranging from casual outreach to getting desperate: use the contact link at the bottom in the site’s footer or contact section, look up the webmaster using a domain lookup such as whois or contact the domain host directly. Guest posting Your sneaker website is live, you’ve hooked a few cheeky links in ShoeKick’s stead and the SEO skies are clearing a little. People are using your tool, making purchases, leaving feedback. Everything is just peachy. But who the hell are you? What’s your deal? I mean, great tool but we still wouldn’t be able to pick you out of a lineup of peppy entrepreneurs. As the captain of this here ship, it’s important that your name goes down in history. From here on out, you are the sneaker guy. The one the internet goes to for advice when they need slick new kicks. You’ve done the work; late nights of market research and monolithic spreadsheets. Any website that reviews clothing and apparel would kill for that kind of niche expertise. They’d straight up murder a fool if it came for free. That’s the strategy. Simply reach out to a webmaster or content pitch submission form with your background and an offer of a free review all for a simple link back to your comparison tool. Not only does that get you a tidy backlink, but it also helps build authority with Google. The more your byline appears at the top of sneaker-related content, the more Google will begin to see you as an authority on the topic. When the internet needs a leader in the sneaker space, you’re basically a shoe-in. Ahem. Sorry. Use your data to tell compelling stories Comparison tools like the lovely ShoeKicker have upwards of 50,000 people per month using their comparison tools. With the help of Google Analytics, these tools have access to incredibly unique datasets that reveal current consumer trends in their particular corner of the internet. If your tool or website is the most popular in its field, it's fair to say you have one of the most comprehensive insights on consumer purchasing habits and retailer pricing structures. Nowhere near enough comparison websites take advantage of this data to segment their audiences to tell a compelling story. If you can map out the data in a way that says something about consumer demographics in the sneaker industry, put it to good use. Even if you’re not the most experienced writer, there are thousands upon thousands of hungry freelancers out there who will take your data and weave a wonderful tale about the latest purchasing trends. To sweeten the pot, you could also hire a freelance graphic designer who can transform that data into a wonderful, shareable infographic. Maybe more people in Salt Lake City purchase more hiking boots than any other city in the world, or maybe people from Colorado don’t actually purchase Colorado shoes. Alone, these discoveries don’t seem like much but there should be enough on hand to flesh out a much larger story on the purchasing trends underfoot. Outlets also love a gorgeous infographic as they tell 90% of the story and can be easily embedded. If your designer is using a tool like Piktochart or Infogram to create a dynamic/interactive infographic, you can also link back to your site. Meaning that, wherever the infographic is shared, you will receive a backlink.

Any website that reviews clothing and apparel would kill for that kind of niche expertise. They’d straight up murder a fool if it came for free. That’s the strategy. Simply reach out to a webmaster or content pitch submission form with your background and an offer of a free review all for a simple link back to your comparison tool. Not only does that get you a tidy backlink, but it also helps build authority with Google. The more your byline appears at the top of sneaker-related content, the more Google will begin to see you as an authority on the topic. When the internet needs a leader in the sneaker space, you’re basically a shoe-in. Ahem. Sorry. Use your data to tell compelling stories Comparison tools like the lovely ShoeKicker have upwards of 50,000 people per month using their comparison tools. With the help of Google Analytics, these tools have access to incredibly unique datasets that reveal current consumer trends in their particular corner of the internet. If your tool or website is the most popular in its field, it's fair to say you have one of the most comprehensive insights on consumer purchasing habits and retailer pricing structures. Nowhere near enough comparison websites take advantage of this data to segment their audiences to tell a compelling story. If you can map out the data in a way that says something about consumer demographics in the sneaker industry, put it to good use. Even if you’re not the most experienced writer, there are thousands upon thousands of hungry freelancers out there who will take your data and weave a wonderful tale about the latest purchasing trends. To sweeten the pot, you could also hire a freelance graphic designer who can transform that data into a wonderful, shareable infographic. Maybe more people in Salt Lake City purchase more hiking boots than any other city in the world, or maybe people from Colorado don’t actually purchase Colorado shoes. Alone, these discoveries don’t seem like much but there should be enough on hand to flesh out a much larger story on the purchasing trends underfoot. Outlets also love a gorgeous infographic as they tell 90% of the story and can be easily embedded. If your designer is using a tool like Piktochart or Infogram to create a dynamic/interactive infographic, you can also link back to your site. Meaning that, wherever the infographic is shared, you will receive a backlink.

December 9, 2024 Building backlinks is one of the best ways to improve your website’s SEO, but paying for links isn’t always an option, especially for small businesses or new websites. The good news? You don’t need a big budget to get great backlinks. There are plenty of simple and free ways to boost your site’s authority and rank higher in search engines. In this article, we’ll share 24+ easy tactics to earn free backlinks—no confusing steps, just practical strategies anyone can use to grow their online presence. Let’s get started! 52% Say Link Building’s Tough Over 52% of SEOs agree—link building is the ultimate challenge in SEO! But with the right strategies, you can turn this daunting task into a powerful advantage. Contents Toggle 1) Publish Original Research or Case Studies 2) Create Engaging Infographics 3) Offer Guest Posts 4) Pitch for Broken Link Building 5) Claim Unlinked Mentions 6) Answer Relevant Questions on Quora 7) Contribute to High-Quality Forums 8) Add Value to Wikipedia 9) Publish Trend-Focused Content 10) Submit Your Site to High-Quality Directories 11) Collaborate on Round-Up Posts 12) Host Free Webinars or Events 13) Repurpose Existing Content 14) Contribute Testimonials 15) Reach Out for Resource Page Links 16) Promote Content on Reddit 17) Participate in Online Competitions or Giveaways 18) Co-Create Content with Partners 19) Submit Press Releases to Free PR Sites 20) Leverage Social Media Platforms 21) Host an AMA (Ask Me Anything) 22) Promote Content on SlideShare or Scribd 23) Find Relevant Edu Backlinks 24) Provide Free Plugins or Widgets Outreach Monks: Your Link-Building Partner! Conclusion FAQs on Free Backlinks 1) Publish Original Research or Case Studies Original research and case studies can easily attract backlinks. People often link to content that offers unique data or solves specific problems. Begin with your own data, a survey, or a case study from the real world. For example, you may have helped some client double his traffic; you can write a case study explaining how you did it step by step. Why it Works: People trust content backed by data or real results. Unique insights make your site a go-to resource in your niche. Backlinko creates original research that’s highly useful, attracting free backlinks from top websites that cite their studies. 2) Create Engaging Infographics Infographics are one of the effective ways to get backlinks. The data will look attractive in a graphical sense that makes the information possible to understand and shareable. Start with a relevant topic to speak to your audience, perhaps from industry trends, insights gathered from data, or simple how-to guides. Then utilize free design tools such as Canva or Piktochart for clean and professional graphics. Keep it really simple and use some combination of charts and icons that will add a level of visual depth to the message; avoid filling up viewers with too much text. Once your infographic is ready, share it widely. Post it on your website and social media platforms, and even submit it to infographic directories like Visual.ly. When others find your infographic useful, they’re more likely to share it on their platforms and link back to your site. Quick Tip Include an embed code below your infographic to make it easy for others to share while giving credit to your website. 3) Offer Guest Posts Guest posting sometimes costs, mainly when the site you wish to target charges a fee for publishing. Still, free guest post opportunities exist, if approached the right way. How to Land Free Guest Posts Offer High-Quality Content: Blogs value unique, well-researched articles that provide real value to their readers. Show examples of your best work to prove you can deliver. Get Creative with Outreach: Personalize your outreach emails and stand out. Avoid using generic pitches, be engaging, do your homework, and add some personality. A little bit of humor or a creative subject line does wonders. Focus on the Right Blogs: Target blogs which are close to your niche and whose readers are quite active. Never fail to check whether the website is authentic or worthy of your effort. Sometimes, even without explicitly aiming for free opportunities, a well-crafted pitch and excellent content can earn you a free guest post. Use our list of free guest posting sites to get started! 4) Pitch for Broken Link Building Broken link building involves finding non-working links on other websites and suggesting your content as a replacement. It’s a straightforward way to earn backlinks while helping website owners improve their sites. To get started, use tools like Ahrefs or Broken Link Checker to identify broken links on relevant websites in your niche. Once you’ve found one, contact the site owner and politely point out the broken link. Offer your content as a replacement, explaining how it fits their page and adds value. This method works because website owners want to fix broken links to maintain their SEO and user experience. By providing a solution, you build goodwill and gain a high-quality backlink in return. Expert Tip! Personalize your outreach email. Mention the specific broken link and clearly explain how your content fills the gap—it increases your chances of success. 5) Claim Unlinked Mentions If people are discussing your business or website already but don’t link it, that’s free backlinks being missed. A simple and easy tactic to have unlinked mentions turned into backlinks is claiming them. First, you can use tools like BuzzSumo or Google Alerts to search for mentions of your brand or website. If you do not want to spend money, you can search for mentions yourself by Googling your business name and using search operators to filter out results from your website or social media pages. For example: Search for your brand name followed by -site:yourdomain.com to exclude your own site. Refine results by excluding major platforms like Facebook or Twitter if they’re not relevant. When you find an article mentioning your brand without a link, reach out to the site owner. Politely thank them for mentioning your business and ask if they’d consider adding a link to make it more helpful for their readers. Why It Works People are already aware of your brand, so it’s not a cold pitch. It’s a win-win situation, as adding the link improves their content and boosts your SEO. Set up Google Alerts to track mentions of your business in real-time. This saves time and ensures you don’t miss any new opportunities. 6) Answer Relevant Questions on Quora Quora is a great platform to build free backlinks by answering questions related to your expertise. It lets you share knowledge while subtly promoting your content. Start by identifying questions related to your niche or industry. Use Quora’s search bar to find topics where your knowledge can add value. Look for questions with high engagement, such as those with many followers or views, to maximize your reach. When answering, provide detailed and helpful responses. Include a link to your website, blog, or resource if it genuinely adds value to your answer. For example, if someone asks for tips on improving website traffic, you can briefly answer the question and link to a blog post offering more insights. Stay Authentic and Avoid Over-Promotion Quora’s moderators keep a close watch for spam. To avoid issues, only add links when they naturally fit into your answer and truly benefit the reader. This approach keeps your responses valuable and trustworthy, increasing the chances of readers engaging with your content. 7) Contribute to High-Quality Forums Forums are online communities where people discuss specific topics, and they can be a great place to share your expertise and earn free backlinks. These forums allow you to share insights, answer questions, and link to your content where it genuinely adds value. How to Get Started: Find Relevant Forums: Use tools like FindAForum or search for active communities in your industry. Create a Profile: Add your website or business details to your profile. Engage in Discussions: Contribute to threads with helpful advice. Link to your content only when it adds value to the conversation. Focus on Value: Share well-thought-out answers and resources that benefit readers. Stay Professional Always adhere to forum rules. Sharing irrelevant or excessive links can harm your credibility and might even result in a ban. Join forums with a good reputation and active users. High-quality forums not only provide high-quality free backlinks but also help establish your authority in your field. 8) Add Value to Wikipedia Wikipedia is a trusted resource where users can edit and create entries, often citing credible sources. Adding value to Wikipedia pages by contributing accurate and relevant information can be a way to earn free backlinks for your content. How to Add Links on Wikipedia: Find Relevant Pages: Search for topics related to your niche where you have expert knowledge or published resources. Look for Gaps or Broken Links: Some Wikipedia pages might have incomplete sections or “citation needed” tags, where your content can fit. Some articles with incomplete information often display the {{Incomplete list}} template. To find these: Visit Category:Incomplete lists to see articles marked as incomplete. Contribute Valuable Content: Edit the page by adding accurate information or replacing broken links with your content as a credible source. Ensure the information aligns with Wikipedia’s guidelines. Important Notes Wikipedia is strict about self-promotion. Always ensure your additions genuinely enhance the page. Links on Wikipedia are nofollow, meaning they won’t directly boost your SEO rankings. However, they can drive referral traffic and enhance credibility. Focus on creating high-quality content first. This increases the chances of your links being accepted as legitimate references by Wikipedia moderators. 9) Publish Trend-Focused Content When your content covers something new or popular in your industry, other websites are more likely to link to it. They want to share the latest and most useful information with their readers, and your content can become their go-to source. Start by keeping an eye on what’s trending in your field using tools like Google Trends or BuzzSumo. For example, if there’s a big change in your industry or a topic everyone is talking about, write a blog, create an infographic, or make a video explaining it. Being one of the first to publish something useful about a trend helps you attract more attention and links. Stay Shareable Add visuals, stats, or actionable tips to make your content easy to share. This increases its chances of earning free backlinks from other websites. 10) Submit Your Site to High-Quality Directories Directories act as online catalogs where businesses can showcase their services, making it easier for potential customers to find you. But it’s important to choose directories that are relevant to your business and have real value. Steps to Follow: Start with Well-Known Directories: Add your site to popular platforms like Google My Business, Yelp, or Bing Places. These directories are essential for local businesses and improving search visibility. Find Industry-Specific Directories: Look for directories that focus on your niche. For example: Tech companies: Crunchbase or Capterra Creative professionals: Behance or Dribbble Local services: Angie’s List or Chamber of Commerce Provide Complete Information: Include your name, address, phone number, website, and business details. Adding photos and a short, clear description of your business makes your listing more appealing. Keep Track of Submissions: Use a Google Sheet or a simple notepad to note where you’ve submitted your site. This will help you keep everything organized and update listings when needed. Focus on directories with real traffic and good authority. Avoid spammy sites that could harm your SEO. 11) Collaborate on Round-Up Posts Round-up posts are curated collections of top-quality content on a specific topic, shared by bloggers or niche enthusiasts. These can include articles, blogs, or podcasts and are usually published daily, weekly, or monthly. For website owners, round-up posts are an excellent way to gain free backlinks and build relationships within your industry. To find relevant round-up posts, start by using Google search operators like “your topic” + “monthly roundup.” Replace “your topic” with keywords relevant to your niche, such as “SEO tips” or “fitness trends.” Filtering results to show recent posts (within the last 1–3 months) will help you find active blogs and opportunities. Once you identify a suitable round-up, pitch your content to the creator. Highlight how your article adds value to their collection, ensuring it aligns with their audience’s interests. Always verify that the round-up includes trusted and ethical links to maintain your site’s credibility. 12) Host Free Webinars or Events Hosting free webinars or events is a practical way to earn free backlinks while offering something valuable to your audience. To get started, choose a topic that your audience finds useful. For example, if you run an SEO agency, you could host a webinar on “Simple SEO Tips to Boost Your Rankings.” Pick something that’s relevant and easy to understand. Create a dedicated page for your event with all the details, like the date, time, and how to register. Share this page through emails, social media, or forums to attract participants. The page itself can generate backlinks if people find it valuable enough to share. During the event, provide free resources like checklists or templates that attendees can use. After the webinar, upload the recording to your website or YouTube. This not only keeps the event content alive but also gives others a reason to link back to your website. Encourage attendees to share the event page or webinar recording on their blogs or social media, creating even more opportunities for backlinks. 13) Repurpose Existing Content You don’t need to create new content just to get backlinks. Sometimes, reusing old content saves time and yet contributes. For example, you take a long, detailed blog post and transform it into an infographic, video, or even a podcast. A nice infographic could bring you good quality free backlinks from blogs and social media as well. A long, detailed blog post can become a video tutorial you’ll upload to YouTube and may bring new chances for obtaining backlinks. Identify content that has performed well in the past. This could be a popular blog post, a case study, or a presentation. Update it with fresh insights or a new format, and share it on different platforms. Link It Back for Maximum Impact! Always include a link back to your original content when repurposing it for other platforms. This not only boosts your backlinks but also drives traffic to your site. 14) Contribute Testimonials When you have written a review of the product or service that you have used, many companies will show it on their website with a link to yours. That makes your relationship with the brand much stronger and gives you a free link. Reach out to companies whose products or services you genuinely use. Offer a short, specific testimonial that highlights the benefits you’ve experienced. For example, “Using this tool saved us 10 hours a week and simplified our workflow.” Target brands within your niche or industry to ensure the backlink adds SEO relevance and value to your website. 15) Reach Out for Resource Page Links Resource pages are curated lists of valuable tools, guides, or articles on a specific topic. Many websites use them to help their audience find trusted resources. If your content fits their topic, you can ask to be included in their list. Start by creating content that adds real value, such as a detailed guide, an actionable checklist, or a list of helpful tools. For example, a post like “Top 50 Free SEO Tools to Improve Rankings” can attract interest from resource page owners. Search for relevant resource pages using Google search operators like: “keyword + resources” “inurl:resources + your niche” Once you find a suitable page, contact the owner with a polite email explaining how your content can complement their list. Make sure your pitch is personalized and highlights the value of your content. Focus on resource pages within your industry to ensure the link is relevant and boosts your site’s authority. 16) Promote Content on Reddit Reddit has niche communities where their users actually discuss niche topics. It’s really the best place to share content while gaining free backlinks with the right strategy. To begin, find which subreddits are the most relevant to your topic. For example, as a digital marketer, consider communities like r/SEO or r/DigitalMarketing. Before posting, participate in the community for at least a little while just to get a feel for rules and preferences. When you share your content, make sure it provides value. For example, instead of just dropping a link, explain why the content is helpful. Add a brief summary, highlight key points, or share how it solves a problem. Reddit users appreciate genuine contributions and are quick to spot and flag promotional spam. Avoid overly promotional behavior. Focus on helping the community first, and only share links when they genuinely fit the discussion. This builds trust and credibility. 17) Participate in Online Competitions or Giveaways You can participate in online contests or giveaways, which can feature you on event sites or blogs; this is a quality backlink. Find events that are appropriate for your niche and participate appropriately, such as offering a product, service, or valuable resource. For example, if you run a fitness business, participating in a health-related competition or sponsoring a giveaway can result in your business being highlighted on the event page. This not only earns backlinks but also introduces your brand to a wider audience. Focus on competitions hosted by reputable websites with strong authority. This ensures the backlinks you earn are credible and beneficial for your SEO efforts. 18) Co-Create Content with Partners Working with industry partners allows you to create valuable content that combines expertise and reaches wider audiences. Whether it’s a guide, webinar, or blog post, this strategy not only adds depth to the content but also opens doors to sharing backlinks and traffic between both parties. For instance, a fitness coach and a nutritionist could team up to create a comprehensive health plan, showcasing their combined knowledge. Select partners who share your audience and values. A well-aligned collaboration ensures better engagement and meaningful backlinks. 19) Submit Press Releases to Free PR Sites Sharing updates through press releases on free pr sites can help spread the word about your business while earning valuable backlinks. How to use press releases effectively: Choose Reputable Platforms: Sites like PRLog and PR.com allow you to share news and gain visibility. Add Relevant Links: Link to your website or a specific page that relates to the announcement. Focus on Newsworthy Topics: Share updates like product launches, awards, or collaborations to make the content engaging. Keep your press release concise and informative. Avoid unnecessary jargon and focus on delivering value to readers. The global PR market is now valued at over $97 billion. 20) Leverage Social Media Platforms Social media is a simple way to share your content and reach more people. Platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, and Facebook Groups let you post your work in different ways that fit each audience. For example, use LinkedIn to share professional tips or Twitter for quick updates and links. Even though most social media links are no-follow, they can still add variety to your link profile and bring valuable traffic to your website. The key is to share content that helps your audience. Post naturally and avoid being overly promotional. Instead, focus on starting conversations or sharing useful information that others will want to share, too. Always engage with your audience by replying to comments and sharing insights. It not only builds trust but also improves the chances of earning free backlinks for SEO as your content gains traction. 21) Host an AMA (Ask Me Anything) Hosting an AMA (Ask Me Anything) lets you connect with your audience directly by answering their questions in real time. Platforms like Reddit, LinkedIn, or Twitter are ideal for these sessions. It’s an excellent opportunity to share your expertise while building backlinks naturally. When your AMA provides valuable insights, people are more likely to reference and link to it in their content. How to host an effective AMA:: Choose the Right Platform: Use Reddit for broader topics or LinkedIn for industry-specific discussions. Promote in Advance: Announce your AMA a few days before and encourage your audience to participate. Provide Thoughtful Answers: Focus on delivering detailed and helpful responses to build credibility and attract more links. 22) Promote Content on SlideShare or Scribd SlideShare and Scribd are great platforms to share your content in formats like presentations, PDFs, or documents. These platforms are widely used by professionals and learners, making them a powerful way to expand your reach and gain free SEO backlinks. How to get started: Transform Your Content: Take your blogs, guides, or reports and convert them into simple, visually appealing presentations or documents. Add Backlinks Smartly: Include links to your website in the description or within the content itself. This way, readers can easily visit your site. Focus on Keywords: Use relevant keywords in your titles and descriptions to increase visibility on these platforms. 23) Find Relevant Edu Backlinks Backlinks from .edu websites carry strong authority and can help improve your search rankings. Educational sites are highly trusted, so links from them give your website extra credibility. How to get Edu backlinks: Create Helpful Resources: Develop guides, tutorials, or tools that would benefit students, teachers, or researchers. Share these with relevant departments or educators. Scholarship Pages: Offer a scholarship, even a small one, and request to be listed on the university’s financial aid page. Collaborate with Faculty: Share insights or data with professors or researchers to support their projects, which might get you featured in their online publications or resources. Career Centers and Alumni Pages: If your business aligns with career development or offers resources for students and alumni, ask to be added to their directory or resource pages. Use tools like Ahrefs or Google Search to find universities with pages listing external resources. Tailor your outreach to show how your content adds value to their audience. 24) Provide Free Plugins or Widgets Creating free plugins or widgets for your audience can help you generate backlinks while offering value to users. These tools solve specific problems or add functionality to websites, making them highly shareable and link-worthy. For example, a plugin that helps optimize images for SEO or a widget showing weather updates can attract downloads and links from related websites. Ensure your tool includes a link back to your site, usually in the footer or settings. This way, every installation becomes a backlink opportunity. Promote your plugin or widget on relevant directories and forums to maximize reach. Keep the tool simple and user-friendly. A practical and easy-to-use plugin is more likely to gain traction and backlinks. Outreach Monks: Your Link-Building Partner!

Conclusion FAQs on Free Backlinks 1) Publish Original Research or Case Studies Original research and case studies can easily attract backlinks. People often link to content that offers unique data or solves specific problems. Begin with your own data, a survey, or a case study from the real world. For example, you may have helped some client double his traffic; you can write a case study explaining how you did it step by step. Why it Works: People trust content backed by data or real results. Unique insights make your site a go-to resource in your niche. Backlinko creates original research that’s highly useful, attracting free backlinks from top websites that cite their studies. 2) Create Engaging Infographics Infographics are one of the effective ways to get backlinks. The data will look attractive in a graphical sense that makes the information possible to understand and shareable. Start with a relevant topic to speak to your audience, perhaps from industry trends, insights gathered from data, or simple how-to guides. Then utilize free design tools such as Canva or Piktochart for clean and professional graphics. Keep it really simple and use some combination of charts and icons that will add a level of visual depth to the message; avoid filling up viewers with too much text. Once your infographic is ready, share it widely. Post it on your website and social media platforms, and even submit it to infographic directories like Visual.ly. When others find your infographic useful, they’re more likely to share it on their platforms and link back to your site. Quick Tip Include an embed code below your infographic to make it easy for others to share while giving credit to your website. 3) Offer Guest Posts Guest posting sometimes costs, mainly when the site you wish to target charges a fee for publishing. Still, free guest post opportunities exist, if approached the right way. How to Land Free Guest Posts Offer High-Quality Content: Blogs value unique, well-researched articles that provide real value to their readers. Show examples of your best work to prove you can deliver. Get Creative with Outreach: Personalize your outreach emails and stand out. Avoid using generic pitches, be engaging, do your homework, and add some personality. A little bit of humor or a creative subject line does wonders. Focus on the Right Blogs: Target blogs which are close to your niche and whose readers are quite active. Never fail to check whether the website is authentic or worthy of your effort. Sometimes, even without explicitly aiming for free opportunities, a well-crafted pitch and excellent content can earn you a free guest post. Use our list of free guest posting sites to get started! 4) Pitch for Broken Link Building Broken link building involves finding non-working links on other websites and suggesting your content as a replacement. It’s a straightforward way to earn backlinks while helping website owners improve their sites. To get started, use tools like Ahrefs or Broken Link Checker to identify broken links on relevant websites in your niche. Once you’ve found one, contact the site owner and politely point out the broken link. Offer your content as a replacement, explaining how it fits their page and adds value. This method works because website owners want to fix broken links to maintain their SEO and user experience. By providing a solution, you build goodwill and gain a high-quality backlink in return. Expert Tip! Personalize your outreach email. Mention the specific broken link and clearly explain how your content fills the gap—it increases your chances of success. 5) Claim Unlinked Mentions If people are discussing your business or website already but don’t link it, that’s free backlinks being missed. A simple and easy tactic to have unlinked mentions turned into backlinks is claiming them. First, you can use tools like BuzzSumo or Google Alerts to search for mentions of your brand or website. If you do not want to spend money, you can search for mentions yourself by Googling your business name and using search operators to filter out results from your website or social media pages. For example: Search for your brand name followed by -site:yourdomain.com to exclude your own site. Refine results by excluding major platforms like Facebook or Twitter if they’re not relevant. When you find an article mentioning your brand without a link, reach out to the site owner. Politely thank them for mentioning your business and ask if they’d consider adding a link to make it more helpful for their readers. Why It Works People are already aware of your brand, so it’s not a cold pitch. It’s a win-win situation, as adding the link improves their content and boosts your SEO. Set up Google Alerts to track mentions of your business in real-time. This saves time and ensures you don’t miss any new opportunities. 6) Answer Relevant Questions on Quora Quora is a great platform to build free backlinks by answering questions related to your expertise. It lets you share knowledge while subtly promoting your content. Start by identifying questions related to your niche or industry. Use Quora’s search bar to find topics where your knowledge can add value. Look for questions with high engagement, such as those with many followers or views, to maximize your reach. When answering, provide detailed and helpful responses. Include a link to your website, blog, or resource if it genuinely adds value to your answer. For example, if someone asks for tips on improving website traffic, you can briefly answer the question and link to a blog post offering more insights. Stay Authentic and Avoid Over-Promotion Quora’s moderators keep a close watch for spam. To avoid issues, only add links when they naturally fit into your answer and truly benefit the reader. This approach keeps your responses valuable and trustworthy, increasing the chances of readers engaging with your content. 7) Contribute to High-Quality Forums Forums are online communities where people discuss specific topics, and they can be a great place to share your expertise and earn free backlinks. These forums allow you to share insights, answer questions, and link to your content where it genuinely adds value. How to Get Started: Find Relevant Forums: Use tools like FindAForum or search for active communities in your industry. Create a Profile: Add your website or business details to your profile. Engage in Discussions: Contribute to threads with helpful advice. Link to your content only when it adds value to the conversation. Focus on Value: Share well-thought-out answers and resources that benefit readers. Stay Professional Always adhere to forum rules. Sharing irrelevant or excessive links can harm your credibility and might even result in a ban. Join forums with a good reputation and active users. High-quality forums not only provide high-quality free backlinks but also help establish your authority in your field. 8) Add Value to Wikipedia Wikipedia is a trusted resource where users can edit and create entries, often citing credible sources. Adding value to Wikipedia pages by contributing accurate and relevant information can be a way to earn free backlinks for your content. How to Add Links on Wikipedia: Find Relevant Pages: Search for topics related to your niche where you have expert knowledge or published resources. Look for Gaps or Broken Links: Some Wikipedia pages might have incomplete sections or “citation needed” tags, where your content can fit. Some articles with incomplete information often display the {{Incomplete list}} template. To find these: Visit Category:Incomplete lists to see articles marked as incomplete. Contribute Valuable Content: Edit the page by adding accurate information or replacing broken links with your content as a credible source. Ensure the information aligns with Wikipedia’s guidelines. Important Notes Wikipedia is strict about self-promotion. Always ensure your additions genuinely enhance the page. Links on Wikipedia are nofollow, meaning they won’t directly boost your SEO rankings. However, they can drive referral traffic and enhance credibility. Focus on creating high-quality content first. This increases the chances of your links being accepted as legitimate references by Wikipedia moderators. 9) Publish Trend-Focused Content When your content covers something new or popular in your industry, other websites are more likely to link to it. They want to share the latest and most useful information with their readers, and your content can become their go-to source. Start by keeping an eye on what’s trending in your field using tools like Google Trends or BuzzSumo. For example, if there’s a big change in your industry or a topic everyone is talking about, write a blog, create an infographic, or make a video explaining it. Being one of the first to publish something useful about a trend helps you attract more attention and links. Stay Shareable Add visuals, stats, or actionable tips to make your content easy to share. This increases its chances of earning free backlinks from other websites. 10) Submit Your Site to High-Quality Directories Directories act as online catalogs where businesses can showcase their services, making it easier for potential customers to find you. But it’s important to choose directories that are relevant to your business and have real value. Steps to Follow: Start with Well-Known Directories: Add your site to popular platforms like Google My Business, Yelp, or Bing Places. These directories are essential for local businesses and improving search visibility. Find Industry-Specific Directories: Look for directories that focus on your niche. For example: Tech companies: Crunchbase or Capterra Creative professionals: Behance or Dribbble Local services: Angie’s List or Chamber of Commerce Provide Complete Information: Include your name, address, phone number, website, and business details. Adding photos and a short, clear description of your business makes your listing more appealing. Keep Track of Submissions: Use a Google Sheet or a simple notepad to note where you’ve submitted your site. This will help you keep everything organized and update listings when needed. Focus on directories with real traffic and good authority. Avoid spammy sites that could harm your SEO. 11) Collaborate on Round-Up Posts Round-up posts are curated collections of top-quality content on a specific topic, shared by bloggers or niche enthusiasts. These can include articles, blogs, or podcasts and are usually published daily, weekly, or monthly. For website owners, round-up posts are an excellent way to gain free backlinks and build relationships within your industry. To find relevant round-up posts, start by using Google search operators like “your topic” + “monthly roundup.” Replace “your topic” with keywords relevant to your niche, such as “SEO tips” or “fitness trends.” Filtering results to show recent posts (within the last 1–3 months) will help you find active blogs and opportunities. Once you identify a suitable round-up, pitch your content to the creator. Highlight how your article adds value to their collection, ensuring it aligns with their audience’s interests. Always verify that the round-up includes trusted and ethical links to maintain your site’s credibility. 12) Host Free Webinars or Events Hosting free webinars or events is a practical way to earn free backlinks while offering something valuable to your audience. To get started, choose a topic that your audience finds useful. For example, if you run an SEO agency, you could host a webinar on “Simple SEO Tips to Boost Your Rankings.” Pick something that’s relevant and easy to understand. Create a dedicated page for your event with all the details, like the date, time, and how to register. Share this page through emails, social media, or forums to attract participants. The page itself can generate backlinks if people find it valuable enough to share. During the event, provide free resources like checklists or templates that attendees can use. After the webinar, upload the recording to your website or YouTube. This not only keeps the event content alive but also gives others a reason to link back to your website. Encourage attendees to share the event page or webinar recording on their blogs or social media, creating even more opportunities for backlinks. 13) Repurpose Existing Content You don’t need to create new content just to get backlinks. Sometimes, reusing old content saves time and yet contributes. For example, you take a long, detailed blog post and transform it into an infographic, video, or even a podcast. A nice infographic could bring you good quality free backlinks from blogs and social media as well. A long, detailed blog post can become a video tutorial you’ll upload to YouTube and may bring new chances for obtaining backlinks. Identify content that has performed well in the past. This could be a popular blog post, a case study, or a presentation. Update it with fresh insights or a new format, and share it on different platforms. Link It Back for Maximum Impact! Always include a link back to your original content when repurposing it for other platforms. This not only boosts your backlinks but also drives traffic to your site. 14) Contribute Testimonials When you have written a review of the product or service that you have used, many companies will show it on their website with a link to yours. That makes your relationship with the brand much stronger and gives you a free link. Reach out to companies whose products or services you genuinely use. Offer a short, specific testimonial that highlights the benefits you’ve experienced. For example, “Using this tool saved us 10 hours a week and simplified our workflow.” Target brands within your niche or industry to ensure the backlink adds SEO relevance and value to your website. 15) Reach Out for Resource Page Links Resource pages are curated lists of valuable tools, guides, or articles on a specific topic. Many websites use them to help their audience find trusted resources. If your content fits their topic, you can ask to be included in their list. Start by creating content that adds real value, such as a detailed guide, an actionable checklist, or a list of helpful tools. For example, a post like “Top 50 Free SEO Tools to Improve Rankings” can attract interest from resource page owners. Search for relevant resource pages using Google search operators like: “keyword + resources” “inurl:resources + your niche” Once you find a suitable page, contact the owner with a polite email explaining how your content can complement their list. Make sure your pitch is personalized and highlights the value of your content. Focus on resource pages within your industry to ensure the link is relevant and boosts your site’s authority. 16) Promote Content on Reddit Reddit has niche communities where their users actually discuss niche topics. It’s really the best place to share content while gaining free backlinks with the right strategy. To begin, find which subreddits are the most relevant to your topic. For example, as a digital marketer, consider communities like r/SEO or r/DigitalMarketing. Before posting, participate in the community for at least a little while just to get a feel for rules and preferences. When you share your content, make sure it provides value. For example, instead of just dropping a link, explain why the content is helpful. Add a brief summary, highlight key points, or share how it solves a problem. Reddit users appreciate genuine contributions and are quick to spot and flag promotional spam. Avoid overly promotional behavior. Focus on helping the community first, and only share links when they genuinely fit the discussion. This builds trust and credibility. 17) Participate in Online Competitions or Giveaways You can participate in online contests or giveaways, which can feature you on event sites or blogs; this is a quality backlink. Find events that are appropriate for your niche and participate appropriately, such as offering a product, service, or valuable resource. For example, if you run a fitness business, participating in a health-related competition or sponsoring a giveaway can result in your business being highlighted on the event page. This not only earns backlinks but also introduces your brand to a wider audience. Focus on competitions hosted by reputable websites with strong authority. This ensures the backlinks you earn are credible and beneficial for your SEO efforts. 18) Co-Create Content with Partners Working with industry partners allows you to create valuable content that combines expertise and reaches wider audiences. Whether it’s a guide, webinar, or blog post, this strategy not only adds depth to the content but also opens doors to sharing backlinks and traffic between both parties. For instance, a fitness coach and a nutritionist could team up to create a comprehensive health plan, showcasing their combined knowledge. Select partners who share your audience and values. A well-aligned collaboration ensures better engagement and meaningful backlinks. 19) Submit Press Releases to Free PR Sites Sharing updates through press releases on free pr sites can help spread the word about your business while earning valuable backlinks. How to use press releases effectively: Choose Reputable Platforms: Sites like PRLog and PR.com allow you to share news and gain visibility. Add Relevant Links: Link to your website or a specific page that relates to the announcement. Focus on Newsworthy Topics: Share updates like product launches, awards, or collaborations to make the content engaging. Keep your press release concise and informative. Avoid unnecessary jargon and focus on delivering value to readers. The global PR market is now valued at over $97 billion. 20) Leverage Social Media Platforms Social media is a simple way to share your content and reach more people. Platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, and Facebook Groups let you post your work in different ways that fit each audience. For example, use LinkedIn to share professional tips or Twitter for quick updates and links. Even though most social media links are no-follow, they can still add variety to your link profile and bring valuable traffic to your website. The key is to share content that helps your audience. Post naturally and avoid being overly promotional. Instead, focus on starting conversations or sharing useful information that others will want to share, too. Always engage with your audience by replying to comments and sharing insights. It not only builds trust but also improves the chances of earning free backlinks for SEO as your content gains traction. 21) Host an AMA (Ask Me Anything) Hosting an AMA (Ask Me Anything) lets you connect with your audience directly by answering their questions in real time. Platforms like Reddit, LinkedIn, or Twitter are ideal for these sessions. It’s an excellent opportunity to share your expertise while building backlinks naturally. When your AMA provides valuable insights, people are more likely to reference and link to it in their content. How to host an effective AMA:: Choose the Right Platform: Use Reddit for broader topics or LinkedIn for industry-specific discussions. Promote in Advance: Announce your AMA a few days before and encourage your audience to participate. Provide Thoughtful Answers: Focus on delivering detailed and helpful responses to build credibility and attract more links. 22) Promote Content on SlideShare or Scribd SlideShare and Scribd are great platforms to share your content in formats like presentations, PDFs, or documents. These platforms are widely used by professionals and learners, making them a powerful way to expand your reach and gain free SEO backlinks. How to get started: Transform Your Content: Take your blogs, guides, or reports and convert them into simple, visually appealing presentations or documents. Add Backlinks Smartly: Include links to your website in the description or within the content itself. This way, readers can easily visit your site. Focus on Keywords: Use relevant keywords in your titles and descriptions to increase visibility on these platforms. 23) Find Relevant Edu Backlinks Backlinks from .edu websites carry strong authority and can help improve your search rankings. Educational sites are highly trusted, so links from them give your website extra credibility. How to get Edu backlinks: Create Helpful Resources: Develop guides, tutorials, or tools that would benefit students, teachers, or researchers. Share these with relevant departments or educators. Scholarship Pages: Offer a scholarship, even a small one, and request to be listed on the university’s financial aid page. Collaborate with Faculty: Share insights or data with professors or researchers to support their projects, which might get you featured in their online publications or resources. Career Centers and Alumni Pages: If your business aligns with career development or offers resources for students and alumni, ask to be added to their directory or resource pages. Use tools like Ahrefs or Google Search to find universities with pages listing external resources. Tailor your outreach to show how your content adds value to their audience. 24) Provide Free Plugins or Widgets Creating free plugins or widgets for your audience can help you generate backlinks while offering value to users. These tools solve specific problems or add functionality to websites, making them highly shareable and link-worthy. For example, a plugin that helps optimize images for SEO or a widget showing weather updates can attract downloads and links from related websites. Ensure your tool includes a link back to your site, usually in the footer or settings. This way, every installation becomes a backlink opportunity. Promote your plugin or widget on relevant directories and forums to maximize reach. Keep the tool simple and user-friendly. A practical and easy-to-use plugin is more likely to gain traction and backlinks. Outreach Monks: Your Link-Building Partner!

Members Online • DrJigsaw How to build backlinks without the BS - lessons learned from 1,000+ backlinks built Case Study I see a ton of posts here (and other subs) about how link-building is a total pain (which it totally is btw). So, thought I'd write a very timely, 2023 edition on how to do outreach that gets you links these days. The problem: a LOT of the link-building guides are outdated or just impractical. The skyscraper technique (hey, you linked to resource A, I have resource B, pls link to me) doesn't work anymore. Everyone and their pet dog do this kinda outreach, and bloggers/site owners just kinda don't care anymore. I've built over 1,000 links in the past year for several client websites and learned a TON in the process. In this post, I'll do a very comprehensive review of link-building in 2023 and explain what really works. Table of contents (yes, this'll be a long way. Grab a coffee. Or a beer, I don't judge): Should I do link-building in the first place? All the link-building BS What kind of links WORK? How link-building is (heavily) niche-dependant The top-down link-building process 5-step guide to running a successful link-building campaign How to build backlinks with low resources Best tools for building backlinks FAQ Let's go! (If you loved this post, I run a no-bs SEO subreddit, r/seogrowth, check it out!) Should I do link-building in the first place? Starting with the most important question here: do you need link-building at your current stage? You should ONLY do link-building once you have: A solid SEO strategy in place A decent number of blog posts / resources Otherwise, you'll be building links on hard more, and you won't be generating results that are good enough for it to the worth your while. You should also avoid SEO as a marketing channel overall unless you're ready to commit to long-term work. While it IS possible to sometimes get results within 1-3 months of SEO work, those cases are pretty rare. If you need revenue TOMORROW or you go bankrupt, try content marketing, PPC, direct sales, email marketing, or any other channel. Now that we've got that out of the way... The BS There is a TON of outdated info about link-building on the net. Here's what DOESN'T work these days: Forum link-building. Most forums no-follow all outgoing backlinks. Web 2.0 links. People spamming their links on Reddit are 100% wasting their time. Google can tell a user-generated content site apart from all other sites. Hence, links from Reddit, Medium, etc. are devalued big-time. Blog comment links. Most blogs no-follow blog comment links, so that's a waste of time too. PBNs (ish). Well-built PBNs work just fine. The PBNs you bought from some sketchy forum, though, will crash your site big time. And before some of you go: \"But Jigsaw, I build web 2 links and rank just fine!\" Sure you do! But you're most likely not ranking because you've been building web 2/blog comment/whatever links. If you were building REAL backlinks, you'd rank faster. Another common misconception is that paying for links is going to get you penalized or it just doesn't work. The reality: Unless you're buying sketchy links, or you're building links in a sketchy way (e.g. building 20 links to ONE page exclusively in a short timeframe), there's no way for Google to tell a backlink was paid for. A lot of industries are just pay-to-play and nothing else. If you're in CBD, forex, gambling, etc. you'll 100% have to pay for backlinks or your competitors are going to outrank you big-time. So what DOES work? Real links from real, topically related websites. E.g. if you run a fitness site, you'd benefit from getting links from the following sites: Authoritative fitness blog/media Small-time yoga blog Weight loss blog/media/site You get the drift. As long as the site publishes topically related content to yours, then that's a good link prospect. Media backlinks also work even if they're not topically related. E.g. Mashable, Forbes, etc. Some green flags that a backlink is high quality are: Their site is driving 1,000+ traffic from Google Site publishes genuine, high-quality content Site does NOT publish dozens of guest posts per month or sells backlinks en masse Site has NOT been penalized lately (i.e. they didn't lose a big chunk of their traffic) Site does NOT publish backlinks/guest posts from gambling sites They have an \"about us\" page & there's a real person behind the blog/site Link-building is niche-dependant Before we dive into the actual process, thought this was important to cover. How you do link-building SERIOUSLY depends on your niche. #1. If you're blogging about, say, yoga then it'll be much easier than. There are a TON of blogs that are topically related to yours and can link back to your site: - Fitness blogs - Yoga blogs - Weight loss blogs These sites are also a lot more approachable. They're usually run by amateurs and w/ a good personalized email, they'll be happy to link to you. #2. If you're blogging in B2B, on the other hand, things are a bit more give-and-take. Websites will want something from you for a backlink. Usually, that's: - A high-quality guest post - Partnership in some way - Direct or indirect backlink exchange So tl;dr, link-building in B2B is mostly relationship-building. #3. If you're in a competitive niche (CBD, VPN, etc.) then it's pay-to-play. A good outreach game will definitely help, but you'll have to pay a good $ for them to place your backlinks. The link-building process Now let's talk practice! The typical link-building process, from a top-down perspective, looks like this: You come up with a link-building campaign type. At this stage, you decide on what you're pitching / promoting. For your campaign to be more successful, you want to promote a useful resource or blog post. People are hella more likely to link to your resources than your product pages. Also, I wouldn't recommend building links unless you already have some content / SEO strategy in place. VA collects link-building prospects based on certain criteria. E.g. blogs about, say, scrapbooking, tech reviews, whatever. Lots of ways to do this, but I'll cover it in detail below. VA finds the right point of contact for each prospect. They extract their email / contact info using some tool. Copywriter creates a personalized outreach template for the campaign. You DO NOT want to copy-paste something from the internet. Link-building specialist starts the outreach campaign. They keep track of responses and do what they need to do to secure link placements. Let's go through each step of this process one by one: 1. Campaign type ================= The most common types of link-building campaigns are: Link insertions Guest posts Broken link-building Unlinked mention 3 and #4 are very situational and require their own approach, so we'll skip that entirely. Same with guest posts. Those require a bit more manual emailing and pitching, so let's push that off for another time. But tl;dr here is this: you review the website's guest posting policy and get a content writer to create a tailored pitch. In this post, let's stick to link insertions since that's the most scalable tactic. You don't need a fresh guest post written for every backlink you want to build. Now, from there, you want to create a cool resource that people will want to link to. Some good examples: Infographic they can insert into an existing blog. e.g. Top 21 Benefits of Weight-Lifting As Proven by Science Long-form content. E.g. Top 101 Productivity Tips from Top Professionals Fresh research. E.g. We surveyed 1,000 of our users about their dating preferences. Here are our findings. Unique tool. E.g. Free tool to analyze your competitor's backlink profile in a click. Not sure what's a good link magnet for your niche? Run your competitors through Ahrefs and check their Top Pages by Links. You'll see which of their pages are driving the most backlinks. Once you've got your link magnet down, time for step 2: 2. Link prospecting ==================== Your VA collects hundreds of prospects that fit your criteria. So step 1 - you HAVE TO have a VA do this. The process is extremely time-consuming and if you, as a founder, are spending time on this, you won't have much time for anything else. Now as for prospecting, there are a TON of ways to go about this. The tactics: Pick several blog categories that you'd benefit from getting backlinks from. E.g. fitness => yoga, weight loss, dieting niches, and so on. Prospect for such blogs w/ basic Google queries. E.g. \"yoga blog,\" \"diet blog,\" etc. Pick out articles that would benefit from a long to your resource. E.g. if you're promoting, say, a bachelor party checklist infographic, you can look up keywords about organizing bachelor parties and extract those prospects. \"Organize bachelor party,\" \"bachelor party ideas,\" \"bachelor party examples,\" etc. Pro tip - you're more likely to get backlinks from articles ranking on page 2+ VS ones ranking on page 1. Pick out articles that can organically mention your product(s). E.g. find articles about \"top X gifts for year Y anniversary\" Run your competitors through Ahrefs and extract their backlink profile. If someone linked to your competitor, chances are, they might link to you, too (as long as your email copy is good). Run sites that already link to you through Ahrefs/Semrush and extract their backlink profile(s). Small-time bloggers usually link to each other so chances are, these sites will be willing to link to you, too. Most of these can either be done manually by a VA, automated via ScrapeBox or Link Assistant, or by using Pitchbox. 3. Finding the point of contact ================================ This one's pretty simple. Your point of contact depends on the size of the site: Big media => you want to contact the author of the post specifically Company of any size => you want to contact the head of content, editor-in-chief, or head of digital marketing Personal or small-time blog => owner of the blog Teach your VA how to find the right point of contact. From there, they can use Hunter to find the email of the contact. If Hunter does NOT find the email, you can simply find the email format (e.g. [firstname]@[company] dot com) and logically guess the email of a given prospect. Note: if you're reaching out to small blogs, general emails like info @ company dot com can still work. If you're reaching out to a company, though, or a media, general email basically means that no one's going to read your outreach. 4. Creating personalized email copy ==================================== One of the most common mistakes people make with link-building is copy-pasting a template from the internet. They read an article on link-building on some top blog like Ahrefs or Backlinko, find a template, copy-paste, send it to 200 people, and wonder why it didn't work. Here's why: Literally, everyone does the same exact thing. It goes a little something like this: \"Hey [Name], I just stumbled on your blog while looking for articles about [topic]. I (totally for real for real) read your article and it's like, really really cool! But you know what it's lacking? A link to my site, eyyy. Pls link?\" Bloggers/site owners get a TON of these emails. It's SO DAMN GENERIC that even if you're pitching the best resource ever created, you'll get ignored. So what you gotta do is create your own template for any given campaign you're pushing. Here are some tips on how to create great outreach copy: For your subject line: Mention the prospect's name/site name. E.g. [Name], recipes in [site] are mouthwatering! Tailor it to the niche. E.g. [name], I'm stuck in bronze, send help Make it look like a personal email. E.g. Question, [name]? Intro - [name] <> [name], etc. And the rest for your body copy: Give a compliment about their site/content that FEELS like a genuine compliment, but applies to most of your prospect list (sorry not sorry). E.g. \"Your recipes are mouthwatering! I'm planning on giving [latest recipe] a try for dinner with my [wife/husband]\" Mention jokes/references that someone in that niche might find funny or punny. E.g. As a budding green thumb enthusiast, I wanted to take a moment to leaf you a message and hopefully plant a few seeds of inspiration. Make it about something they mentioned in their post. Get a VA to make a custom column and add details from the post. E.g. \"Your post about 10-anniversary gifts really saved me in a clutch! I'm planning on getting my missus a [gift from a listicle]\" Keep it human. No corpo lingo. Your outreach emails should look like something you're sending to your BFF. Finally, (preferably), don't include images or links in your outreach emails. They hurt deliverability. If you have to include a pitch to a resource, you can make an exception (or add a CTA for \"drop me a thumbs up and I'll send you the post\"). Optionally, at the end of the outreach email, you can add an offer of what you can give in exchange for that backlink. Some examples I've seen that work: We'll link back to your site from a future guest post on a third-party site. We'll share your content with our Twitter audience of X people. We're going to literally pay you money for the link. Let's do a backlink exchange. We'll give you free access to our software for X months. We'll give you X free credits to our SaaS tool. 5. And launch! =============== Once you've got your prospects and email copy ready to go, launch your campaign. Some info on the technical stuff re: the outreach process: Use a dedicated outreach domain. DO NOT use your main domain. Some peeps on the internet WILL report you for spam just because they had a bad day. If this happens, your email deliverability for your main domain will suffer. Instead, use a dedicated outreach domain. E.g. if your brand is \"brand dot com\", you can do \"brand PR dot com\" Use either Google Workspace, private email, Office 365, or Zoho to create those private emails. Use a tool to warm up the email. Such tools automatically send/open/reply to emails from new domains to \"warm them up.\" This helps improve the deliverability rates of your fresh emails. Warm up for around 2 weeks per inbox. Don't send more than 60 emails per day per email. Yes, this includes follow-ups. The more you go over this limit, the more likely it is for the inbox to get \"burned\" and your deliverability to tank. Speaking of follow-ups, do NOT do more than 2 follow-ups per email. If the prospect doesn't reply after 2 emails, they're probably not interested at this time. Finally, don't include links in your outreach emails. This helps improve deliverability. If you're pitching a resource, you can make an exception there (or you can add a CTA like, \"just drop me a thumbs-up and I'll send you a link\"). How to build backlinks when you're broke I've had a ton of people ask me about this before so thought I'd cover it in a dedicated section. In a niche where links cost cash AND you're broke? Fortunately, there are options to bypass that backlink sponsorship fee. Some solid tactics: Do value-based guest posting. Most guest posts people pitch are, practically speaking, trash. 500 words, 0 value, and usually AI-generated. Pitch your prospects your experience and expertise and offer a post that they can actually benefit from. Good example is picking out a keyword they want to target and writing a guest post targeting that. That's value! Use HARO, Terkel, or similar platforms. Basically, these are platforms that match journalists with sources. They're a great way to sometimes land very high authority backlinks, or build up some homepage backlinks without too much hassle/outreach. Make friends with other bloggers. For real. Follow them on Twitter or LinkedIn. Engage with their content. Then shoot them a DM and offer a backlink collaboration. E.g. link exchange, ABC link exchange, etc. Friendship is magic. While this approach is time-consuming, it's ideal if you're building a niche site and don't have a lot of existing backlinks. Best tools for building backlinks Now, let's talk tools. You ain't doing all this manually: Semrush/Ahrefs as a general SEO tool. You can use both to extract competitor backlink profiles. You can also use either to evaluate whether a certain site is a good backlink prospect. Outreach tool. If you're just getting started with link-building, Snov is the most value deal there is (comes with email warmup, email finder credits, outreach tool, etc.). If you're looking for the best-in-class tool, that would be Pitchbox. Must-have if you're building links at scale or run an agency. Hunter dot io is great for finding prospect emails. Link Assistant or Scrapebox for help with prospecting. Warmup Inbox for email warmup. MailGenius to check email health. Might've missed a couple, but this is the gist. You can also use ChatGPT to write your email first lines if you're feeling spicy. Think there was a dedicated tool for this too, though. FAQ Got more questions? I foresaw this with my third eye of truth and 3rd coffee of the day. Hence, the FAQ section. How many emails should I send per day? This depends on the niche. Estimate your win rate per 100 emails. Then, work backward from there. If you win 5 links from 100 emails, and you want 20 links a month, you need 400 emails sent per month. How long does it take for backlinks to kick in? Links impact your site 1-3 months after being built (usually). How can I calculate the ROI of my link-building? It's really hard to estimate the dollar value of a given link, so hard to figure out link-building ROI. That said, if links can take you from page 2 to the top 3 rankings for your target keyword, very good chance you'll get good ROI. If you're targeting the right keywords, anyway. This is literally why the catchphrase of SEO is \"well, maybe, yes, but sometimes no, it depends...\" Can I rank without backlinks? This depends on the niche. If there's not much competition, yeah, that's possible. Otherwise, link quality/quantity will determine if you rank top 3, or page 2. Links also determine how fast you'll rank. Will I get penalized for exchanging links? According to a study by Ahrefs, most top websites have reciprocal links. That's just how the internet works. Unless all you have is direct link exchanges with hundreds of sites, you should be good/safe. Google said paying for links is bad, what do? :( Paying for links is extremely common and most link-builders do it. If you're doing it smart, you won't get penalized / affected negatively in any way. How do I get backlinks from big media sites / authority sites? Either through connections or digital PR, but that's a completely different topic VS conventional link-building.

Members Online • DrJigsaw How to build backlinks without the BS - lessons learned from 1,000+ backlinks built Case Study I see a ton of posts here (and other subs) about how link-building is a total pain (which it totally is btw). So, thought I'd write a very timely, 2023 edition on how to do outreach that gets you links these days. The problem: a LOT of the link-building guides are outdated or just impractical. The skyscraper technique (hey, you linked to resource A, I have resource B, pls link to me) doesn't work anymore. Everyone and their pet dog do this kinda outreach, and bloggers/site owners just kinda don't care anymore. I've built over 1,000 links in the past year for several client websites and learned a TON in the process. In this post, I'll do a very comprehensive review of link-building in 2023 and explain what really works. Table of contents (yes, this'll be a long way. Grab a coffee. Or a beer, I don't judge): Should I do link-building in the first place? All the link-building BS What kind of links WORK? How link-building is (heavily) niche-dependant The top-down link-building process 5-step guide to running a successful link-building campaign How to build backlinks with low resources Best tools for building backlinks FAQ Let's go! (If you loved this post, I run a no-bs SEO subreddit, r/seogrowth, check it out!) Should I do link-building in the first place? Starting with the most important question here: do you need link-building at your current stage? You should ONLY do link-building once you have: A solid SEO strategy in place A decent number of blog posts / resources Otherwise, you'll be building links on hard more, and you won't be generating results that are good enough for it to the worth your while. You should also avoid SEO as a marketing channel overall unless you're ready to commit to long-term work. While it IS possible to sometimes get results within 1-3 months of SEO work, those cases are pretty rare. If you need revenue TOMORROW or you go bankrupt, try content marketing, PPC, direct sales, email marketing, or any other channel. Now that we've got that out of the way... The BS There is a TON of outdated info about link-building on the net. Here's what DOESN'T work these days: Forum link-building. Most forums no-follow all outgoing backlinks. Web 2.0 links. People spamming their links on Reddit are 100% wasting their time. Google can tell a user-generated content site apart from all other sites. Hence, links from Reddit, Medium, etc. are devalued big-time. Blog comment links. Most blogs no-follow blog comment links, so that's a waste of time too. PBNs (ish). Well-built PBNs work just fine. The PBNs you bought from some sketchy forum, though, will crash your site big time. And before some of you go: \"But Jigsaw, I build web 2 links and rank just fine!\" Sure you do! But you're most likely not ranking because you've been building web 2/blog comment/whatever links. If you were building REAL backlinks, you'd rank faster. Another common misconception is that paying for links is going to get you penalized or it just doesn't work. The reality: Unless you're buying sketchy links, or you're building links in a sketchy way (e.g. building 20 links to ONE page exclusively in a short timeframe), there's no way for Google to tell a backlink was paid for. A lot of industries are just pay-to-play and nothing else. If you're in CBD, forex, gambling, etc. you'll 100% have to pay for backlinks or your competitors are going to outrank you big-time. So what DOES work? Real links from real, topically related websites. E.g. if you run a fitness site, you'd benefit from getting links from the following sites: Authoritative fitness blog/media Small-time yoga blog Weight loss blog/media/site You get the drift. As long as the site publishes topically related content to yours, then that's a good link prospect. Media backlinks also work even if they're not topically related. E.g. Mashable, Forbes, etc. Some green flags that a backlink is high quality are: Their site is driving 1,000+ traffic from Google Site publishes genuine, high-quality content Site does NOT publish dozens of guest posts per month or sells backlinks en masse Site has NOT been penalized lately (i.e. they didn't lose a big chunk of their traffic) Site does NOT publish backlinks/guest posts from gambling sites They have an \"about us\" page & there's a real person behind the blog/site Link-building is niche-dependant Before we dive into the actual process, thought this was important to cover. How you do link-building SERIOUSLY depends on your niche. #1. If you're blogging about, say, yoga then it'll be much easier than. There are a TON of blogs that are topically related to yours and can link back to your site: - Fitness blogs - Yoga blogs - Weight loss blogs These sites are also a lot more approachable. They're usually run by amateurs and w/ a good personalized email, they'll be happy to link to you. #2. If you're blogging in B2B, on the other hand, things are a bit more give-and-take. Websites will want something from you for a backlink. Usually, that's: - A high-quality guest post - Partnership in some way - Direct or indirect backlink exchange So tl;dr, link-building in B2B is mostly relationship-building. #3. If you're in a competitive niche (CBD, VPN, etc.) then it's pay-to-play. A good outreach game will definitely help, but you'll have to pay a good $ for them to place your backlinks. The link-building process Now let's talk practice! The typical link-building process, from a top-down perspective, looks like this: You come up with a link-building campaign type. At this stage, you decide on what you're pitching / promoting. For your campaign to be more successful, you want to promote a useful resource or blog post. People are hella more likely to link to your resources than your product pages. Also, I wouldn't recommend building links unless you already have some content / SEO strategy in place. VA collects link-building prospects based on certain criteria. E.g. blogs about, say, scrapbooking, tech reviews, whatever. Lots of ways to do this, but I'll cover it in detail below. VA finds the right point of contact for each prospect. They extract their email / contact info using some tool. Copywriter creates a personalized outreach template for the campaign. You DO NOT want to copy-paste something from the internet. Link-building specialist starts the outreach campaign. They keep track of responses and do what they need to do to secure link placements. Let's go through each step of this process one by one: 1. Campaign type ================= The most common types of link-building campaigns are: Link insertions Guest posts Broken link-building Unlinked mention 3 and #4 are very situational and require their own approach, so we'll skip that entirely. Same with guest posts. Those require a bit more manual emailing and pitching, so let's push that off for another time. But tl;dr here is this: you review the website's guest posting policy and get a content writer to create a tailored pitch. In this post, let's stick to link insertions since that's the most scalable tactic. You don't need a fresh guest post written for every backlink you want to build. Now, from there, you want to create a cool resource that people will want to link to. Some good examples: Infographic they can insert into an existing blog. e.g. Top 21 Benefits of Weight-Lifting As Proven by Science Long-form content. E.g. Top 101 Productivity Tips from Top Professionals Fresh research. E.g. We surveyed 1,000 of our users about their dating preferences. Here are our findings. Unique tool. E.g.

Now, the effectiveness of these links is debatable, but Google certainly equates backlinking campaigns with link spam – as per Google’s November office hours session. Backlinking has lost steam as a ranking factor since the early days of Google search, and now hundreds of other ranking factors share the space that backlinks once occupied. With all that said, backlinks are still a ranking factor, albeit less important, so you still need them. Ideally, you should get backlinks naturally. And if you don’t, you should definitely not have to pay for them. You might be thinking, ‘how on earth can you get backlinks from other websites through outreach without paying?!’ Simply by offering an undeniable value proposition that compels a website owner or operator to log into the backend and add a link to your website. In this blog post, we cover some ways to highlight value propositions – other than money – to get those links. Here is how to build backlinks without paying for them: 1. Link building through HARO and similar websites HARO (Help A Reporter Out) is a powerful PR channel that can generate high-quality backlinks to your website. It is a platform where journalists submit queries for sources to answer. A journalist can be anyone writing an article. They are often on a tight deadline, looking for quality content that they can get for free. And that’s your chance to promote your content to them. Here’s how it works: Whom does HARO link building work for? HARO link building works for all websites. It, however, is a gold mine for businesses with low domain authority. HARO outreach can get you links from powerful domains like Forbes, NYT, and websites relevant to your niche, and it remains one of the most effective ways to get good quality backlinks.Most websites get so many guest posting requests every day that they direct them all to trash. With HARO, you know the exact content these websites are looking for, so your pitch gets seen, to the least. Challenges with HARO link building. 1. Competition HARO is a popular newsletter for everything PR. Many people submit pitches for all queries, even those from low-domain websites. So Forbes and its famous cousins get thousands of pitches per query. Even a perfect pitch may not make it to the final copy because of the intense competition. Yet, this backlinking method is better than most alternatives listed here. Alternatively, Terkel has lesser competition, but fewer quality websites submit their pitches there. 2. You can mostly build links only to your homepage Google wants to see contextual links with relevant anchor text. With HARO, journalists use your homepage as the landing page when they link. You might get a lot of links, but if they point to the homepage, they might not be topical. You must invest time in adding internal links to distribute link juice. HARO pitch email template At DigiGrow, we have seen a success rate of 8% with HARO with this template. Hi {Journalist’s name}, I am {Your name}, and I own a {Your service}. Please find my response to your query below. ========= {Your query -limited to the word count suggested by the journalist} ========= I hope this was useful. Please let me know if you have any questions. I would be happy to answer them. Please find my full name, title, image, and company URL in my signature. Thank you. — {Your details} 2. Broken link building Broken link building is one of the oldest link building techniques. In this method, a backlink seeker reaches out to the target website with information on a broken link with a recommendation to replace it with the seeker’s content. For example, if I were to have a broken link on DigiGrow and someone were to want backlinks from my website, they would look for links returning 404 error on my domain, notify me about its existence and share their content to replace the broken link. Through this method, the value the backlink seeker offers is an improvement in the technical health of the target website. Whom does broken link building work for? This method is almost as old as the concept of backlinking campaigns and doesn’t work much for anyone. New websites and those with low domain authority have a tough time seeing any success with this method. We saw a poor conversion rate of 1.5% with broken link building. Challenges with broken link building Additionally, this method’s popularity has attracted tonnes of ready-to-use templates that most target websites are familiar with. Some websites also add them to the spam list. This method has become a joke – we don’t recommend it. It still makes it to the list because it’s one of the options available in case nothing else works. 3. The method that works the best Creating a statistics page is the best method to get backlinks without paying for them – and get them in bulk, fast! A statistics page is a trend-based article on a specific industry pain point. For example, a data point on what percentage of successful people wake up early might be of great interest to many. If you have that number in your blog post, people will link to it while mentioning it in their blog posts. With the statistics page, you provide data to content writers that no other website has. You get backlinks for your originality. Whom does statistics page link building work for? It works well for businesses that already have a decent domain rating. Their domain authority gives people an impetus to respond to their survey as a backlink from them holds high value. Smaller websites will have a tough time convincing people to respond to their survey. The only workaround is giving Amazon gift cards or something else that requires a budget – which disqualifies this method as a free method. Challenges with statistics page backlinking strategy Creating a statistics page involves qualifying leads and reaching out to them for data, cleaning the data, deriving insights, writing blog posts, and more. It might be a month-long effort, but the results are usually brilliant. 4. Free Guest Posting The guest posting method belongs to the bronze age of link building campaigns. In this method, you write a blog post with a link to your website. Whom does guest posting work for? Guest posting is no longer an effective method for building backlinks for any business. Think about it – you essentially give away your content for just a backlink! You could get a lot more by hosting the same content on your website. You can get traffic and backlinks by getting the page to rank. Challenges with guest posting Even if you pick good websites to submit a guest post to, this method may fail you because: 1. Like the broken link-building method, website owners are overwhelmed with outreach mail and direct them all to the trash bin. The success rate is too low. 2. Every blog post is worth more than a backlink. 3. It is not a scalable method. 5. Link exchange Link exchange is the technique in which the target domain links to your website if you link to theirs. Many consider this method to be grey-hat, and they are right. If done sparingly, this can be a very convenient method to build links. This practice is quite prevalent today. Whom does link exchange work for? Link exchange works for any website, but you can build links from websites with similar domain authority. A low-authority website will not have enough bargaining chips for a link exchange with a high-authority domain. Challenges with link exchange 1. Link exchange is seen as a grey-hat method – Google doesn’t like it. 2. It works for websites with similar authority – if you want to get links from high-authority domains, this method will not yield results. 6. Link building through social media Google rankings depend on the E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) of a website. And social media plays a key role in SEO by providing a signal to Google about the authority of your brand. When Google registers you as the author and owner of the content, you rank better. Not just that, social media can help you build backlinks without paying. This method involves creating valuable content on social media, building a follower base, and generating backlinks in the process. It takes time but once you have enough clout on any one social media platform, you can build backlinks consistently. By building a network and providing value over a long time, you increase the probability of a follower clicking on the links you share. Moreover, even if you don’t have links in your posts, people might link to your post in their content. All in all, the more people see your post, the more visits to your profile page and click on your links. Whom does link building through social media work for? This method works for all businesses because, for the most part, it has nothing to do with domain authority. Challenges with link building through social media There is no way to predict if link-building through social media would ever work. It involves creating a lot of content without seeing immediate results. Additionally, you need to invest time in writing content, engaging with your audience, and building your subscriber base. You won’t see success overnight. It might take many months. 7. Promote target domain through your newsletter Your website may not have a good domain authority but you may have a decent newsletter subscriber base. You can offer relevant high-domain websites to submit content to be promoted through your newsletter in return for a backlink. Through this method, you offer exposure to target domains in return for a backlink. Whom does this method of link building work for? Anyone who has a good subscriber base or newsletters can use this technique. Brand new websites with fewer than a thousand newsletter subscribers may not see any success with this method. Challenges with this method Building an audience is the most difficult bit of this method but selecting content for your newsletters can be even more challenging. Your subscriber base expects high-quality content but the target domain may want to get away with a substandard piece. You need to be able to say no even to high authority domains if the quality of content is subpar. 8. Create infographics Infographics are snackable. And thus shareable. Bloggers use them in their content to drive the point home effectively and often give a link-back to the owner. Whom does this method of link building work for? Infographics are a great way of getting backlinks without paying for them. They work well for any domain but the main challenge is getting the link. At times, people may post your infographic without giving you credit. You won’t find such instances until you do a Google image search. You sure can claim copyright or ask for a backlink but it’s often not worth the effort. Challenges with this method Designing an infographic might be a challenge. However, with Freemium tools like Canva, creating high-quality infographics is easy. You can access free templates and modify them as per your taste and brand colors. That’s it! 9. Start a podcast or feature in one Podcasting has become a killer method of promoting content. You can start your podcast when you talk about your niche or reach out to industry leaders and try to feature in popular podcasts. Podcasting will give you exposure. Additionally, you often get to mention the name of your website or link your content in the description and get referral traffic. The more you get that, the higher the probability of people linking to it because of the value it offers. Whom does podcast link building work for? You must have some domain authority to leverage this method of backlinking. Most podcast owners do not entertain newbies. Once you have a good domain authority or enough customer testimonials that highlight your expertise, getting onto a podcast without paying the owner becomes easy. Challenges with backlinking through podcasts If you plan to start your own podcast, be prepared to spend at least 6 months in getting a sizable subscriber-base. You won’t get followers until you build some clout through other channels of promotion. 10. Write business reviews Very few websites adopt this easy method of getting backlinks without paying for them. However, this one really works because you offer value to businesses before reaching out to them for backlinks. This is how this method works: First, you finalize 10-15 product or service based websites you hope to get a link from. Let’s assume that you seek backlinks from gardening based websites in the US. To attract their attention, you can create service-based listicles. For example, the keyword – best nursery in Seattle – is important for most nurseries. A post with them listed in it makes for good PR. You can get the list of nurseries from Google maps, select those that don’t rank on the map pack, and reach out to them for inputs. You can ask for details like Pricing, Quality, Distance from city center, employee count, etc. You can also assign a star-rating. This way you establish contact and give them something of value. Finally, once the article is ready, let the listed websites know about it. You can ask for a backlink but most of them will share your content, one way or another, by themselves. Whom does business review link building work for? Businesses with decent domain rating – and thus a chance to rank the listicle would see the most success with this method. You need to have samples of top ranking pages for businesses to evaluate your proposal. Challenges with this link building method The biggest challenge of this free link building method is that most listicle keywords are super-competitive. They are quite difficult to rank for. 11. Use an affiliate network An affiliate network can help you generate loads of relevant referral traffic through backlinks. It makes it easy to find the right affiliates to promote your business who also link to your website while promoting it. How this works is, the affiliate network creates unique links for every affiliate who chooses to promote your business. Those links find themselves in the media of promotion that the affiliates choose. For example, someone might promote your product through social media, in which case you just get a brand mention. However, if someone does it through a blog, you get backlinks. Who does affiliate link building work for? This method of link building works from businesses that pay a high commission and have a good reputation. It may not work for new websites. Challenges of building links through affiliates Most affiliates will add a nofollow or sponsored tag to your links because that’s what Google wants them to do. Any link that involves a monetary transaction needs to carry those tags otherwise Google might penalize them. A nofollow tag does not carry forward the link-juice which means you won’t see an improvement in your domain rating. However, these links might drive quality traffic which improves your authoritativeness. So these still are valuable links. 12. Try Slack Groups Slack groups are a gold-mine of backlinks and content collaboration in general. These groups are like HARO without competition. This method of generating backlinks without paying shows a high conversion rate. Essentially, someone who needs content for their next article puts a request in a popular slack group. You, if the niche is relevant, can respond to those requests with a quote in return for a backlink. Who does this free link building method work for? This method works for all websites big or small, old or new. Low domain authority websites may see a lower success rate but this method works much better than most others. Challenges with Slack group link building Finding vibrant slack communities is the biggest challenge of all. You will find hundreds of communities relevant to your niche, but few of them have a responsive audience. But the effort invested in finding one functional group will yield great results. FAQs Is paying for backlinks worth it? Buying backlinks is helpful only if the invested amount generates backlinks organically. It is a legit practice to pay someone to create content that generates links naturally. But paying someone to link to your website in their content is risky. That is because it can result in a manual action from Google. Does Google allow buying backlinks? No, it is a black-hat method of link-building. Google released a link-spam update in December 2023 that helps the search algorithm identify and penalize purchased backlinks. Today, websites find it difficult to buy backlinks and keep safe from Google’s manual action. How much should backlinks cost? Getting backlinks from individual domains should cost $0, meaning you should not pay for backlinks nor sell them. Paying for links is a black-hat method that can get you trapped in the link-spam update, resulting in deindexing of your website. There’s no easy or fast way to come back from that.

Members Online • Character_Ad_1990 Top 1% Poster Link Building in 2025 - Strategies for success, and what's changed? Tips Hi - I wrote something similar last year, and it garnered some good response along with a lot of questions regarding different elements of link building and how to go about it as a business owner. The reality is that we don’t 100% know all the elements the HCU entailed or changed. But In my experience, links have become a bit more impactful from what I've seen since the HCU and early 2024 updates, and are still an incredibly powerful ranking factor. Again, the sub is full of bad and nonsensical advice and commentary in regards to link building (elements of good, too) - its an incredibly (in my experience) logical process that people oftentimes overthink - however, it's time consuming to do it properly which is why so many people (agencies AND business owners) cut corners and get subpar results. Below, I’m sharing some information I mainly wrote in response to questions from business owners that could potentially benefit others. If you know link building well, this may not be useful to you but hopefully this can help some business owners create a more powerful profile of links. There’s a mixture of strategy and discourse. Again, if you’re right at the start of your journey, my earlier posts outline some of the more general aspects of link building. Each of these are essentially strategies and changes we’ve used over the last year. It’s important to note with all things that this is what worked for me and my clients - there are other views and methodologies that might have worked just as well for others - and that these are my own opinions based on what I’ve seen rather than universally accepted concepts. Stopped Using Link Inserts For this client, they’d been using link inserts for a long period of time with mixed results. Every now and then they’d get a small bump followed by a retraction. The strategy just wasn’t working. One of the issues was that, as a large B2B machinery seller in the financial sector, the weak link inserts previously procured just weren't moving the needle for the more difficult keywords. Before we look at the strategy - I just wanted to run through link inserts in a bit more detail… They’ve always been a cheaper option - and can sometimes be effective. However, there’s a way to get the best out of them. A way that the majority of large “link building agencies” don’t use or really care about due to the volume they’re processing. Unfortunately, its led to misinformation in general about what works best for link inserts. I find the best way to look at them is in a kind of tier system. This is just something that's in my own head, but it might help you out. Remember, link inserts, in my opinion, rarely beat post placements because with a post, you can completely control the breadth of content that sits around the link, allowing you to get the best from it entirely. With a link insert, the content isn’t primed to drive your link in the best possible way. Anyway: Tier one: A link that's thrown into content that isn’t even indexed on google. In our opinion these are the lowest of the low (though some might think otherwise) - and usually what these agencies procure on mass for their clients (or other agencies outsourcing to them). Doesn’t matter if the website is decent, if the page the link is in isn’t indexed, it’s going to do near nothing! If you’re procuring a link insert yourself - check the content you want it inserted into is at least indexed on google! You can do this with a simple site:(webpage) search on google itself. In the case above, upon investigation, these were mainly the links procured for the client up until we started working together. Tier two: A link in a page that’s indexed Its better because its indexed. However, here you have to make sure the content is worthwhile, isn’t terrible, and ties in with your own link. You don’t just want to throw your link into a page just because its indexed. Sure, you might be able to reword some of it, and potentially add in a paragraph that surrounds the link - but it has to be contextually relevant to what the link leads to. The client had a few of these too, some moderately relevant, but no consistency. Tier three: a link in content that ranks on google Now we’re getting somewhere. The content actually ranks on google - it isn’t just indexed…its ranked for terms. This means google is passing the content/page value…its saying that essentially it trusts the page enough to show it to people. A link here is clearly more valuable than the above. Again - the content has to be on point, and you can’t just throw your link into any content…there has to be relevancy. With that said - a link in content that ranks, if done right, will usually pull. The client had none of these… Tier four: A link in content that ranks for industry specific keywords These are great, because the keywords are completely related to you, and to what you do. Difficult to get, but completely worthwhile. Tier five: A link in content that ranks for what you’re trying to rank for A holy grail - but usually out of reach. These work incredibly well usually - but most sites aren’t going to link to a competitor from a page that ranks for a keyword they’re trying to beat them in - but it can be done in certain niches and situations. Remember - the content also has to be right when you’re looking at link inserts, this is just illustrative of the different kinds out there without really looking at assessing the website or content - its a way of highlighting how you can leverage getting a good link insert out of your provider. Most bought are tier 1 - a good agency won’t get you these kind of inserts (a great one will use inserts sparingly anyway - instead curating content that gives your link the best chance of doing well) - but this gives you an idea of how to leverage something out of it if buying them for yourself or assessing a provider. Now - back to the client, they sell large machinery with some pretty tough keywords to crack. The agencies previously primarily were using tier one and two above…so no real efficacy, on pages with weak relevancy. By pivoting to content curation, we were able to write for the target website while really making the most out of the link in the content we’ve written. We focused down on websites in the B2B niche as well as websites within the niches that would use this kind of software - the link inserts previously were just slapped into any kind of weakly relevant content. Remember, with link inserts, the content has been written for another purpose (maybe even for another link) - so you’re usually better off putting content together. The differentiation here got them where they wanted to be within 4 months, and when you think they’d spent years building crappy link inserts it speaks volumes. The main takeaway here is you can’t cut corners. You either need to get GOOD link inserts, or curate the content yourselves and you’ll see results if consistent. It boils down to logic. It also kind of shows how so many do this wrong (either due to lack of knowledge, or because they just can’t be bothered to do it right). Don’t just slap your links into any kind of content - Pivot to placing content written to support your link. Link Velocity: How Many? When a website goes viral or hits the headlines - however old - it accrues a tonne of links and nothing bad happens. The reality is that to an extent and from what we’ve seen - numbers don’t matter, what matters is the quality of the links you’re getting. The more quality links the better. Some do stand by numbers, and may have evidence to back that up - but in my experience quality stands on its own two feet where quantity doesn’t so well. One quality link can be worth hundreds of other links. You can get good links as often as you can. Never pass up a great opportunity because you think you’ve got too many in a month or a year. For a brand new website - it’s good to take a well planned out and measured approach. Different kinds of sites that are all of a certain quality, pertaining to the niche in question always drive value. In this case - We began working with a brand new brand in the B2C niche selling a popular ecom product. Competitors had thousands of links and a lot of business owners will jump to a (logical to be fair) conclusion that they need to match those links. Instead, focus on quality, and focus on making up a solid link profile that makes sense. In doing this, we matched and then surpassed the competitors for primary keywords after 6 months with 20% the amount of links that they had. Quality over quantity. What makes a quality site is the real question - but don’t just look at the number of referring domains, the domains themselves are whats important. Many people focus on the number of referring domains - its the quality level of domains - not the amount! Competitor Sniping? The links may not work in the same way This is an easy one - but worth a mention. The clients were between 4th and 6th for their main keyword - selling a consumer product similar to kids water toy, huge volume etc. Their link building was essentially copying whatever links their main (and leading) competitor was procuring. I’ve seen many clients and individuals who have come to me and said ‘I’ve copied my competitors link profile, but its not really worked and they’re still higher than me etc.” Sometimes links won’t work in the same was as they have for someone else. Sniping a competitors profile can work, and if there are any epic websites in the profile it can be worth trying to secure your own link. However, you’d be better off in the long run simply focusing on procuring your own link profile. Simply because of the quirks of link building, copying a competitor profile may disappoint you if it doesn’t give you a similar boost. Don’t spend all your time on your competitors' profile! There are many variables in play. This is a perfect example of why opinions can and do differ - because sometimes the same methodology works differently from one site to the next. Competitor link sniping can work as part of a wider link acquisition strategy, but it shouldn’t be all you do. Try out the first person (in Content) The majority of articles are written in the third person. It’s logical, easier, makes more sense. Sometimes it can also make sense to vary things as best possible and push out some first person posts. There was a single product ecom client in a really niche industry, but the keyword was nails. They were getting the right kind of link profile bit by bit, but every single bit of content they put out there on other sites (which held the link) was super similar. In fairness - it's hard to make each article unique with their one product store that fits a very slim user profile. However, we varied the content and made 70% of new posts 1st person - this works well for a few reasons: It really looks like the owner of the website/blog etc., has written the content - it feels more immediate and real. It stands out - if done well, it breaks the monotony of the same posts going to similar websites - meaning there could be more chance of ranking (especially if the “author” is recognised as an expert. If it ranks, the link will be more powerful instantly.) There are some drawbacks - if not done right, the article can read too promotional. It needs to be as neutral as possible. In this case, changing a load of link placements so that they’re in first person written content worked really well and pushed them into a gaining position. Vary the voice, tone, and person of the articles you’re placing on other websites. In the real world, the articles wouldn’t be too similar if it were happening naturally - again, create a believable link profile and use varied content to achieve this. You’re not just creating single links - you’re creating a varied profile, first person content can be part of this. Write for the Website or the link? People get confused with this - do you write for the link, or the website? The two will tie over slightly because logically the site you’ve targeted will naturally be in the same niche as your business. The best bet is to write for the website - because it gives you more chance of being published - and looks like the website owner has written the content. However, you have to give your link the best chance of success too. So - you curate the content in a certain way that's not promotional, but as if the website author has just naturally linked to it as if it would be a good resource, good product, on point information etc. So what you need to do is write for the theme of the website your publishing on - while focusing the niche/minutiae on your own websites intent. Takes practice but all you need to do is put yourself in the website owners shoes when writing the content. Create Your Own Network PBNs are usually referred to in a negative light, in a lot of cases this is justified. It’s because a lot of PBNs are from spammy link farms with spoofed traffic etc., owned by one person who rarely does things right. However, if you have the time and inclination you can build a logical one of your own. You essentially would build blogs around the service/product you’re selling - then link from the blogs logically to the service. For example say you own an electric bike website, you might build a couple of content sites: A blog on electric bike laws in different states A blog on electric bike reviews A blog on best places to use an electric bike A blog on electric bike maintenance tips etc. If you rank all of these for logical terms, the links from them to your electric bike shop will be pretty powerful. However, its limited by how many blogs you can create. Also, if the keywords you’re targeting are incredibly difficult, you’ll need links from other relevant blogs/websites in any case. Lastly - it is eminently time consuming. However, this is an example of a workable PBN. Again, a decent strategy depending on the use case and KW difficulty you’re going for. Website Traffic: Quality over Quantity Web traffic is a main website assessment metric. However, a lot of people use it in the wrong way. Most people now know (not all) that focusing on DA/DR etc. as a way to assess a website is a one way ticket to at best, a link that does nothing and a quick way to burn through your cash. So, we look at site traffic instead. We often consult on external link campaigns, on one, a client was approving any links (from their internal marketing team) with traffic over 5k - that was their only barometer, traffic over 5k. There are multiple things wrong here. The traffic might be coming from a country that the client business doesn’t even operate in. The traffic might be coming from completely fake/nonsense sources The keywords the site ranks for might also be complete nonsense (meaning the traffic means nothing or is just fake and spoofed). So - instead of focusing on traffic numbers - focus on where the traffic is coming from. Instead of looking at quantity, go for quality. Here - we taught the team to look at what the site is ranking for, and whether or not they’re relevant in the grand scheme of the campaign. By focusing on this instead of the blind numbers, they’re not only getting websites that rank for relevant terms to link to them, but sites with real traffic. In this case - a site with 2k relevant and real traffic is better than one with 50k nonsense anyday! Numbers can be good if you’re assessing two sites with real traffic against each other - obviously then, if you’ve the budget, you go for the larger one as seemingly Google is passing that one more (relevant) traffic (for whatever reason). In the end - remember, you’re trying to create a profile of believable links to your website. You’ll need different kinds of websites (while keeping relevancy and quality in mind.) This is where so many go wrong - because they tend to snatch at links here and there and don’t focus on building a mutually beneficial portfolio of links. Hope this helped with your link building campaign. Again - this is what I've observed and what's worked for me. Other approaches may be just as viable.

In this case - We began working with a brand new brand in the B2C niche selling a popular ecom product. Competitors had thousands of links and a lot of business owners will jump to a (logical to be fair) conclusion that they need to match those links. Instead, focus on quality, and focus on making up a solid link profile that makes sense. In doing this, we matched and then surpassed the competitors for primary keywords after 6 months with 20% the amount of links that they had. Quality over quantity. What makes a quality site is the real question - but don’t just look at the number of referring domains, the domains themselves are whats important. Many people focus on the number of referring domains - its the quality level of domains - not the amount! Competitor Sniping? The links may not work in the same way This is an easy one - but worth a mention. The clients were between 4th and 6th for their main keyword - selling a consumer product similar to kids water toy, huge volume etc. Their link building was essentially copying whatever links their main (and leading) competitor was procuring. I’ve seen many clients and individuals who have come to me and said ‘I’ve copied my competitors link profile, but its not really worked and they’re still higher than me etc.” Sometimes links won’t work in the same was as they have for someone else. Sniping a competitors profile can work, and if there are any epic websites in the profile it can be worth trying to secure your own link. However, you’d be better off in the long run simply focusing on procuring your own link profile. Simply because of the quirks of link building, copying a competitor profile may disappoint you if it doesn’t give you a similar boost. Don’t spend all your time on your competitors' profile! There are many variables in play. This is a perfect example of why opinions can and do differ - because sometimes the same methodology works differently from one site to the next. Competitor link sniping can work as part of a wider link acquisition strategy, but it shouldn’t be all you do. Try out the first person (in Content) The majority of articles are written in the third person. It’s logical, easier, makes more sense. Sometimes it can also make sense to vary things as best possible and push out some first person posts. There was a single product ecom client in a really niche industry, but the keyword was nails. They were getting the right kind of link profile bit by bit, but every single bit of content they put out there on other sites (which held the link) was super similar. In fairness - it's hard to make each article unique with their one product store that fits a very slim user profile. However, we varied the content and made 70% of new posts 1st person - this works well for a few reasons: It really looks like the owner of the website/blog etc., has written the content - it feels more immediate and real. It stands out - if done well, it breaks the monotony of the same posts going to similar websites - meaning there could be more chance of ranking (especially if the “author” is recognised as an expert. If it ranks, the link will be more powerful instantly.) There are some drawbacks - if not done right, the article can read too promotional. It needs to be as neutral as possible. In this case, changing a load of link placements so that they’re in first person written content worked really well and pushed them into a gaining position. Vary the voice, tone, and person of the articles you’re placing on other websites. In the real world, the articles wouldn’t be too similar if it were happening naturally - again, create a believable link profile and use varied content to achieve this. You’re not just creating single links - you’re creating a varied profile, first person content can be part of this. Write for the Website or the link? People get confused with this - do you write for the link, or the website? The two will tie over slightly because logically the site you’ve targeted will naturally be in the same niche as your business. The best bet is to write for the website - because it gives you more chance of being published - and looks like the website owner has written the content. However, you have to give your link the best chance of success too. So - you curate the content in a certain way that's not promotional, but as if the website author has just naturally linked to it as if it would be a good resource, good product, on point information etc. So what you need to do is write for the theme of the website your publishing on - while focusing the niche/minutiae on your own websites intent. Takes practice but all you need to do is put yourself in the website owners shoes when writing the content. Create Your Own Network PBNs are usually referred to in a negative light, in a lot of cases this is justified. It’s because a lot of PBNs are from spammy link farms with spoofed traffic etc., owned by one person who rarely does things right. However, if you have the time and inclination you can build a logical one of your own. You essentially would build blogs around the service/product you’re selling - then link from the blogs logically to the service. For example say you own an electric bike website, you might build a couple of content sites: A blog on electric bike laws in different states A blog on electric bike reviews A blog on best places to use an electric bike A blog on electric bike maintenance tips etc. If you rank all of these for logical terms, the links from them to your electric bike shop will be pretty powerful. However, its limited by how many blogs you can create. Also, if the keywords you’re targeting are incredibly difficult, you’ll need links from other relevant blogs/websites in any case. Lastly - it is eminently time consuming. However, this is an example of a workable PBN. Again, a decent strategy depending on the use case and KW difficulty you’re going for. Website Traffic: Quality over Quantity Web traffic is a main website assessment metric. However, a lot of people use it in the wrong way. Most people now know (not all) that focusing on DA/DR etc. as a way to assess a website is a one way ticket to at best, a link that does nothing and a quick way to burn through your cash. So, we look at site traffic instead. We often consult on external link campaigns, on one, a client was approving any links (from their internal marketing team) with traffic over 5k - that was their only barometer, traffic over 5k. There are multiple things wrong here. The traffic might be coming from a country that the client business doesn’t even operate in. The traffic might be coming from completely fake/nonsense sources The keywords the site ranks for might also be complete nonsense (meaning the traffic means nothing or is just fake and spoofed). So - instead of focusing on traffic numbers - focus on where the traffic is coming from. Instead of looking at quantity, go for quality. Here - we taught the team to look at what the site is ranking for, and whether or not they’re relevant in the grand scheme of the campaign. By focusing on this instead of the blind numbers, they’re not only getting websites that rank for relevant terms to link to them, but sites with real traffic. In this case - a site with 2k relevant and real traffic is better than one with 50k nonsense anyday! Numbers can be good if you’re assessing two sites with real traffic against each other - obviously then, if you’ve the budget, you go for the larger one as seemingly Google is passing that one more (relevant) traffic (for whatever reason). In the end - remember, you’re trying to create a profile of believable links to your website. You’ll need different kinds of websites (while keeping relevancy and quality in mind.) This is where so many go wrong - because they tend to snatch at links here and there and don’t focus on building a mutually beneficial portfolio of links. Hope this helped with your link building campaign. Again - this is what I've observed and what's worked for me. Other approaches may be just as viable.

If backlink acquisition slows, adjustments to content marketing or outreach efforts may be needed. A SEO Manager may track this KPI monthly to report on link-building success, while a content marketer may analyze backlink trends to optimize future content strategies. KPI Example Best Practices for Link Building 📊 Track Your Link Building Success 📊 Earn High-Quality Backlinks Focus on securing links from authoritative and relevant websites to boost your site’s credibility and search rankings. 📈 Create Link-Worthy Content Develop high-value content like guides, infographics, and research studies that naturally attract backlinks. 🔄 Build Relationships for Outreach Engage with industry leaders, bloggers, and websites to foster link-building opportunities through guest posts and collaborations. 📅 Monitor & Maintain Backlinks Regularly track your backlinks to remove spammy links and ensure your site maintains a strong and healthy link profile. What is Link Building Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in link building are specific, measurable values that show how effectively your backlink strategy achieves key business objectives. These aren’t just random numbers—they’re the compass guiding your entire link building journey. Good link building management depends on these indicators to tell you whether your efforts are actually paying off. Without clear KPIs, you’re basically building links in the dark, with no way to know if your hard work translates to real business results. A thoughtful link building report includes these metrics to show progress and ROI to clients or stakeholders. The right KPIs help you connect your link building work directly to business outcomes like increased traffic, better rankings, and ultimately, more conversions. The Role of KPIs in Achieving Link Building Goals KPIs serve as both the roadmap and measuring stick for your link building strategy. They transform vague goals like “get more backlinks” into specific, trackable objectives. When used properly, these indicators help you focus your resources on the most productive link building tactics. Link building reporting becomes much more valuable when it centers around meaningful KPIs rather than just raw numbers. According to research compiled by Databox.com, the most valuable metrics to track include the number of new backlinks earned, average link quality, and the number of referring domains. These indicators provide actionable insights that help you refine your approach over time. For SEO agencies, establishing clear KPIs from the start sets proper expectations with clients and provides a framework for showing success. When everyone agrees on what success looks like, it’s easier to build trust and showcase the value of your link building services. Key Link Building KPIs to Monitor Number of Backlinks When developing your link building management strategy, the debate between quantity and quality is crucial. While tracking the total number of backlinks gives you a baseline metric, the quality of those links determines their actual impact on your site’s authority. A good link building report should highlight not just how many backlinks you’ve acquired, but their quality distribution. Research shows that 76% of SEO professionals use Ahrefs specifically for link building purposes, allowing them to assess metrics like Domain Rating (DR) alongside raw backlink counts. This combination creates a more meaningful picture of link profile strength. For effective link metrics tracking, try categorizing backlinks by authority levels. High-quality backlinks from authoritative sites in your niche deliver significantly more value than dozens of links from low-quality sources. According to data gathered by Databox, the average link quality (measuring both authority and relevance) ranks as one of the most critical KPIs to monitor in your link building efforts. Referring Domains The number of unique referring domains often proves more valuable than raw backlink counts. This metric reveals the breadth of your link profile and serves as a stronger indicator of your site’s perceived authority across the web. In link building reporting, highlighting growth in unique referring domains shows meaningful progress to clients or stakeholders. Search engines interpret links from diverse sources as multiple independent “votes of confidence” in your content. According to Databox research, the number of referring domains is considered one of the top link building metrics by industry experts. For SEO agencies, prioritizing domain diversity over sheer backlink volume often yields better results. One effective approach is tracking the ratio of referring domains to total backlinks—a healthy profile shows steady growth in both areas without excessive links from a small number of sources. Anchor Text Variation The distribution of anchor text in your backlink profile significantly impacts your SEO performance. Natural variation in anchor text helps search engines understand what your content is about while avoiding over-optimization penalties. When preparing your link building report, include anchor text distribution analysis to identify potential issues or opportunities. Databox insights confirm that anchor text distribution is among the key metrics valued by SEO professionals for evaluating link building success. Aim for a natural mix of branded terms (your company name), naked URLs, generic phrases (“click here,” “learn more”), and relevant keywords. Too many exact-match keyword anchors can trigger spam filters, while too many generic anchors might limit the contextual value of your links. Link Relevancy and Contextual Value Link relevancy has become increasingly important as search algorithms grow more sophisticated. Backlinks from websites in related industries or discussing similar topics carry more weight than random links from unrelated sources. In your link building management dashboard, include metrics that assess contextual relevance—not just domain authority. This might involve categorizing backlinks by industry, content type, or topical overlap with your site. The contextual value of a link often determines its true impact on your rankings more than raw authority metrics. For SEO agencies, showing the relevancy of acquired links adds another dimension to client reporting. Beyond showing that you’ve secured links from high-authority sites, you can highlight how these links come from sources that align with the client’s industry and audience interests. Follow vs. Nofollow Links Modern link building strategies should balance follow links (which pass SEO value) with nofollow links (which typically don’t). While follow links remain the priority for direct ranking benefits, nofollow links still contribute to a natural-looking backlink profile. When tracking link metrics, categorize links by their attribute type to ensure a balanced distribution. Too many follow links from low-quality sources can appear manipulative, while a profile containing only follow links looks unnatural in today’s linking environment. According to Databox data, successful link building campaigns typically track both follow and nofollow acquisition separately while maintaining focus on high-quality links regardless of attribute. Even nofollow links from respected sources can drive significant referral traffic and brand visibility. Traffic and Engagement from Backlinks Beyond their SEO impact, high-quality backlinks should generate direct referral traffic and engagement. Monitoring these downstream effects provides a more complete picture of your link building ROI. Effective link building reporting connects backlink acquisition to actual business outcomes by tracking metrics like referral traffic, time on site from referral sources, and conversion rates from backlink traffic. This approach demonstrates value beyond simple link counts or domain authority scores. For SEO agencies, showcasing traffic generation alongside traditional link metrics creates more compelling client reports. Using tools like Google Analytics alongside specialized SEO platforms provides this comprehensive view. As Databox research indicates, both Google Analytics and Google Search Console are essential tools for evaluating the true impact of link building efforts on website performance. Measuring and Analyzing Link Building KPIs Essential Tools for Tracking Link Building Metrics Effective link building management requires robust tools that provide comprehensive data on your backlink profile. According to research from Databox, Ahrefs stands out as the most popular tool for link building campaigns, used by 80% of surveyed contributors. Its comprehensive backlink analysis makes it an industry standard for tracking link metrics. Beyond Ahrefs, SEMrush and Moz offer similar capabilities for backlink analysis, with each providing unique features that may better suit certain organizational needs. For SEO agencies handling multiple clients, these tools offer efficient ways to monitor progress across various campaigns simultaneously. Interestingly, while Ahrefs is widely used for link building specifically, 51.3% of SEO professionals prefer SEMrush as their favorite overall SEO tool. For thorough link building reporting, don’t overlook free tools like Google Search Console, which provides valuable data on how search engines view your backlinks. Combining data from multiple sources into a unified dashboard using tools like Databox can streamline your reporting process, creating clear visualizations that help clients understand progress at a glance. For outreach tracking, tools like Hunter have become popular for gathering prospect email addresses and managing communication efforts. Interpreting Complex Data for Clear Insights The challenge in link building reporting isn’t collecting data—it’s transforming that data into actionable insights. Start by establishing baseline measurements for each KPI before launching new campaigns. This creates a reference point for measuring progress and identifying trends over time. When analyzing link data, focus on correlation patterns between different metrics. For instance, if referring domains increase but organic traffic remains flat, this might indicate you’re acquiring links from irrelevant or low-quality sources. Look beyond surface-level numbers to understand the story your data is telling about your link building effectiveness. For link building management purposes, segment your data by campaign, content type, or acquisition method. This granular approach reveals which strategies deliver the best results and deserve more resources. According to Databox research, successful SEO professionals track metrics like response rate to outreach emails alongside traditional link metrics to optimize their processes from end to end. Benchmarking Against Industry Standards Establishing realistic expectations requires understanding how your link building performance compares to industry standards. While every website starts from a different baseline, certain benchmarks can guide your strategy development and goal-setting process. For SEO agencies, contextualizing link building reports with industry averages helps manage client expectations. For example, highly competitive industries like finance or health typically require more authoritative backlinks to see movement in rankings compared to less competitive niches. Understanding these differences prevents setting unrealistic targets that lead to perceived failure. Research from Databox indicates that tracking Domain Rating (DR) of acquired backlinks provides valuable context when benchmarking link quality. By comparing your DR distribution against competitors, you can identify gaps and opportunities in your link building strategy. Additionally, tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush offer industry-specific benchmarking features that allow you to measure your performance against similar websites. When establishing benchmarks, consider factors beyond raw link counts. Metrics like link growth rate, referring domain diversity, and traffic from backlinks often provide more meaningful comparisons than absolute numbers. For SEO agencies, creating custom benchmarking reports that account for client-specific factors like site age, existing authority, and competitive landscape delivers more valuable insights than generic industry averages. Remember that benchmarking isn’t about matching exact numbers but understanding relative performance. A new website might celebrate acquiring ten high-quality backlinks in a month, while an established authority site might consider that same number disappointing. The key is establishing realistic, contextual goals based on where you start and where your competitors stand. Strategies to Optimize Link Building through KPIs Enhancing Domain Authority Domain authority remains one of the most coveted link metrics in SEO. To boost this critical indicator, focus your link building management efforts on quality rather than quantity. Start by identifying high-authority websites in your niche that could provide valuable backlinks. According to Databox research, tracking Domain Rating (DR) of acquired backlinks is a practice followed by 67% of marketers when measuring the quality of their links. Implement a tiered outreach strategy that prioritizes high-authority targets while maintaining a steady flow of mid-level acquisitions. For effective link building reporting, track how each new backlink impacts your overall domain authority over time. This approach demonstrates clear value to clients or stakeholders by connecting specific link building efforts to measurable authority growth. Consider establishing topic clusters in your content strategy, creating comprehensive resource pages that naturally attract links from authoritative sources. This approach not only enhances domain authority but also establishes topical relevance—another factor search engines increasingly value. For SEO agencies, highlighting topic authority growth alongside domain authority in your link building reports provides clients with a more complete picture of campaign success. Improving Anchor Text Distribution Anchor text distribution directly impacts how search engines interpret your backlink profile. Your link metrics should include detailed anchor text analysis to identify potential optimization opportunities or overoptimization risks. According to Databox, anchor text distribution is among the key link building reporting metrics valued by SEO professionals. To optimize your anchor text strategy, aim for a natural distribution that includes: Branded anchors (your brand name) Naked URLs (your exact website address) Generic phrases (“click here,” “learn more”) Partial-match keywords (variations of target terms) Exact-match keywords (used sparingly) Avoid excessive exact-match keyword anchors, which can trigger algorithm penalties. Instead, focus on diversification that mimics natural linking patterns. When conducting link building for SEO agencies, educate clients about the importance of varied anchor text rather than fixating on exact-match keywords. Regular anchor text audits should be part of your link building management process. These reviews help identify potential risk areas before they become problems. If your analysis reveals an overreliance on specific anchor types, adjust your outreach strategy to request more diverse anchor text in future link building efforts. Strategies for Acquiring High-Quality Backlinks High-quality backlinks form the backbone of effective link building campaigns. Start by creating truly exceptional, linkable content assets—comprehensive guides, original research, or interactive tools that naturally attract references. These resources should address specific pain points in your industry or provide unique insights not available elsewhere. Targeted outreach remains essential for acquiring premium backlinks. Tools like Hunter, mentioned in Databox research, can streamline your outreach process by gathering prospect email addresses efficiently. Track your outreach response rates as part of your link building report to continuously refine your approach and messaging. For SEO agencies, demonstrating the quality of acquired links goes beyond domain metrics. Consider including additional contextual information in your link building reporting, such as: Topic relevance to client’s industry Estimated monthly traffic of linking pages Social engagement metrics of linking domains Editorial standards of linking publications These quality indicators provide clients with a more comprehensive understanding of your link acquisition strategy and value. Remember that a single high-quality, contextually relevant backlink often delivers more value than multiple lower-quality links. Managing and Mitigating Spammy Links Even the most careful link building strategies can attract unwanted backlinks. Proactive link profile monitoring should be a core component of your link building management approach. According to Databox findings, successful SEO professionals regularly audit their backlink profiles to identify potential toxic links before they harm rankings. Implement a systematic process for identifying and addressing problematic links: Conduct regular backlink audits (monthly or quarterly) Flag suspicious links based on quality metrics and relevance Attempt outreach for removal when appropriate Use Google’s Disavow Tool for links that cannot be removed Document all actions in your link building report For clients, explain that some toxic link accumulation is normal and doesn’t indicate a problem with your strategy. Instead, emphasize how your proactive management protects their site from potential penalties. When presenting link metrics, include a “toxicity trend” that shows how your efforts keep harmful links under control over time. SEO agencies should consider including regular backlink audits as a standard service offering. This proactive approach demonstrates value beyond just link acquisition and positions your agency as a comprehensive link building management partner rather than simply a link builder. As search algorithms continue to emphasize quality over quantity, this protective service becomes increasingly valuable to clients concerned about their long-term search visibility. Addressing Common Challenges and FAQs How Long Does It Take to See Improvements in Link Building KPIs? One of the most common questions in link building management is about timeline expectations. The truth is that improvements in link metrics vary widely depending on several factors. Typically, you’ll notice changes in direct link KPIs (like referring domains or backlink counts) immediately, but their impact on authority metrics and rankings often takes longer. For most sites, expect to see meaningful movement in domain authority metrics within 3-6 months of consistent, quality link building. However, competitive niches may require longer timeframes. When creating a link building report for clients or stakeholders, it’s crucial to set realistic expectations about these timelines from the beginning. Several factors influence how quickly you’ll see results: Your site’s existing authority (higher authority sites often see faster impacts) The quality and relevance of acquired links Consistency of link acquisition over time Competitive landscape in your niche According to Databox research, tracking both immediate metrics (new backlinks earned, referring domains) and lagging indicators (domain rating, organic traffic) provides a more complete picture of progress. This approach helps manage expectations while still demonstrating incremental wins along the way. Is It Necessary to Remove Low-Quality Links? Proper backlink hygiene remains essential in 2024’s SEO landscape. While Google has improved its ability to ignore low-quality links rather than penalizing sites for them, proactive management of your link profile is still a best practice in link building reporting. For SEO agencies, regular link audits should be part of your standard service offering. These audits help identify potentially harmful links before they impact client performance. When toxic links are discovered, you have several options: Contact webmasters requesting removal (effective but time-consuming) Use Google’s Disavow Tool (especially for links that can’t be removed) Monitor without action (for borderline cases where disavowal might do more harm than good) The key is developing a consistent process for evaluating link quality. Not every “low-quality” link requires action—focus on truly spammy or manipulative links that could trigger algorithmic or manual penalties. Document your decisions in your link building management system to maintain a clear history of actions taken. Impact of Internal and Social Media Links on KPIs While external backlinks often get the spotlight, internal linking and social media signals play important supporting roles in comprehensive link building strategies. Internal links help distribute page authority throughout your site and establish topical relevance clusters that complement your external link building efforts. In your link building report, consider including internal linking metrics alongside external backlink data. This holistic approach demonstrates how your overall link strategy (both internal and external) works together to improve site authority and user experience. Social media links typically carry “nofollow” attributes, limiting their direct SEO impact. However, they deliver other benefits worth tracking in your link metrics dashboard: Increased content visibility and amplification Potential for attracting natural backlinks from social audiences Direct referral traffic that can lead to conversions Brand awareness and reputation building For SEO agencies, explaining this ecosystem approach helps clients understand how different types of links contribute to overall performance. Tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console can help attribute traffic and engagement from these various link sources. FAQs Link Building Metrics “More links always mean better rankings.” This persistent myth needs addressing in client education. Quality and relevance now far outweigh quantity. A focused strategy targeting fewer, higher-quality links often delivers better results than mass acquisition of mediocre links. “Only follow links matter for SEO.” While follow links pass more direct ranking power, nofollow links still provide brand exposure, referral traffic, and diversification of your link profile. A natural link profile includes both types. “Domain Authority is an official Google metric.” Many clients confuse third-party authority metrics (like Moz’s DA or Ahrefs’ DR) with Google’s actual ranking factors. Explain in your link building reporting that these are useful comparative tools but not direct Google rankings factors. “All link building happens quickly.” Sustainable link building is a marathon, not a sprint. Educate stakeholders that quality link acquisition takes time and rushing typically leads to lower-quality links that deliver less long-term value. “Anchor text should always include keywords.” Excessive keyword-rich anchor text can appear manipulative. A diverse, natural-looking anchor text profile performs better long-term than one over-optimized for keywords. Related Topics for Further Exploration To deepen your link building expertise, consider exploring these related areas: Digital PR for Link Acquisition Public relations strategies increasingly overlap with link building. Techniques like data-driven stories, expert commentary, and newsworthy content can attract high-authority links from media outlets. Content-Driven Link Building Creating linkable assets—comprehensive guides, original research, or interactive tools—can generate passive link acquisition over time. This approach complements active outreach strategies. Technical SEO’s Impact on Link Equity How your site handles redirects, canonicalization, and internal linking directly affects how link equity flows through your site. Technical optimizations can maximize the value of your link building efforts. Competitive Link Analysis Techniques Advanced competitive analysis helps identify link gaps and opportunities. Learning to effectively analyze competitor backlink profiles can reveal valuable strategic insights. Local Link Building Strategies For businesses with physical locations, local link building techniques focused on community relationships and geographic relevance offer unique opportunities. For SEO agencies looking to enhance their link building services, staying current with these evolving topics helps maintain a competitive edge. Consider incorporating educational content about these areas in your client communications and link building reporting to demonstrate your ongoing expertise and value.

When used properly, these indicators help you focus your resources on the most productive link building tactics. Link building reporting becomes much more valuable when it centers around meaningful KPIs rather than just raw numbers. According to research compiled by Databox.com, the most valuable metrics to track include the number of new backlinks earned, average link quality, and the number of referring domains. These indicators provide actionable insights that help you refine your approach over time. For SEO agencies, establishing clear KPIs from the start sets proper expectations with clients and provides a framework for showing success. When everyone agrees on what success looks like, it’s easier to build trust and showcase the value of your link building services. Key Link Building KPIs to Monitor Number of Backlinks When developing your link building management strategy, the debate between quantity and quality is crucial. While tracking the total number of backlinks gives you a baseline metric, the quality of those links determines their actual impact on your site’s authority. A good link building report should highlight not just how many backlinks you’ve acquired, but their quality distribution. Research shows that 76% of SEO professionals use Ahrefs specifically for link building purposes, allowing them to assess metrics like Domain Rating (DR) alongside raw backlink counts. This combination creates a more meaningful picture of link profile strength. For effective link metrics tracking, try categorizing backlinks by authority levels. High-quality backlinks from authoritative sites in your niche deliver significantly more value than dozens of links from low-quality sources. According to data gathered by Databox, the average link quality (measuring both authority and relevance) ranks as one of the most critical KPIs to monitor in your link building efforts. Referring Domains The number of unique referring domains often proves more valuable than raw backlink counts. This metric reveals the breadth of your link profile and serves as a stronger indicator of your site’s perceived authority across the web. In link building reporting, highlighting growth in unique referring domains shows meaningful progress to clients or stakeholders. Search engines interpret links from diverse sources as multiple independent “votes of confidence” in your content. According to Databox research, the number of referring domains is considered one of the top link building metrics by industry experts. For SEO agencies, prioritizing domain diversity over sheer backlink volume often yields better results. One effective approach is tracking the ratio of referring domains to total backlinks—a healthy profile shows steady growth in both areas without excessive links from a small number of sources. Anchor Text Variation The distribution of anchor text in your backlink profile significantly impacts your SEO performance. Natural variation in anchor text helps search engines understand what your content is about while avoiding over-optimization penalties. When preparing your link building report, include anchor text distribution analysis to identify potential issues or opportunities. Databox insights confirm that anchor text distribution is among the key metrics valued by SEO professionals for evaluating link building success. Aim for a natural mix of branded terms (your company name), naked URLs, generic phrases (“click here,” “learn more”), and relevant keywords. Too many exact-match keyword anchors can trigger spam filters, while too many generic anchors might limit the contextual value of your links. Link Relevancy and Contextual Value Link relevancy has become increasingly important as search algorithms grow more sophisticated. Backlinks from websites in related industries or discussing similar topics carry more weight than random links from unrelated sources. In your link building management dashboard, include metrics that assess contextual relevance—not just domain authority. This might involve categorizing backlinks by industry, content type, or topical overlap with your site. The contextual value of a link often determines its true impact on your rankings more than raw authority metrics. For SEO agencies, showing the relevancy of acquired links adds another dimension to client reporting. Beyond showing that you’ve secured links from high-authority sites, you can highlight how these links come from sources that align with the client’s industry and audience interests. Follow vs. Nofollow Links Modern link building strategies should balance follow links (which pass SEO value) with nofollow links (which typically don’t). While follow links remain the priority for direct ranking benefits, nofollow links still contribute to a natural-looking backlink profile. When tracking link metrics, categorize links by their attribute type to ensure a balanced distribution. Too many follow links from low-quality sources can appear manipulative, while a profile containing only follow links looks unnatural in today’s linking environment. According to Databox data, successful link building campaigns typically track both follow and nofollow acquisition separately while maintaining focus on high-quality links regardless of attribute. Even nofollow links from respected sources can drive significant referral traffic and brand visibility. Traffic and Engagement from Backlinks Beyond their SEO impact, high-quality backlinks should generate direct referral traffic and engagement. Monitoring these downstream effects provides a more complete picture of your link building ROI. Effective link building reporting connects backlink acquisition to actual business outcomes by tracking metrics like referral traffic, time on site from referral sources, and conversion rates from backlink traffic. This approach demonstrates value beyond simple link counts or domain authority scores. For SEO agencies, showcasing traffic generation alongside traditional link metrics creates more compelling client reports. Using tools like Google Analytics alongside specialized SEO platforms provides this comprehensive view. As Databox research indicates, both Google Analytics and Google Search Console are essential tools for evaluating the true impact of link building efforts on website performance. Measuring and Analyzing Link Building KPIs Essential Tools for Tracking Link Building Metrics Effective link building management requires robust tools that provide comprehensive data on your backlink profile. According to research from Databox, Ahrefs stands out as the most popular tool for link building campaigns, used by 80% of surveyed contributors. Its comprehensive backlink analysis makes it an industry standard for tracking link metrics. Beyond Ahrefs, SEMrush and Moz offer similar capabilities for backlink analysis, with each providing unique features that may better suit certain organizational needs. For SEO agencies handling multiple clients, these tools offer efficient ways to monitor progress across various campaigns simultaneously. Interestingly, while Ahrefs is widely used for link building specifically, 51.3% of SEO professionals prefer SEMrush as their favorite overall SEO tool. For thorough link building reporting, don’t overlook free tools like Google Search Console, which provides valuable data on how search engines view your backlinks. Combining data from multiple sources into a unified dashboard using tools like Databox can streamline your reporting process, creating clear visualizations that help clients understand progress at a glance. For outreach tracking, tools like Hunter have become popular for gathering prospect email addresses and managing communication efforts. Interpreting Complex Data for Clear Insights The challenge in link building reporting isn’t collecting data—it’s transforming that data into actionable insights. Start by establishing baseline measurements for each KPI before launching new campaigns. This creates a reference point for measuring progress and identifying trends over time. When analyzing link data, focus on correlation patterns between different metrics. For instance, if referring domains increase but organic traffic remains flat, this might indicate you’re acquiring links from irrelevant or low-quality sources. Look beyond surface-level numbers to understand the story your data is telling about your link building effectiveness. For link building management purposes, segment your data by campaign, content type, or acquisition method. This granular approach reveals which strategies deliver the best results and deserve more resources. According to Databox research, successful SEO professionals track metrics like response rate to outreach emails alongside traditional link metrics to optimize their processes from end to end. Benchmarking Against Industry Standards Establishing realistic expectations requires understanding how your link building performance compares to industry standards. While every website starts from a different baseline, certain benchmarks can guide your strategy development and goal-setting process. For SEO agencies, contextualizing link building reports with industry averages helps manage client expectations. For example, highly competitive industries like finance or health typically require more authoritative backlinks to see movement in rankings compared to less competitive niches. Understanding these differences prevents setting unrealistic targets that lead to perceived failure. Research from Databox indicates that tracking Domain Rating (DR) of acquired backlinks provides valuable context when benchmarking link quality. By comparing your DR distribution against competitors, you can identify gaps and opportunities in your link building strategy. Additionally, tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush offer industry-specific benchmarking features that allow you to measure your performance against similar websites. When establishing benchmarks, consider factors beyond raw link counts. Metrics like link growth rate, referring domain diversity, and traffic from backlinks often provide more meaningful comparisons than absolute numbers. For SEO agencies, creating custom benchmarking reports that account for client-specific factors like site age, existing authority, and competitive landscape delivers more valuable insights than generic industry averages. Remember that benchmarking isn’t about matching exact numbers but understanding relative performance. A new website might celebrate acquiring ten high-quality backlinks in a month, while an established authority site might consider that same number disappointing. The key is establishing realistic, contextual goals based on where you start and where your competitors stand. Strategies to Optimize Link Building through KPIs Enhancing Domain Authority Domain authority remains one of the most coveted link metrics in SEO. To boost this critical indicator, focus your link building management efforts on quality rather than quantity. Start by identifying high-authority websites in your niche that could provide valuable backlinks. According to Databox research, tracking Domain Rating (DR) of acquired backlinks is a practice followed by 67% of marketers when measuring the quality of their links. Implement a tiered outreach strategy that prioritizes high-authority targets while maintaining a steady flow of mid-level acquisitions. For effective link building reporting, track how each new backlink impacts your overall domain authority over time. This approach demonstrates clear value to clients or stakeholders by connecting specific link building efforts to measurable authority growth. Consider establishing topic clusters in your content strategy, creating comprehensive resource pages that naturally attract links from authoritative sources. This approach not only enhances domain authority but also establishes topical relevance—another factor search engines increasingly value. For SEO agencies, highlighting topic authority growth alongside domain authority in your link building reports provides clients with a more complete picture of campaign success. Improving Anchor Text Distribution Anchor text distribution directly impacts how search engines interpret your backlink profile. Your link metrics should include detailed anchor text analysis to identify potential optimization opportunities or overoptimization risks. According to Databox, anchor text distribution is among the key link building reporting metrics valued by SEO professionals. To optimize your anchor text strategy, aim for a natural distribution that includes: Branded anchors (your brand name) Naked URLs (your exact website address) Generic phrases (“click here,” “learn more”) Partial-match keywords (variations of target terms) Exact-match keywords (used sparingly) Avoid excessive exact-match keyword anchors, which can trigger algorithm penalties. Instead, focus on diversification that mimics natural linking patterns. When conducting link building for SEO agencies, educate clients about the importance of varied anchor text rather than fixating on exact-match keywords. Regular anchor text audits should be part of your link building management process. These reviews help identify potential risk areas before they become problems. If your analysis reveals an overreliance on specific anchor types, adjust your outreach strategy to request more diverse anchor text in future link building efforts. Strategies for Acquiring High-Quality Backlinks High-quality backlinks form the backbone of effective link building campaigns. Start by creating truly exceptional, linkable content assets—comprehensive guides, original research, or interactive tools that naturally attract references. These resources should address specific pain points in your industry or provide unique insights not available elsewhere. Targeted outreach remains essential for acquiring premium backlinks. Tools like Hunter, mentioned in Databox research, can streamline your outreach process by gathering prospect email addresses efficiently. Track your outreach response rates as part of your link building report to continuously refine your approach and messaging. For SEO agencies, demonstrating the quality of acquired links goes beyond domain metrics. Consider including additional contextual information in your link building reporting, such as: Topic relevance to client’s industry Estimated monthly traffic of linking pages Social engagement metrics of linking domains Editorial standards of linking publications These quality indicators provide clients with a more comprehensive understanding of your link acquisition strategy and value. Remember that a single high-quality, contextually relevant backlink often delivers more value than multiple lower-quality links. Managing and Mitigating Spammy Links Even the most careful link building strategies can attract unwanted backlinks. Proactive link profile monitoring should be a core component of your link building management approach. According to Databox findings, successful SEO professionals regularly audit their backlink profiles to identify potential toxic links before they harm rankings. Implement a systematic process for identifying and addressing problematic links: Conduct regular backlink audits (monthly or quarterly) Flag suspicious links based on quality metrics and relevance Attempt outreach for removal when appropriate Use Google’s Disavow Tool for links that cannot be removed Document all actions in your link building report For clients, explain that some toxic link accumulation is normal and doesn’t indicate a problem with your strategy. Instead, emphasize how your proactive management protects their site from potential penalties. When presenting link metrics, include a “toxicity trend” that shows how your efforts keep harmful links under control over time. SEO agencies should consider including regular backlink audits as a standard service offering. This proactive approach demonstrates value beyond just link acquisition and positions your agency as a comprehensive link building management partner rather than simply a link builder. As search algorithms continue to emphasize quality over quantity, this protective service becomes increasingly valuable to clients concerned about their long-term search visibility. Addressing Common Challenges and FAQs How Long Does It Take to See Improvements in Link Building KPIs? One of the most common questions in link building management is about timeline expectations. The truth is that improvements in link metrics vary widely depending on several factors. Typically, you’ll notice changes in direct link KPIs (like referring domains or backlink counts) immediately, but their impact on authority metrics and rankings often takes longer. For most sites, expect to see meaningful movement in domain authority metrics within 3-6 months of consistent, quality link building. However, competitive niches may require longer timeframes. When creating a link building report for clients or stakeholders, it’s crucial to set realistic expectations about these timelines from the beginning. Several factors influence how quickly you’ll see results: Your site’s existing authority (higher authority sites often see faster impacts) The quality and relevance of acquired links Consistency of link acquisition over time Competitive landscape in your niche According to Databox research, tracking both immediate metrics (new backlinks earned, referring domains) and lagging indicators (domain rating, organic traffic) provides a more complete picture of progress. This approach helps manage expectations while still demonstrating incremental wins along the way. Is It Necessary to Remove Low-Quality Links? Proper backlink hygiene remains essential in 2024’s SEO landscape. While Google has improved its ability to ignore low-quality links rather than penalizing sites for them, proactive management of your link profile is still a best practice in link building reporting. For SEO agencies, regular link audits should be part of your standard service offering. These audits help identify potentially harmful links before they impact client performance. When toxic links are discovered, you have several options: Contact webmasters requesting removal (effective but time-consuming) Use Google’s Disavow Tool (especially for links that can’t be removed) Monitor without action (for borderline cases where disavowal might do more harm than good) The key is developing a consistent process for evaluating link quality. Not every “low-quality” link requires action—focus on truly spammy or manipulative links that could trigger algorithmic or manual penalties. Document your decisions in your link building management system to maintain a clear history of actions taken. Impact of Internal and Social Media Links on KPIs While external backlinks often get the spotlight, internal linking and social media signals play important supporting roles in comprehensive link building strategies. Internal links help distribute page authority throughout your site and establish topical relevance clusters that complement your external link building efforts. In your link building report, consider including internal linking metrics alongside external backlink data. This holistic approach demonstrates how your overall link strategy (both internal and external) works together to improve site authority and user experience. Social media links typically carry “nofollow” attributes, limiting their direct SEO impact. However, they deliver other benefits worth tracking in your link metrics dashboard: Increased content visibility and amplification Potential for attracting natural backlinks from social audiences Direct referral traffic that can lead to conversions Brand awareness and reputation building For SEO agencies, explaining this ecosystem approach helps clients understand how different types of links contribute to overall performance. Tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console can help attribute traffic and engagement from these various link sources. FAQs Link Building Metrics “More links always mean better rankings.” This persistent myth needs addressing in client education. Quality and relevance now far outweigh quantity. A focused strategy targeting fewer, higher-quality links often delivers better results than mass acquisition of mediocre links. “Only follow links matter for SEO.” While follow links pass more direct ranking power, nofollow links still provide brand exposure, referral traffic, and diversification of your link profile. A natural link profile includes both types. “Domain Authority is an official Google metric.” Many clients confuse third-party authority metrics (like Moz’s DA or Ahrefs’ DR) with Google’s actual ranking factors. Explain in your link building reporting that these are useful comparative tools but not direct Google rankings factors. “All link building happens quickly.” Sustainable link building is a marathon, not a sprint. Educate stakeholders that quality link acquisition takes time and rushing typically leads to lower-quality links that deliver less long-term value. “Anchor text should always include keywords.” Excessive keyword-rich anchor text can appear manipulative. A diverse, natural-looking anchor text profile performs better long-term than one over-optimized for keywords. Related Topics for Further Exploration To deepen your link building expertise, consider exploring these related areas: Digital PR for Link Acquisition Public relations strategies increasingly overlap with link building. Techniques like data-driven stories, expert commentary, and newsworthy content can attract high-authority links from media outlets. Content-Driven Link Building Creating linkable assets—comprehensive guides, original research, or interactive tools—can generate passive link acquisition over time. This approach complements active outreach strategies. Technical SEO’s Impact on Link Equity How your site handles redirects, canonicalization, and internal linking directly affects how link equity flows through your site. Technical optimizations can maximize the value of your link building efforts. Competitive Link Analysis Techniques Advanced competitive analysis helps identify link gaps and opportunities. Learning to effectively analyze competitor backlink profiles can reveal valuable strategic insights. Local Link Building Strategies For businesses with physical locations, local link building techniques focused on community relationships and geographic relevance offer unique opportunities. For SEO agencies looking to enhance their link building services, staying current with these evolving topics helps maintain a competitive edge. Consider incorporating educational content about these areas in your client communications and link building reporting to demonstrate your ongoing expertise and value.
