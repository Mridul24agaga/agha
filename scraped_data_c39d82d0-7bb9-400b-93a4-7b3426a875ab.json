Healthcare Organizations Technical Tools and Software for Link Building Implement One New Strategy From This Guide Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Link-Building? Link-building represents a crucial component of modern digital marketing and search engine optimization (SEO). It involves acquiring hyperlinks from other websites that point to your website. A hyperlink, commonly known as a backlink, allows users to navigate between different web pages while helping search engines discover new content and determine page rankings. The Strategic Importance of Link Building: Search engines like Google use links to crawl the web, moving between individual pages and entire websites. During this process, they analyze both the content on pages and the ways pages are linked together. Quality backlinks signal to search engines that other websites vouch for your content, essentially acting as votes of confidence. The Foundation of Quality Content The process starts with creating valuable content on your website that others would naturally want to reference. For example, if you run a cooking website and publish an ultimate guide to baking sourdough bread, other food bloggers, cooking enthusiasts, and even news websites might link to your guide when discussing bread-making techniques. Comparing Quantity vs Quality Backlinks A key feature of effective link building is understanding the difference between high-quality and low-quality links. High-quality links typically come from reputable websites in your industry or related fields. For instance, if a well-known cooking magazine‚Äôs website links to your sourdough guide, that carries more weight than a link from a random, unrelated blog. Think of it like job references‚Äîa recommendation from a respected professional in your field means more than one from someone unfamiliar with your work. Benefits of Link Building It drives direct traffic as people click through these links to visit your site. It helps establish your authority in your field. When multiple respected sources link to your content, you become recognized as a trusted source of information. It improves your visibility in search results, leading to more organic traffic and potential customers. Top 10 Latest Link-Building Strategies (2025) Achieving higher search engine rankings requires more than just creating quality content. Link building has become an essential cornerstone of successful SEO strategies. Let‚Äôs explore the most effective approaches to help your website climb the search engine rankings while building lasting authority in your industry. 1. Creating High-Quality Content Quality content serves as the foundation for successful link-building campaigns. When content provides genuine value, other websites naturally want to reference and link to it. Creating comprehensive guides, original research, industry surveys, and data-driven insights encourage organic link acquisition. Content should address specific pain points, answer common questions, or offer unique perspectives that make others want to cite it as a reliable source. Practical examples of link-worthy content include: Industry research reports with original data Step-by-step tutorials solving common problems Comprehensive guides covering topics exhaustively Original case studies documenting real results Infographics presenting complex data visually Expert interviews offering unique insights 2. Skyscraper Technique The Skyscraper Technique represents an innovative approach to link-building in digital marketing. The strategy involves finding highly successful content, creating substantially better versions, and acquiring backlinks through strategic link building outreach. Core Strategy Components: 1. Content Research and Identification Finding content pieces that have already garnered significant backlinks serves as the foundation. Using analytics tools helps identify content with 50-100 quality referring domains. The chosen content must be relevant to your expertise and audience while offering clear opportunities for improvement. 2. Creating Superior Content The key lies in developing content that‚Äôs significantly better than the original. Simply making content longer isn‚Äôt enough; the focus should be on creating genuine value through: Offering fresh perspectives and insights. Including current data and credible sources. Adding custom visuals and illustrations. Improving readability and structure. Addressing search intent effectively. 3. Strategic Outreach Process The final step involves contacting websites linking to the original content. The focus stays on reaching editors and writers who have editorial control. Personalized outreach emails should: Remain brief and focused Reference specific details from their content Highlight unique improvements in your version Make linking suggestions easy to implement Maintain a polite, non-demanding tone The Skyscraper Technique remains valuable when properly executed with a focus on quality content creation and strategic outreach. Success requires patience, dedication to excellence, and genuine relationship-building within your industry. While the strategy has evolved since its introduction, its core principle of creating superior content continues to drive results in modern SEO practices. 3. Building Relationships with Influencers and Media Connecting with industry influencers and journalists creates valuable link-building opportunities. Start by following relevant professionals on social media, engaging meaningfully with their content, and sharing their work. When reaching out, focus on building genuine relationships rather than immediately requesting links. Share unique insights or data that add value to their work. Journalists often seek expert sources for stories, so positioning yourself as a reliable industry expert can lead to natural link acquisitions. For example, a successful example involves a fitness equipment company that: Follow relevant fitness influencers on social media. Engaged meaningfully with their content for several months. Shared original research about exercise equipment usage. Get featured in influencers‚Äô content with backlinks. Maintained relationships through regular interaction. 4. Maximizing Guest Blogging Opportunities Guest blogging remains effective when approached strategically. Focus on finding reputable websites in your industry that accept guest posts. Study their content guidelines carefully and pitch unique topics that align with their audience‚Äôs interests. Quality guest posts should provide genuine value rather than merely serving as link vehicles. Include relevant internal links within the content where they naturally fit, and maintain a professional writing style that matches the host site‚Äôs tone. Example Pitch Structure: An introduction showing familiarity with the site. Proposed topic with outline. Writer credentials and previous work samples. Potential value for their audience. Content Creation: Match the host site‚Äôs style and tone. Include relevant statistics and research. Add value beyond basic information. Include natural, relevant internal links. 5. Establishing Relevant Website Connections Building links from websites within your industry or related fields strengthens your link profile. Consider reaching out to industry partners, suppliers, or complementary businesses for collaboration opportunities. Create case studies featuring successful client partnerships, which often result in natural backlinks. Directory listings in industry-specific directories can also provide relevant links, though focus on quality directories rather than submitting to every available option. 6. Leveraging Social Media Presence While social media links typically don‚Äôt directly impact search rankings, a strong social presence increases content visibility and link-building opportunities. Share valuable content consistently across platforms where your target audience engages. Encourage content sharing and engagement through strategic posting times and compelling descriptions. When content gains traction on social media, it often leads to natural backlinks from others who discover and reference it. Engagement Optimization: Post during peak audience hours Use engaging visuals with content Include clear calls-to-action Respond promptly to comments 7. Implementing Broken Link Building Broken link building involves finding broken links on other websites and suggesting your content as a replacement. Start by identifying relevant pages in your industry with potential broken links using tools like Ahrefs or Check My Links. When finding broken links, create or identify existing content that would serve as a suitable replacement. Contact website owners with a helpful approach, pointing out the broken link and suggesting your content as a valuable alternative. Outreach Process: Email subject: ‚ÄúBroken link on your resources page.‚Äù Mention specific broken link locations. Suggest replacement content. Offer additional value or resources. Example Success Rates: Higher success with personalized outreach. Better results from recent broken links. Improved response from smaller sites. 8. Analyzing Competitor Backlinks Studying competitor backlink profiles reveals valuable link-building opportunities. Use tools like SEMrush or Ahrefs to analyze where competitors obtain their backlinks. Look for guest posting opportunities, directory listings, or partnership possibilities they have leveraged. While some links may not be replicable, understanding competitors‚Äô successful strategies helps inform your link-building approach. Research Phase: Identify top-ranking competitors Analyze their backlink profiles Categorize link types Assess link quality and relevance Implementation: Create similar but improved content Reach out to the same linking websites Develop better resource pages Improve upon competitor strategies 9. Implementing Local SEO Tactics Local businesses should focus on building location-specific links. Create profiles on local business directories, chamber of commerce websites, and industry-specific local directories. Participate in local events or sponsor community activities to earn local press coverage and backlinks. Develop content focused on local topics or issues to attract links from other local businesses and organizations. 10. Running Strategic Contests and Giveaways Well-planned contests can generate backlinks while engaging your target audience. Design contests that encourage content creation or social sharing, naturally leading to backlinks as participants share and discuss the contest. Ensure prizes appeal to your target audience while aligning with your brand. Partner with other businesses or influencers to expand reach and create additional link-building opportunities. Success in link-building requires patience, consistent effort, and a focus on quality over quantity. Monitor results regularly using analytics tools to understand which strategies generate the most valuable links. Adjust approaches based on performance data while focusing on creating genuine value for your target audience. Remember that sustainable link building focuses on earning links naturally through valuable content and meaningful relationships rather than quick artificial gains. Anchor Text Importance in Link Building Anchor text plays a crucial role in conveying relevance to search engines. While optimizing anchor text, maintain a natural mix of branded, naked URLs, generic phrases, and exact-match keywords. For example, instead of repeatedly using ‚Äúbest marketing strategies‚Äù as anchor text, vary it with phrases like ‚Äúlearn more about marketing,‚Äù ‚Äúmarketing guide,‚Äù or your brand name. Natural anchor text variation helps avoid over-optimization penalties while maintaining ranking potential. Maintaining natural variation prevents over-optimization while preserving ranking potential. For example, a healthy anchor text profile might include: 40% branded anchors 25% naked URLs 20% generic phrases 10% partial match keywords 5% exact match keywords Modern Link-Building Techniques for Different Businesses Link building isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all approach. Different business types require unique strategies that align with their goals, target audience, and industry dynamics. Understanding these distinctions helps create more effective and targeted link-building campaigns. 1. E-commerce Businesses Product Review Programs Online retailers can establish strong link profiles through strategic product review programs. For instance, a natural skincare brand might partner with beauty bloggers and wellness websites to review their products. These collaborations result in authentic content creation and natural link placement within detailed product reviews. 2. Local Service Businesses Community Engagement Local businesses thrive on community connections. A restaurant can build links by participating in local food festivals, charity events, or neighborhood initiatives. Local news websites, event directories, and community blogs often cover these activities, creating valuable local backlinks. Professional Directories Service-based businesses benefit from strategic placement in industry-specific directories. A law firm, for example, should maintain updated profiles on legal directories, chamber of commerce websites, and professional association platforms.

What are the most effective link-building strategies? A1. The most effective link-building strategies include creating high-quality, shareable content that naturally attracts backlinks through its value. Guest posting on reputable industry websites helps establish authority while building relevant links. Building relationships with influencers and journalists can lead to natural media mentions and backlinks. Broken link building identifies opportunities to replace dead links with your content. Analyzing competitor backlinks reveals valuable link-building opportunities. Local SEO efforts, including community involvement and local directory listings, strengthen regional presence. Strategic content partnerships and collaborative projects with industry peers create mutual link-building opportunities. Finally, maintaining active social media engagement increases content visibility and natural link acquisition. Q2. How do you scale your link-building strategies for SEO? A2. To scale link-building effectively, implement systematic processes and leverage automation tools while maintaining quality. Start by creating a content calendar focused on linkable assets like research reports, industry studies, and data visualizations. Use tools like Ahrefs or Moz to identify high-potential link opportunities and track competitors‚Äô backlink profiles. Q3. Is link building a one-time activity? A3. No, link-building must be an ongoing, strategic effort. Search algorithms continually evolve, and competitors actively build new links, making it crucial to maintain consistent link acquisition. Additionally, some backlinks naturally decay over time as pages get removed or websites shut down. A sustainable link-building strategy requires regular content creation, relationship nurturing, and monitoring of link health. Success comes from viewing link building as a continuous process of earning and maintaining quality backlinks rather than a one-off campaign. Q4. Is paid link building an effective strategy? A4. Paid link building can be effective when done strategically, but it carries risks. While high-quality backlinks from reputable sites can boost search rankings and referral traffic, Google explicitly prohibits buying links to manipulate PageRank. Getting caught can result in severe penalties or deindexing. Instead, focus on earning links naturally through valuable content, relationship building, and digital PR. If pursuing paid links, prioritize relevant industry sites, use no-follow attributes, and maintain a diverse link profile. The investment might be better spent on creating link-worthy content and outreach. Q5. How do I use link-building to improve my SEO? A5.

Reach out to relevant websites through personalized emails proposing collaborations. Consider guest posting on authoritative industry blogs. Fix broken links on other sites by suggesting your content as a replacement. Q7. How can I measure the success of my link-building campaign? A7. Track key metrics, including domain authority of referring sites, organic traffic growth, search rankings for target keywords, and referral traffic. Monitor the ratio of do-follow vs. no-follow links, anchor text diversity, and topical relevance of linking domains. Use tools like Ahrefs, Semrush, or Moz to analyze competitor backlink profiles and identify new opportunities. Regular backlink audits help maintain link quality and identify toxic links. Q8. What are the potential risks of aggressive link-building in 2025? A8. Aggressive link building can trigger Google penalties if it appears manipulative. Risks include over-optimization of anchor text, acquiring links from low-quality or irrelevant sites, and using paid links without proper disclosure. Google‚Äôs AI algorithms are becoming more sophisticated at detecting unnatural link patterns. Focus on sustainable, white-hat techniques that prioritize user value and topical relevance over quick wins.

Healthcare Organizations Technical Tools and Software for Link Building Implement One New Strategy From This Guide Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Link-Building? Link-building represents a crucial component of modern digital marketing and search engine optimization (SEO). It involves acquiring hyperlinks from other websites that point to your website. A hyperlink, commonly known as a backlink, allows users to navigate between different web pages while helping search engines discover new content and determine page rankings. The Strategic Importance of Link Building: Search engines like Google use links to crawl the web, moving between individual pages and entire websites. During this process, they analyze both the content on pages and the ways pages are linked together. Quality backlinks signal to search engines that other websites vouch for your content, essentially acting as votes of confidence. The Foundation of Quality Content The process starts with creating valuable content on your website that others would naturally want to reference. For example, if you run a cooking website and publish an ultimate guide to baking sourdough bread, other food bloggers, cooking enthusiasts, and even news websites might link to your guide when discussing bread-making techniques. Comparing Quantity vs Quality Backlinks A key feature of effective link building is understanding the difference between high-quality and low-quality links. High-quality links typically come from reputable websites in your industry or related fields. For instance, if a well-known cooking magazine‚Äôs website links to your sourdough guide, that carries more weight than a link from a random, unrelated blog. Think of it like job references‚Äîa recommendation from a respected professional in your field means more than one from someone unfamiliar with your work. Benefits of Link Building It drives direct traffic as people click through these links to visit your site. It helps establish your authority in your field. When multiple respected sources link to your content, you become recognized as a trusted source of information. It improves your visibility in search results, leading to more organic traffic and potential customers. Top 10 Latest Link-Building Strategies (2025) Achieving higher search engine rankings requires more than just creating quality content. Link building has become an essential cornerstone of successful SEO strategies. Let‚Äôs explore the most effective approaches to help your website climb the search engine rankings while building lasting authority in your industry. 1. Creating High-Quality Content Quality content serves as the foundation for successful link-building campaigns. When content provides genuine value, other websites naturally want to reference and link to it. Creating comprehensive guides, original research, industry surveys, and data-driven insights encourage organic link acquisition. Content should address specific pain points, answer common questions, or offer unique perspectives that make others want to cite it as a reliable source. Practical examples of link-worthy content include: Industry research reports with original data Step-by-step tutorials solving common problems Comprehensive guides covering topics exhaustively Original case studies documenting real results Infographics presenting complex data visually Expert interviews offering unique insights 2. Skyscraper Technique The Skyscraper Technique represents an innovative approach to link-building in digital marketing. The strategy involves finding highly successful content, creating substantially better versions, and acquiring backlinks through strategic link building outreach. Core Strategy Components: 1. Content Research and Identification Finding content pieces that have already garnered significant backlinks serves as the foundation. Using analytics tools helps identify content with 50-100 quality referring domains. The chosen content must be relevant to your expertise and audience while offering clear opportunities for improvement. 2. Creating Superior Content The key lies in developing content that‚Äôs significantly better than the original. Simply making content longer isn‚Äôt enough; the focus should be on creating genuine value through: Offering fresh perspectives and insights. Including current data and credible sources. Adding custom visuals and illustrations. Improving readability and structure. Addressing search intent effectively. 3. Strategic Outreach Process The final step involves contacting websites linking to the original content. The focus stays on reaching editors and writers who have editorial control. Personalized outreach emails should: Remain brief and focused Reference specific details from their content Highlight unique improvements in your version Make linking suggestions easy to implement Maintain a polite, non-demanding tone The Skyscraper Technique remains valuable when properly executed with a focus on quality content creation and strategic outreach. Success requires patience, dedication to excellence, and genuine relationship-building within your industry. While the strategy has evolved since its introduction, its core principle of creating superior content continues to drive results in modern SEO practices. 3. Building Relationships with Influencers and Media Connecting with industry influencers and journalists creates valuable link-building opportunities. Start by following relevant professionals on social media, engaging meaningfully with their content, and sharing their work. When reaching out, focus on building genuine relationships rather than immediately requesting links. Share unique insights or data that add value to their work. Journalists often seek expert sources for stories, so positioning yourself as a reliable industry expert can lead to natural link acquisitions. For example, a successful example involves a fitness equipment company that: Follow relevant fitness influencers on social media. Engaged meaningfully with their content for several months. Shared original research about exercise equipment usage. Get featured in influencers‚Äô content with backlinks. Maintained relationships through regular interaction. 4. Maximizing Guest Blogging Opportunities Guest blogging remains effective when approached strategically. Focus on finding reputable websites in your industry that accept guest posts. Study their content guidelines carefully and pitch unique topics that align with their audience‚Äôs interests. Quality guest posts should provide genuine value rather than merely serving as link vehicles. Include relevant internal links within the content where they naturally fit, and maintain a professional writing style that matches the host site‚Äôs tone. Example Pitch Structure: An introduction showing familiarity with the site. Proposed topic with outline. Writer credentials and previous work samples. Potential value for their audience. Content Creation: Match the host site‚Äôs style and tone. Include relevant statistics and research. Add value beyond basic information. Include natural, relevant internal links. 5. Establishing Relevant Website Connections Building links from websites within your industry or related fields strengthens your link profile. Consider reaching out to industry partners, suppliers, or complementary businesses for collaboration opportunities. Create case studies featuring successful client partnerships, which often result in natural backlinks. Directory listings in industry-specific directories can also provide relevant links, though focus on quality directories rather than submitting to every available option. 6. Leveraging Social Media Presence While social media links typically don‚Äôt directly impact search rankings, a strong social presence increases content visibility and link-building opportunities. Share valuable content consistently across platforms where your target audience engages. Encourage content sharing and engagement through strategic posting times and compelling descriptions. When content gains traction on social media, it often leads to natural backlinks from others who discover and reference it. Engagement Optimization: Post during peak audience hours Use engaging visuals with content Include clear calls-to-action Respond promptly to comments 7. Implementing Broken Link Building Broken link building involves finding broken links on other websites and suggesting your content as a replacement. Start by identifying relevant pages in your industry with potential broken links using tools like Ahrefs or Check My Links. When finding broken links, create or identify existing content that would serve as a suitable replacement. Contact website owners with a helpful approach, pointing out the broken link and suggesting your content as a valuable alternative. Outreach Process: Email subject: ‚ÄúBroken link on your resources page.‚Äù Mention specific broken link locations. Suggest replacement content. Offer additional value or resources. Example Success Rates: Higher success with personalized outreach. Better results from recent broken links. Improved response from smaller sites. 8. Analyzing Competitor Backlinks Studying competitor backlink profiles reveals valuable link-building opportunities. Use tools like SEMrush or Ahrefs to analyze where competitors obtain their backlinks. Look for guest posting opportunities, directory listings, or partnership possibilities they have leveraged. While some links may not be replicable, understanding competitors‚Äô successful strategies helps inform your link-building approach. Research Phase: Identify top-ranking competitors Analyze their backlink profiles Categorize link types Assess link quality and relevance Implementation: Create similar but improved content Reach out to the same linking websites Develop better resource pages Improve upon competitor strategies 9. Implementing Local SEO Tactics Local businesses should focus on building location-specific links. Create profiles on local business directories, chamber of commerce websites, and industry-specific local directories. Participate in local events or sponsor community activities to earn local press coverage and backlinks. Develop content focused on local topics or issues to attract links from other local businesses and organizations. 10. Running Strategic Contests and Giveaways Well-planned contests can generate backlinks while engaging your target audience. Design contests that encourage content creation or social sharing, naturally leading to backlinks as participants share and discuss the contest. Ensure prizes appeal to your target audience while aligning with your brand. Partner with other businesses or influencers to expand reach and create additional link-building opportunities. Success in link-building requires patience, consistent effort, and a focus on quality over quantity. Monitor results regularly using analytics tools to understand which strategies generate the most valuable links. Adjust approaches based on performance data while focusing on creating genuine value for your target audience. Remember that sustainable link building focuses on earning links naturally through valuable content and meaningful relationships rather than quick artificial gains. Anchor Text Importance in Link Building Anchor text plays a crucial role in conveying relevance to search engines. While optimizing anchor text, maintain a natural mix of branded, naked URLs, generic phrases, and exact-match keywords. For example, instead of repeatedly using ‚Äúbest marketing strategies‚Äù as anchor text, vary it with phrases like ‚Äúlearn more about marketing,‚Äù ‚Äúmarketing guide,‚Äù or your brand name. Natural anchor text variation helps avoid over-optimization penalties while maintaining ranking potential. Maintaining natural variation prevents over-optimization while preserving ranking potential. For example, a healthy anchor text profile might include: 40% branded anchors 25% naked URLs 20% generic phrases 10% partial match keywords 5% exact match keywords Modern Link-Building Techniques for Different Businesses Link building isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all approach. Different business types require unique strategies that align with their goals, target audience, and industry dynamics. Understanding these distinctions helps create more effective and targeted link-building campaigns. 1. E-commerce Businesses Product Review Programs Online retailers can establish strong link profiles through strategic product review programs. For instance, a natural skincare brand might partner with beauty bloggers and wellness websites to review their products. These collaborations result in authentic content creation and natural link placement within detailed product reviews. 2. Local Service Businesses Community Engagement Local businesses thrive on community connections. A restaurant can build links by participating in local food festivals, charity events, or neighborhood initiatives. Local news websites, event directories, and community blogs often cover these activities, creating valuable local backlinks. Professional Directories Service-based businesses benefit from strategic placement in industry-specific directories. A law firm, for example, should maintain updated profiles on legal directories, chamber of commerce websites, and professional association platforms. These links help establish local authority and improve geographic relevance. 3. B2B Companies Industry Research and Reports Business-to-business companies can generate links through original research and data reports. A software company might publish an annual report on industry trends, creating link-worthy content that trade publications, news outlets, and industry blogs frequently reference. Expert Contributions B2B leaders can build authority through expert contributions to industry publications. A marketing agency‚Äôs CEO might write guest articles for prominent marketing websites or contribute expert quotes for industry news stories, naturally earning high-quality backlinks. 4. Educational Institutions Academic Partnerships Schools and universities can build links through academic collaborations. When an institution partners with industry organizations for research projects, both parties often link to shared resources and project outcomes on their respective websites. Student Success Stories Educational institutions can earn links by highlighting student achievements. When a graduate launches a successful startup or wins an award, industry news sites and local media often cover the story, creating natural linking opportunities. 5. Healthcare Organizations Health Resource Centers Medical practices and healthcare organizations can build links by creating comprehensive health resource centers. A dental practice might develop an extensive guide about oral health care, attracting links from health websites, parenting blogs, and educational resources.

While many businesses struggle to acquire quality backlinks, the biggest and most successful SEO agencies have mastered the art and science of backlink acquisition. Here, we'll explore these agencies' strategies and provide actionable insights to help you replicate their success. How do website SEO services do it? Let's find out. üì≤ Do you need a reliable SEO company to increase your website authority? Schedule a Call with Speck Designs. üìû 1. Content Creation and Promotion Content is the foundation of any backlink strategy. High-quality, valuable content attracts links naturally. Leading agencies prioritize creating content that is relevant to the target audience, shareable, and link-worthy. Example: An agency working for a financial services client may create a detailed infographic about \"The History of Cryptocurrency.\" This visually appealing, data-rich content will likely be picked up by finance bloggers and news outlets, earning backlinks. SEO Steps: Conduct thorough keyword research to identify trending topics. Use tools like BuzzSumo to find popular content in your niche. Promote content through email outreach, social media, and online communities. 2. Guest Blogging on Authority Sites Guest blogging remains a powerful tool for earning high-quality backlinks. The top agencies identify relevant, high-authority websites and pitch compelling article ideas. Example: For a client in the health niche, an agency may pitch a blog titled \"10 Superfoods That Boost Immunity\" to a popular health and wellness website. In return, they include a backlink to the client's site within the article. SEO Steps: Use tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush to find websites with strong domain authority. Craft personalized pitches tailored to each website's audience. Ensure the content adds value and includes a natural link to your client's site. 3. Building Resource Pages Resource pages are curated lists of helpful links on specific topics. Successful agencies reach out to websites that maintain these pages and suggest their client's content as a valuable addition. Example: An agency representing a travel company might approach a resource page titled \"Top Tools for Planning Your Next Vacation\" and suggest adding their client's trip-planning app. Key Steps: Search for resource pages using \"in title: resources + [keyword].\" Contact the page owner with a polite and concise email. Highlight why your client's resource deserves inclusion. 4. Broken Link Building Broken link building involves identifying broken links on websites and suggesting your client's content as a replacement. It's a win-win strategy: the site owner fixes a broken link, and you gain a backlink. Example: Suppose an agency notices that a popular food blog has a broken link to a recipe. They can suggest a similar recipe to their client's. Key Steps: Use tools like Check My Links or Screaming Frog to find broken links. Create or identify content that matches the broken link's topic. Craft a helpful email pointing out the issue and offering your solution. 5. Skyscraper Technique The skyscraper technique involves finding popular content in your niche, creating an even better version, and reaching out to websites linked to the original content. Example: An agency finds a widely shared article titled \"Top 10 Tips for Digital Marketing Success.\" They create a more comprehensive version, \"Top 20 Tips for Digital Marketing Success,\" with updated insights and better visuals. Key Steps: Identify high-performing content using tools like Ahrefs or BuzzSumo. Enhance the content with additional details, visuals, or data. Reach out to sites linking to the original content and pitch your improved version. 6. Collaborations and Partnerships Successful agencies often collaborate with influencers, bloggers, and other businesses to earn backlinks. These partnerships can include co-created content, sponsored posts, or product reviews. Example: An agency working for a tech company may partner with a prominent tech influencer to review their latest gadget. The influencer's blog post links back to the company's product page. Key Steps: Identify potential collaborators in your niche. Propose mutually beneficial partnerships. Ensure transparency and compliance with search engine guidelines. 7. Digital PR Campaigns Digital PR focuses on earning media coverage and backlinks through newsworthy stories or campaigns. Top agencies craft press releases, create viral content or conduct studies to attract attention. Example: An agency representing an e-commerce client might survey \"Holiday Shopping Habits\" and share the findings with significant publications, earning backlinks from news outlets. Key Steps: Develop unique and compelling story angles. Target journalists and publications that cover your niche. Distribute press releases through platforms like PR Newswire. 8. Leveraging Social Media and Communities Social media platforms and online communities can amplify content reach and attract backlinks. Successful agencies share client content strategically and engage with relevant communities. Example: An agency promoting a client's fitness blog may share their posts in Facebook groups dedicated to health enthusiasts, sparking discussions that lead to organic backlinks. Key Steps: Identify active communities on platforms like Reddit, Quora, or niche forums. Share valuable content without being overly promotional. Engage with community members to build trust and relationships. 9. HARO (Help a Reporter Out) HARO connects journalists with sources for their stories. Agencies use this platform to pitch their clients as experts, earning backlinks from reputable media outlets. Example: A journalist writing about \"Sustainable Fashion\" may request expert insights. An agency representing an eco-friendly clothing brand can respond with a quote, securing a backlink in the article. Key Steps: Sign up for HARO and monitor relevant queries. Respond quickly with concise, well-crafted pitches. Highlight your client's expertise and relevance. 10. Monitoring Competitor Backlinks Successful agencies study their clients' competitors to identify backlink opportunities. By analyzing competitor link profiles, they uncover strategies and websites to target. Example: If a popular industry forum links a competitor's blog post, an agency can approach the forum to feature their client's similar (or better) post. Key Steps: Use tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush to analyze competitor backlinks. Identify websites that link to multiple competitors. Develop tailored outreach strategies for these sites. Key Takeaways Backlink acquisition is a critical component of SEO success. By leveraging strategies such as content creation, guest blogging, broken link building, and digital PR, the most prominent agencies consistently deliver results for their clients.

How to Analyze a Site? Link Building Strategies That Work Tools that Help in Link Building Link Building: A Case Study From Stan Ventures Link Building Tactics You Should Avoid Backlinks are a must-have to improve your online visibility, drive more web traffic and position your website at the top of search engine results. In short, backlinks come in handy when you want to increase the authority of your website in the eyes of search engine giants like Google. Search engines discover new content via links and also leverage them as a parameter to determine the content quality. So, how does that work? Google considers a high-quality contextual backlink as a vote of confidence that testifies how worthy the content is. That said, it isn‚Äôt a surprise that link building remains one of the crucial search engine ranking factors. A targeted strategy often makes things easier and link building is no exception. Yes, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you are a beginner or a pro, you need a definitive link building strategy in place to achieve significant results. If not, your link-building efforts may end up a disaster. Worry not! If you understand the what, why, how, dos and don‚Äôts of link building, it isn‚Äôt tough to crack the hard nut. Let me walk you through link building and its aspects one step at a time. What is Link Building? Professional link building is the practice of gaining links from one or more websites to your own. These links help users navigate from one web page to the other to access more information relevant to their search on the internet. As for search engines, links make way for the bots to crawl, index, and rank web pages. Why is Link Building Important for SEO? Link building is one of the most powerful ways to get high-authority, niche-specific websites to vouch for your site. With an effective link acquisition strategy, you can build a bold and illustrative backlink profile. Based on the robustness of the link profile you create, your website can enamor Google‚Äôs algorithm and achieve higher rankings. Link building, despite all the rumor-mongering happening, is something you cannot overlook when optimizing your website for SEO. Spoiler Alert: Building a healthy link profile doesn‚Äôt happen overnight. White hat link building for SEO takes time, but it is always worth it. When you put in targeted and genuine efforts toward link building, it gets paid off with long-lasting results. That‚Äôs the gist of it. The concept of links is cardinal to how Google search works. Its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin came up with the beautiful concept of PageRank. PageRank algorithm helps Google identify new pages and rank them based on quality signals. So, what this means is that Google‚Äôs core algorithm weighs backlinks as one of the top-ranking factors, and ignoring it could bring a website‚Äôs growth to a standstill. How to Build Links? Now that you know how link building can complement your website‚Äôs SEO, it‚Äôs time to learn how to build links. So, let‚Äôs delve into it. Broadly speaking, link building happens in three ways: 1. Requesting for Links Do you want to link back to your website from a specific website? The best thing to do is request the website owner for a backlink. However, you need to make sure that linking back to the website fetches you benefits in terms of web traffic and authority. Here‚Äôs what you need to remember. The website has to be related to your industry/niche. The website should be credible and exhibit great performance. Craft a genuinely compelling email pitch to convenience the website owner to accept a backlink placement to your website. 2. Earning Links Earning links is when other website owners link back to your website without you contacting them regarding backlinks. This often happens when you feature high-quality, user-engaging content on your website that your target audience and industry experts find useful. As per Google Webmaster Guidelines, ‚ÄúCreating good content pays off: Links are usually editorial votes given by choice, and the more useful content you have, the greater the chances someone else will find that content valuable to their readers and link to it.‚Äù Earning backlinks to your website is the biggest reward and a clear sign that your link-building efforts are actually working. 3. Buying Links Buying links is yet another way to secure link placements in top-performing sites. When it comes to buying backlinks, you need to be quite choosy about the sites you pick as you are investing some money to make more of it. Make sure you follow a metric-specific approach to narrow down top sites from your niche to build backlinks. Once that‚Äôs done, get in touch with the website owner with a well-crafted email to gain backlink placements on a commercial basis. If you find the process time-consuming, you can avail the assistance of a trusted link-building service provider to purchase links from relevant sites on your behalf. Key Elements to Evaluate Link Prospects Before thinking about how to find backlink placements, you need to narrow down sites that suit your link building needs. That‚Äôs why you should consider the following elements related to host sites when you invest in link building for SEO. Content: Written and visual content for blogs, web pages, etc. Admin: Do they have advertising policies in place? Link Profile: What do the links pointing to the site look like? Reputation: Does the author have any reputation? Authorship: Who is responsible for the website content? Technical: How do users find and engage with the site? In addition to these metrics, you need to conduct your own manual research and backlink quality analysis to get an even deeper understanding of your link-building prospects. Metric Vs. Quality Understanding metrics and quality can help you set up link-building success. Certain metrics from top SEO tools can help evaluate a site for link-building prospects much easier. They are: Ahrefs Domain Rating. Moz Page Authority. Moz Domain Authority. Moz Page Authority. Majestic Trust Flow. Majestic Citation Flow. Majestic Trust Flow. SEMrushAuthority Score. Verve Link Score. In addition to these metrics, you need to conduct your own manual research to get an even deeper understanding of your link-building prospects. Quality The search quality raters guidelines by Google have dedicated a section for Overall Page Quality Rating that you can follow as well. It can help you cover the purpose of the content, the depth of the content, and find out credible sources for the content. How to Analyze a Site? As you go through the evaluation process, there are two important things to keep in mind: Weight Each Element Some aspects of the site are more important than others. Examine multiple elements that decide the site quality Here are the key elements to consider during the assessment: Content Commercial links: Check if there are links to money pages. Find whether links are not tagged with no follow or sponsor Navigation: Is it too generic for the site? Restricted Keywords: Check if the site uses gambling, payday loan, or pornographic keywords Infrequency: Does the website post infrequently, or are the old posts rarely updated? Admin About Us: Find if the links point to money pages Admin Pages: Find pages that directly advertise dofollow links in guest posts and avoid them at all costs Info: Phone number, address, and email Link Profile Excess links: See if too many links are pointing to a single page Low Authority: Find the site‚Äôs Domain Authority and Domain Rating using SEO tools Non-relevant links: Discover if there are links that don‚Äôt make sense for the page Authorship Byline: Is the byline set to the site name or the admin? Author Page Info: Is the information about the author incomplete? Nationality: Is the author from your target country or not? If you are dealing with YMYL pages, you have to be more stringent about the author‚Äôs reputation. Reputation Online presence: Does the website has a good social media presence Followers: What type of accounts are following the brand Engagement: Does the page have enough engagement? Technical Indexed: Does the website exist in Google‚Äôs index with more than just the home page? Geo: What is the focus of the audience‚Äôs country? Page Engagement: Does the site have ads and links within pages? Link Building Strategies That Work The strategy you devise is the major driving factor behind your link-building outcomes. So, here is a look at the top white hat link building strategies you can harness to achieve desired results. 1. Ultimate Guides Ultimate Guides usually cover in-depth information about a specific topic and comprise several subheadings, illustrations, and super-long content. Since Ultimate Guides provide users access to massive information in one place, they can be a go-to choice to earn backlinks. 2. Listicles Listicles or list posts are posts that feature a numbered list of facts, techniques, tips, reasons and so much more. Packed in chunks, these posts contain information that delivers value to the users. After analyzing 1 million pieces of content, BuzzSumo has arrived at the conclusion that list posts generate far more backlinks than other forms of content, including infographics, quizzes, and more. 3. Resource Page Link Building So, what are Resource Pages? Resource Pages are pages that contain a curated list of resources that solely link back to informative content from multiple websites. The more the number of backlinks on a page, the more authoritative it is. Resource page link building is a practice where you link back to your website from a resource page. Your chances of gaining link placements in resource pages depend heavily on the quality of your content. You can find resource pages easily by using the following Google search strings. ‚ÄúKeyword‚Äù + inurl:links ‚ÄúKeyword‚Äù + ‚Äúhelpful resources‚Äù ‚ÄúKeyword‚Äù + ‚Äúuseful resources‚Äù ‚ÄúKeyword‚Äù + ‚Äúuseful links‚Äù Let‚Äôs say your niche is medicine. You can use medicine in the keyword field followed by one of the above Google search strings. Once you have the resource pages, you need to find out if a particular resource page is suitable for your link-building purposes. Not everyone has the same link-building needs. You can use metrics such as page authority, domain authority, the web traffic of the page/domain to decide if a given resource page is the right fit for you. This will give you the ideal site for your resource page link-building process. Look for content that is worth linking back to from the resource page. Finally, draft an email stating how your content can be a valuable addition to the resource page and ask the website owner to link back to your site. 4. Broken Link Building Broken link building is a unique link building strategy. While other link building strategies are about asking people for backlinks, broken link building makes way for you to help add value to somebody‚Äôs website. So, how to get backlinks using this strategy? The first step is to identify broken links in a website. Install either Check My Links or LinkMiner chrome extension. Not sure which website to check for broken links? Pick a page with more links. If there are many links, it‚Äôs likely that one or more of them are broken. That‚Äôs the idea. A resource page from your niche should be the best fit. After all, it is fully loaded with links. You can use the Chrome extension to weed out broken links in the page easily. Finally, send the website owner a mail highlighting the broken links that you identified and suggest replacing the link with yours. 5. Guest Blogging Guest blogging is never out of trend. It is, of course, one of the classic link building methods. Use a search string such as ‚Äúwrite for us‚Äù + keyword to find blogs and websites that currently accept guest posts in your niche. Run through the search results and shortlist the ones that are right for you. Use the contact form or email address to initiate a formal conversation asking for a guest post opportunity with backlink placement. Unfortunately, guest post opportunities aren‚Äôt available just for you but also for your competitors. Make sure you stand out from the crowd every step of the way. Getting professional assistance from a trusted guest blogging service provider can take the burden off your shoulders and help you achieve desired results to outperform the other players in your industry. 6. Blogger Outreach Blogger outreach is one of the best strategies to build your backlink profile. You would have received outreach emails too. Doubt that? Check the spam folder of your mailbox. You will likely find at least a few outreach emails in there, only that they failed to grab your attention. If you‚Äôre wondering why these emails are dropped straight into the spam box, it‚Äôs because they may not be relevant to you. Suppose you run a website that specializes in e-commerce. An email targeting finance experts and investors is certainly not your cup of tea. That‚Äôs why your outreach campaigns should be targeting the right people. Your link success depends on it as well. In fact, outreach emails witness a response rate of only 10%, while the other 90% of them go unanswered. Having said that, if you want your outreach emails answered, you need to keep yourself updated about the latest outreach techniques and master them. Are you still using standard/traditional email templates for your outreach purposes? If your answer is yes, then it‚Äôs high time to break away. Let me tell you how to switch to non-conventional email outreach. Draft 100% personalized and original emails. Leverage your unique brand voice. Apart from increasing the response rate for your outreach campaigns, these emails also help you create a positive outlook toward your brand. So, who do you start with? Trustworthiness is the lifeline of blogger outreach. Start with people who trust you and are already aware of your business. They may include Your industry partners. People who have subscribed to your newsletter. People who have mentioned your links or brand name in their content. Bloggers/influencers who are connected with you on social media. Who else do you reach out to? Look for people who share something in common with you. For instance, you can reach out to bloggers who share a similar customer base. Link placement in niche-specific blogs can drive qualified leads and help you achieve more tractions for your business. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and others are also ideal to find people whose interests are similar to yours. Do you think outreach is eating up too much of your time? That‚Äôs why Stan Ventures shortlists sites based on 25+ link building metrics and offers a genuine blogger outreach service to help you earn high-quality backlinks seamlessly. 7. Unlinked Brand Mentions Every business gets its brand mentioned somewhere on the internet. These brand mentions need not necessarily be linked back to the corresponding website. Why not use your unlinked brand mentions to your link-building advantage? Yes, you can translate unlinked brand mentions to gain backlink placements across websites with minimal effort in the right direction. Use a brand monitoring tool like Semrush to keep track of your brand mentions across the internet. Once you find people who have mentioned your brand name in their web space, reach out to them and ask for backlink placements. However, you need to ensure that these links add value to the visitors of the corresponding domain. That way, the link juice is rightly passed on, having a positive impact on your website‚Äôs authority. 8. Podcast Links Links are everywhere. You just need to have a keen eye for them. What if I told you you could get backlinks without writing content or initiating outreach campaigns? It‚Äôs definitely possible. All it takes is one word: Podcasts. You just have to show up and talk about things you know and you get a link just like that. A podcast can be about anything, as long as it adds value to the listeners. Talk about something your target audience wants to learn and you get the job done without lifting your finger. 9. HARO Links HARO or Help A Reporter Out is an ideal place for you to connect with big shots from high authority, trusted websites. Once you sign up, you start receiving emails on a daily basis. Set a time frame, say, 30 to 45 minutes every day and look for queries within your expertise and respond to them. If your answer gets featured, you get a link placement on a high-authority website. It isn‚Äôt a sure-shot that your answers will be cited, but when it happens, the impact will be high. That‚Äôs how HARO links bolster your SEO efforts. 10. Infographic & Image Link Building Visual assets such as infographics, images, and diagrams make way for seamless link building. They present huge chunks of information in a comprehensive way. Users are fond of visual assets as well. So, how do infographics and images simplify link building? Let‚Äôs say you include a graph or chart on one of your web pages. Every time someone shares the graph, you automatically get a link from their website to your own. From this standpoint, visual assets hold greater good for link building than text-based content. 11. Getting competitor‚Äôs links using tools like AHREFs Link Intersect feature Did you know your competitors can help you strengthen your backlink profile? Here‚Äôs how: If a website links back to one or more of your competitors, chances are they can link back to your site. So, how do you find these sites that link back to your competitors? Ahrefs Link Intersect tool can simplify the process for you. Enter a few of your major competitors in the tool. Choose ‚Äúall of the below targets‚Äù -> Show link opportunities. You will see a list of websites that all of them link back to. Check them out to find the best fit for building links. Make sure you pick sites where your potential prospects are likely to hang out. That‚Äôs precisely where you should establish your presence. Is that it? Not yet. I‚Äôll tell you another way to refine your search for domains that link back to your competitors. Link Intersect -> Enter domains -> Click ‚Äúany of the below targets‚Äù -> Show link opportunities. Now, you will get more results based on the number of intersects. Shortlist the websites you are going to contact for link-building opportunities. 12. Content Promotion Creating link-worthy content is important. However, you cannot stop there, especially if your aim is to create a great link profile. People should be able to discover your web pages in order to link back to them. That‚Äôs exactly why content promotion is mandatory. So, how do you promote your content? Advertising Outreach Communities/ Forums Advertising Invest in platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and others to improve the visibility of your content. The more the visibility, the greater the chances of someone showing interest to link back to your content. Well-written content can fetch you multiple backlinks in the long run. Investing a small sum of money to advertise your content isn‚Äôt a problem when it can fetch you more links and grow your business, right? Outreach Advertising is, of course, a good way to promote your content. Even so, reaching out to people with an email pitch makes the process sound more formal. Also, when it comes to content promotion via outreach, you add more value to the recipients of your mail and their target audience (who are your prospects too). If you can convince the website owners that linking back to your content fetches mutual benefits, it is a win-win scenario. Communities/ Forums You have niche-specific forum sites where you can promote your content among your target audience. Social media groups and communities are also good places for content promotion. However, it isn‚Äôt as easy as joining a forum and dropping your content links just like that. You need to become an active member and take part in discussions that happen there. Once you have built a reputation for yourself among the forum members, you can post your content in the community. If the audiences find the content good enough, they will link back to it. Remember, you must not post links in the group every time you publish new content. Doing it frequently can annoy people and they might not check out your content at all. Make your moves wisely when promoting your content across communities. 13. Reverse Image Search Is someone using your visual asset without your knowledge? Don‚Äôt worry. I look at it as an opportunity rather than a problem. What if you can use the scenario to build a backlink while fixing the copyright breach? Reverse image search is the key. Reverse image search refers to the practice of searching for all indexed URLs across the internet containing the same or similar image. You can perform a reverse image search using Google Images or Bing Images. Alternatively, you can do it directly from Chrome. So, how do you harness reverse image search to build backlinks? Most website owners do not want to remove copied images because it delivers value to their users. That said, it is a cakewalk to secure a backlink from their website through the image. All you have to do is send them a friendly email asking for a backlink in return. 14. Skyscraper Technique Have you ever thought about creating something better than the top-performing content in your niche? That‚Äôs the root of the skyscraper technique. This technique emphasizes improvising on the top-performing content with a great number of backlinks. You do that to steal your competitor‚Äôs backlinks so that you can drive more traffic to your website and skyrocket your search engine ranking, all by creating a more enhanced version of the existing content. The first step is to identify the best-performing content loaded with backlinks. Perform a Google search with a broad keyword for top-ranked content and analyze it for backlinks using tools like Ahrefs. The next thing is to create an improved version of the content. Here‚Äôs what you should do. Increase the length of the content Add updated information and relevant images Implement a simple and appealing design Provide in-depth information about the topic Once you have created your version of the content, it‚Äôs time for email outreach. Now, let‚Äôs do some smart work. Instead of reaching out to random bloggers, contact people who have already linked to the content. As they‚Äôve linked to similar content, the chances of them linking to your content are high. That‚Äôs the idea. 15. Internal Linking Strategy Link building isn‚Äôt just about linking from or to other sites. It is also about linking pages within your website. So, why is internal link building crucial? Your visitors are your top priority. A bad user experience can drive them away as soon as they come in. This includes increased bounce rate and a higher bounce rate, which are a threat to your website‚Äôs SEO. The smoother the user experience, the longer the time they spend on your website. With channelized internal link building, you help your visitors navigate across your web pages seamlessly while offering a promising user experience. Your users aren‚Äôt the only ones navigating across your site. Search engine spiders do the same and when you link internal pages, you make way for them to understand the context better and rank pages higher. The more the internal links directing to a particular web page, the more important the page is in the eyes of the search engine bots. Tools that Help in Link Building As you know, link building is a time-consuming process. However, the results are long-lasting if done right. Your link-building toolkit is your magic wand.

Link Building: A Case Study From Stan Ventures Actions speak better than words. Let me give you a practical example of how we helped one of our clients rank #1 in SERPs in just 2 weeks. Kitchenroom, a UK-based website offering fitted kitchen services, found it difficult to generate organic traffic despite having a great website with unique content and being in business since 2017. Jason, the founder of Kitchenroom, wanted more prospects across Oxfordshire to contact him and also needed to rank on top of the search. Our SEOs rolled up their sleeves to figure out the challenges we will meet going forward. The major challenge we faced was that some of the client‚Äôs competitors had a robust online presence with 10x more referring domains compared to Kitchenroom. On the other hand, Kitchenroom was lagging behind in terms of authority due to fewer backlinks. After a thorough competitor analysis, we found that even though the competitors leveraged backlinks to stay at the top of the search, those links lacked authority. And that was our trump card. We figured out that building high-quality backlinks through genuine blogger outreach will help the client‚Äôs website rank higher. Proceeding further, our outreach experts started contacting niche-specific bloggers to ensure link placements for Kitchenroom on relevant sites. Once the sites were narrowed down and approved by Jason, our native content writers produced content with the anchor text placed naturally. We shared the content with the bloggers and received the live link shortly. Within two weeks, Jason started receiving more calls while the original traffic was going up. The keywords we wanted Kitchenroom to rank for were in the top 3 positions and the overall traffic of the site increased by 79%. Here‚Äôs a look at the numbers. Traffic ‚Äì 387 +40% Keywords ‚Äì 111 +107% Traffic Value ‚Äì $739 +3X Link Building Tactics You Should Avoid It isn‚Äôt always about knowing the dos. You also need to know the don‚Äôts so that you dodge or unlearn them in time. This holds true for link building as well. Let me pinpoint some black hat practices you should avoid in the course of your link-building journey. Paying for Links Paid link building manipulates search engine algorithms and is clearly a violation of Google‚Äôs webmaster guidelines. So, you may end up with a penalty and that‚Äôs very risky. A majority of paid links come from sites with a lot of outbound links and are naturally of low quality. Again, low-quality links can negatively impact your SEO. If you purchase paid links to outdo your competitors, remember they can buy links too. In that case, your investment may bear no fruit. However, if paid marketing isn‚Äôt the chief focus for your SEO strategy or if you want to buy links just to boost your brand authority, you can opt for paid links. Remember to include rel=‚Äúnofollow‚Äù or rel=‚Äúsponsored‚Äù attributes to your paid links so that they don‚Äôt affect your website‚Äôs SEO. If you leverage paid links purely to boost your search engine rankings, it is, of course, a red flag. Unnatural Links Are you placing links just because you want to increase your backlink count and rank higher on searches? Don‚Äôt do that. The tactic can backfire on you. Low-quality, unnatural backlinks are enlisted as spammy links and you may face a penalty for the same. That said, your backlink has to add value to the users and the website. It should either drive users to a relevant source of information or allow search engine crawlers to comprehend the context better. Want to dig deeper? Check out our extensive blog post covering how to check backlink quality in detail PBN Links Private blog networks (PBN) intend to create lots of links from a cluster of websites (often with no authority) to a money-making website. This is done to pass link juice to the money-making site and improve its ranking unethically. Google hates PBN as it tricks the search engine algorithm into ranking a site higher using unfair means. If you use a PBN to get your site ranked better, the whole strategy will collapse when Google finds and imposes a penalty upon it. Wrapping Up Link building is a consistent process and you can never expect to arrive at a dead-end. While it may seem like demanding more effort than any other SEO strategy, the reward is huge and lasts in the long run. Once you achieve success in link building for SEO, your site will already be generating considerable organic traffic. Then, you may not be required to put in as much effort as you did initially. After all, you don‚Äôt have to start from scratch every time. All you need to do is maintain your website‚Äôs standard while featuring user-focused content and keeping a constant eye on search engine algorithm updates. Link building is an ocean and I have touched upon all possible aspects of it to give you a 360-degree view of it. Hopefully, all your link building questions have been answered. Stay tuned for more.

Link Building Strategies That Work Tools that Help in Link Building Link Building: A Case Study From Stan Ventures Link Building Tactics You Should Avoid Backlinks are a must-have to improve your online visibility, drive more web traffic and position your website at the top of search engine results. In short, backlinks come in handy when you want to increase the authority of your website in the eyes of search engine giants like Google. Search engines discover new content via links and also leverage them as a parameter to determine the content quality. So, how does that work? Google considers a high-quality contextual backlink as a vote of confidence that testifies how worthy the content is. That said, it isn‚Äôt a surprise that link building remains one of the crucial search engine ranking factors. A targeted strategy often makes things easier and link building is no exception. Yes, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you are a beginner or a pro, you need a definitive link building strategy in place to achieve significant results. If not, your link-building efforts may end up a disaster. Worry not! If you understand the what, why, how, dos and don‚Äôts of link building, it isn‚Äôt tough to crack the hard nut. Let me walk you through link building and its aspects one step at a time. What is Link Building? Professional link building is the practice of gaining links from one or more websites to your own. These links help users navigate from one web page to the other to access more information relevant to their search on the internet. As for search engines, links make way for the bots to crawl, index, and rank web pages. Why is Link Building Important for SEO? Link building is one of the most powerful ways to get high-authority, niche-specific websites to vouch for your site. With an effective link acquisition strategy, you can build a bold and illustrative backlink profile. Based on the robustness of the link profile you create, your website can enamor Google‚Äôs algorithm and achieve higher rankings. Link building, despite all the rumor-mongering happening, is something you cannot overlook when optimizing your website for SEO. Spoiler Alert: Building a healthy link profile doesn‚Äôt happen overnight. White hat link building for SEO takes time, but it is always worth it. When you put in targeted and genuine efforts toward link building, it gets paid off with long-lasting results. That‚Äôs the gist of it. The concept of links is cardinal to how Google search works. Its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin came up with the beautiful concept of PageRank. PageRank algorithm helps Google identify new pages and rank them based on quality signals. So, what this means is that Google‚Äôs core algorithm weighs backlinks as one of the top-ranking factors, and ignoring it could bring a website‚Äôs growth to a standstill. How to Build Links? Now that you know how link building can complement your website‚Äôs SEO, it‚Äôs time to learn how to build links. So, let‚Äôs delve into it. Broadly speaking, link building happens in three ways: 1. Requesting for Links Do you want to link back to your website from a specific website? The best thing to do is request the website owner for a backlink. However, you need to make sure that linking back to the website fetches you benefits in terms of web traffic and authority. Here‚Äôs what you need to remember. The website has to be related to your industry/niche. The website should be credible and exhibit great performance. Craft a genuinely compelling email pitch to convenience the website owner to accept a backlink placement to your website. 2. Earning Links Earning links is when other website owners link back to your website without you contacting them regarding backlinks. This often happens when you feature high-quality, user-engaging content on your website that your target audience and industry experts find useful. As per Google Webmaster Guidelines, ‚ÄúCreating good content pays off: Links are usually editorial votes given by choice, and the more useful content you have, the greater the chances someone else will find that content valuable to their readers and link to it.‚Äù Earning backlinks to your website is the biggest reward and a clear sign that your link-building efforts are actually working. 3. Buying Links Buying links is yet another way to secure link placements in top-performing sites. When it comes to buying backlinks, you need to be quite choosy about the sites you pick as you are investing some money to make more of it. Make sure you follow a metric-specific approach to narrow down top sites from your niche to build backlinks. Once that‚Äôs done, get in touch with the website owner with a well-crafted email to gain backlink placements on a commercial basis. If you find the process time-consuming, you can avail the assistance of a trusted link-building service provider to purchase links from relevant sites on your behalf. Key Elements to Evaluate Link Prospects Before thinking about how to find backlink placements, you need to narrow down sites that suit your link building needs. That‚Äôs why you should consider the following elements related to host sites when you invest in link building for SEO. Content: Written and visual content for blogs, web pages, etc. Admin: Do they have advertising policies in place? Link Profile: What do the links pointing to the site look like? Reputation: Does the author have any reputation? Authorship: Who is responsible for the website content? Technical: How do users find and engage with the site? In addition to these metrics, you need to conduct your own manual research and backlink quality analysis to get an even deeper understanding of your link-building prospects. Metric Vs. Quality Understanding metrics and quality can help you set up link-building success. Certain metrics from top SEO tools can help evaluate a site for link-building prospects much easier. They are: Ahrefs Domain Rating. Moz Page Authority. Moz Domain Authority. Moz Page Authority. Majestic Trust Flow. Majestic Citation Flow. Majestic Trust Flow. SEMrushAuthority Score. Verve Link Score. In addition to these metrics, you need to conduct your own manual research to get an even deeper understanding of your link-building prospects. Quality The search quality raters guidelines by Google have dedicated a section for Overall Page Quality Rating that you can follow as well. It can help you cover the purpose of the content, the depth of the content, and find out credible sources for the content. How to Analyze a Site? As you go through the evaluation process, there are two important things to keep in mind: Weight Each Element Some aspects of the site are more important than others. Examine multiple elements that decide the site quality Here are the key elements to consider during the assessment: Content Commercial links: Check if there are links to money pages. Find whether links are not tagged with no follow or sponsor Navigation: Is it too generic for the site? Restricted Keywords: Check if the site uses gambling, payday loan, or pornographic keywords Infrequency: Does the website post infrequently, or are the old posts rarely updated? Admin About Us: Find if the links point to money pages Admin Pages: Find pages that directly advertise dofollow links in guest posts and avoid them at all costs Info: Phone number, address, and email Link Profile Excess links: See if too many links are pointing to a single page Low Authority: Find the site‚Äôs Domain Authority and Domain Rating using SEO tools Non-relevant links: Discover if there are links that don‚Äôt make sense for the page Authorship Byline: Is the byline set to the site name or the admin? Author Page Info: Is the information about the author incomplete? Nationality: Is the author from your target country or not? If you are dealing with YMYL pages, you have to be more stringent about the author‚Äôs reputation. Reputation Online presence: Does the website has a good social media presence Followers: What type of accounts are following the brand Engagement: Does the page have enough engagement? Technical Indexed: Does the website exist in Google‚Äôs index with more than just the home page? Geo: What is the focus of the audience‚Äôs country? Page Engagement: Does the site have ads and links within pages? Link Building Strategies That Work The strategy you devise is the major driving factor behind your link-building outcomes. So, here is a look at the top white hat link building strategies you can harness to achieve desired results. 1. Ultimate Guides Ultimate Guides usually cover in-depth information about a specific topic and comprise several subheadings, illustrations, and super-long content. Since Ultimate Guides provide users access to massive information in one place, they can be a go-to choice to earn backlinks. 2. Listicles Listicles or list posts are posts that feature a numbered list of facts, techniques, tips, reasons and so much more. Packed in chunks, these posts contain information that delivers value to the users. After analyzing 1 million pieces of content, BuzzSumo has arrived at the conclusion that list posts generate far more backlinks than other forms of content, including infographics, quizzes, and more. 3. Resource Page Link Building So, what are Resource Pages? Resource Pages are pages that contain a curated list of resources that solely link back to informative content from multiple websites. The more the number of backlinks on a page, the more authoritative it is. Resource page link building is a practice where you link back to your website from a resource page. Your chances of gaining link placements in resource pages depend heavily on the quality of your content. You can find resource pages easily by using the following Google search strings. ‚ÄúKeyword‚Äù + inurl:links ‚ÄúKeyword‚Äù + ‚Äúhelpful resources‚Äù ‚ÄúKeyword‚Äù + ‚Äúuseful resources‚Äù ‚ÄúKeyword‚Äù + ‚Äúuseful links‚Äù Let‚Äôs say your niche is medicine. You can use medicine in the keyword field followed by one of the above Google search strings. Once you have the resource pages, you need to find out if a particular resource page is suitable for your link-building purposes. Not everyone has the same link-building needs. You can use metrics such as page authority, domain authority, the web traffic of the page/domain to decide if a given resource page is the right fit for you. This will give you the ideal site for your resource page link-building process. Look for content that is worth linking back to from the resource page. Finally, draft an email stating how your content can be a valuable addition to the resource page and ask the website owner to link back to your site. 4. Broken Link Building Broken link building is a unique link building strategy. While other link building strategies are about asking people for backlinks, broken link building makes way for you to help add value to somebody‚Äôs website. So, how to get backlinks using this strategy? The first step is to identify broken links in a website. Install either Check My Links or LinkMiner chrome extension. Not sure which website to check for broken links? Pick a page with more links. If there are many links, it‚Äôs likely that one or more of them are broken. That‚Äôs the idea. A resource page from your niche should be the best fit. After all, it is fully loaded with links. You can use the Chrome extension to weed out broken links in the page easily. Finally, send the website owner a mail highlighting the broken links that you identified and suggest replacing the link with yours. 5. Guest Blogging Guest blogging is never out of trend. It is, of course, one of the classic link building methods. Use a search string such as ‚Äúwrite for us‚Äù + keyword to find blogs and websites that currently accept guest posts in your niche. Run through the search results and shortlist the ones that are right for you. Use the contact form or email address to initiate a formal conversation asking for a guest post opportunity with backlink placement. Unfortunately, guest post opportunities aren‚Äôt available just for you but also for your competitors. Make sure you stand out from the crowd every step of the way. Getting professional assistance from a trusted guest blogging service provider can take the burden off your shoulders and help you achieve desired results to outperform the other players in your industry. 6. Blogger Outreach Blogger outreach is one of the best strategies to build your backlink profile. You would have received outreach emails too. Doubt that? Check the spam folder of your mailbox. You will likely find at least a few outreach emails in there, only that they failed to grab your attention. If you‚Äôre wondering why these emails are dropped straight into the spam box, it‚Äôs because they may not be relevant to you. Suppose you run a website that specializes in e-commerce. An email targeting finance experts and investors is certainly not your cup of tea. That‚Äôs why your outreach campaigns should be targeting the right people. Your link success depends on it as well. In fact, outreach emails witness a response rate of only 10%, while the other 90% of them go unanswered. Having said that, if you want your outreach emails answered, you need to keep yourself updated about the latest outreach techniques and master them. Are you still using standard/traditional email templates for your outreach purposes? If your answer is yes, then it‚Äôs high time to break away. Let me tell you how to switch to non-conventional email outreach. Draft 100% personalized and original emails. Leverage your unique brand voice. Apart from increasing the response rate for your outreach campaigns, these emails also help you create a positive outlook toward your brand. So, who do you start with? Trustworthiness is the lifeline of blogger outreach. Start with people who trust you and are already aware of your business. They may include Your industry partners. People who have subscribed to your newsletter. People who have mentioned your links or brand name in their content. Bloggers/influencers who are connected with you on social media. Who else do you reach out to? Look for people who share something in common with you. For instance, you can reach out to bloggers who share a similar customer base. Link placement in niche-specific blogs can drive qualified leads and help you achieve more tractions for your business. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and others are also ideal to find people whose interests are similar to yours. Do you think outreach is eating up too much of your time? That‚Äôs why Stan Ventures shortlists sites based on 25+ link building metrics and offers a genuine blogger outreach service to help you earn high-quality backlinks seamlessly. 7. Unlinked Brand Mentions Every business gets its brand mentioned somewhere on the internet. These brand mentions need not necessarily be linked back to the corresponding website. Why not use your unlinked brand mentions to your link-building advantage? Yes, you can translate unlinked brand mentions to gain backlink placements across websites with minimal effort in the right direction. Use a brand monitoring tool like Semrush to keep track of your brand mentions across the internet. Once you find people who have mentioned your brand name in their web space, reach out to them and ask for backlink placements. However, you need to ensure that these links add value to the visitors of the corresponding domain. That way, the link juice is rightly passed on, having a positive impact on your website‚Äôs authority. 8. Podcast Links Links are everywhere. You just need to have a keen eye for them. What if I told you you could get backlinks without writing content or initiating outreach campaigns? It‚Äôs definitely possible. All it takes is one word: Podcasts. You just have to show up and talk about things you know and you get a link just like that. A podcast can be about anything, as long as it adds value to the listeners. Talk about something your target audience wants to learn and you get the job done without lifting your finger. 9. HARO Links HARO or Help A Reporter Out is an ideal place for you to connect with big shots from high authority, trusted websites. Once you sign up, you start receiving emails on a daily basis. Set a time frame, say, 30 to 45 minutes every day and look for queries within your expertise and respond to them. If your answer gets featured, you get a link placement on a high-authority website. It isn‚Äôt a sure-shot that your answers will be cited, but when it happens, the impact will be high. That‚Äôs how HARO links bolster your SEO efforts. 10. Infographic & Image Link Building Visual assets such as infographics, images, and diagrams make way for seamless link building. They present huge chunks of information in a comprehensive way. Users are fond of visual assets as well. So, how do infographics and images simplify link building? Let‚Äôs say you include a graph or chart on one of your web pages. Every time someone shares the graph, you automatically get a link from their website to your own. From this standpoint, visual assets hold greater good for link building than text-based content. 11. Getting competitor‚Äôs links using tools like AHREFs Link Intersect feature Did you know your competitors can help you strengthen your backlink profile? Here‚Äôs how: If a website links back to one or more of your competitors, chances are they can link back to your site. So, how do you find these sites that link back to your competitors? Ahrefs Link Intersect tool can simplify the process for you. Enter a few of your major competitors in the tool. Choose ‚Äúall of the below targets‚Äù -> Show link opportunities. You will see a list of websites that all of them link back to. Check them out to find the best fit for building links. Make sure you pick sites where your potential prospects are likely to hang out. That‚Äôs precisely where you should establish your presence. Is that it? Not yet. I‚Äôll tell you another way to refine your search for domains that link back to your competitors. Link Intersect -> Enter domains -> Click ‚Äúany of the below targets‚Äù -> Show link opportunities. Now, you will get more results based on the number of intersects. Shortlist the websites you are going to contact for link-building opportunities. 12. Content Promotion Creating link-worthy content is important. However, you cannot stop there, especially if your aim is to create a great link profile. People should be able to discover your web pages in order to link back to them. That‚Äôs exactly why content promotion is mandatory. So, how do you promote your content? Advertising Outreach Communities/ Forums Advertising Invest in platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and others to improve the visibility of your content. The more the visibility, the greater the chances of someone showing interest to link back to your content. Well-written content can fetch you multiple backlinks in the long run. Investing a small sum of money to advertise your content isn‚Äôt a problem when it can fetch you more links and grow your business, right? Outreach Advertising is, of course, a good way to promote your content. Even so, reaching out to people with an email pitch makes the process sound more formal. Also, when it comes to content promotion via outreach, you add more value to the recipients of your mail and their target audience (who are your prospects too). If you can convince the website owners that linking back to your content fetches mutual benefits, it is a win-win scenario. Communities/ Forums You have niche-specific forum sites where you can promote your content among your target audience. Social media groups and communities are also good places for content promotion. However, it isn‚Äôt as easy as joining a forum and dropping your content links just like that. You need to become an active member and take part in discussions that happen there. Once you have built a reputation for yourself among the forum members, you can post your content in the community. If the audiences find the content good enough, they will link back to it. Remember, you must not post links in the group every time you publish new content. Doing it frequently can annoy people and they might not check out your content at all. Make your moves wisely when promoting your content across communities. 13. Reverse Image Search Is someone using your visual asset without your knowledge? Don‚Äôt worry. I look at it as an opportunity rather than a problem. What if you can use the scenario to build a backlink while fixing the copyright breach? Reverse image search is the key. Reverse image search refers to the practice of searching for all indexed URLs across the internet containing the same or similar image. You can perform a reverse image search using Google Images or Bing Images. Alternatively, you can do it directly from Chrome. So, how do you harness reverse image search to build backlinks? Most website owners do not want to remove copied images because it delivers value to their users. That said, it is a cakewalk to secure a backlink from their website through the image. All you have to do is send them a friendly email asking for a backlink in return. 14. Skyscraper Technique Have you ever thought about creating something better than the top-performing content in your niche? That‚Äôs the root of the skyscraper technique. This technique emphasizes improvising on the top-performing content with a great number of backlinks. You do that to steal your competitor‚Äôs backlinks so that you can drive more traffic to your website and skyrocket your search engine ranking, all by creating a more enhanced version of the existing content. The first step is to identify the best-performing content loaded with backlinks. Perform a Google search with a broad keyword for top-ranked content and analyze it for backlinks using tools like Ahrefs. The next thing is to create an improved version of the content. Here‚Äôs what you should do. Increase the length of the content Add updated information and relevant images Implement a simple and appealing design Provide in-depth information about the topic Once you have created your version of the content, it‚Äôs time for email outreach. Now, let‚Äôs do some smart work. Instead of reaching out to random bloggers, contact people who have already linked to the content. As they‚Äôve linked to similar content, the chances of them linking to your content are high. That‚Äôs the idea. 15. Internal Linking Strategy Link building isn‚Äôt just about linking from or to other sites. It is also about linking pages within your website. So, why is internal link building crucial? Your visitors are your top priority. A bad user experience can drive them away as soon as they come in. This includes increased bounce rate and a higher bounce rate, which are a threat to your website‚Äôs SEO. The smoother the user experience, the longer the time they spend on your website. With channelized internal link building, you help your visitors navigate across your web pages seamlessly while offering a promising user experience. Your users aren‚Äôt the only ones navigating across your site. Search engine spiders do the same and when you link internal pages, you make way for them to understand the context better and rank pages higher. The more the internal links directing to a particular web page, the more important the page is in the eyes of the search engine bots. Tools that Help in Link Building As you know, link building is a time-consuming process. However, the results are long-lasting if done right. Your link-building toolkit is your magic wand. Abracadabra! And the whole process becomes simpler and more effective. Let me tell you about the top 5 tools that come in handy in every step of your link-building journey.

Link Building: A Case Study From Stan Ventures Actions speak better than words. Let me give you a practical example of how we helped one of our clients rank #1 in SERPs in just 2 weeks. Kitchenroom, a UK-based website offering fitted kitchen services, found it difficult to generate organic traffic despite having a great website with unique content and being in business since 2017. Jason, the founder of Kitchenroom, wanted more prospects across Oxfordshire to contact him and also needed to rank on top of the search. Our SEOs rolled up their sleeves to figure out the challenges we will meet going forward. The major challenge we faced was that some of the client‚Äôs competitors had a robust online presence with 10x more referring domains compared to Kitchenroom. On the other hand, Kitchenroom was lagging behind in terms of authority due to fewer backlinks. After a thorough competitor analysis, we found that even though the competitors leveraged backlinks to stay at the top of the search, those links lacked authority. And that was our trump card. We figured out that building high-quality backlinks through genuine blogger outreach will help the client‚Äôs website rank higher. Proceeding further, our outreach experts started contacting niche-specific bloggers to ensure link placements for Kitchenroom on relevant sites. Once the sites were narrowed down and approved by Jason, our native content writers produced content with the anchor text placed naturally. We shared the content with the bloggers and received the live link shortly. Within two weeks, Jason started receiving more calls while the original traffic was going up. The keywords we wanted Kitchenroom to rank for were in the top 3 positions and the overall traffic of the site increased by 79%. Here‚Äôs a look at the numbers. Traffic ‚Äì 387 +40% Keywords ‚Äì 111 +107% Traffic Value ‚Äì $739 +3X Link Building Tactics You Should Avoid It isn‚Äôt always about knowing the dos. You also need to know the don‚Äôts so that you dodge or unlearn them in time. This holds true for link building as well. Let me pinpoint some black hat practices you should avoid in the course of your link-building journey. Paying for Links Paid link building manipulates search engine algorithms and is clearly a violation of Google‚Äôs webmaster guidelines. So, you may end up with a penalty and that‚Äôs very risky. A majority of paid links come from sites with a lot of outbound links and are naturally of low quality. Again, low-quality links can negatively impact your SEO. If you purchase paid links to outdo your competitors, remember they can buy links too. In that case, your investment may bear no fruit. However, if paid marketing isn‚Äôt the chief focus for your SEO strategy or if you want to buy links just to boost your brand authority, you can opt for paid links. Remember to include rel=‚Äúnofollow‚Äù or rel=‚Äúsponsored‚Äù attributes to your paid links so that they don‚Äôt affect your website‚Äôs SEO. If you leverage paid links purely to boost your search engine rankings, it is, of course, a red flag. Unnatural Links Are you placing links just because you want to increase your backlink count and rank higher on searches? Don‚Äôt do that. The tactic can backfire on you. Low-quality, unnatural backlinks are enlisted as spammy links and you may face a penalty for the same. That said, your backlink has to add value to the users and the website. It should either drive users to a relevant source of information or allow search engine crawlers to comprehend the context better. Want to dig deeper? Check out our extensive blog post covering how to check backlink quality in detail PBN Links Private blog networks (PBN) intend to create lots of links from a cluster of websites (often with no authority) to a money-making website. This is done to pass link juice to the money-making site and improve its ranking unethically. Google hates PBN as it tricks the search engine algorithm into ranking a site higher using unfair means. If you use a PBN to get your site ranked better, the whole strategy will collapse when Google finds and imposes a penalty upon it. Wrapping Up Link building is a consistent process and you can never expect to arrive at a dead-end. While it may seem like demanding more effort than any other SEO strategy, the reward is huge and lasts in the long run. Once you achieve success in link building for SEO, your site will already be generating considerable organic traffic. Then, you may not be required to put in as much effort as you did initially. After all, you don‚Äôt have to start from scratch every time. All you need to do is maintain your website‚Äôs standard while featuring user-focused content and keeping a constant eye on search engine algorithm updates. Link building is an ocean and I have touched upon all possible aspects of it to give you a 360-degree view of it. Hopefully, all your link building questions have been answered. Stay tuned for more.

Guest Posting is the Most Popular Link Building Tactic in 2024 2. The Average Cost For a Guest Post is $220 3. Only 6% of ‚ÄúGuest Posting Sites‚Äù Are Quality (After the Helpful Content Update) 4. The Average Cost of a Quality Guest Post is $609 5. The Average Cost of Buying a Link Insertion is $141 6. Top-Tier or High-End Links Can Cost Over $1000 7.

Backlinks (and Higher DR) Correlate With More Traffic 11. 84.72% of AI Overviews Link to at Least One Domain From the Top 10 Search Results The Problem With Statistics Link building has undergone a lot these days. One day, Google says it doesn‚Äôt matter as much, and the next day, someone leaks their algorithm, which clearly shows otherwise. Looking at Google Trends to check its popularity shows that link building is almost the same, if not slightly up, from five years ago. What has changed is the effectiveness of different link building strategies and tactics. For me, coming from an agency, I‚Äôve seen many waning strategies and many holding firm. So, I‚Äôve analyzed other people‚Äôs studies to extract data that tell a story about what is working and why. These are the ten link building statistics that should change (or reinforce) how you think about SEO. Quick Takeaways 1. Guest posting is the most popular link building tactic in 2024. 2. The avg. price for a guest post is $220. 3. 6% of ‚Äúguest posting sites‚Äù are quality. 4. Quality guest posts costs avg. $609. 5. The avg. price for a link insertion is $141. 6. High-end links can cost over $1,000. 7. Most SEOs‚Äô monthly budget is $5,000-$12,500. 8. Most campaigns get 1-9 links. 9. ~66% of links in the last nine years are dead. 10. Backlinks (and higher DR) correlate with more traffic. 11. ~85% of AI Overviews have one link to a top 10 result. 1. Guest Posting is the Most Popular Link Building Tactic in 2024 There is somewhat conflicting data about tactics. But, the most used and influential are very different when you get into it. In the screenshot below, you‚Äôll see that Authority Hacker found that guest posting, followed by link exchanges, and creating content were the top link building tactics used today. Aira‚Äôs report found that content-led link building was most popular, with guest posting actually last. Looking at uSERP‚Äôs study in 2022, we see that digital PR and content marketing were most popular with guest posting in third. So, we know that a lot of SEOs are using guest posting. But, when it comes down to what is most effective, the latest study I‚Äôve seen was from Editorial.link, which found that digital PR is the most effective tactic (check out our digital PR statistics as well): While guest posting is the second most effective, it shows that just because something is the most used doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the most impactful for your business. Guest posting (also called guest blogging) is so popular because it is easy to use. You typically enter your information into a database and choose the sites you want to post. But are those the kinds of links you want? Not always. You‚Äôll see it in the next statistic. What does it mean for you? ‚ÄúMost popular‚Äù doesn‚Äôt equal ‚Äúmost effective.‚Äù Do your due diligence before deciding where to spend your budget. 2. The Average Cost For a Guest Post is $220 After evaluating 898 guest posting sites from various marketplaces, databases, and shared spreadsheets, we found the average guest post price to be $220. I came across a similar number when I contacted the sites mentioned in our guest posting sites list. This is unsurprising, as most site owners charge more if they have a high authority site that can potentially get you more eyeballs on your post. In fact, site owners seem to have an idea of the market based on third-party calculators like the one mentioned in this response below. (I asked if there was any wiggle room in the cost for placement.) What stood out to me the most is that back 5-6 years ago, the industry wasn‚Äôt as highly monetized. Now, every site sees the revenue potential in selling guest posting placements. However, to truly maximize the value of your investment, you must consider higher quality than at least 65 DR. (The only exception is if the site is newer, hyper-relevant, and has solid SEO. In that case, it‚Äôs OK to invest in a lower DR site.) What does it mean for you? Guest posting can be effective if you focus on high-end sites with real users and exposure. However, that will cost way more than $220. As you‚Äôll see next, low-cost guest post sites are low quality and not worth the money (because most are garbage.) 3. Only 6% of ‚ÄúGuest Posting Sites‚Äù Are Quality (After the Helpful Content Update) Whenever someone offers me a guest post on a site, I add it to my database. Each time, I find that the sites have had considerable dips in traffic since March 2024. For example: This site was already trending down from previous Helpful Content updates, but it got blasted down to zero in March. After about nine months of work, I‚Äôve accumulated over 1,100 sites. About a week ago, I analyzed the full list to determine which still had viable traffic and were still quality sites. My simple criteria was: Domain Rating above 65 Monthly Organic Traffic is above 10,000 This isn‚Äôt a scientific analysis but a directionally accurate way to determine quality. The list went from 1,104 to just 68 sites! That‚Äôs an extraordinary drop. Does this mean a site with low traffic or low DR isn‚Äôt valuable? No. A site could be brand new and still growing, which you need to evaluate. But if you are paying for a link, this must be factored into the link building pricing. What does it mean for you? No, guest blogging isn‚Äôt dead. But, you need to evaluate sites more closely. And if you can, avoid pitching to sites you find on lists. Instead, try to find real value from relevant sites in your niche. I outline an entire pitching strategy in my video below: 4. The Average Cost of a Quality Guest Post is $609 When I took my list of guest posts and link insertion sites and removed all low-quality sites, I was left with 68 sites. These had an average DR of 80 and DA of 81. When I averaged that pricing, it came out to $609.25. Most are general news sites like the ones you see below: For guest posting, I‚Äôd always think about it from the perspective of the value to your brand, not just a link building exercise. Where will customers actually see me? Where can I show thought leadership and a strong association with a brand? For instance, we‚Äôve had guest posts on the BuzzStream blog from digital PR agency thought leaders, like Darren Kingman. We are a digital PR tool. That is a strong association. The other thing to consider is that at $600, you get into what some agencies get as an average cost per link(CPL) for a content-led link building campaign. If you net 6-8 quality links on average when assets cost $5k on an asset, your CPL is about $600-700. This is the better investment because it‚Äôs an asset you own that lives on your site. When your link building and SEO teams work together, you can really start to reap the ROI. Statistics posts like this one, which you are reading, require little investment but can yield high returns because they have a high intent to link and can accrue links naturally over time. What does it mean for you? True high-end guest posting is much more expensive and has less ROI than content-led digital PR. But now, let‚Äôs look at link insertions. 5. The Average Cost of Buying a Link Insertion is $141 This price comes from my analysis of shared link insertion prices from 174 sites across various industries. As I discussed in my link insertion post, these links are only impactful when placed on high-quality and highly relevant sites. So, digging into this stat a bit more, you can see a drop-off in pricing at 80+ DR. But, this reflects the limited, high-quality sites open to link insertions (rather than thinking that it‚Äôs cheaper to insert a link on a DR 90 site than it is on a DR 11.) What does it mean for you? Realistically, a ‚Äúhigh-quality‚Äù link that will move the needle will likely be above DR 75+, so assume this value skews higher. I‚Äôve said ‚Äúhigh-quality‚Äù a lot at this point, so let‚Äôs look at this next. 6. Top-Tier or High-End Links Can Cost Over $1000 This link building statistic about the cost of high-end links is an estimate from Ross Hudgens of Siege Media based on years of industry experience. (I also worked at Siege Media for six years, so I trust this number.) Although it‚Äôs not specified in the article, high-end is in that 75+ range I mentioned above, and it most likely refers to news publications achieved through digital PR. But as journalists are getting laid off, and the ones who are left are starting to write more and more affiliate-driven SEO content so that publications can stay afloat, there are fewer ‚Äúlinks‚Äù to go around. High-end news links from publishers like local news stations to sites like CNet, Time, and the New York Times are in high demand right now. So, realistically, those high-end links are valued at closer to $2-2.5K. What does it mean for you? Ultimately, your cost per link for high-end links like this comes down to the strength of a campaign. You aren‚Äôt going to hit home runs every campaign, either. So, give yourself (or an agency) a chance to prove a trust cost. 7. Most In-House SEOs‚Äô Typical Monthly Budget is $5,000-$12,500 So, this one is technically a mix of two stats found in the report from Aira: The most common budget range for in-house SEOs was $10,000-$25,000. Over 80% of in-house SEOs dedicate up to 50% of their SEO budget to link building. Combining the two, the most common monthly budget for in-house SEOs is between $5k and $12.5k. Although this is, again, not super scientific, it‚Äôs at least directionally accurate. As stated by Aira, the budget in question here is ‚Äúexternal agencies, freelancers or contractors.‚Äù With these budgets, can brands actually make an impact? Yes, but I‚Äôd think less about the cost per link and more about investing in a link-building asset. As we saw in our analysis of digital PR‚Äôs impact on SEO, a content-led digital PR campaign clearly has an effect‚Äîespecially when correlated with search volume. For example, when WalletHub‚Äôs best cities for families post is published and (most likely pitched), you can see a concurrent boost in organic traffic and links. Then, you can see subsequent traffic boosts each time they update it. A study like this could easily cost $10,000-15,000, but it has over 650 unique links, putting that cost per link at something like $23. And if you were doing this study yourself (instead of hiring out), you‚Äôd see that cost per link drop even lower. You invest in one asset, and it gains links and traffic over time. You can even see the indirect impact of a keyword on the traffic to product pages. For example, look at the traffic boost to a product page that is linked to this highly successful digital PR campaign about dirty car interiors: There‚Äôs no search volume attached to the piece itself, but it has a meaningful impact on organic traffic. And if your content‚Äôs topic is relevant to customers, and your site is correctly set up to convert those visitors, you can attach revenue to digital PR. That, for me, is a more meaningful way to spend a link building budget than buying individual link placements on sites or guest posts. However, as we‚Äôll see in the next stat, how many links do most campaigns actually generate? What does it mean for you? Consider where and how you spend your budget. Guest posts and link insertions will only move the needle if they are on high-quality sites and in areas of the site that get a lot of visibility. Investing in a content marketing asset and pitching it via digital PR gives you more opportunities to impact SEO. Doing it yourself in-house is even cheaper. 8. Most Campaigns Get 1-9 Links (and That‚Äôs Considered a Success) If you asked anyone inside of SEO or even digital PR how many links are a success, I‚Äôd say that virtually everyone would agree that around ten links is a solid campaign. That‚Äôs precisely what Aira found in their study. Aira asked its respondents how many links they generated in campaigns in the last 12 months, and a majority said 1-9 links. Then, they asked how many links you would want to get that are deemed a success. Tying this into our previous statistic, numbers may look bleak if you spend $5-10k monthly on a link-building asset and only get 1-9 links back. Stakeholders or clients might feel the same. But it‚Äôs easy to fall into the quantity of links over the quality trap. As mentioned before, high-end links that can move the needle are costly. To support this more with data, let‚Äôs examine the quality of links on most sites. I took a quick list of five random top-ranking sites in different industries. Then, I used Ahref‚Äôs ‚ÄòBest Links‚Äô feature to determine how many quality links they have. The filters are set only to show referring domains from DR 75+ sites that get an estimated 10,000 organic visits or more per month. When we compare the total number of links to the filtered total of ‚Äúbest‚Äù links, there is a decrease of almost 98%! This doesn‚Äôt show link relevancy, freshness, or other factors influencing a link‚Äôs value. But on the face of it, it just goes to show that quantity isn‚Äôt a reliable number. What does it mean for you? Campaigns may get fewer links, but if they are quality links, that‚Äôs all that matters. 9. At Least 66.5% of Links to Sites in the Last 9 Years Are Dead Link rot is a real thing. Although Ahrefs found that 66.5% of links in the last nine years have been lost to crawl errors, dropped pages, and redirects, I‚Äôve found that most links last about two years. There are a few main things to take from this strategically. First, you‚Äôll always need to build links to keep up. Second, although some lost links are beyond your control, you can mitigate some of this by being more selective about how and where you build links. Always ask if it makes sense to get a link from a site. And specifically, does it make sense in the area of this site? For example, say you could get a backlink to CNN‚Äôs coupon area. Recently, Google has started penalizing sites that exploit site reputation abuse (‚Äúthird-party content produced primarily for ranking purposes and without close oversight of a website owner‚Äù). So, if the site‚Äôs content is unclear, your link will be lost sooner than expected. Last, one of the major points the Google leak documentation made is that Google may prefer freshness‚Äînot only fresh content but also links from site-specific areas that get refreshed. So, does this mean that links that have been up for a while are worth less? Quite possibly. It makes sense that Google wants fresh signals about a site, given how quickly information can change. What does it mean for you? Think of it like farming. You can‚Äôt plant a crop and expect it to last a lifetime. You must continually grow every year, refresh the soil, etc. To keep up with decaying links, you must continually build links to grow your link profile consistently. Focusing on high-quality news sites may also help lower link decay. 10. Backlinks (and Higher DR) Correlate With More Traffic Ahref‚Äôs search traffic study found that both backlinks and a higher DR correlate with more traffic. This is somewhat surprising statistic for link builders because Google reps have recently mentioned things like ‚Äúlinks aren‚Äôt as important‚Äù (although they‚Äôve then backtracked.) It‚Äôs unsurprising because anyone in the SEO game knows how important links are for success. But it‚Äôs always nice to see data backing this up. One of Ahrefs more compelling studies found some profound correlations between backlinks and traffic. After pointing out that 96.55% of all pages in their index get zero traffic from Google, they dug into some correlations into what does get traffic. They found that pages with more referring domains get more traffic. And that pages with more referring domains rank for more keywords. Specifically, they call out how competitive keywords are the ones where links really make a big difference. Another study from Authority Hacker found that referring domains are still the most strongly correlated factor for SEO success. And finally, a third study from Backlinko shows that #1 result in Google has an average of 3.8x more backlinks than positions #2-#10. Both Authority Hacker and Backlinko really show the impact of links on ranking #1. But what about just being on page one? Isn‚Äôt that enough? According to another study from Backlinko, the number one result in Google gets over a quarter of all clicks (27.6%). This stat is huge for SEOs looking to pitch the value of ranking. It can mean the difference between a sale and a no-sale. However, one thing to remember going forward is that AI Overviews may impact this number. In the same way that Featured Snippets took clicks away from the SERP results, we may see AI Overviews take away from users‚Äô clicks. In fact, Google reps have already said, ‚Äú‚Ä¶we see that the links included in AI Overviews get more clicks than if the page had appeared as a traditional web listing for that query.‚Äù So, the last burning question is: What does it take to be included in the AI Overview, and will it impact you? What does it mean for you?Even if Google says that links aren‚Äôt as valuable, we have compelling evidence to prove otherwise. Even if the reason you get more links as you get closer to number one is because you have more visibility, that still means you want to build links. 11. 84.72% of AI Overviews Link to at Least One Domain From the Top 10 Search Results SE Ranking has compiled a great list of results from their most recent study on AI Overviews (AIOs). There aren‚Äôt any prescriptive takeaways regarding Domain Rating or the number of backlinks required to appear in an AI Overview, but the data shows that almost 85% of the AIOs appear in the top 10 SERP results. So, do referring domains equal showing up in AIO? There is no direct data, but you can easily connect the dots. We know that it takes links to rank well in the SERPs. So, getting links may increase the likelihood of appearing in the AI Overviews. Google has also been struggling with AIO not showing correct information (like drinking urine to pass a kidney stone). So much so that they need to provide a disclaimer that it is still experimental: So, in many cases, Google must do some type of fact-checking behind the information they display. How better to do this? I believe that they will fall back on links and authority metrics. What does it mean for you? AI Overviews are still very new. We have some data, but this is a changing landscape. The more Google gets pushback that AIO results aren‚Äôt helpful or incorrect, the more they will (most likely) lean on links and traditional ranking metrics. The Problem With Statistics The problem with most link building statistics and studies is that they are usually correlation studies. We don‚Äôt know anything for sure. We have access to leaked information about Google‚Äôs algorithm, which helps us connect the dots. But so much of SEO is a mix of intuition and critical thinking. As Nick LeRoy said in our podcast, SEO is ‚Äúreally trying to just take in as much information as possible, process it, use critical thinking, which I think is a skill that a lot of SEOs and link builders struggle with because we just want what we want to work.‚Äù Don‚Äôt just rely on what you hear and read. Test it out yourself. If statistics, data, and case studies tell you one thing, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to work on your site, don‚Äôt do it. You need to be able to think on your feet. Things change VERY quickly in the SEO world. Strong convictions are OK, but you don‚Äôt want to be stuck in the mud if things change. Think beyond the statistics. Remember, at the end of the day, whether you are doing link outreach or writing content to rank, real people read it at the other end. Write for them. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been in SEO for 10+ years, but seeing purely SEO-driven content or receiving a generic email is like a slap in the face to me. The stuff that sticks out is when users go the extra mile to provide something useful or surprising ‚Äî either in an email or a piece of content.

Backlinks (and Higher DR) Correlate With More Traffic 11. 84.72% of AI Overviews Link to at Least One Domain From the Top 10 Search Results The Problem With Statistics Link building has undergone a lot these days. One day, Google says it doesn‚Äôt matter as much, and the next day, someone leaks their algorithm, which clearly shows otherwise. Looking at Google Trends to check its popularity shows that link building is almost the same, if not slightly up, from five years ago. What has changed is the effectiveness of different link building strategies and tactics. For me, coming from an agency, I‚Äôve seen many waning strategies and many holding firm. So, I‚Äôve analyzed other people‚Äôs studies to extract data that tell a story about what is working and why. These are the ten link building statistics that should change (or reinforce) how you think about SEO. Quick Takeaways 1. Guest posting is the most popular link building tactic in 2024. 2. The avg. price for a guest post is $220. 3. 6% of ‚Äúguest posting sites‚Äù are quality. 4. Quality guest posts costs avg. $609. 5. The avg. price for a link insertion is $141. 6. High-end links can cost over $1,000. 7. Most SEOs‚Äô monthly budget is $5,000-$12,500. 8. Most campaigns get 1-9 links. 9. ~66% of links in the last nine years are dead. 10. Backlinks (and higher DR) correlate with more traffic. 11. ~85% of AI Overviews have one link to a top 10 result. 1. Guest Posting is the Most Popular Link Building Tactic in 2024 There is somewhat conflicting data about tactics. But, the most used and influential are very different when you get into it. In the screenshot below, you‚Äôll see that Authority Hacker found that guest posting, followed by link exchanges, and creating content were the top link building tactics used today. Aira‚Äôs report found that content-led link building was most popular, with guest posting actually last. Looking at uSERP‚Äôs study in 2022, we see that digital PR and content marketing were most popular with guest posting in third. So, we know that a lot of SEOs are using guest posting. But, when it comes down to what is most effective, the latest study I‚Äôve seen was from Editorial.link, which found that digital PR is the most effective tactic (check out our digital PR statistics as well): While guest posting is the second most effective, it shows that just because something is the most used doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the most impactful for your business. Guest posting (also called guest blogging) is so popular because it is easy to use. You typically enter your information into a database and choose the sites you want to post. But are those the kinds of links you want? Not always. You‚Äôll see it in the next statistic. What does it mean for you? ‚ÄúMost popular‚Äù doesn‚Äôt equal ‚Äúmost effective.‚Äù Do your due diligence before deciding where to spend your budget. 2. The Average Cost For a Guest Post is $220 After evaluating 898 guest posting sites from various marketplaces, databases, and shared spreadsheets, we found the average guest post price to be $220. I came across a similar number when I contacted the sites mentioned in our guest posting sites list. This is unsurprising, as most site owners charge more if they have a high authority site that can potentially get you more eyeballs on your post. In fact, site owners seem to have an idea of the market based on third-party calculators like the one mentioned in this response below. (I asked if there was any wiggle room in the cost for placement.) What stood out to me the most is that back 5-6 years ago, the industry wasn‚Äôt as highly monetized. Now, every site sees the revenue potential in selling guest posting placements. However, to truly maximize the value of your investment, you must consider higher quality than at least 65 DR. (The only exception is if the site is newer, hyper-relevant, and has solid SEO. In that case, it‚Äôs OK to invest in a lower DR site.) What does it mean for you? Guest posting can be effective if you focus on high-end sites with real users and exposure. However, that will cost way more than $220. As you‚Äôll see next, low-cost guest post sites are low quality and not worth the money (because most are garbage.) 3. Only 6% of ‚ÄúGuest Posting Sites‚Äù Are Quality (After the Helpful Content Update) Whenever someone offers me a guest post on a site, I add it to my database. Each time, I find that the sites have had considerable dips in traffic since March 2024. For example: This site was already trending down from previous Helpful Content updates, but it got blasted down to zero in March. After about nine months of work, I‚Äôve accumulated over 1,100 sites. About a week ago, I analyzed the full list to determine which still had viable traffic and were still quality sites. My simple criteria was: Domain Rating above 65 Monthly Organic Traffic is above 10,000 This isn‚Äôt a scientific analysis but a directionally accurate way to determine quality. The list went from 1,104 to just 68 sites! That‚Äôs an extraordinary drop. Does this mean a site with low traffic or low DR isn‚Äôt valuable? No. A site could be brand new and still growing, which you need to evaluate. But if you are paying for a link, this must be factored into the link building pricing. What does it mean for you? No, guest blogging isn‚Äôt dead. But, you need to evaluate sites more closely. And if you can, avoid pitching to sites you find on lists. Instead, try to find real value from relevant sites in your niche. I outline an entire pitching strategy in my video below: 4. The Average Cost of a Quality Guest Post is $609 When I took my list of guest posts and link insertion sites and removed all low-quality sites, I was left with 68 sites. These had an average DR of 80 and DA of 81. When I averaged that pricing, it came out to $609.25. Most are general news sites like the ones you see below: For guest posting, I‚Äôd always think about it from the perspective of the value to your brand, not just a link building exercise. Where will customers actually see me? Where can I show thought leadership and a strong association with a brand? For instance, we‚Äôve had guest posts on the BuzzStream blog from digital PR agency thought leaders, like Darren Kingman. We are a digital PR tool. That is a strong association. The other thing to consider is that at $600, you get into what some agencies get as an average cost per link(CPL) for a content-led link building campaign. If you net 6-8 quality links on average when assets cost $5k on an asset, your CPL is about $600-700. This is the better investment because it‚Äôs an asset you own that lives on your site. When your link building and SEO teams work together, you can really start to reap the ROI. Statistics posts like this one, which you are reading, require little investment but can yield high returns because they have a high intent to link and can accrue links naturally over time. What does it mean for you? True high-end guest posting is much more expensive and has less ROI than content-led digital PR. But now, let‚Äôs look at link insertions. 5. The Average Cost of Buying a Link Insertion is $141 This price comes from my analysis of shared link insertion prices from 174 sites across various industries. As I discussed in my link insertion post, these links are only impactful when placed on high-quality and highly relevant sites. So, digging into this stat a bit more, you can see a drop-off in pricing at 80+ DR. But, this reflects the limited, high-quality sites open to link insertions (rather than thinking that it‚Äôs cheaper to insert a link on a DR 90 site than it is on a DR 11.) What does it mean for you? Realistically, a ‚Äúhigh-quality‚Äù link that will move the needle will likely be above DR 75+, so assume this value skews higher. I‚Äôve said ‚Äúhigh-quality‚Äù a lot at this point, so let‚Äôs look at this next. 6. Top-Tier or High-End Links Can Cost Over $1000 This link building statistic about the cost of high-end links is an estimate from Ross Hudgens of Siege Media based on years of industry experience. (I also worked at Siege Media for six years, so I trust this number.) Although it‚Äôs not specified in the article, high-end is in that 75+ range I mentioned above, and it most likely refers to news publications achieved through digital PR. But as journalists are getting laid off, and the ones who are left are starting to write more and more affiliate-driven SEO content so that publications can stay afloat, there are fewer ‚Äúlinks‚Äù to go around. High-end news links from publishers like local news stations to sites like CNet, Time, and the New York Times are in high demand right now. So, realistically, those high-end links are valued at closer to $2-2.5K. What does it mean for you? Ultimately, your cost per link for high-end links like this comes down to the strength of a campaign. You aren‚Äôt going to hit home runs every campaign, either. So, give yourself (or an agency) a chance to prove a trust cost. 7. Most In-House SEOs‚Äô Typical Monthly Budget is $5,000-$12,500 So, this one is technically a mix of two stats found in the report from Aira: The most common budget range for in-house SEOs was $10,000-$25,000. Over 80% of in-house SEOs dedicate up to 50% of their SEO budget to link building. Combining the two, the most common monthly budget for in-house SEOs is between $5k and $12.5k. Although this is, again, not super scientific, it‚Äôs at least directionally accurate. As stated by Aira, the budget in question here is ‚Äúexternal agencies, freelancers or contractors.‚Äù With these budgets, can brands actually make an impact? Yes, but I‚Äôd think less about the cost per link and more about investing in a link-building asset. As we saw in our analysis of digital PR‚Äôs impact on SEO, a content-led digital PR campaign clearly has an effect‚Äîespecially when correlated with search volume. For example, when WalletHub‚Äôs best cities for families post is published and (most likely pitched), you can see a concurrent boost in organic traffic and links. Then, you can see subsequent traffic boosts each time they update it. A study like this could easily cost $10,000-15,000, but it has over 650 unique links, putting that cost per link at something like $23. And if you were doing this study yourself (instead of hiring out), you‚Äôd see that cost per link drop even lower. You invest in one asset, and it gains links and traffic over time. You can even see the indirect impact of a keyword on the traffic to product pages. For example, look at the traffic boost to a product page that is linked to this highly successful digital PR campaign about dirty car interiors: There‚Äôs no search volume attached to the piece itself, but it has a meaningful impact on organic traffic. And if your content‚Äôs topic is relevant to customers, and your site is correctly set up to convert those visitors, you can attach revenue to digital PR. That, for me, is a more meaningful way to spend a link building budget than buying individual link placements on sites or guest posts. However, as we‚Äôll see in the next stat, how many links do most campaigns actually generate? What does it mean for you? Consider where and how you spend your budget. Guest posts and link insertions will only move the needle if they are on high-quality sites and in areas of the site that get a lot of visibility. Investing in a content marketing asset and pitching it via digital PR gives you more opportunities to impact SEO. Doing it yourself in-house is even cheaper. 8. Most Campaigns Get 1-9 Links (and That‚Äôs Considered a Success) If you asked anyone inside of SEO or even digital PR how many links are a success, I‚Äôd say that virtually everyone would agree that around ten links is a solid campaign. That‚Äôs precisely what Aira found in their study. Aira asked its respondents how many links they generated in campaigns in the last 12 months, and a majority said 1-9 links. Then, they asked how many links you would want to get that are deemed a success. Tying this into our previous statistic, numbers may look bleak if you spend $5-10k monthly on a link-building asset and only get 1-9 links back. Stakeholders or clients might feel the same. But it‚Äôs easy to fall into the quantity of links over the quality trap. As mentioned before, high-end links that can move the needle are costly. To support this more with data, let‚Äôs examine the quality of links on most sites. I took a quick list of five random top-ranking sites in different industries. Then, I used Ahref‚Äôs ‚ÄòBest Links‚Äô feature to determine how many quality links they have. The filters are set only to show referring domains from DR 75+ sites that get an estimated 10,000 organic visits or more per month. When we compare the total number of links to the filtered total of ‚Äúbest‚Äù links, there is a decrease of almost 98%! This doesn‚Äôt show link relevancy, freshness, or other factors influencing a link‚Äôs value. But on the face of it, it just goes to show that quantity isn‚Äôt a reliable number. What does it mean for you? Campaigns may get fewer links, but if they are quality links, that‚Äôs all that matters. 9. At Least 66.5% of Links to Sites in the Last 9 Years Are Dead Link rot is a real thing. Although Ahrefs found that 66.5% of links in the last nine years have been lost to crawl errors, dropped pages, and redirects, I‚Äôve found that most links last about two years. There are a few main things to take from this strategically. First, you‚Äôll always need to build links to keep up. Second, although some lost links are beyond your control, you can mitigate some of this by being more selective about how and where you build links. Always ask if it makes sense to get a link from a site. And specifically, does it make sense in the area of this site? For example, say you could get a backlink to CNN‚Äôs coupon area. Recently, Google has started penalizing sites that exploit site reputation abuse (‚Äúthird-party content produced primarily for ranking purposes and without close oversight of a website owner‚Äù). So, if the site‚Äôs content is unclear, your link will be lost sooner than expected. Last, one of the major points the Google leak documentation made is that Google may prefer freshness‚Äînot only fresh content but also links from site-specific areas that get refreshed. So, does this mean that links that have been up for a while are worth less? Quite possibly. It makes sense that Google wants fresh signals about a site, given how quickly information can change. What does it mean for you? Think of it like farming. You can‚Äôt plant a crop and expect it to last a lifetime. You must continually grow every year, refresh the soil, etc. To keep up with decaying links, you must continually build links to grow your link profile consistently. Focusing on high-quality news sites may also help lower link decay. 10. Backlinks (and Higher DR) Correlate With More Traffic Ahref‚Äôs search traffic study found that both backlinks and a higher DR correlate with more traffic. This is somewhat surprising statistic for link builders because Google reps have recently mentioned things like ‚Äúlinks aren‚Äôt as important‚Äù (although they‚Äôve then backtracked.)

Both Authority Hacker and Backlinko really show the impact of links on ranking #1. But what about just being on page one? Isn‚Äôt that enough?

We have some data, but this is a changing landscape.

The stuff that sticks out is when users go the extra mile to provide something useful or surprising ‚Äî either in an email or a piece of content.

As the digital landscape evolves, the focus on securing high-quality backlinks is as crucial as ever. Effective link building does more than boost your search rankings; it strengthens your domain authority and increases traffic to your website. In an era where the quality of your links often outweighs the quantity, grasping the strategic importance of these connections is vital. In this article, we‚Äôll highlight five link-building services that can help you strengthen your SEO efforts and improve your visibility in search engine results. Why Is Link Building Essential for Your SEO in 2025? Link building is crucial for SEO because it signals to search engines that your website is reliable, authoritative, and valuable. Search engines like Google use backlinks as votes of confidence, meaning the more high-quality backlinks you acquire, the more likely you are to rank higher. In 2025, the SEO landscape shifted towards focusing on relevant, authoritative backlinks rather than collecting as many as possible. A well-rounded, sustainable link-building strategy will help your website maintain long-term success and stay competitive in a crowded digital marketplace. To strengthen your online presence further, consider investing in the top 5 link-building services for SEO in 2025.

Here‚Äôs what you should focus on: Reputation and Track Record The agency‚Äôs reputation speaks volumes about its capabilities. Look for services with a proven track record of delivering results. Client testimonials, case studies, and reviews can offer insight into past performance. A reputable agency should be transparent and confident in showcasing its successful campaigns. Quality of Backlinks Not all backlinks are equal. High-quality backlinks come from relevant, authoritative websites that align with your industry. When assessing a service, make sure they prioritize editorial links, which are more valuable than links obtained through directories or link farms. Ensure that the agency avoids using shortcuts like spammy backlinks that can lead to penalties from search engines. White-Hat SEO Practices Only choose agencies that follow white-hat SEO techniques. These methods comply with Google‚Äôs guidelines, ensuring sustainable growth for your website. Black-hat techniques, like link farming and keyword stuffing, might offer short-term gains, but they can lead to penalties and diminished trust with search engines in the long run. Transparency and Reporting A professional agency should provide clear and detailed reports on the backlinks it acquires. Ask how frequently they update clients on progress, and ensure you track domain authority and search rankings improvements. Transparent reporting ensures you‚Äôre always in the loop and can adjust your strategy as needed. Customized Approach to Your Business Needs The best link-building services understand that every business is unique. Whether you‚Äôre a small business or a large enterprise, the agency should tailor its approach to your specific SEO goals. A generic, one-size-fits-all approach is less effective than a customized strategy, considering factors like your target audience, niche, and market competition. Scalability and Flexibility Your business will grow, and so should your link building strategy. Ensure your chosen service can scale its efforts to meet your increasing demands as your SEO needs evolve. A flexible service will allow for adjustments in strategy as trends and search engine algorithms change. Content Strategy Alignment Link building isn‚Äôt just about acquiring backlinks; it should work hand in hand with your content strategy. A good agency will help you build links to high-quality content that addresses your audience‚Äôs needs. They should be skilled at securing backlinks to valuable blog posts, resource pages, or pillar content that naturally draws in relevant traffic. Communication and Support Strong communication is essential throughout the link building process. Look for agencies that offer responsive customer support and are easy to reach. Whether you have questions, need updates, or want to discuss strategy changes, your agency should be readily available to assist you. Focusing on these factors can help you select a link-building service that aligns with your business goals, follows ethical practices, and delivers high-quality, relevant backlinks that can help improve your search engine rankings and overall SEO performance. Are All Link Building Services the Same? Link-building services vary. Some focus on editorial backlinks, others on guest posts, influencer outreach, or link insertions. Agencies might offer targeted strategies for specific industries or broader approaches. The right service depends on your business goals, budget, and competition level. Choosing a service that adapts to your needs will lead to more effective results and a robust backlink profile. Can I trust link-building agencies to follow ethical practices? You can trust reputable link-building agencies that employ white hat methods. Ethical agencies acquire natural, high-quality backlinks from authoritative sites and avoid practices like paid link schemes that violate search engine guidelines. Always check an agency‚Äôs reputation and request case studies or client testimonials to verify their commitment to ethical standards. Choosing agencies that prioritize ethical practices is essential for a sustainable SEO strategy and for maintaining your site‚Äôs reputation.

Step #1 ‚Äì Generate A List Of Targets To get started with this link building tactic, you need to find the websites for services and products that you could provide a testimonial for. Each site needs to- Be relevant to your niche Have existing testimonials Actually be a product/service that you use So start by writing a list of tools/products/services you are already using in your business. If you‚Äôre struggling to come up with any ideas you could cheat a little bit. Look at what other tools and services people in your niche use‚Ä¶. And you‚Äôll quite often find that a free trial will be on offer to test the tool‚Ä¶ Step #2 ‚Äì Find The Right Person To Pitch To Now we need to find the right person to contact.

Support New Business Growth Crowdfunding is one of the most unknown and underused link building strategy. Someone who is raising money for their business through crowdfunding will often place a link to each person that contributed‚Ä¶ See where this is going yet? The donation can be anything from $1 up to thousands of dollars and can be found for all kinds of projects across all niches. Meaning this is a brilliant opportunity to get link back to your website. There are two ways to obtain links. Donor links Package links Donor links are from pages that publish the details of all donors, including a link to the donor‚Äôs website: Package links are when links are offered as part of a package you get if you donate a certain amount of money: Sounds easy right? It really is! How To Find Crowdfunding Sites For Link Building There are hundreds of crowdfunding sites out there to search through. But we are gonna take a closer look at Indiegogo. There is a simple way to look for crowdfunding projects without trawling through the site. Simply do a Google search using these keywords: site:[indiegogo.com] inurl:projects +‚Äúlink to your‚Äù site:[indiegogo.com] inurl:projects +‚Äùdonor page‚Äù You need to be prepared to sift through the results‚Ä¶ But they will be vastly narrowed down to projects that either add donor‚Äôs details to their donor page or projects that offer links in exchange for your donation. You will be able to find a bunch of crowdfunding projects that are affordable and an easy way to get links to your website. You might even benefit from some of their other perks too! This Section In Short Crowdfunding is an underused link building strategy. You can build backlinks from crowdfunding projects by either: Being included on their donation page Receiving a link back as part of a package Make a list of crowdfunding sites to search. Use Google searches to narrow down opportunities: site:[website URL] inurl:projects +‚Äúlink to your‚Äù site:[website URL] inurl:projects +‚Äùdonor page‚Äù And find crowdfunding pages within your niche that allow you to build links and are within your budget. Check out my full crowdfunding link building tutorial to learn more. 3. Sponsor Real World Events Did you know that you can use events as part of your link building strategy? They could be local, national, and international events that you can utilize to build links. There are two ways you can do this‚Ä¶ #1 ‚Äì Hosting An Event You can create your own event and then have it advertised on third-party event sites which then link back to your website. These links are usually extremely relevant and come from high authority sites. #2 ‚Äì Sponsoring An Event Alternatively, you can sponsor an event being hosted by someone else as most hosts will list (and link to) all their sponsors. This is also a great way to build good relationships with other authorities in your industry. I am going to give you a quick glimpse of how to find events to sponsor. This type of event link building offers all the benefits without actually having to host an event. How To Find Events To Sponsor Firstly you need to figure out what type of events are relevant to your niche. This could be workshops, conferences, lectures, clubs etc‚Ä¶ Then you need to make a list of where these events are likely to be hosted online. Depending on the event, local events may be hosted on local sites, but national or international events can usually be found on sites like: Eventful MeetUp Events.org To find events that you can sponsor‚Ä¶ You can use these Google searches for each of the hosting sites: site:[website URL] inurl:events +‚Äúsponsors‚Äù site:[website URL] inurl:events +‚Äúlink to your‚Äù site:[website URL] inurl:registration +‚Äúsponsors‚Äù site:[website URL] +‚Äúsponsors‚Äù site:[website URL] + ‚Äúdonation‚Äù site:[website URL] + ‚Äúbecome a sponsor‚Äù And if you want to pull in more specific results, just add a keyword at the end: Search through the results and make a list of any events that are relevant to your niche. Rinse and repeat for each event hosting site using each search term. Once you have exhausted all opportunities and set up your sponsorships for each event, you can set up Google alerts to find any new sponsorship opportunities as they appear. This Section In Short Event link building is a great way to get backlinks that Google approves of. There are two ways of building these links: Hosting An Event: Creating an event where third-party event websites link back Sponsoring An Event: Sponsoring a relevant event & receiving a link as a sponsor Finding events to sponsor is easy to do with these Google searches: site:[website URL] inurl:events +‚Äúsponsors‚Äù site:[website URL] inurl:events +‚Äúlink to your‚Äù site:[website URL] inurl:registration +‚Äúsponsors‚Äù site:[website URL] +‚Äúsponsors‚Äù site:[website URL] + ‚Äúdonation‚Äù site:[website URL] + ‚Äúbecome a sponsor‚Äù Just add the event hosting site (eg. eventful.com/) and if you need to narrow down the search to more relevant events‚Ä¶ Simply add another keyword to the search. Rinse and repeat for a range of event hosting sites for each search term or check out my step by step guide to event link building. 4. Show Your Presence On Social Media Social media backlinks are generally considered by a lot of people to be a waste of time. This is because they are nofollow and considered to carry little SEO benefit but still form an important base of links most genuine businesses should have. Healthy link profiles include both follow links and legitimate nofollow. So I am going to show you 5 quick wins from Facebook (accessible for all skill levels) but there are 23 more from other networks listed in my full social media backlinks guide. How To Build Backlinks With Facebook As Facebook is the most popular network I thought we would start there‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs dive in: #1 ‚Äì Your Profile‚Äôs ‚ÄòIntro‚Äô The best way to connect a new visitor to your website is through your ‚ÄòIntro‚Äô. Just add your website URL in your basic settings and be sure to have it set to public. #2 ‚Äì Your ‚ÄòAbout‚Äô Page Description As well as adding your website to your about page contact info, you can also place your website URL in the description: By having your website appear twice on your about me page‚Ä¶ You are doubling your chances of sending traffic to your website from there. #3 ‚Äì Include A Website Link In All Posts For those articles, you are posting that aren‚Äôt directing traffic to your site‚Ä¶ You can still add a link as a reference. This can easily be worked into all your blog posts. #4 ‚Äì Page Buttons You can add page buttons underneath your cover photo. These can be optimised to send traffic to your website when clicked: Simply add or edit your page button and input your website‚Äôs URL. #5 ‚Äì Picture Descriptions You can add your website to the description of an image (which most people don‚Äôt do). This works best when done for your profile picture and cover photo: Don‚Äôt forget to update this each time you change your pictures.

But here‚Äôs a snap shot of how you can build social media backlinks on Facebook: Your Profile‚Äôs ‚ÄòInfo‚Äô Tab Your ‚ÄòAbout‚Äô Page Description Include A Website Link In All Posts Page Buttons Picture Descriptions 5. Strategic Guest Blogging Boring right? But guest blogging is one of the most popular, simplest and most effective link building strategy there is‚Ä¶ The funny thing is most people label guest posting as a white hat strategy. But Google has given us multiple warnings- And more importantly: John Mueller advised to nofollow guest post links. My point is: ALL FORMS of link building are against Google‚Äôs guidelines. And in the end‚Ä¶ All Google‚Äôs ranking algorithm wants to see is specific metrics. It‚Äôs your job to feed it those metrics. And guest posts will always work very well as a marketing function to build a target audience and feed the algorithm the metrics it wants. The idea behind guest blogging is simple: You create a high-quality piece of content You add a few links in the content piece pointing to your site You get the piece published in another site, preferably one with a high DA I won‚Äôt lie to you: Guest blogging isn‚Äôt what it‚Äôs used to be a few years ago. It‚Äôs much much harder to earn a genuine link placement in 2025. Most site owners have caught on and often want payments to place your guest posts. Which is nothing more than just a long-winded way to buy links right? And some people are much much more direct- That‚Äôs not to say that guest blogging isn‚Äôt worth doing and it‚Äôs definetly easier if you use one of the recommended guest posting services. Feel free to walk that line however you choose. To get started with guest blogging, there are 5 steps you need to follow: Find your prospects Qualify the right blogs Send outreach emails Create great content Build relationships Step #1 ‚Äì Find Your Prospects The first step to getting started with guest blogging is to find your prospects. These are the websites where you are going to publish your piece of content. Ideally, you want to publish on sites with high DA (domain authority), page authority and high organic traffic. But how do you find them? Two words ‚Äì SEO Footprints. Think of SEO Footprints as digital imprints left around the web. You can leverage these footprints by using search operators to find potential sites for guest blogging. Here‚Äôs an example: Let‚Äôs say you run a site about sustainable living. Go to Google and do a quick search using the following: ‚Äúproudly powered by WordPress‚Äù intitle:sustainability This will bring up a list of WordPress websites about sustainability. The reason this works so well is because lots of websites built on WordPress have blogs. This gives you a whole list of potential guest blogging opportunities on niche-relevant sites. Cool, right? And the best part is there are so many different variations of SEO footprints to try. Here are a few of the top ones: ‚Äúproudly powered by WordPress‚Äù ‚Äì intitle:niche keyword ‚Äúproudly powered by WordPress‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äúniche keywords‚Äù ‚Äúyour keyword‚Äù + ‚Äúcomments‚Äù ‚Äúyour keyword‚Äù + ‚Äúleave a comment‚Äù ‚Äúyour keyword‚Äù + inurl:blog ‚Äúyour keyword‚Äù + inurl:blog ‚Äúpost a comment‚Äù ‚Äúyour keyword‚Äù+ site:.edu ‚Äúforums register‚Äù ‚Äúyour keyword‚Äù + site:.edu ‚Äúregister i am over 13 years of age forum‚Äù ‚Äúyour keyword‚Äù + site:.edu ‚Äúdiscussion board register‚Äù Make sure you check out our complete SEO footprints tutorial to get even more ways to find strategic guest blogging opportunities for link building. Step #2 ‚Äì Qualify The Blogs With the list, you have created, run each site through Ahrefs (who just so happen to be the best backlink checker) to check their domain authority. Take the first website in your list, and go to the Site Explorer. Once you are there, add the website you want to analyze and click on the orange loop icon. In the menu, take the number that you see in the center of the screen, under the DR sign. Add these numbers to your list and repeat the process until you have the DR of every site. Step #3 ‚Äì Reaching Out With the list of websites, go to each site and contact the manager to check if they are interested in your pitch. To contact each blog you can use the following template: Subject: Writing for SITE Hi [NAME], I was checking out [SITE] today and found the guest post you published from [GUEST POSTER‚ÄôS NAME]. I loved that article, I just shared it with my audience. I‚Äôd love to be your next guest author. Here are some topics that I think would do really well with [SITE] readers: Topic #1 Topic #2 Topic #3 Do any of these ideas look good? Let me know your thoughts. Best, [YOUR NAME] I highly recommend that you customise that a little bit and also take a peek at any specific guest post guidelines they may have. Step #4 ‚Äì Creating Incredible Guest Post Content Once you get accepted, start creating the content. It‚Äôs important to write with the blog‚Äôs target audience in mind! If you need to dig into the site‚Äôs audience, read the comments from previous articles and check the blog posts that got the most shares and comments. Don‚Äôt hold anything back, write everything you know about the subject- Add quotes Add links to other relevant articles from the site Add images and videos Add anything you can to make it amazing Take a look at this incredible guest post by James Johnson- He teaches everything he knows about becoming a freelance writer. And he holds nothing back! Once you finish writing it, send it their way. Step #5 ‚Äì Build Relationships A great thing about guest blogging is that it helps you build relationships with the blog managers. Creating a network is important if you ever need help promoting a specific piece of content from your site and you want to publish often in a high-authority site. BONUS TIP: Engage Their Audience One of the most overlooked benefits of guest blogging is the ability to open direct conversation with someone elses audience. What does that mean? Well it means that you should- Respond to all of the comments on your guest post personally Monitor shares on social media then reply to say thanks Setup Google Alerts for the URL to engage anywhere it gets shared If you do those 3 things alongside your guest post, you will accelerate your results. This Section In Short Guest blogging can take some time, and due to the amount of content you have to create, it can get messy. Find your prospects with the help of the Google footprints I previously shared Then, qualify every blog you found to make sure you are pitching to the right place. Reach out to the right people using the template I shared as a basis. Send your guest post and get it published. Engage with their audience as much as possible. It can be a pretty long-winded process, but it is an effective one. It will allow you to find, qualify and reach out to hundreds of blogs in just a few clicks. If you need help with guest posting, check out one of these guest posting services. 6. Help Clean Up The Web Most websites have hundreds, if not thousands, of links. Many of them link internally, while others do it externally. For whatever reason, these links can easily break and stop working. Most site owners don‚Äôt realize this when it happens, and it can break their user experience, reputation, and SEO performance. In fact as I am writing this, I just did a quick check on my own blog- And I have broken links from an old a/b experiment where I didn‚Äôt redirect the test page! Finding broken links represent a magnificent occasion for you to- Find link building opportunities (especially for niche edits & link inserts) Build a relationship with the website owner Add value to them And most importantly, get a high-quality link All of that makes this one of my favorite types of link building. Broken link building is the tactic Nikolay Stoyanov used to acquire 15 links in 1 day with a 15% conversion rate. It really is one of the most underutilized link building strategies in my opinion. Here is how to do it- Step #1 ‚Äì Define A Target Website The first step of this link building strategy is to define the website where you want to get a link from. You can pick any website you want, but I‚Äôd recommend you be realistic about your expectations. The chances of getting a link from Inc or The New York Times after you find a broken link are slim to none. The best websites where you can get a link from are personal blogs and small companies. The site owners and managers will be grateful for your help, and they will likely thank you with a link. Step #2 ‚Äì Finding The Broken Links Once you have created the list of the websites you want to get a link from, you need to start searching for the broken links. To do so, you can use seo tool like: Check My Links and Ahrefs. Check My Links is a useful Chrome Extension that finds for links within a specific page. Ahrefs will analyze the site thoroughly and will make a list of all the broken links it has. You see exactly how to find broken links with these tools here. Step #3 ‚Äì Contacting The Blog Manager Once you finished analyzing all the sites and pages, it‚Äôs time to contact the blog owner or manager to let them know about the broken link. Your first goal should be to create a relationship and build some trust . If you have a web page that‚Äôs relevant to the page where you find the broken link, then let them know about it. Don‚Äôt do it to get a link; do it to help them have a great page for their readers. If you don‚Äôt have something relevant to offer, focus on fixing the broken link at hand. It‚Äôs likely you will find more opportunities later on to ask for a link. You‚Äôll be amazed at the types of responses you receive from people! This Section In Short The key to broken link building is finding the right sites to pitch. Begin by picking websites that you‚Äôd want to get a link from. You can find the sites with the most amount of broken links with the help of a tool like Ahrefs, or you can just check case-by-case with the help of Check My Links. Learn how to scale this broken link building process with my full broken link building tutorial. 7. Harness Internal Link Building Internal link building is one of my favorite link building strategies. Not only do you have complete control over where you place your links‚Ä¶ But: It is super easy to implement and carries very little to no risk of penalisation. What Is An Internal Link? An internal link is a link placed on one web page that links to another web page of the same domain. For example- This is an internal link that points to a page on this blog This is an external link that points to a page on a different domain And because they are internal links that we place on our own sites and pages- It means that we have complete control over them and the anchor text that we use. Why Internal Links Are So Valuable Internal links carry a lot of value and most people don‚Äôt realise just how much they help your SEO. Here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶ Internal links help Google discover new hight quality content Internal links help Google to better understand & rank your content Internal links can be used to control Google‚Äôs spiders Internal links can be used to direct traffic to important high converting pages This the most underused link building strategy in SEO. And I don‚Äôt know why- Because it‚Äôs very easy to implement! 3x Internal Link Building Strategies There are 3x internal link building strategies that I like to use when it comes to placing links‚Ä¶ My quick and easy method My power process Manual linking process I‚Äôm going to show you the manual linking process here.

It might take a while ‚Äì but I promise you it‚Äôs worth it. And remember‚Ä¶ Internal link building is not a set and forget process.

And be sure to add internal links to each new post you publish from old content. Learn more with my internal link building tutorial that also includes a downloadable smart template to help you out. 8. Replicate Your Competitors Best Links This is one of my favourite white hat link building strategies! Your competitors spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours developing their link building strategies to acquire high-quality links. If you have a small budget, why would you try to compete with those companies? You‚Äôd most likely fail to get the same quality of links your competitors get. Instead of hitting your head against your wall in anger and deciding to work harder, you should work smarter. The idea I‚Äôm suggesting is simple: Spy on your competitors and steal their best backlinks. You are basically drafting with your competitors; they work hard to get links, you follow them and get the same ones. This is also one of our most effective ecommerce link building strategies in terms of win rate and overall time invested per earned link- Let‚Äôs take a quick look at the process: Step #1 ‚Äì Make A List Of Your Competitors Start by making a list of 5x competitor that ranks for a keyword you want to rank for. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they are bigger or smaller than you. They will all teach you some valuable lessons. Step #2 ‚Äì Analyse Their Backlinks Once you have your list of competitors, you will need to analyse their backlinks profile. You can download my intelligent spreadsheets that make this a really easy process. As you already know, my favorite tool for this is Ahrefs but my spreadsheets also work with SEMRush and SEO Powersuite. If for any reason you don‚Äôt want to use my intelligent sheets, you can do it manually‚Ä¶ The analysis is simple: go to Ahrefs‚Äô Site Explorer, add the link from one of your competitors, and click the orange loop button. In the left-side menu, click on the link that says Backlinks. In here you can see all the inbound links my competitor (in this case, a paleo blog) got. To make your analysis more interesting, click on the little arrow next to ‚ÄúNofollow‚Äù button in the bar above the results. Here you can organize the links by those that are ‚ÄúDofollow‚Äù, ‚ÄúNonfollow‚Äù, ‚ÄúUGC‚Äù and ‚ÄúSponsored‚Äù. This Section In Short Reverse engineering is simple, yet it takes some creativity from your end. You want to know why your competitor got its links; your analysis will try to uncover just that. Start by making a list of your competitors in the top 5 search results. Then analyse the backlinks with the help of my awesome spreadsheets. Or do it manually with Ahrefs, go to the Site Explorer, add your competitor, and once you have the results, click on the link that says Backlinks. There, click on the Link type button, and export the whole list of URLs you get. With this list, you want to open each link and figure out how and why they got the link. Ask yourself, is it because of the quality of their content? Is it because they offer something unique and valuable? You want to know the why behind the link. Learn more about this strategy with my full competitorbacklink analysis tutorial. 9. Get Listed In Link Roundups Link Roundups are blog posts that ‚Äúround up‚Äù links to awesome content. This is usually done daily weekly or monthly and often includes a short write up. Take a look at this blog post example from Matt Diggity‚Äôs Blog: You can find these types of blog posts in nearly every niche. All you need to do is- Find websites that regularly post roundups Pitch your content for the next roundup It doesn‚Äôt get much easier than that! Step #1 ‚Äì How To Find Link Roundup Sites Use Google to do the following searches‚Ä¶ keyword +link roundup keyword +monthly roundup keyword +roundup keyword +weekly roundup ‚Ä¶and then go through the results and add any suitable roundup sites to a spreadsheet. For example: If I wanted to build links to my Ecommerce SEO guide‚Ä¶ My Google search would look like this- In a matter of seconds, I have a bunch of relevant search results to add to my list- https://www.semrush.com/blog/ecommerce-link-building/ https://outreachmonks.com/link-roundups/ https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-build-links-and-traffic-from-link-roundups/ Repeat the search for each suggestion mentioned above. And once you have a list ready‚Ä¶ Step #2 ‚Äì Pitching Your Awesome Content Find the contact email address for each site by following my email address lookup guide or using a tool like FindThatLead. Or if you‚Äôve got time search their site for an email address or contact form. The problem with this kind of pitch though‚Ä¶ Is that the bloggers that publish these kind of roundup posts get emails like this every day- So if you want to get featured‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶you need to do something a little bit different. I suggest that you use a 2 pronged approach- Send the initial outreach email (that doesn‚Äôt ask for anything) Then pivot to the pitch You could send something that looks like this at first- Hey, I am a frequent reader of #INSERTROUNDUPNAME# ‚Äì thanks for putting it together every #WEEK/MONTH/YEAR#. When you featured #INSERTURL# it really helped me to #INSERTRESULT# Looking forward to the next roundup! Thanks again for putting it together all the time! ‚Äì Your Name Once they reply, then pivot with your link pitch. And that‚Äôs it! Link Roundup Link Building is so simple and easy to carry out. All you need is- Some hight quality content A bit of elbow grease to find roundups Not only will you get a link, but you‚Äôll likely receive targeted traffic as well! This Section In Short There are loads of blogs out there who regularly publish link roundup posts which you can take advantage of. Identify blogs in your niche who publish link roundups Find contact information Pitch your content Be sure that any content you pitch is top quality & adds value to their roundup. 10. Get Listed On Resource Pages Most websites have a resource page where they list all the tools, guides and articles that they use or have found useful. I have a few of them across the blog- The Best Free SEO Tools To Super Charge Your Search Rankings 42x SEO Tutorials That Will Take You To The Next Level 24x SEO Tools That Will Fast Track Your Success And it‚Äôs not just me. Take a look at this resource page from the Goinswriter team‚Äì This is in essence just a list of links with some added commentary. I‚Äôm sure you have figured out where this is going right? The concept is pretty simple- Find resource pages in your niche Reach out to them asking for a link Voila! Step #1 ‚Äì How To Find Resource Pages Jump over to Google and search these terms- Keyword +inurl:links Keyword +useful resources Keyword +helpful resources Keyword +inurl:useful links Keyword +useful links If I wanted to build links to a meditation blog, it would look like this- Just look through the results and pick any that fit your content. Add those to a spreadsheet and you‚Äôre ready for the next step. Step #2 ‚Äì Pitching Your Content The next step is to reach out to the website and pitch them your content to add to the resource page. This is easier said than done. But just like we did earlier, it‚Äôs better to take a 2 pronged approach to get the link placed- Send the first outreach email Then pivot to the link placement It really is as easy as that! The more people you ask, the more links you will get. Simples! This Section In Short A simple, yet effective link building strategy is Resource Link Building. Find resource pages that relate to your article, tool, product or service and pitch to the website owner to feature your content. Give them useful evergreen content and earn a valuable backlink in return. Want to learn more about how to do this? Check out my full guide to resource page link building. 11. Create Data Driven Content Creating content that drives attention has become harder and harder as time goes by. To create relevant and useful content, it needs to stand out. Using unique data to develop and enrich your content can help it stand out, command the attention it deserves, and attract the link your website needs. Take a look at this post- I built 12 tests sites across 12 of the most popular hosts to try and find out who really offers the fastest WordPress hosting. Then I published the results (data)- Now, this took quite a lot of time, effort, and money to do. But it answered a common question with data and attracted a bunch of links- I also shared data with my case studies and my monthly income reports for the same reason. To get started, here are a few ideas you can implement to make your content more data-driven: Do an in-depth research on your industry Create tests of tools/services in your niche Find unique data and use it on your content Survey your email list subscribers, industry peers, or customers Create attractive and unique graphics from your own or someone else‚Äôs data There is no step-by-step plan for this. Rather, it‚Äôs a process you need to follow. Before you hit the ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù button, ask yourself- Does this article has any unique data? If not, try to add some so you give it more substance. This Section In Short You can make this as simple or as complicated as you want. Find a common question in your niche Then compile data to answer that question That might mean running your own tests or aggregating the data of others. You could even take someone else‚Äôs data and do a better job of presenting it with graphics/infographics/interactive charts/tables. This approach also works well with the NewsJacking strategy above because it‚Äôs often easy to compile quick reference data/infographics when a story breaks. 12. Listen To The Web If you have a respected brand in your industry or location, people likely write about you. When someone mentions you online, an opportunity to get a link appears. Unfortunately, many times people forget to link to your site when they mention you but fixing that is easy! Step #1 ‚Äì Look For Your Company Online In a moment I am going to show you an easy way to automate this but for now, I want you to understand the process. First, search your site on Google- ‚Äúsearchlogistics.com‚Äù -inurl:searchlogistics.com This returns a list of results that mention my domain name but excludes all the pages from my own blog. Be creative with your keywords; people may misspell your company‚Äôs name more often than you think. Step #2 ‚Äì Find Your Mentions Make a list of all the sites you find where you have gotten a mention. Check for- mentions without a link with broken links or with incorrect links that lead to a 404 Step #3 ‚Äì Outreach Once you have created the list of websites, find the person who‚Äôs responsible for managing it. If you are in doubt, use the ‚ÄúContact‚Äù page, but it‚Äôs better to go straight to the person who can actually fix the mention. Once you have the email addresses you can just use this template- But don‚Äôt forget to customize it first! Hey [NAME], I‚Äôve seen you mentioned us on [PAGE]. Thanks a lot! By the way, I‚Äôve seen you haven‚Äôt linked to our site. It‚Äôd be of great use for your readers if you added a link, so they can learn more about us. Here‚Äôs the link you can use: [URL]. Thanks a lot, [YOUR NAME] And of course: Don‚Äôt forget to send those follow-ups- Or you‚Äôll be leaving a bunch of links on the table! Step #4 ‚Äì Setting Up Automatic Alerts Many people won‚Äôt answer you because it‚Äôs been a long time since they published the page where they mentioned you. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to respond fast whenever you get a mention without a link. To do this, you should learn how to setup Google Alerts so you‚Äôre always ready. But in essence ‚Äì every time you see you get a new mention alert, make sure to check there‚Äôs a link. Otherwise, contact the writer or editor of the website and ask for the link, using the template shown before. This way, you‚Äôll be able to bring high-quality links to your site with no effort from your end. This Section In Short Link reclamation is one of the easiest link building techniques there is. You are basically getting links from people who already like you, so your pitching will be more effective than usual. To get started, look for mentions your company or site has gotten via Google. Whenever you find a mention without a link, contact the site owner asking for a link with my template. Finally, set up alerts with the help of Google Alerts to make sure never to miss any future mentions. This is one of the more quick win link building strategies that nearly anyone can apply instantly! 13. Recycle Old Domain Names One of my favourite link building hacks is to recycle expired domains. Why? Because some aged domains‚Äì Have great backlink profiles Have high levels of authority Are highly relevant to your niche Have valuable backlinks from places like Wikipedia, BBC, New York Times etc Regardless of which side of the stupid white hat/black hat argument you subscribe to- You should be wielding their power for your business. And if you‚Äôre are super smart about it‚Ä¶ You can buy them for the same price as new domains! (more about that later) What To Do With Expired Domains You have a few choices when you buy an expired domain- Build a new site on the expired domain with instant authority Use the expired domains to link to your site Redirect the expired domain to pass on link juice to your site We used one to build out a new site in November which has already taken 15 number 1 positions and featured snippets- This is why so many people use them because if you build out a site on a highly authoritative and relevant expired domain it can give you a serious head start. But the trick is finding RELEVANT expired domains that have authority in the first place. How To Find Expired Domains Finding expired domains can be as hard or as easy as you want it to be. I have used every tool under the sun over the years and for me the best tools by far are Domain Hunter Gatherer and Spamzilla. They will help you to find expired domains and pull in key metrics for you. What you do with an expired domain once you have found it is up to you. This Section In Short Expired domains that have great backlink profiles are worth their weight in gold! Buying these domains and either building your websites on them or using them to create links is an intelligent strategy. Learn more about expired domains and how to recycle them. PRO TIPS: Selling expired domain names is a great way to make extra income. Learn how to sell a domain name. 14. Hijack News Events One of the key elements of any effective link building campaign is creating great website content that stands out and commands attention. Creating content that has a higher likelihood of going viral, however, isn‚Äôt easy. Instead of wasting time trying to figure out what people may like, you can take what people are already talking about and use that as inspiration for your next piece of content. This tactic is known as ‚Äúnewsjacking‚Äù because you are taking advantage of a popular topic from the news and using it to create and promote your own content. A classic case of newsjacking is what Oreo did in the Superbowl 2013. After the energy shut down in the stadium, they tweeted the following: This Oreo tweet got more than 15,880 retweets and 6,200 favourites in just a few hours. They also got a lot of press (and the links that come with it), including mentions in The Huffington Post, Wired, and CNET. You can use this same press to get links to your site. Here‚Äôs how you do it: Step #1 ‚Äì Find Popular Topics Research what people talk about with the help of Google Trends. You can put your own ideas in the top search bar and see their popularity, or write down the list of topics that show up on the homepage. The young royals, for example, represent a great idea for many articles, especially if you are in the design, beauty, and fashion industry. Go broad with your list of ideas; later you will analyse them in more detail. Step #2 ‚Äì Brainstorm content ideas With your initial list of popular topics, brainstorm a list of content articles. You want both to have some relationship with one another. For example, if you have a blog that talks about leadership, you could write something related to Tim Cook‚Äôs leadership style- 5 Things Sales Managers Can Learn From Tim Cook How Tim Cook‚Äôs Leadership Style Will Accelerate Your Success The 3 Leadership Mistakes Tim Cook Made That You Must Avoid At All Costs Step #3 ‚Äì Define And Create The Content With your list of content ideas, define one that suits you best, and start creating the content fast. Time is your friend in here. The popularity of some topics lasts only a few weeks, if not days. Make sure to have the article done no longer than a week after you found it. Step #4 ‚Äì Publish And Promote Talking about a popular topic makes promotion easier, but it‚Äôs not a fool-proof way of creating viral content. As it always happens with content, focus on the promotion. Don‚Äôt promote it on social media alone; use it as a way to get the attention of people both within and outside your industry. Reach outside your industry. Using the previous example, you may want to reach blogs that talk about technology, business, Apple, and Uber. This Section In Short Newsworthy content always attract attention (and link opportunities). It‚Äôs really easy to do and there are new opportunities every single week! To find newsjacking opportunities, get to know what people are searching for with Google Trends. You can go deeper with the help of the categories section. With the results, brainstorm potential ideas that tie your expertise with the news. Create the content fast, and aggressively promote it. Remember, people like sharing content that‚Äôs new and unique; newsjacking can help you achieve just that. 15. Massage Influencers Ego‚Äôs Dale Carnegie said once ‚ÄúYou can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.‚Äù Similarly, if you play on people‚Äôs ego, the chances of getting links from high-authority sites increase significantly. First, you build relationships with people that manage high-traffic, high authority blogs/sites. As you know, relationships are one of the key ways to get anything in life, including links. If you get influencers interested in your article, they will feel invested. Once you publish it, they will feel ‚Äúpushed‚Äù to share and link to it, even if you don‚Äôt tell them. This is the basis of influencer marketing. Creating ego bait list posts (ELP for short) has helped get 2000 views to a blog that wasn‚Äôt even getting 50 visits per month. In the image above you can see the sessions went up 482%, while the pageviews increased 1382% and the users 624%. If you want to get started with ego bait, follow these steps: Step #1 ‚Äì Pick Your Headline As I recommend on the ego bait list article, start with the headline, which sums up the idea of the article. You can use the following structure: Number + (industry) blogs/experts + promise/keyword Pick a list of influencers from your industry, and define the promise that your article will fulfil. You can pick as little or as many as you want, depending on how much in-depth you want to go with each influencer. For example you might want to ask what everyone‚Äôs favorite link building tools are. That makes it easy for the influencers to know exactly what they are expected to write about. The audience will also appreciate a specific piece of advice they can use on their own. Step #2 ‚Äì Define the Question Even though you have already specified the main promise of the article, you want to define the question you will ask the influencers. Be specific and focus on one question only. Influencers are busy people, that‚Äôs why you want them to answer your question with the greatest level of detail possible. When defining the question, remember what people would want to read about. Pick a unique angle for the question. For example, if I were to do another SEO ego bait article like the one I showed you before, I‚Äôd focus on something like the best local SEO strategy or favourite 30 minutes SEO quick win. It still focuses on SEO but has a new angle that brings a good answer to people‚Äôs problems. Step #3 ‚Äì The Experts Create a list of all the experts you want to contact. You can brainstorm the experts or search on Google for other expert roundups in your niche & with similar target markets- Make sure to define experts that have sites with high domain authority & page authority as well as social following. This will make the sharing as well as the linking more powerful. After you define the list of experts, find their contact information. Look in their personal websites, use LinkedIn, or simply ask them on Twitter. Step #4 ‚Äì Outreach Finally, send the influencers an email with your question. If they don‚Äôt answer right away, wait a few days. Follow up two times more, and if they don‚Äôt answer, ask a different influencer. Don‚Äôt be a pushy link builder. You should get a response rate of around 10-25%, maybe more if you already have a relationship with some of the influencers or if you are one yourself. This Section In Short Creating egobait articles is simple. The key to success is to structure your article for success and be organized with the pitching. Start by defining your headline. It must convey the value right away so people want to click on it. You can use the structure I recommend which is: Number + (industry) blogs/experts + promise/keyword Then, define the question (or questions) you want to ask to the influencers. Make sure to make it super concise and actionable. Then, define the experts you want to contact. Finally, contact the experts with the question you previously defined. Once you publish your content, make sure you contact the experts so they help you promote it. Also, remember it‚Äôs all about the relationships; once an expert knows about your site, it will be easier for them to link to your site in the future (assuming they like your site).

Outsource Your Link Building I won‚Äôt lie to you‚Ä¶ Even with the best link building strategies ‚Äì link building is still hard work and takes time. That‚Äôs why so many people choose to outsource link building to reputable link building services. That way you can focus on running your business while letting SEO pros take care of your links. What To Look For In A Link Building Service You don‚Äôt just want to hire any link building service. You only want to hire a link building agency you can trust. Here are some things to think about: Quality control ‚Äì Only use link building services that are very particular with the quality of links they build Proof of results ‚Äì The best link building services will share case studies and client results that you can review Genuine outreach ‚Äì Avoid services that share their site lists or build links on sites that have ‚Äúwrite for us‚Äù pages Transparent techniques ‚Äì You should have a good idea of the techniques and strategies the service uses to build links Customer service ‚Äì Hire a link building service that has good customer service and support Remember: With link building services ‚Äì You get what you pay for. Don‚Äôt go looking for the cheapest link buliding service you can find. Hire a link building service with a reputation for delivering quality links and the results showing they know what they are doing. Our Favourite Link Building Service LinksThatRank is the best link building service we can recommend. They have a strong reputation for delivering quality links to clients and even display case study screenshots on their home page to prove it. But what we really love about LinksThatRank is that they are laser-focused on quality control. Unlike other services they- Have a 23-point quality control checklist to ensure only links that help you rank Select target anchor text to make sure you don‚Äôt trigger an anchor text penalty Offer 1,000 words of premium written content with each placement by default Every site they build links on is guaranteed to have real organic traffic from Google Add internal and external links to placement pages to appear more natural Operate a strict blacklist of sites with ‚Äúwrite for us‚Äù pages and known guest post farms and PBN networks Have built their own link building tool to identify toxic backlinks Crazy, right? LinksThatRank also offers a quick and easy buying process that‚Äôs entirely hands-off. All you have to do is choose the links you need and tell them which keyword you are targeting ‚Äì they take care of the rest. How Many Backlinks Do I Need? The truth is that there is no blanket answer to this question. Every single keyword, niche and search result is different. The good news is that it‚Äôs possible to calculate how many backlinks you need to rank for a target keyword. Just follow this simple 3-step process. Step #1 ‚Äì Determine Which Pages You Need To Build Backlinks To Don‚Äôt build links to every page on your site. Why? Because not every page is worth it. Link building costs time and money. You should only build links to pages that include keywords that generate real leads and sales for your business. So, the first thing you need to do is work out which pages they are. Here‚Äôs how we do it: Look at pages where you currently rank in spots 2 to 30 for your target keyword Find the top pages that make you the most money (not traffic) Create a shortlist of those pages and take note of them You can do all of this for free using Google Search Console. Need some more help? Watch the video below for more information. Step #2 ‚Äì Calculate The ‚ÄúLink Gap‚Äù Now that you have your shortlist of target keywords, you can calculate the ‚Äúlink gap‚Äù. The link gap is simply the minimum number of links you need to rank in the top 3 positions on Google for your target keyword. For this, you will need a premium tool like Ahrefs or Semrush. Here‚Äôs how the process works: Type your target keywords into your chosen tool (I prefer Ahrefs) Look at the links above DR20 pointing to the first three ranking URLs Write down the number of links for each ranking URL The video below outlines this entire process in more detail. Now you are ready for the last step‚Ä¶ Step #3 ‚Äì Build The Links You Need Link building is the trickiest part for many SEOs. Some people feel comfortable enough to do it themselves with any of the above link-building strategies. Others prefer to outsource it to a service link LinksThatRank. You decide which method is right for your business. Either way‚Ä¶ You now know which pages to build links to and how many links you need to build. The last step is simply to build them. How To Get Your Links Indexed? Getting your newly built links indexed is essential. Why? They will only help your rankings if Google knows they exist. Now you could let Google naturally find them or‚Ä¶ You can take matters into your own hands to make sure they do. Using a proven indexing strategy and service is the easiest way to index your links quickly. So I tested 14 popular indexing methods to see which was best. You can see the full results of the backlink indexer test here. For those who don‚Äôt want to read‚Ä¶ There were only 3 services that worked: Indexing Expert ‚Äì 99.5% indexing success rate Omega Indexer ‚Äì 88.5% indexing success rate (but costs 75% less than Indexing Expert) SpeedLinks VIP ‚Äì 72.5% indexing success rate These were the only services that got Google to visit the URL and index the junk content we added to random pages.

Leverage Testimonials In Your Niche This link building strategy almost seems too easy‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs because it is! With just a few minutes work you can create powerful homepage links to your website. Let me explain what I mean. By reaching out and offering positive testimonials for services and/or products that you are using‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶you can have your testimonial published with a link back to your website. Here is one of my testimonials based on the findings of my Surfer SEO review‚Äì Which includes a backlink to my homepage. So let‚Äôs take a quick look at how to build a number of external links with testimonials! Step #1 ‚Äì Generate A List Of Targets To get started with this link building tactic, you need to find the websites for services and products that you could provide a testimonial for. Each site needs to- Be relevant to your niche Have existing testimonials Actually be a product/service that you use So start by writing a list of tools/products/services you are already using in your business. If you‚Äôre struggling to come up with any ideas you could cheat a little bit. Look at what other tools and services people in your niche use‚Ä¶. And you‚Äôll quite often find that a free trial will be on offer to test the tool‚Ä¶ Step #2 ‚Äì Find The Right Person To Pitch To Now we need to find the right person to contact. Sometimes you can just ask via the contact form on the website and some will even have dedicated testimonial submission forms. Or you can use one of these handy extensions to help you find email addresses- FindThatLead Hunter Then you can add each email address to your spreadsheet and start to contact everyone on your list with a pitch. Step #3 ‚Äì Send Your Testimonial Pitch Before spending time creating a testimonial‚Ä¶ First pitch them with the idea that they could have a testimonial created by you.

Support New Business Growth Crowdfunding is one of the most unknown and underused link building strategy. Someone who is raising money for their business through crowdfunding will often place a link to each person that contributed‚Ä¶ See where this is going yet? The donation can be anything from $1 up to thousands of dollars and can be found for all kinds of projects across all niches. Meaning this is a brilliant opportunity to get link back to your website. There are two ways to obtain links. Donor links Package links Donor links are from pages that publish the details of all donors, including a link to the donor‚Äôs website: Package links are when links are offered as part of a package you get if you donate a certain amount of money: Sounds easy right? It really is! How To Find Crowdfunding Sites For Link Building There are hundreds of crowdfunding sites out there to search through. But we are gonna take a closer look at Indiegogo. There is a simple way to look for crowdfunding projects without trawling through the site. Simply do a Google search using these keywords: site:[indiegogo.com] inurl:projects +‚Äúlink to your‚Äù site:[indiegogo.com] inurl:projects +‚Äùdonor page‚Äù You need to be prepared to sift through the results‚Ä¶ But they will be vastly narrowed down to projects that either add donor‚Äôs details to their donor page or projects that offer links in exchange for your donation. You will be able to find a bunch of crowdfunding projects that are affordable and an easy way to get links to your website. You might even benefit from some of their other perks too! This Section In Short Crowdfunding is an underused link building strategy. You can build backlinks from crowdfunding projects by either: Being included on their donation page Receiving a link back as part of a package Make a list of crowdfunding sites to search. Use Google searches to narrow down opportunities: site:[website URL] inurl:projects +‚Äúlink to your‚Äù site:[website URL] inurl:projects +‚Äùdonor page‚Äù And find crowdfunding pages within your niche that allow you to build links and are within your budget. Check out my full crowdfunding link building tutorial to learn more. 3. Sponsor Real World Events Did you know that you can use events as part of your link building strategy? They could be local, national, and international events that you can utilize to build links. There are two ways you can do this‚Ä¶ #1 ‚Äì Hosting An Event You can create your own event and then have it advertised on third-party event sites which then link back to your website. These links are usually extremely relevant and come from high authority sites. #2 ‚Äì Sponsoring An Event Alternatively, you can sponsor an event being hosted by someone else as most hosts will list (and link to) all their sponsors. This is also a great way to build good relationships with other authorities in your industry. I am going to give you a quick glimpse of how to find events to sponsor. This type of event link building offers all the benefits without actually having to host an event. How To Find Events To Sponsor Firstly you need to figure out what type of events are relevant to your niche. This could be workshops, conferences, lectures, clubs etc‚Ä¶ Then you need to make a list of where these events are likely to be hosted online. Depending on the event, local events may be hosted on local sites, but national or international events can usually be found on sites like: Eventful MeetUp Events.org To find events that you can sponsor‚Ä¶ You can use these Google searches for each of the hosting sites: site:[website URL] inurl:events +‚Äúsponsors‚Äù site:[website URL] inurl:events +‚Äúlink to your‚Äù site:[website URL] inurl:registration +‚Äúsponsors‚Äù site:[website URL] +‚Äúsponsors‚Äù site:[website URL] + ‚Äúdonation‚Äù site:[website URL] + ‚Äúbecome a sponsor‚Äù And if you want to pull in more specific results, just add a keyword at the end: Search through the results and make a list of any events that are relevant to your niche. Rinse and repeat for each event hosting site using each search term. Once you have exhausted all opportunities and set up your sponsorships for each event, you can set up Google alerts to find any new sponsorship opportunities as they appear. This Section In Short Event link building is a great way to get backlinks that Google approves of. There are two ways of building these links: Hosting An Event: Creating an event where third-party event websites link back Sponsoring An Event: Sponsoring a relevant event & receiving a link as a sponsor Finding events to sponsor is easy to do with these Google searches: site:[website URL] inurl:events +‚Äúsponsors‚Äù site:[website URL] inurl:events +‚Äúlink to your‚Äù site:[website URL] inurl:registration +‚Äúsponsors‚Äù site:[website URL] +‚Äúsponsors‚Äù site:[website URL] + ‚Äúdonation‚Äù site:[website URL] + ‚Äúbecome a sponsor‚Äù Just add the event hosting site (eg. eventful.com/) and if you need to narrow down the search to more relevant events‚Ä¶ Simply add another keyword to the search. Rinse and repeat for a range of event hosting sites for each search term or check out my step by step guide to event link building. 4. Show Your Presence On Social Media Social media backlinks are generally considered by a lot of people to be a waste of time. This is because they are nofollow and considered to carry little SEO benefit but still form an important base of links most genuine businesses should have. Healthy link profiles include both follow links and legitimate nofollow. So I am going to show you 5 quick wins from Facebook (accessible for all skill levels) but there are 23 more from other networks listed in my full social media backlinks guide. How To Build Backlinks With Facebook As Facebook is the most popular network I thought we would start there‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs dive in: #1 ‚Äì Your Profile‚Äôs ‚ÄòIntro‚Äô The best way to connect a new visitor to your website is through your ‚ÄòIntro‚Äô. Just add your website URL in your basic settings and be sure to have it set to public. #2 ‚Äì Your ‚ÄòAbout‚Äô Page Description As well as adding your website to your about page contact info, you can also place your website URL in the description: By having your website appear twice on your about me page‚Ä¶ You are doubling your chances of sending traffic to your website from there. #3 ‚Äì Include A Website Link In All Posts For those articles, you are posting that aren‚Äôt directing traffic to your site‚Ä¶ You can still add a link as a reference. This can easily be worked into all your blog posts. #4 ‚Äì Page Buttons You can add page buttons underneath your cover photo. These can be optimised to send traffic to your website when clicked: Simply add or edit your page button and input your website‚Äôs URL. #5 ‚Äì Picture Descriptions You can add your website to the description of an image (which most people don‚Äôt do). This works best when done for your profile picture and cover photo: Don‚Äôt forget to update this each time you change your pictures.

But here‚Äôs a snap shot of how you can build social media backlinks on Facebook: Your Profile‚Äôs ‚ÄòInfo‚Äô Tab Your ‚ÄòAbout‚Äô Page Description Include A Website Link In All Posts Page Buttons Picture Descriptions 5. Strategic Guest Blogging Boring right? But guest blogging is one of the most popular, simplest and most effective link building strategy there is‚Ä¶ The funny thing is most people label guest posting as a white hat strategy. But Google has given us multiple warnings- And more importantly: John Mueller advised to nofollow guest post links. My point is: ALL FORMS of link building are against Google‚Äôs guidelines. And in the end‚Ä¶ All Google‚Äôs ranking algorithm wants to see is specific metrics. It‚Äôs your job to feed it those metrics. And guest posts will always work very well as a marketing function to build a target audience and feed the algorithm the metrics it wants. The idea behind guest blogging is simple: You create a high-quality piece of content You add a few links in the content piece pointing to your site You get the piece published in another site, preferably one with a high DA I won‚Äôt lie to you: Guest blogging isn‚Äôt what it‚Äôs used to be a few years ago. It‚Äôs much much harder to earn a genuine link placement in 2025. Most site owners have caught on and often want payments to place your guest posts. Which is nothing more than just a long-winded way to buy links right? And some people are much much more direct- That‚Äôs not to say that guest blogging isn‚Äôt worth doing and it‚Äôs definetly easier if you use one of the recommended guest posting services. Feel free to walk that line however you choose. To get started with guest blogging, there are 5 steps you need to follow: Find your prospects Qualify the right blogs Send outreach emails Create great content Build relationships Step #1 ‚Äì Find Your Prospects The first step to getting started with guest blogging is to find your prospects. These are the websites where you are going to publish your piece of content. Ideally, you want to publish on sites with high DA (domain authority), page authority and high organic traffic. But how do you find them? Two words ‚Äì SEO Footprints. Think of SEO Footprints as digital imprints left around the web. You can leverage these footprints by using search operators to find potential sites for guest blogging. Here‚Äôs an example: Let‚Äôs say you run a site about sustainable living. Go to Google and do a quick search using the following: ‚Äúproudly powered by WordPress‚Äù intitle:sustainability This will bring up a list of WordPress websites about sustainability. The reason this works so well is because lots of websites built on WordPress have blogs. This gives you a whole list of potential guest blogging opportunities on niche-relevant sites. Cool, right? And the best part is there are so many different variations of SEO footprints to try. Here are a few of the top ones: ‚Äúproudly powered by WordPress‚Äù ‚Äì intitle:niche keyword ‚Äúproudly powered by WordPress‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äúniche keywords‚Äù ‚Äúyour keyword‚Äù + ‚Äúcomments‚Äù ‚Äúyour keyword‚Äù + ‚Äúleave a comment‚Äù ‚Äúyour keyword‚Äù + inurl:blog ‚Äúyour keyword‚Äù + inurl:blog ‚Äúpost a comment‚Äù ‚Äúyour keyword‚Äù+ site:.edu ‚Äúforums register‚Äù ‚Äúyour keyword‚Äù + site:.edu ‚Äúregister i am over 13 years of age forum‚Äù ‚Äúyour keyword‚Äù + site:.edu ‚Äúdiscussion board register‚Äù Make sure you check out our complete SEO footprints tutorial to get even more ways to find strategic guest blogging opportunities for link building. Step #2 ‚Äì Qualify The Blogs With the list, you have created, run each site through Ahrefs (who just so happen to be the best backlink checker) to check their domain authority. Take the first website in your list, and go to the Site Explorer. Once you are there, add the website you want to analyze and click on the orange loop icon. In the menu, take the number that you see in the center of the screen, under the DR sign. Add these numbers to your list and repeat the process until you have the DR of every site. Step #3 ‚Äì Reaching Out With the list of websites, go to each site and contact the manager to check if they are interested in your pitch. To contact each blog you can use the following template: Subject: Writing for SITE Hi [NAME], I was checking out [SITE] today and found the guest post you published from [GUEST POSTER‚ÄôS NAME]. I loved that article, I just shared it with my audience. I‚Äôd love to be your next guest author. Here are some topics that I think would do really well with [SITE] readers: Topic #1 Topic #2 Topic #3 Do any of these ideas look good? Let me know your thoughts. Best, [YOUR NAME] I highly recommend that you customise that a little bit and also take a peek at any specific guest post guidelines they may have. Step #4 ‚Äì Creating Incredible Guest Post Content Once you get accepted, start creating the content. It‚Äôs important to write with the blog‚Äôs target audience in mind! If you need to dig into the site‚Äôs audience, read the comments from previous articles and check the blog posts that got the most shares and comments. Don‚Äôt hold anything back, write everything you know about the subject- Add quotes Add links to other relevant articles from the site Add images and videos Add anything you can to make it amazing Take a look at this incredible guest post by James Johnson- He teaches everything he knows about becoming a freelance writer. And he holds nothing back! Once you finish writing it, send it their way. Step #5 ‚Äì Build Relationships A great thing about guest blogging is that it helps you build relationships with the blog managers. Creating a network is important if you ever need help promoting a specific piece of content from your site and you want to publish often in a high-authority site. BONUS TIP: Engage Their Audience One of the most overlooked benefits of guest blogging is the ability to open direct conversation with someone elses audience. What does that mean? Well it means that you should- Respond to all of the comments on your guest post personally Monitor shares on social media then reply to say thanks Setup Google Alerts for the URL to engage anywhere it gets shared If you do those 3 things alongside your guest post, you will accelerate your results. This Section In Short Guest blogging can take some time, and due to the amount of content you have to create, it can get messy. Find your prospects with the help of the Google footprints I previously shared Then, qualify every blog you found to make sure you are pitching to the right place. Reach out to the right people using the template I shared as a basis. Send your guest post and get it published. Engage with their audience as much as possible. It can be a pretty long-winded process, but it is an effective one. It will allow you to find, qualify and reach out to hundreds of blogs in just a few clicks. If you need help with guest posting, check out one of these guest posting services. 6. Help Clean Up The Web Most websites have hundreds, if not thousands, of links. Many of them link internally, while others do it externally. For whatever reason, these links can easily break and stop working. Most site owners don‚Äôt realize this when it happens, and it can break their user experience, reputation, and SEO performance. In fact as I am writing this, I just did a quick check on my own blog- And I have broken links from an old a/b experiment where I didn‚Äôt redirect the test page! Finding broken links represent a magnificent occasion for you to- Find link building opportunities (especially for niche edits & link inserts) Build a relationship with the website owner Add value to them And most importantly, get a high-quality link All of that makes this one of my favorite types of link building. Broken link building is the tactic Nikolay Stoyanov used to acquire 15 links in 1 day with a 15% conversion rate. It really is one of the most underutilized link building strategies in my opinion. Here is how to do it- Step #1 ‚Äì Define A Target Website The first step of this link building strategy is to define the website where you want to get a link from. You can pick any website you want, but I‚Äôd recommend you be realistic about your expectations. The chances of getting a link from Inc or The New York Times after you find a broken link are slim to none. The best websites where you can get a link from are personal blogs and small companies. The site owners and managers will be grateful for your help, and they will likely thank you with a link. Step #2 ‚Äì Finding The Broken Links Once you have created the list of the websites you want to get a link from, you need to start searching for the broken links. To do so, you can use seo tool like: Check My Links and Ahrefs. Check My Links is a useful Chrome Extension that finds for links within a specific page. Ahrefs will analyze the site thoroughly and will make a list of all the broken links it has. You see exactly how to find broken links with these tools here. Step #3 ‚Äì Contacting The Blog Manager Once you finished analyzing all the sites and pages, it‚Äôs time to contact the blog owner or manager to let them know about the broken link. Your first goal should be to create a relationship and build some trust . If you have a web page that‚Äôs relevant to the page where you find the broken link, then let them know about it. Don‚Äôt do it to get a link; do it to help them have a great page for their readers. If you don‚Äôt have something relevant to offer, focus on fixing the broken link at hand. It‚Äôs likely you will find more opportunities later on to ask for a link. You‚Äôll be amazed at the types of responses you receive from people! This Section In Short The key to broken link building is finding the right sites to pitch. Begin by picking websites that you‚Äôd want to get a link from. You can find the sites with the most amount of broken links with the help of a tool like Ahrefs, or you can just check case-by-case with the help of Check My Links. Learn how to scale this broken link building process with my full broken link building tutorial. 7. Harness Internal Link Building Internal link building is one of my favorite link building strategies. Not only do you have complete control over where you place your links‚Ä¶ But: It is super easy to implement and carries very little to no risk of penalisation. What Is An Internal Link? An internal link is a link placed on one web page that links to another web page of the same domain. For example- This is an internal link that points to a page on this blog This is an external link that points to a page on a different domain And because they are internal links that we place on our own sites and pages- It means that we have complete control over them and the anchor text that we use. Why Internal Links Are So Valuable Internal links carry a lot of value and most people don‚Äôt realise just how much they help your SEO. Here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶ Internal links help Google discover new hight quality content Internal links help Google to better understand & rank your content Internal links can be used to control Google‚Äôs spiders Internal links can be used to direct traffic to important high converting pages This the most underused link building strategy in SEO. And I don‚Äôt know why- Because it‚Äôs very easy to implement! 3x Internal Link Building Strategies There are 3x internal link building strategies that I like to use when it comes to placing links‚Ä¶ My quick and easy method My power process Manual linking process I‚Äôm going to show you the manual linking process here. It takes a bit more time to apply‚Ä¶ ..but you‚Äôll end up with a powerful internal linking structure and a dangerous amount of know how. However, you can still learn the other 2x easier methods in my internal link building tutorial. The Manual Internal Link Building Process First up you need to make a list of your URL‚Äôs and the target keywords. Then use Google to search for blog posts on your website where you could add relevant links. site:yourdomain.com keyword Add your links (try to use exact match anchor text) and then repeat for each URL/keyword in your list. It might take a while ‚Äì but I promise you it‚Äôs worth it. And remember‚Ä¶ Internal link building is not a set and forget process. You must be sure to add internal links from old content to new content every time you publish! This Section In Short Take Internal linking seriously! It can do wonders for your SEO and you can use them to- Help Google find your content and rank it better Use them to direct traffic to high conversion pages Use the manual internal link building strategy to have complete control over your link placements. And be sure to add internal links to each new post you publish from old content. Learn more with my internal link building tutorial that also includes a downloadable smart template to help you out. 8. Replicate Your Competitors Best Links This is one of my favourite white hat link building strategies! Your competitors spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours developing their link building strategies to acquire high-quality links. If you have a small budget, why would you try to compete with those companies? You‚Äôd most likely fail to get the same quality of links your competitors get. Instead of hitting your head against your wall in anger and deciding to work harder, you should work smarter. The idea I‚Äôm suggesting is simple: Spy on your competitors and steal their best backlinks. You are basically drafting with your competitors; they work hard to get links, you follow them and get the same ones. This is also one of our most effective ecommerce link building strategies in terms of win rate and overall time invested per earned link- Let‚Äôs take a quick look at the process: Step #1 ‚Äì Make A List Of Your Competitors Start by making a list of 5x competitor that ranks for a keyword you want to rank for. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they are bigger or smaller than you. They will all teach you some valuable lessons. Step #2 ‚Äì Analyse Their Backlinks Once you have your list of competitors, you will need to analyse their backlinks profile. You can download my intelligent spreadsheets that make this a really easy process. As you already know, my favorite tool for this is Ahrefs but my spreadsheets also work with SEMRush and SEO Powersuite. If for any reason you don‚Äôt want to use my intelligent sheets, you can do it manually‚Ä¶ The analysis is simple: go to Ahrefs‚Äô Site Explorer, add the link from one of your competitors, and click the orange loop button. In the left-side menu, click on the link that says Backlinks. In here you can see all the inbound links my competitor (in this case, a paleo blog) got. To make your analysis more interesting, click on the little arrow next to ‚ÄúNofollow‚Äù button in the bar above the results. Here you can organize the links by those that are ‚ÄúDofollow‚Äù, ‚ÄúNonfollow‚Äù, ‚ÄúUGC‚Äù and ‚ÄúSponsored‚Äù. This Section In Short Reverse engineering is simple, yet it takes some creativity from your end. You want to know why your competitor got its links; your analysis will try to uncover just that. Start by making a list of your competitors in the top 5 search results. Then analyse the backlinks with the help of my awesome spreadsheets. Or do it manually with Ahrefs, go to the Site Explorer, add your competitor, and once you have the results, click on the link that says Backlinks. There, click on the Link type button, and export the whole list of URLs you get. With this list, you want to open each link and figure out how and why they got the link. Ask yourself, is it because of the quality of their content? Is it because they offer something unique and valuable? You want to know the why behind the link. Learn more about this strategy with my full competitorbacklink analysis tutorial. 9. Get Listed In Link Roundups Link Roundups are blog posts that ‚Äúround up‚Äù links to awesome content. This is usually done daily weekly or monthly and often includes a short write up. Take a look at this blog post example from Matt Diggity‚Äôs Blog: You can find these types of blog posts in nearly every niche. All you need to do is- Find websites that regularly post roundups Pitch your content for the next roundup It doesn‚Äôt get much easier than that! Step #1 ‚Äì How To Find Link Roundup Sites Use Google to do the following searches‚Ä¶ keyword +link roundup keyword +monthly roundup keyword +roundup keyword +weekly roundup ‚Ä¶and then go through the results and add any suitable roundup sites to a spreadsheet. For example: If I wanted to build links to my Ecommerce SEO guide‚Ä¶ My Google search would look like this- In a matter of seconds, I have a bunch of relevant search results to add to my list- https://www.semrush.com/blog/ecommerce-link-building/ https://outreachmonks.com/link-roundups/ https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-build-links-and-traffic-from-link-roundups/ Repeat the search for each suggestion mentioned above. And once you have a list ready‚Ä¶ Step #2 ‚Äì Pitching Your Awesome Content Find the contact email address for each site by following my email address lookup guide or using a tool like FindThatLead. Or if you‚Äôve got time search their site for an email address or contact form. The problem with this kind of pitch though‚Ä¶ Is that the bloggers that publish these kind of roundup posts get emails like this every day- So if you want to get featured‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶you need to do something a little bit different. I suggest that you use a 2 pronged approach- Send the initial outreach email (that doesn‚Äôt ask for anything) Then pivot to the pitch You could send something that looks like this at first- Hey, I am a frequent reader of #INSERTROUNDUPNAME# ‚Äì thanks for putting it together every #WEEK/MONTH/YEAR#. When you featured #INSERTURL# it really helped me to #INSERTRESULT# Looking forward to the next roundup! Thanks again for putting it together all the time! ‚Äì Your Name Once they reply, then pivot with your link pitch. And that‚Äôs it! Link Roundup Link Building is so simple and easy to carry out. All you need is- Some hight quality content A bit of elbow grease to find roundups Not only will you get a link, but you‚Äôll likely receive targeted traffic as well! This Section In Short There are loads of blogs out there who regularly publish link roundup posts which you can take advantage of. Identify blogs in your niche who publish link roundups Find contact information Pitch your content Be sure that any content you pitch is top quality & adds value to their roundup. 10. Get Listed On Resource Pages Most websites have a resource page where they list all the tools, guides and articles that they use or have found useful. I have a few of them across the blog- The Best Free SEO Tools To Super Charge Your Search Rankings 42x SEO Tutorials That Will Take You To The Next Level 24x SEO Tools That Will Fast Track Your Success And it‚Äôs not just me. Take a look at this resource page from the Goinswriter team‚Äì This is in essence just a list of links with some added commentary. I‚Äôm sure you have figured out where this is going right? The concept is pretty simple- Find resource pages in your niche Reach out to them asking for a link Voila! Step #1 ‚Äì How To Find Resource Pages Jump over to Google and search these terms- Keyword +inurl:links Keyword +useful resources Keyword +helpful resources Keyword +inurl:useful links Keyword +useful links If I wanted to build links to a meditation blog, it would look like this- Just look through the results and pick any that fit your content. Add those to a spreadsheet and you‚Äôre ready for the next step. Step #2 ‚Äì Pitching Your Content The next step is to reach out to the website and pitch them your content to add to the resource page. This is easier said than done. But just like we did earlier, it‚Äôs better to take a 2 pronged approach to get the link placed- Send the first outreach email Then pivot to the link placement It really is as easy as that! The more people you ask, the more links you will get. Simples! This Section In Short A simple, yet effective link building strategy is Resource Link Building. Find resource pages that relate to your article, tool, product or service and pitch to the website owner to feature your content. Give them useful evergreen content and earn a valuable backlink in return. Want to learn more about how to do this? Check out my full guide to resource page link building. 11. Create Data Driven Content Creating content that drives attention has become harder and harder as time goes by. To create relevant and useful content, it needs to stand out. Using unique data to develop and enrich your content can help it stand out, command the attention it deserves, and attract the link your website needs. Take a look at this post- I built 12 tests sites across 12 of the most popular hosts to try and find out who really offers the fastest WordPress hosting. Then I published the results (data)- Now, this took quite a lot of time, effort, and money to do. But it answered a common question with data and attracted a bunch of links- I also shared data with my case studies and my monthly income reports for the same reason. To get started, here are a few ideas you can implement to make your content more data-driven: Do an in-depth research on your industry Create tests of tools/services in your niche Find unique data and use it on your content Survey your email list subscribers, industry peers, or customers Create attractive and unique graphics from your own or someone else‚Äôs data There is no step-by-step plan for this. Rather, it‚Äôs a process you need to follow. Before you hit the ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù button, ask yourself- Does this article has any unique data? If not, try to add some so you give it more substance. This Section In Short You can make this as simple or as complicated as you want. Find a common question in your niche Then compile data to answer that question That might mean running your own tests or aggregating the data of others. You could even take someone else‚Äôs data and do a better job of presenting it with graphics/infographics/interactive charts/tables. This approach also works well with the NewsJacking strategy above because it‚Äôs often easy to compile quick reference data/infographics when a story breaks. 12. Listen To The Web If you have a respected brand in your industry or location, people likely write about you. When someone mentions you online, an opportunity to get a link appears. Unfortunately, many times people forget to link to your site when they mention you but fixing that is easy! Step #1 ‚Äì Look For Your Company Online In a moment I am going to show you an easy way to automate this but for now, I want you to understand the process. First, search your site on Google- ‚Äúsearchlogistics.com‚Äù -inurl:searchlogistics.com This returns a list of results that mention my domain name but excludes all the pages from my own blog. Be creative with your keywords; people may misspell your company‚Äôs name more often than you think. Step #2 ‚Äì Find Your Mentions Make a list of all the sites you find where you have gotten a mention. Check for- mentions without a link with broken links or with incorrect links that lead to a 404 Step #3 ‚Äì Outreach Once you have created the list of websites, find the person who‚Äôs responsible for managing it. If you are in doubt, use the ‚ÄúContact‚Äù page, but it‚Äôs better to go straight to the person who can actually fix the mention. Once you have the email addresses you can just use this template- But don‚Äôt forget to customize it first! Hey [NAME], I‚Äôve seen you mentioned us on [PAGE]. Thanks a lot! By the way, I‚Äôve seen you haven‚Äôt linked to our site. It‚Äôd be of great use for your readers if you added a link, so they can learn more about us. Here‚Äôs the link you can use: [URL]. Thanks a lot, [YOUR NAME] And of course: Don‚Äôt forget to send those follow-ups- Or you‚Äôll be leaving a bunch of links on the table! Step #4 ‚Äì Setting Up Automatic Alerts Many people won‚Äôt answer you because it‚Äôs been a long time since they published the page where they mentioned you. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to respond fast whenever you get a mention without a link. To do this, you should learn how to setup Google Alerts so you‚Äôre always ready. But in essence ‚Äì every time you see you get a new mention alert, make sure to check there‚Äôs a link. Otherwise, contact the writer or editor of the website and ask for the link, using the template shown before. This way, you‚Äôll be able to bring high-quality links to your site with no effort from your end. This Section In Short Link reclamation is one of the easiest link building techniques there is. You are basically getting links from people who already like you, so your pitching will be more effective than usual. To get started, look for mentions your company or site has gotten via Google. Whenever you find a mention without a link, contact the site owner asking for a link with my template. Finally, set up alerts with the help of Google Alerts to make sure never to miss any future mentions. This is one of the more quick win link building strategies that nearly anyone can apply instantly! 13. Recycle Old Domain Names One of my favourite link building hacks is to recycle expired domains. Why? Because some aged domains‚Äì Have great backlink profiles Have high levels of authority Are highly relevant to your niche Have valuable backlinks from places like Wikipedia, BBC, New York Times etc Regardless of which side of the stupid white hat/black hat argument you subscribe to- You should be wielding their power for your business. And if you‚Äôre are super smart about it‚Ä¶ You can buy them for the same price as new domains! (more about that later) What To Do With Expired Domains You have a few choices when you buy an expired domain- Build a new site on the expired domain with instant authority Use the expired domains to link to your site Redirect the expired domain to pass on link juice to your site We used one to build out a new site in November which has already taken 15 number 1 positions and featured snippets- This is why so many people use them because if you build out a site on a highly authoritative and relevant expired domain it can give you a serious head start. But the trick is finding RELEVANT expired domains that have authority in the first place. How To Find Expired Domains Finding expired domains can be as hard or as easy as you want it to be. I have used every tool under the sun over the years and for me the best tools by far are Domain Hunter Gatherer and Spamzilla. They will help you to find expired domains and pull in key metrics for you. What you do with an expired domain once you have found it is up to you. This Section In Short Expired domains that have great backlink profiles are worth their weight in gold! Buying these domains and either building your websites on them or using them to create links is an intelligent strategy. Learn more about expired domains and how to recycle them. PRO TIPS: Selling expired domain names is a great way to make extra income. Learn how to sell a domain name. 14. Hijack News Events One of the key elements of any effective link building campaign is creating great website content that stands out and commands attention. Creating content that has a higher likelihood of going viral, however, isn‚Äôt easy. Instead of wasting time trying to figure out what people may like, you can take what people are already talking about and use that as inspiration for your next piece of content. This tactic is known as ‚Äúnewsjacking‚Äù because you are taking advantage of a popular topic from the news and using it to create and promote your own content. A classic case of newsjacking is what Oreo did in the Superbowl 2013. After the energy shut down in the stadium, they tweeted the following: This Oreo tweet got more than 15,880 retweets and 6,200 favourites in just a few hours. They also got a lot of press (and the links that come with it), including mentions in The Huffington Post, Wired, and CNET. You can use this same press to get links to your site. Here‚Äôs how you do it: Step #1 ‚Äì Find Popular Topics Research what people talk about with the help of Google Trends. You can put your own ideas in the top search bar and see their popularity, or write down the list of topics that show up on the homepage. The young royals, for example, represent a great idea for many articles, especially if you are in the design, beauty, and fashion industry. Go broad with your list of ideas; later you will analyse them in more detail. Step #2 ‚Äì Brainstorm content ideas With your initial list of popular topics, brainstorm a list of content articles. You want both to have some relationship with one another. For example, if you have a blog that talks about leadership, you could write something related to Tim Cook‚Äôs leadership style- 5 Things Sales Managers Can Learn From Tim Cook How Tim Cook‚Äôs Leadership Style Will Accelerate Your Success The 3 Leadership Mistakes Tim Cook Made That You Must Avoid At All Costs Step #3 ‚Äì Define And Create The Content With your list of content ideas, define one that suits you best, and start creating the content fast. Time is your friend in here. The popularity of some topics lasts only a few weeks, if not days. Make sure to have the article done no longer than a week after you found it. Step #4 ‚Äì Publish And Promote Talking about a popular topic makes promotion easier, but it‚Äôs not a fool-proof way of creating viral content. As it always happens with content, focus on the promotion. Don‚Äôt promote it on social media alone; use it as a way to get the attention of people both within and outside your industry. Reach outside your industry. Using the previous example, you may want to reach blogs that talk about technology, business, Apple, and Uber. This Section In Short Newsworthy content always attract attention (and link opportunities). It‚Äôs really easy to do and there are new opportunities every single week! To find newsjacking opportunities, get to know what people are searching for with Google Trends. You can go deeper with the help of the categories section. With the results, brainstorm potential ideas that tie your expertise with the news. Create the content fast, and aggressively promote it. Remember, people like sharing content that‚Äôs new and unique; newsjacking can help you achieve just that. 15. Massage Influencers Ego‚Äôs Dale Carnegie said once ‚ÄúYou can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.‚Äù Similarly, if you play on people‚Äôs ego, the chances of getting links from high-authority sites increase significantly. First, you build relationships with people that manage high-traffic, high authority blogs/sites. As you know, relationships are one of the key ways to get anything in life, including links. If you get influencers interested in your article, they will feel invested. Once you publish it, they will feel ‚Äúpushed‚Äù to share and link to it, even if you don‚Äôt tell them. This is the basis of influencer marketing. Creating ego bait list posts (ELP for short) has helped get 2000 views to a blog that wasn‚Äôt even getting 50 visits per month. In the image above you can see the sessions went up 482%, while the pageviews increased 1382% and the users 624%. If you want to get started with ego bait, follow these steps: Step #1 ‚Äì Pick Your Headline As I recommend on the ego bait list article, start with the headline, which sums up the idea of the article. You can use the following structure: Number + (industry) blogs/experts + promise/keyword Pick a list of influencers from your industry, and define the promise that your article will fulfil. You can pick as little or as many as you want, depending on how much in-depth you want to go with each influencer. For example you might want to ask what everyone‚Äôs favorite link building tools are. That makes it easy for the influencers to know exactly what they are expected to write about. The audience will also appreciate a specific piece of advice they can use on their own. Step #2 ‚Äì Define the Question Even though you have already specified the main promise of the article, you want to define the question you will ask the influencers. Be specific and focus on one question only. Influencers are busy people, that‚Äôs why you want them to answer your question with the greatest level of detail possible. When defining the question, remember what people would want to read about. Pick a unique angle for the question. For example, if I were to do another SEO ego bait article like the one I showed you before, I‚Äôd focus on something like the best local SEO strategy or favourite 30 minutes SEO quick win. It still focuses on SEO but has a new angle that brings a good answer to people‚Äôs problems. Step #3 ‚Äì The Experts Create a list of all the experts you want to contact. You can brainstorm the experts or search on Google for other expert roundups in your niche & with similar target markets- Make sure to define experts that have sites with high domain authority & page authority as well as social following. This will make the sharing as well as the linking more powerful. After you define the list of experts, find their contact information. Look in their personal websites, use LinkedIn, or simply ask them on Twitter. Step #4 ‚Äì Outreach Finally, send the influencers an email with your question. If they don‚Äôt answer right away, wait a few days. Follow up two times more, and if they don‚Äôt answer, ask a different influencer. Don‚Äôt be a pushy link builder. You should get a response rate of around 10-25%, maybe more if you already have a relationship with some of the influencers or if you are one yourself. This Section In Short Creating egobait articles is simple. The key to success is to structure your article for success and be organized with the pitching. Start by defining your headline. It must convey the value right away so people want to click on it. You can use the structure I recommend which is: Number + (industry) blogs/experts + promise/keyword Then, define the question (or questions) you want to ask to the influencers. Make sure to make it super concise and actionable. Then, define the experts you want to contact. Finally, contact the experts with the question you previously defined. Once you publish your content, make sure you contact the experts so they help you promote it. Also, remember it‚Äôs all about the relationships; once an expert knows about your site, it will be easier for them to link to your site in the future (assuming they like your site). BONUS EGO BAIT STRATEGY: Take a look at this awesome link building tutorial that you can use to ego bait people in a different way. 16. Outsource Your Link Building I won‚Äôt lie to you‚Ä¶ Even with the best link building strategies ‚Äì link building is still hard work and takes time. That‚Äôs why so many people choose to outsource link building to reputable link building services. That way you can focus on running your business while letting SEO pros take care of your links. What To Look For In A Link Building Service You don‚Äôt just want to hire any link building service. You only want to hire a link building agency you can trust. Here are some things to think about: Quality control ‚Äì Only use link building services that are very particular with the quality of links they build Proof of results ‚Äì The best link building services will share case studies and client results that you can review Genuine outreach ‚Äì Avoid services that share their site lists or build links on sites that have ‚Äúwrite for us‚Äù pages Transparent techniques ‚Äì You should have a good idea of the techniques and strategies the service uses to build links Customer service ‚Äì Hire a link building service that has good customer service and support Remember: With link building services ‚Äì You get what you pay for. Don‚Äôt go looking for the cheapest link buliding service you can find. Hire a link building service with a reputation for delivering quality links and the results showing they know what they are doing. Our Favourite Link Building Service LinksThatRank is the best link building service we can recommend. They have a strong reputation for delivering quality links to clients and even display case study screenshots on their home page to prove it. But what we really love about LinksThatRank is that they are laser-focused on quality control. Unlike other services they- Have a 23-point quality control checklist to ensure only links that help you rank Select target anchor text to make sure you don‚Äôt trigger an anchor text penalty Offer 1,000 words of premium written content with each placement by default Every site they build links on is guaranteed to have real organic traffic from Google Add internal and external links to placement pages to appear more natural Operate a strict blacklist of sites with ‚Äúwrite for us‚Äù pages and known guest post farms and PBN networks Have built their own link building tool to identify toxic backlinks Crazy, right? LinksThatRank also offers a quick and easy buying process that‚Äôs entirely hands-off. All you have to do is choose the links you need and tell them which keyword you are targeting ‚Äì they take care of the rest. How Many Backlinks Do I Need? The truth is that there is no blanket answer to this question. Every single keyword, niche and search result is different. The good news is that it‚Äôs possible to calculate how many backlinks you need to rank for a target keyword. Just follow this simple 3-step process. Step #1 ‚Äì Determine Which Pages You Need To Build Backlinks To Don‚Äôt build links to every page on your site. Why? Because not every page is worth it. Link building costs time and money. You should only build links to pages that include keywords that generate real leads and sales for your business. So, the first thing you need to do is work out which pages they are. Here‚Äôs how we do it: Look at pages where you currently rank in spots 2 to 30 for your target keyword Find the top pages that make you the most money (not traffic) Create a shortlist of those pages and take note of them You can do all of this for free using Google Search Console. Need some more help? Watch the video below for more information. Step #2 ‚Äì Calculate The ‚ÄúLink Gap‚Äù Now that you have your shortlist of target keywords, you can calculate the ‚Äúlink gap‚Äù. The link gap is simply the minimum number of links you need to rank in the top 3 positions on Google for your target keyword. For this, you will need a premium tool like Ahrefs or Semrush. Here‚Äôs how the process works: Type your target keywords into your chosen tool (I prefer Ahrefs) Look at the links above DR20 pointing to the first three ranking URLs Write down the number of links for each ranking URL The video below outlines this entire process in more detail. Now you are ready for the last step‚Ä¶ Step #3 ‚Äì Build The Links You Need Link building is the trickiest part for many SEOs. Some people feel comfortable enough to do it themselves with any of the above link-building strategies. Others prefer to outsource it to a service link LinksThatRank. You decide which method is right for your business. Either way‚Ä¶ You now know which pages to build links to and how many links you need to build. The last step is simply to build them. How To Get Your Links Indexed? Getting your newly built links indexed is essential. Why? They will only help your rankings if Google knows they exist. Now you could let Google naturally find them or‚Ä¶ You can take matters into your own hands to make sure they do. Using a proven indexing strategy and service is the easiest way to index your links quickly. So I tested 14 popular indexing methods to see which was best. You can see the full results of the backlink indexer test here. For those who don‚Äôt want to read‚Ä¶ There were only 3 services that worked: Indexing Expert ‚Äì 99.5% indexing success rate Omega Indexer ‚Äì 88.5% indexing success rate (but costs 75% less than Indexing Expert) SpeedLinks VIP ‚Äì 72.5% indexing success rate These were the only services that got Google to visit the URL and index the junk content we added to random pages. If you want your new links indexed faster ‚Äì use one of the services above. Wrapping It Up I‚Äôve shown you 16x link-building strategies you can implement in 2025 for maximum results.

You got it? The world of backlinks is wild, my friend. Picture me sitting in a dimly lit diner, channeling all my energy into this rant. Buckle up because we‚Äôre hitting this topic from both ends.Listen, backlinks are like oxygen for your website. Without them, you‚Äôre gasping for air, stuck in the depths of page two (or worse) of search results. It‚Äôs not just about climbing that SEO ladder; it‚Äôs about building a reputation, establishing your presence, and doing it all ethically. We‚Äôre ripping past the fluff and getting into the raw shit about creating content that genuinely offers value‚Äînot just jargon-filled pages chasing the latest SEO trend.This isn‚Äôt a game of manipulation or shortcuts. Trust me, I've been there and done that, and it blew up in my face harder than my cousin Tony‚Äôs epic paint mishap! That dude thought he was some kind of Picasso and trashed his whole setup with paint everywhere when he tried to DIY. I‚Äôd swear, I didn‚Äôt think it was possible to mess up so badly. Paint on the ceiling? Yeah, that happened.But Tony‚Äôs moment of chaos taught me something vital. If you don‚Äôt take the time to lay down a solid foundation, the entire structure can come crashing down in a colorful frenzy of regret. Same goes for your website; if you‚Äôre not building those backlinks ethically, you‚Äôll be cleaning up a mess you didn‚Äôt even see coming.Now, let‚Äôs strap in because it‚Äôs a rollercoaster‚Äîhere‚Äôs the full damn ride‚Ä¶Why Quick Fixes Aren‚Äôt EnoughLet‚Äôs hit the ground running. Quick fixes are like a sugar rush; they feel great for a hot minute but leave you crashing hard. Picture my buddy Tony again, who started that eco-friendly paint company. Dude went viral",
