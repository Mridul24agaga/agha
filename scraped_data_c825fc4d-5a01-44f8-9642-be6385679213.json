It's about presenting your product in the best possible way, using the right words, images, and details to attract and convince customers to hit that \"Add to Cart\" button. But why is it so important? Because competition on Amazon is fierce. While partnering with over 250 brands, we have observed that with millions of sellers vying for the same customers, even the slightest improvement in your listing can significantly impact your sales. By mastering Amazon eCommerce optimization, you can maximize your visibility, attract more buyers, and ultimately grow your Amazon listing to its full potential. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how to optimize an Amazon listing. We’ll also share Amazon listing best practices, tips to avoid common mistakes, and ways to measure your success. Let’s dive in! Key Components of an Optimized Amazon Listing 1. Product Title The product title is the first thing customers notice, so it needs to be clear, informative, and keyword-rich. It should immediately communicate what your product is and why it’s unique. Amazon product title best practices recommend including: The brand name. Key features (such as size, color, or material). Benefits or usage specifics. For example, instead of “Water Bottle,” a title like “Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle – 24 oz, Keeps Drinks Cold for 24 Hours” is more detailed and appealing. This approach not only improves Amazon title optimization but also helps boost search visibility. 2. Bullet Points Bullet points are where you highlight the main selling points of your product in a quick and scannable format. These are displayed right next to the images and play a significant role in catching the buyer's attention. Here’s how to craft effective bullet points: Start with a Strong Benefit: Mention what problem your product solves or how it adds value. Include Keywords Naturally: This improves product listing optimization and helps customers find your product. Be Concise but Informative: Use 2-3 lines per bullet point, focusing on key features like size, material, or functionality. Prioritize Information: Place the most important details in the first 2-3 bullet points since they grab the buyer’s attention. Highlight Unique Features: Mention any standout features, certifications, or guarantees. Well-crafted bullet points enhance Amazon listing best practices by combining relevant keywords and a focus on benefits, making it easier for customers to make a purchase decision. Amazon listing with Product Title and Bullet Points 3. Product Images High-quality images are crucial for Amazon eCommerce optimization. Customers want to see what they’re buying, and your images should help them visualize the product in their lives. Include: Multiple angles and close-ups. Lifestyle shots showing the product in use. Infographics highlighting key features. Amazon recommends using at least 7 images, including one with a pure white background as the primary image. Amazon Detail Page Images 4. Product Descriptions Your product description is where you tell the full story of your product. Use simple language and organize the information into bullet points for better readability. Amazon listing best practices suggest focusing on: Key features like dimensions, materials, and compatibility. Benefits such as durability, convenience, or unique qualities. Remember to include relevant keywords naturally, as it boosts your product listing optimization. 5. A+ Content and Amazon Brand Page Enhanced Brand Content (A+ Content) allows you to add visually appealing layouts, additional images, comparison charts, and brand stories to your product descriptions. Here’s how A+ Content enhances your listings: Differentiates Your Brand: Makes your product pages visually stand out from competitors. Educates Buyers: Allows you to explain complex features with diagrams or detailed images. Increases Conversions: A+ Content has been shown to boost conversion rates by providing a richer shopping experience. Amazon A+ Page If you’re enrolled in Amazon’s Brand Registry, you can use Amazon Brand Page to give your product store a professional look. Creating an Amazon Brand Page helps customers explore your entire product line in one place. With customizable layouts, you can showcase your brand’s story, highlight your top-selling products, and drive customer loyalty. These tools are essential for Amazon eCommerce optimization and can significantly grow your Amazon listing visibility. Amazon Brand Page 6. Backend Keywords While customers don’t see backend keywords, they play a critical role in search engine optimization (SEO). These are hidden terms you add to your listing to ensure it shows up in relevant searches. For example, if you’re selling sunglasses, your backend keywords could include terms like “UV protection,” “polarized lenses,” or “men’s sunglasses.” Properly using these keywords can grow your Amazon listing and increase visibility. By perfecting these key components, you’ll not only optimize your Amazon listing but also create a seamless shopping experience that leads to higher conversions. Advanced Amazon Listing Optimization Techniques To truly stand out in the Amazon marketplace, basic strategies are not enough. You need to go a step further by leveraging advanced techniques that refine your listings, align with customer preferences, and maximize visibility. Here are some actionable ways to take your Amazon listing optimization to the next level. 1. Leveraging Customer Reviews to Enhance Listings Customer reviews are a goldmine of information. Beyond providing social proof, they offer valuable insights into what customers love (or dislike) about your product. Use this feedback to: Address Concerns: If multiple reviews mention issues like confusing assembly instructions, update your product descriptions or include detailed setup guides in your packaging. Highlight Strengths: If customers consistently praise a specific feature, like durability or sleek design, emphasize it in your bullet points or A+ Content. Spot Opportunities for Improvement: Reviews of competitor products can also reveal gaps that you can address in your listing or product design. 2. Using Enhanced Brand Content (A+ Content) to Differentiate Your Brand A+ Content is a game-changer for sellers enrolled in the Amazon Brand Registry. It allows you to create rich, visually appealing product pages that go beyond standard descriptions. Here’s how A+ Content helps: Educate Your Buyers: Use comparison charts or detailed images to explain product variations or highlight what sets you apart. Build Trust with Brand Stories: Include sections that showcase your brand’s mission, history, or dedication to quality. Increase Conversion Rates: According to Amazon, listings with A+ Content see higher engagement and improved sales performance. For example, if you’re selling a smart thermostat, A+ Content could showcase its compatibility with different home automation systems, energy-saving benefits, and easy installation. 3. Analyzing Competitors’ Listings for Improvement Ideas Competitor analysis is essential for effective product listing optimization. By studying top-performing listings in your category, you can identify strategies to improve your own. What to Look For: Keyword Usage: Observe how competitors use keywords in titles, bullet points, and backend fields. Adopt relevant ones to grow your Amazon listing visibility. Visuals: Are competitors using lifestyle images, infographics, or videos? Enhance your images to match or surpass their quality. Customer Questions: Review the Q&A section of competing products to address similar concerns in your listing upfront. Pro Tip: Avoid directly copying competitors. Instead, use their strengths as inspiration while ensuring your listings remain unique and authentic. 4. Seasonal and Trend-Based Optimizations Keeping your listings relevant to seasonal changes and market trends is a smart way to drive consistent sales. Here’s how to do it: Adapt Descriptions and Images: For example, if you’re selling home décor, update your listings with holiday-specific keywords like “Christmas decorations” or “fall-themed pillows.” Update images to reflect seasonal use. Capitalize on Trends: Stay updated on industry trends or viral products. For instance, if eco-friendly items are trending, highlight sustainability features in your product description and bullet points. Run Time-Sensitive Promotions: Pair seasonal updates with limited-time discounts to further attract buyers. By combining these advanced techniques with the foundational principles of Amazon product optimization, you can create listings that not only rank high but also resonate with your target audience. Common Mistakes in Amazon Listing Optimization While Amazon listing optimization can significantly boost your product’s visibility and sales, common mistakes can derail your efforts. By identifying and avoiding these pitfalls, you can ensure your listings remain compliant with Amazon’s best practices. Here are some of the most frequent missteps and how to steer clear of them: 1. Overlooking Amazon's Compliance Guidelines Amazon has strict rules regarding product listings, and failure to comply can lead to penalties or even account suspension. Some common compliance errors include: Prohibited Claims: Using unverified claims like “best product ever” or “#1 choice.” Misleading Images: Adding lifestyle images that exaggerate product functionality or quality. Keyword Stuffing: Overloading your product title or description with irrelevant or repetitive keywords to manipulate rankings. Solution: Always adhere to Amazon listing best practices by reading and following Amazon’s Style Guides for your product category. These guidelines ensure your listings remain clear, concise, and compliant. Read our expert guide on Amazon’s restricted keywords to avoid costly mistakes and optimize your listings for success. 2. Neglecting Keyword Research and Placement Keywords play a vital role in helping customers find your product, but many sellers either skip proper research or misuse them. Common issues include: Using Irrelevant Keywords: Adding keywords that are popular but unrelated to your product. For example, using “Bluetooth speakers” for wired headphones. Ignoring Backend Keywords: Many sellers focus only on visible keywords while leaving backend keyword fields empty, missing out on additional ranking opportunities. Solution: Conduct thorough research using tools like Helium 10 or Jungle Scout to identify high-performing keywords. Implement them naturally in your titles, bullet points, descriptions, and backend fields to optimize Amazon listings without appearing spammy. 3. Focusing Solely on Desktop Optimization Instead of Mobile With the majority of shoppers browsing Amazon on their mobile devices, optimizing for desktop alone is a major oversight. Listings that are too long, cluttered, or poorly formatted can drive mobile shoppers away. Solution: Shorten Titles: Follow Amazon product title best practices by keeping titles concise yet informative. Mobile-Friendly Images: Ensure your images are clear and compelling, even on smaller screens. Prioritize Key Details: Place critical information at the top of your bullet points and descriptions, as mobile users may not scroll through lengthy content. Optimizing for mobile ensures you can maximize Amazon listing visibility and appeal to a broader audience. 4. Neglecting to Update Listings Regularly Amazon’s marketplace is dynamic, with customer preferences and trends changing frequently. A “set it and forget it” approach can lead to declining performance over time. Solution: Regularly analyze listing performance using tools like Amazon Seller Central or third-party analytics. Refresh your images, descriptions, and keywords based on seasonal trends, customer feedback, and competitor strategies. Stay updated on Amazon eCommerce optimization techniques to keep your listings competitive. A proactive approach to Amazon product optimization not only helps you avoid pitfalls but also ensures that your efforts contribute to sustainable growth and higher conversion rates. SalesDuo’s AI-powered Cohesity model ensures your Amazon product page content stays intact, with real-time updates and automated corrections via our proprietary Business Intelligence Dashboard. Measuring Success and Iterating on Optimizations Optimizing your Amazon listing doesn’t end once it’s live—it’s an ongoing process that requires careful monitoring and adjustments. Here’s how you can measure success and improve over time: 1. Tools and Metrics to Track Performance To understand how well your listing is doing, track key metrics using tools like: Amazon Seller Central: Keep an eye on metrics like impressions, click-through rates (CTR), and conversions to see how customers are interacting with your listing. Third-Party Tools: Platforms like Helium 10 or Jungle Scout provide advanced insights into keyword rankings, competitor analysis, and listing audits. Customer Feedback: Reviews and Q&A sections often highlight areas where your product or listing could improve. These insights help you gauge how effectively your Amazon product optimization strategies are performing. 2. Adapting Based on Analytics and Trends The eCommerce market changes constantly, so your listings need to evolve, too. Here’s how: Keyword Updates: Update your backend keywords based on performance data. Swap out underperforming keywords for better-ranking ones. Seasonal Adjustments: Tailor listings for holidays or trends, like adding “Christmas gift” during December. Competitor Analysis: Study competitor listings to see what works for them, then apply similar ideas while staying unique. A/B Testing: Test different product titles, images, or A+ Content to find the most effective combination. Adopting a data-driven approach ensures you optimize Amazon listings effectively, keeping them competitive in a constantly evolving marketplace.

But many sellers doom themselves before the Facebook campaign goes live. We’ve seen a lot of ways Amazon sellers mess up with Facebook Ads. But the first and most common mistake has nothing to do with Facebook Ads proper-and that is having a poorly optimized Amazon listing. Time and time again, customers reach out to our support saying they didn’t get good results from their Facebook Ads. And time and time again, we find big mistakes in their Amazon listing. If you are spending money to drive traffic to a listing that is not optimized, your money isn’t being well spent. Optimizing your listing is an essential aspect of success on the platform. We’re going to help you do an audit yourself, by showing you the most common mistakes and how to fix them. What is an “Optimized” Listing? Optimization? What are we talking about here? We’re talking about making sure your Amazon product page is set up perfectly to attract new shoppers, and convert shoppers into sales. Done right, you’ll maximize your organic visibility in search results, as well as your conversion rate. The second point is especially important for external traffic, as most of the time you’ve paid money to get someone to your listing. If the customer doesn’t go on to buy from you, it’s a huge waste of money. The first step to perfecting your listing is doing a listing audit, which we’ll run you through now. Listing Audit Overview There are three general categories to cover in a listing audit. It takes into account Amazon SEO, readability & persuasion of your copy, and quality of your images. Before spending anything on paid ads, it’s a good idea to take a second look at all three. Optimize Your Keyword Strategy Oftentimes, customers are targeting keywords that are hyper-competitive & have comparatively low sales potential. Meanwhile, there are hyper-relevant keywords that have higher search volume & lower competition. Finding these keywords and making them a priority means your product will show up in search results more often. More searches and better Amazon SEO will almost always result in increased sales. Additionally, if you rank higher for more relevant or targeted keywords (say, “blender” versus “kitchen appliance”), you’ll convert that into more sales. Optimize Your Listing Copy Having listing copy that is optimized to convert is essential to maximize sales. That means copy that is not just a bloodbath of keywords. But rather copy that is readable, scannable and convinces shoppers of the unique value of your product. Title: The title serves an incredibly important role in the Amazon experience. The goal of your title is to get people to click on your listing, rather than others which show up in the search results. Does your title accomplish this? Also, the keywords in your title play the number one role in ranking. How many of those high-relevance, high search-volume, low-competition keywords are included in your title? Bullets: Bullet points also play a big role in the Amazon ranking system, and they provide shoppers an opportunity to learn more about your product. But, keep in mind, people are unlikely to read through the bullet points like a novel. More likely they will skim through. So you need to make it easy for people to get a snap-understanding of why your product is awesome, just by skimming. Description: If people get down to this section, make it worthwhile for them. The description should go into more detail, which is especially important for technical products. Like the bullet points, people will most likely skim. So make sure to break up your description into sections that make sense, and use HTML for formatting. Optimize Your Images Lastly, we see product photos that do not do justice to the awesome products our customers have to offer. A good product image should be beautiful, professional and show off the product, product features, benefits & use-cases in the best light and follow Amazon’s guidelines. Images are even more important on mobile, because they take up the bulk of the screen. Imagine your target customer swiping through your photos. Do they understand what your product can do for them? Does it evoke emotions — Solving their pain? Improving their life? It should. Higher Conversion Rate & Rankings, More Traffic & Sales By performing a listing audit, you will likely find some glaring mistakes. Fixing those mistakes will not only increase conversions from your external traffic campaigns, but it will also help you rank higher and increase organic traffic & sales for your product. At the very least, you’ll have double-checked that your listing is easily digestible by the Amazon search algorithm and consumers. In the past, we’ve charged hundreds of dollars to audit listings. We’re happy to provide that service for you [contact us to learn more]. But if you would rather do it yourself or have someone on your team do it, we’re giving you the blueprint to do it. Here is a video breakdown of a listing audit we performed for a LandingCube customer’s product on Amazon, and here is a PDF checklist to make sure you cover all your bases. Keyword Audit Process We use Helium10’s Cerebro & Magnet to perform a keyword audit. Reverse ASIN Search: Enter your ASIN into Cerebro to get a list of keywords Amazon is currently ranking you for, or keywords you should rank for but don’t Order the keywords by Search Volume (highest to lowest) Filter the keywords by a minimum Cerebro IQ Score (suggested filter = >1,000) Compare these keywords to the keywords in your listing (title being most important, followed by backend fields, then bullets, lastly description) Build a list of the best keywords to include in your listing, move up in your listing and/or add to the backend. >>If a keyword is highly relevant, has higher search volume & lower competition, it should gain higher priority (ie put into your listing or moved up in your listing) Standard Keyword Search: Enter your most relevant keyword as the seed keyword into Magnet. Order the keywords by Search Volume (highest to lowest) Filter the keywords by a minimum Cerebro IQ Score (suggested filter = >1,000) Compare these keywords to the keywords in your listing (Title being most important, followed by backend fields, then bullets, lastly description) Add the best keywords to your keyword list (to include in your listing, move up in your listing and/or add to the backend). Listing Copy Audit Process Take the findings from your keyword research to improve the keyword strength of your title, bullets & description. You should find a balance between keyword optimization and persuasive, readable copy. The goal is not just to rank higher, but to convert clicks into sales. The title should persuade people to click on your listing, and the bullets and description should make it easy for people to understand the unique value of your product and persuade them to purchase. If you find a keyword that is hyper-relevant and has higher search volume & lower competition than any of the keywords currently in your title, add it. Analyze the title word-by-word. Can you replace some search terms with other terms that have the potential for more sales? If so, do it. Try to add more high opportunity keywords to your listing copy, without sacrificing readability. Make sure your bullet points all use the same format. Make sure your bullet points all focus on the main benefits of your product, followed by unique features. The description should be easily scannable — break it down into sections and use HTML for formatting. Do your bullets & description help consumers imagine themselves using the product, solving their pain with the product and benefiting from the product? BONUS SPY TACTIC #1: Look through your reviews for terms that your customers are actually using to describe your product. Are you using this terminology in your listing? BONUS SPY TACTIC #2: Look at your best competitors’ copy. Can you take it, improve upon it and tailor it to your own unique brand & product? Product Image Audit Process Images are incredibly important. The first product image, like the title, should get people to click through to your listing from the search results page. The other images should together tell a story about why your product is awesome for your target customer, and help them imagine themselves using it. Count your images. If you have less than 7, think about making more. Look at your images for quality & usefulness. Check that the first image prominently displays the product on a white background. Do you have secondary images that highlight the main product features and benefits? Use-cases? Do you have at least one image showing an attractive customer using your product? Consider an image comparing the product features/benefits to a competitor’s product. Check that the text overlayed on your images is easy to read? Check that your images together convey a cohesive brand identity?

But many sellers doom themselves before the Facebook campaign goes live. We’ve seen a lot of ways Amazon sellers mess up with Facebook Ads. But the first and most common mistake has nothing to do with Facebook Ads proper-and that is having a poorly optimized Amazon listing. Time and time again, customers reach out to our support saying they didn’t get good results from their Facebook Ads. And time and time again, we find big mistakes in their Amazon listing. If you are spending money to drive traffic to a listing that is not optimized, your money isn’t being well spent. Optimizing your listing is an essential aspect of success on the platform. We’re going to help you do an audit yourself, by showing you the most common mistakes and how to fix them. What is an “Optimized” Listing? Optimization? What are we talking about here? We’re talking about making sure your Amazon product page is set up perfectly to attract new shoppers, and convert shoppers into sales. Done right, you’ll maximize your organic visibility in search results, as well as your conversion rate. The second point is especially important for external traffic, as most of the time you’ve paid money to get someone to your listing. If the customer doesn’t go on to buy from you, it’s a huge waste of money. The first step to perfecting your listing is doing a listing audit, which we’ll run you through now. Listing Audit Overview There are three general categories to cover in a listing audit. It takes into account Amazon SEO, readability & persuasion of your copy, and quality of your images. Before spending anything on paid ads, it’s a good idea to take a second look at all three. Optimize Your Keyword Strategy Oftentimes, customers are targeting keywords that are hyper-competitive & have comparatively low sales potential. Meanwhile, there are hyper-relevant keywords that have higher search volume & lower competition. Finding these keywords and making them a priority means your product will show up in search results more often. More searches and better Amazon SEO will almost always result in increased sales. Additionally, if you rank higher for more relevant or targeted keywords (say, “blender” versus “kitchen appliance”), you’ll convert that into more sales. Optimize Your Listing Copy Having listing copy that is optimized to convert is essential to maximize sales. That means copy that is not just a bloodbath of keywords. But rather copy that is readable, scannable and convinces shoppers of the unique value of your product. Title: The title serves an incredibly important role in the Amazon experience. The goal of your title is to get people to click on your listing, rather than others which show up in the search results. Does your title accomplish this? Also, the keywords in your title play the number one role in ranking. How many of those high-relevance, high search-volume, low-competition keywords are included in your title? Bullets: Bullet points also play a big role in the Amazon ranking system, and they provide shoppers an opportunity to learn more about your product. But, keep in mind, people are unlikely to read through the bullet points like a novel. More likely they will skim through. So you need to make it easy for people to get a snap-understanding of why your product is awesome, just by skimming. Description: If people get down to this section, make it worthwhile for them. The description should go into more detail, which is especially important for technical products. Like the bullet points, people will most likely skim. So make sure to break up your description into sections that make sense, and use HTML for formatting. Optimize Your Images Lastly, we see product photos that do not do justice to the awesome products our customers have to offer. A good product image should be beautiful, professional and show off the product, product features, benefits & use-cases in the best light and follow Amazon’s guidelines. Images are even more important on mobile, because they take up the bulk of the screen. Imagine your target customer swiping through your photos. Do they understand what your product can do for them? Does it evoke emotions — Solving their pain? Improving their life? It should. Higher Conversion Rate & Rankings, More Traffic & Sales By performing a listing audit, you will likely find some glaring mistakes. Fixing those mistakes will not only increase conversions from your external traffic campaigns, but it will also help you rank higher and increase organic traffic & sales for your product. At the very least, you’ll have double-checked that your listing is easily digestible by the Amazon search algorithm and consumers. In the past, we’ve charged hundreds of dollars to audit listings. We’re happy to provide that service for you [contact us to learn more]. But if you would rather do it yourself or have someone on your team do it, we’re giving you the blueprint to do it. Here is a video breakdown of a listing audit we performed for a LandingCube customer’s product on Amazon, and here is a PDF checklist to make sure you cover all your bases.

Calculate Your Amazon Sales Margin What is Amazon listing optimization? Amazon listing optimization describes the process of optimizing a listing to improve its organic rankings (and sales) on Amazon.com. Amazon production optimizations can range from targeting keywords in product titles to uploading professional product images. Every optimization focuses on helping users, as well as Amazon, understand your product. Amazon listing optimization and the Amazon algorithm As an ecommerce store, Amazon needs to provide shoppers with relevant results. If a user searches for, “child safety gate,” and product listings for diapers appear, then Amazon isn’t matching the search intent of its users. And when that happens, users go somewhere else to buy their child safety gates. That’s why Amazon relies on a search algorithm called A9. This algorithm helps the ecommerce company rank product listings, with the goal of providing the most relevant result to shoppers first. That way, users find the product they want — and buy it. To see Amazon’s search algorithm in action, search for something on the site, like, “pool safety fence.” As you can see in the example below, Amazon delivers more than 300 results. Those on the first page, however, match your exact intent. These products earned their top ranking because their sellers invested the time to optimize their Amazon listings, targeting the keyword, “pool safety fence,” “pool fence,” and other keywords related to the query. So, what is Amazon optimization? It’s optimizing the following features of a product listing: Title Features Images Description It also concentrates on the following areas: Product reviews Product ratings Product price Product bundling While some of these factors, such as product ratings and reviews, are outside your direct control, it’s worth investing time in Amazon listing optimization — and for several good reasons, including increased sales. How to optimize your Amazon listing in 9 steps Ready to learn about optimizing your Amazon products? Get started with this nine-step guide for optimizing your listings: 1. Audit product listings If you’re optimizing existing product listings, versus a brand-new product, start by auditing them. Taking this step will help you identify areas of improvement. For example, you might find that you need to revamp your product titles and add high-quality product images. To make the audit process easier, use a free tool like Jungle Scout Product Listing Grader. Enter your product’s URL on Amazon or your product’s ASIN, and Jungle Scout will assess and grade your product listing in the following areas: Product title Product images Product features Product description Product reviews Product rating It’s also critical that you look for duplicate product listings — if you spot any, merge them. Depending on the size of your inventory, you can add these product grades to a Google Sheet or Excel document. That way, your team can build a plan for optimizing these Amazon listings, as well as track the performance of these products afterward. 2. Research keywords Whether you’re focusing on new products or existing products, you need to dedicate time to keyword research. This step is critical when it comes to Amazon listing optimization — if you target the wrong keywords, your target audience won’t find your products. Unlike other search engines, like Google, Amazon features two types of keywords: Primary keywords: On Amazon, your primary keywords are visible to users. They appear in product titles, descriptions, and features, and they’re the keywords most likely to connect you with your target audience. Hidden keywords: Amazon also allows hidden or backend keywords, which are not visible to users — note, Amazon refers to these keywords as Search Terms. A hidden keyword connects you with shoppers by considering their search habits. For example, you may use an abbreviation as a hidden keyword, such as “lotr” for “Lord of the Rings.” If you’re familiar with keyword research on Google and Bing, it’s worth mentioning that researching keywords on Amazon is a bit different. Why? Users on Amazon have one intent, while users on Google have a range of search intents. On Amazon, users are looking to buy a product. They’ve researched the item, such as a safety fence for their pool, and have decided that they want it — all they need to do is to find a trusted buyer with the product they want. In comparison, on Google and Bing, users are conducting a range of searches, from informational to navigational to transactional. That’s why you can target a keyword like, “types of pool fences,” on Google and direct high-value traffic to your website. That wouldn’t happen on Amazon — users already know what type of pool fence they want. As a result, you’d target phrases like, “mesh pool fence,” “aluminum pool fence,” or “metal pool fence,” to reach your target audience. How do you find the best keywords for your Amazon products, though? With the following tools: Keywordtool.io: With keywordtool.io, which is also available as a browser extension, you can discover keywords for Amazon. To use it, enter a keyword you’re interested in, such as, “pool safety fence.” You’ll then receive a list of related keywords, as well as their search volume, competition, and cost-per-click (CPC). Amazon suggestions: Another way to find keywords is with Amazon’s search suggestions. As you type in a query, Amazon will recommend a search. For example, if you type, “pool safety fence,” Amazon will suggest, “pool safety fence for deck.” With the keywordtool.io browser extension, you can also see the search volume and CPC of these suggested keywords. Competitor analysis: During keyword research, it’s also important to assess your competitors. Look at what keywords they’re targeting in their product titles, descriptions, and features. Keep in mind that you don’t want to copy your competitor’s strategy. All you want is some insight into their Amazon listing optimization approach. Advertising data: If you’ve advertised on Amazon, such as with Sponsored Products, you want to review your advertising data. In your Advertising Marketing Services (AMS) account, you can see which keywords drove clicks to your product listing, as well as purchases. Add those keywords to your optimization strategy. Like your product audit results, you want to compile your keyword research into a Google Sheet or Excel document. If you use keywordtool.io, you can download and import all your keyword data — from the search volume to the competition — into your document. That way, you keep your keywords organized and easy to access when optimizing your listings. 3. Organize product categories What is one step that most, “How to Optimize Your Amazon Listing,” guides skip? Organizing and optimizing your product categories. It’s a quick step and one that can lead to big returns for your company, from more sales to better rankings in results. It’s helpful to ensure your products occupy the correct product category because of user search habits. While many shoppers will start with a query on Amazon, they’ll often filter their results, such as by category, brand, or material. As an example, look at the filters available for the query, “pool safety fence.” If your pool fencing occupies the “Agricultural Fencing” category, for instance, users in your target audience can — and likely will — remove your product listing from their search results with a single click. That’s why you need to review the categories your products occupy. Amazon makes this an easy fix via the Product Classifier tool. Just follow these steps: Use the browse or search method to determine your product’s classifications Build and download your list of classifications, or Product Classifier file Open your Product Classifier file and download the recommended Inventory File Templates Add your product classifications and refinement fields to your Inventory File Templates Upload your changes Once you update your product categories, you can start optimizing each product listing. 4. Write informative product titles One of the most critical parts of optimizing your Amazon listing is writing your product title. For users, as well as Amazon, it’s important that you create an informative title — users should know what you’re selling before they even click on your listing. When you write your product listing, make sure to follow these best practices: Capitalize the first letter of each word unless it’s a conjunction, article, or preposition Use numerals and state the number of items in a product pack Spell out measurements and the word, “and” Include a primary keyword at least once It’s also critical that you exclude the following information, which can impact your rank in results: All capital letters for each word Promotional messages, such as for sales or free shipping Subjective commentary, such as “Best Seller” Brand, company, or seller information Pricing information Special characters or symbols, like © For product titles, Amazon limits you to 200 characters. In some cases, certain product categories have a limit lower than 200 characters — you can find out the character limit for your product category by viewing Amazon’s Templates for Specific Categories. Amazon also offers a recommended product title format: Brand + Model + Product Type If you have additional and relevant information to include in your product title, Amazon recommends including it after the product type. Some additional information that’s helpful to consumers are the number of items in a product pack or the color of a product. Below, you can see an example of an optimized product title for a pool fence. The seller follows the exact format for product titles — it starts with the brand, Water Warden, followed by the model, four foot, and then the product type and primary keyword, pool safety fence. Note, however, that while the seller uses numerals, they don’t spell out the measurement. It’s an excellent example of how you can continue to improve and optimize your product titles. 5. Build benefit-rich product features Whether they’re browsing Google or Amazon, users will always skim through search results and the content they click to view. That’s why your product features are so critical — they provide users with valuable information about your product in bite-sized chunks. Amazon allows you to highlight five product features. These features appear as bullet points beneath your product’s pricing, inventory, style, and color information. Depending on your product, some of these features may not display, such as a color choice for a product that only comes in one color. Optimize your product features by following these tips: Start each bullet point with a capital letter Write all numbers as numerals Spell out all measurements Use a primary keyword in each bullet point Separate phrases in a single feature with semicolons Maximize the success of your Amazon listing’s optimization by avoiding the following missteps: Including seller, company, or shipping information Featuring promotional or pricing information Using hyphens, symbols, periods, exclamation points, and any ending punctuation Writing vague, uninformative statements If you’re unsure which product features to highlight, Amazon recommends showcasing the following: Warranty or guarantee information Product dimensions Product age group Product origin Care instructions Package contents It’s also essential to include product features that emphasize value to consumers. For pool fencing, users may not care that much about the product’s age group. Instead, they’re probably focused on the warranty, dimensions, and contents. If you look at the earlier example of product features, you can see that the seller highlights the product’s convenience. It’s easy for you to install and remove the fence, which includes a limited lifetime warranty and non-corrosive latching system. Plus, the system includes almost everything — except a gate. All this information comes from the product features, making it even easier for users to buy from you. 6. Write compelling product descriptions Another core part of Amazon listing optimization is your product descriptions, which have a max length of 2000 characters. These appear lower on the product page, which means shoppers that are reading this description are interested in learning more about your product, such as pool fencing. Follow these best practices for product descriptions to improve your ranking in search results: Include information on major product features and uses Note warranty information, care instructions, dimensions, and other helpful information Use complete sentences and correct grammar and punctuation Include primary keywords when appropriate It’s also critical that you don’t include the following information: Company-specific information Promotional information Information for another product Website URL Seller name Contact information, such as an email address When you’re optimizing your product description, it’s worth looking back on your competitor analysis. While you focused on their keyword strategy, it’s likely you noticed their customer reviews. These reviews may have noted the perks of the product, as well as the pain points of it. In your product description, highlight how your product relieves these pain points. Maybe your competitor doesn’t offer a comprehensive warranty, but you do — note this in your product description, as well as your product features. That can help you convert a shopper faster, which can have a massive impact when considering the number of shoppers on Amazon. 7. Upload high-quality product images A core part of Amazon listing optimization is your product images. That’s why it’s critical that you provide shoppers with a series of high-quality images that showcase your product, as well as its benefits and its uses. A few technical requirements for Amazon images include the following: JPEG, TIFF, GIF, or PNG format sRGB or CMYK color mode Dimension of 1000 pixels or larger in height or width It’s critical to adhere to Amazon’s standards for an sRGB (standard Red Green Blue) or CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) color mode because they can impact your sales, as well as return rate. If you use RGB (Red Green Blue), you’re providing shoppers with an inaccurate image of your product. To demonstrate, look at the example below: While they’re the same exact shades of green, they look for different. That provides consumers with a different idea of what your product will look like, versus what it actually looks like. To prevent that, use the sRGB or CMYK color mode, which you can set in a photo editing software, like Adobe Photoshop. Your filename should also feature an identifier of your product, such as its: ASIN: The Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) is a product identifier that consists of 10 letters or numbers. Amazon creates an ASIN for every product listing. ISBN: The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is an identifier for commercial books. It features 10 or 13 digits and appears on the back cover of a book. EAN: The European Article Number (EAN) is a 12- or 13-digit product identifier that denotes the product and product’s manufacturer. If a product does not have an EAN, you will need to purchase one. JAN: The Japanese Article Number (JAN) is a 13-digit product identifier for Japanese products. UPC: The Universal Product Code (UPC) is a 12-digit product identifier for goods sold in the U.S. Image filenames cannot include spaces, dashes, or special characters. On Amazon, you can upload two types of images: Primary image: A primary image of your product displays in search results — and it’s the first image users see on your product listing. That’s why Amazon has a separate set of standards for primary images. Other view images: Your other view images only display on your product listing. These often provide additional information about your product. The rules for these images are often more flexible than for primary images. For your primary image, follow these standards: Professional photograph or cover art of product Image dots per inch (dpi) of 1000 Entire product and all included items displayed Pure white background, which is RGB 255, 255, 255 Zero text, graphics, or inset images Avoid these bad practices for primary images to prevent a quality alert from Amazon: Promotional text Lifestyle pictures Colored backgrounds Images of the product in different colors Borders, watermarks, or text over images Product blueprints, sketches, or drawings Products not included with the listed product If you’re preparing to photograph your product for its Amazon listing, do not upload an image placeholder. A placeholder image, such as one that says, “No Image Available,” can result in a quality alert from Amazon. When it comes to your other view images, follow these recommendations: Use backgrounds or environments Ensure a 1000 dpi Demonstrate the scale of a product with other objects or related products Have the product and any additional items occupy at least 85 percent of the image Include close-up or cropped images For other view images, Amazon allows you to use text and demonstrative graphics. While you can include these on your images, make sure they offer value to shoppers. A graphic of how to install your pool fencing, for instance, can provide value to consumers. 8. Encourage verified Amazon reviews To provide shoppers with high-quality results, Amazon weighs product reviews and ratings in its search algorithm. If your product has a five-star rating and 200 reviews, for example, that’s a positive signal to Amazon that your product is top-notch. It’s also a powerful signal to users. In fact, 80 percent of consumers say that online reviews have changed their mind about a purchase — not to mention, customer reviews can increase your sales by 18 percent. To ensure the integrity of its online reviews, Amazon does not allow sellers to solicit them. Instead, you must develop a strategy for encouraging users to review your product and share their experience with other shoppers. A few ways to encourage verified reviews for your Amazon products include: Email: When someone places an order on Amazon, they receive a few automated emails, such as their order confirmation, shipment, and arrival. In your Buyer-Seller Messaging, create a template for a post-arrival email. In this email, invite users to review your product — you can also encourage them to contact you if something’s wrong with their purchase. Print: The materials that you include with your order shipments can also remind users to leave a review. If you included printed instructions for your pool fencing, for example, you could update the instructions to include a call-to-action (CTA) to review your product on Amazon. Early Review Program: If your product costs more than $15 and has less than five reviews, you can use Amazon’s Early Reviewer Program. Via this program, Amazon solicits reviews for you for a one-year period or until you earn five reviews. Vine Reviewer Program: For wholesale providers, the Amazon Vine Reviewer Program is another option. To partake, you must provide samples of your product, which Amazon will send to its top reviewers. These consumers will use your product and then post an honest review. While it’s important to earn reviews on Amazon, it’s also essential that you monitor and respond to them. They can provide insight into how to improve your product. Plus, by responding, you can improve your company’s reputation and awareness among consumers. 9. Set competitive prices Another crucial part of Amazon listing optimization focuses on product pricing. If you want your product to appear on the first page of search results for, “pool safety fences,” then you need to provide competitive prices. To do that, monitor the pricing of your competitors. Tools like JungleScout, CARL, and InformedRepricer, help you watch the prices of your competitors in real-time, as well as adapt to them automatically — which is great if you have an expansive catalog of products. When you optimize the price of your Amazon listing, you can also work towards winning the Buy Box. On Amazon, the Buy Box occupies the right-hand side of a product page and includes the, “Add to Cart,” or “Buy Now,” button. Win the Buy Box, and your product becomes the default choice when a user clicks, “Add to Cart,” or, “Buy Now.” That’s an immense win for your business because, without the Buy Box, you rely on users to take the initiative to explore other sellers. To the right, you can see an example of the Buy Box on Amazon. In this example, Amazon is the seller of the product, beating out WeLOC, CA Global Distribution, and several other sellers. As you optimize the price of your product, it’s essential that your price remains profitable for your business. While you may win the Buy Box, it doesn’t help your company if you’re giving away your product. That’s why you want to keep your prices competitive.

Learn More 5 quick Amazon listing tips to improve your rankings Now that you know how to optimize your Amazon listings, how can you improve them even more? On Amazon, there are a few ways you can better your Amazon listing optimization, leading to more orders for your products. Here are five quick tips to improve your Amazon listings: Use A+ enhanced marketing content: If you have a Vendor Central membership, you can take advantage of the A+ enhanced marketing content application — you can access this tool via your Vendor Central dashboard. This application can increase sales by five to 10 percent. It works by creating a product page design that features images, videos, comparison charts, and more. Make products Amazon Prime eligible: One of the most frequent filters shoppers use on Amazon is for Amazon Prime. Since Amazon Prime members spend more than $1,000 per year — $500 more than non-members, you want to appeal to this audience. To become an Amazon Prime Seller, you’ll need to join Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA). Opt-in for Fulfillment by Amazon: Another reason to invest in FBA is that Amazon will oversee your products’ packaging, shipment, and returns. That ensures shoppers receive the best customer experience possible, which can lead to positive reviews from shoppers — and an improvement in your search results rank. Create product bundles: With bundled products, you can also optimize your Amazon listings. This strategy is excellent for products that have lower sales numbers but offer value to shoppers. When you build a bundle on Amazon, make sure the bundle make sense, such as packaging a pool fence with a gate for that fence. Try Amazon ads: If you’re launching a new product — and have optimized its listing — you can also experiment with advertising on Amazon. Like pay-per-click (PPC) advertising options on other platforms, like Google, your ad tops organic search results, and you only pay when users click on your ad.

Calculate Your Amazon Sales Margin What is Amazon listing optimization? Amazon listing optimization describes the process of optimizing a listing to improve its organic rankings (and sales) on Amazon.com. Amazon production optimizations can range from targeting keywords in product titles to uploading professional product images. Every optimization focuses on helping users, as well as Amazon, understand your product. Amazon listing optimization and the Amazon algorithm As an ecommerce store, Amazon needs to provide shoppers with relevant results. If a user searches for, “child safety gate,” and product listings for diapers appear, then Amazon isn’t matching the search intent of its users. And when that happens, users go somewhere else to buy their child safety gates. That’s why Amazon relies on a search algorithm called A9. This algorithm helps the ecommerce company rank product listings, with the goal of providing the most relevant result to shoppers first. That way, users find the product they want — and buy it. To see Amazon’s search algorithm in action, search for something on the site, like, “pool safety fence.” As you can see in the example below, Amazon delivers more than 300 results. Those on the first page, however, match your exact intent. These products earned their top ranking because their sellers invested the time to optimize their Amazon listings, targeting the keyword, “pool safety fence,” “pool fence,” and other keywords related to the query. So, what is Amazon optimization? It’s optimizing the following features of a product listing: Title Features Images Description It also concentrates on the following areas: Product reviews Product ratings Product price Product bundling While some of these factors, such as product ratings and reviews, are outside your direct control, it’s worth investing time in Amazon listing optimization — and for several good reasons, including increased sales. How to optimize your Amazon listing in 9 steps Ready to learn about optimizing your Amazon products? Get started with this nine-step guide for optimizing your listings: 1. Audit product listings If you’re optimizing existing product listings, versus a brand-new product, start by auditing them. Taking this step will help you identify areas of improvement. For example, you might find that you need to revamp your product titles and add high-quality product images. To make the audit process easier, use a free tool like Jungle Scout Product Listing Grader. Enter your product’s URL on Amazon or your product’s ASIN, and Jungle Scout will assess and grade your product listing in the following areas: Product title Product images Product features Product description Product reviews Product rating It’s also critical that you look for duplicate product listings — if you spot any, merge them. Depending on the size of your inventory, you can add these product grades to a Google Sheet or Excel document. That way, your team can build a plan for optimizing these Amazon listings, as well as track the performance of these products afterward. 2. Research keywords Whether you’re focusing on new products or existing products, you need to dedicate time to keyword research. This step is critical when it comes to Amazon listing optimization — if you target the wrong keywords, your target audience won’t find your products. Unlike other search engines, like Google, Amazon features two types of keywords: Primary keywords: On Amazon, your primary keywords are visible to users. They appear in product titles, descriptions, and features, and they’re the keywords most likely to connect you with your target audience. Hidden keywords: Amazon also allows hidden or backend keywords, which are not visible to users — note, Amazon refers to these keywords as Search Terms. A hidden keyword connects you with shoppers by considering their search habits. For example, you may use an abbreviation as a hidden keyword, such as “lotr” for “Lord of the Rings.” If you’re familiar with keyword research on Google and Bing, it’s worth mentioning that researching keywords on Amazon is a bit different. Why? Users on Amazon have one intent, while users on Google have a range of search intents. On Amazon, users are looking to buy a product. They’ve researched the item, such as a safety fence for their pool, and have decided that they want it — all they need to do is to find a trusted buyer with the product they want. In comparison, on Google and Bing, users are conducting a range of searches, from informational to navigational to transactional. That’s why you can target a keyword like, “types of pool fences,” on Google and direct high-value traffic to your website. That wouldn’t happen on Amazon — users already know what type of pool fence they want. As a result, you’d target phrases like, “mesh pool fence,” “aluminum pool fence,” or “metal pool fence,” to reach your target audience. How do you find the best keywords for your Amazon products, though? With the following tools: Keywordtool.io: With keywordtool.io, which is also available as a browser extension, you can discover keywords for Amazon. To use it, enter a keyword you’re interested in, such as, “pool safety fence.” You’ll then receive a list of related keywords, as well as their search volume, competition, and cost-per-click (CPC). Amazon suggestions: Another way to find keywords is with Amazon’s search suggestions. As you type in a query, Amazon will recommend a search. For example, if you type, “pool safety fence,” Amazon will suggest, “pool safety fence for deck.” With the keywordtool.io browser extension, you can also see the search volume and CPC of these suggested keywords. Competitor analysis: During keyword research, it’s also important to assess your competitors. Look at what keywords they’re targeting in their product titles, descriptions, and features. Keep in mind that you don’t want to copy your competitor’s strategy. All you want is some insight into their Amazon listing optimization approach. Advertising data: If you’ve advertised on Amazon, such as with Sponsored Products, you want to review your advertising data. In your Advertising Marketing Services (AMS) account, you can see which keywords drove clicks to your product listing, as well as purchases. Add those keywords to your optimization strategy. Like your product audit results, you want to compile your keyword research into a Google Sheet or Excel document. If you use keywordtool.io, you can download and import all your keyword data — from the search volume to the competition — into your document. That way, you keep your keywords organized and easy to access when optimizing your listings. 3. Organize product categories What is one step that most, “How to Optimize Your Amazon Listing,” guides skip? Organizing and optimizing your product categories. It’s a quick step and one that can lead to big returns for your company, from more sales to better rankings in results. It’s helpful to ensure your products occupy the correct product category because of user search habits. While many shoppers will start with a query on Amazon, they’ll often filter their results, such as by category, brand, or material. As an example, look at the filters available for the query, “pool safety fence.” If your pool fencing occupies the “Agricultural Fencing” category, for instance, users in your target audience can — and likely will — remove your product listing from their search results with a single click. That’s why you need to review the categories your products occupy. Amazon makes this an easy fix via the Product Classifier tool. Just follow these steps: Use the browse or search method to determine your product’s classifications Build and download your list of classifications, or Product Classifier file Open your Product Classifier file and download the recommended Inventory File Templates Add your product classifications and refinement fields to your Inventory File Templates Upload your changes Once you update your product categories, you can start optimizing each product listing. 4. Write informative product titles One of the most critical parts of optimizing your Amazon listing is writing your product title. For users, as well as Amazon, it’s important that you create an informative title — users should know what you’re selling before they even click on your listing. When you write your product listing, make sure to follow these best practices: Capitalize the first letter of each word unless it’s a conjunction, article, or preposition Use numerals and state the number of items in a product pack Spell out measurements and the word, “and” Include a primary keyword at least once It’s also critical that you exclude the following information, which can impact your rank in results: All capital letters for each word Promotional messages, such as for sales or free shipping Subjective commentary, such as “Best Seller” Brand, company, or seller information Pricing information Special characters or symbols, like © For product titles, Amazon limits you to 200 characters. In some cases, certain product categories have a limit lower than 200 characters — you can find out the character limit for your product category by viewing Amazon’s Templates for Specific Categories. Amazon also offers a recommended product title format: Brand + Model + Product Type If you have additional and relevant information to include in your product title, Amazon recommends including it after the product type. Some additional information that’s helpful to consumers are the number of items in a product pack or the color of a product. Below, you can see an example of an optimized product title for a pool fence. The seller follows the exact format for product titles — it starts with the brand, Water Warden, followed by the model, four foot, and then the product type and primary keyword, pool safety fence. Note, however, that while the seller uses numerals, they don’t spell out the measurement. It’s an excellent example of how you can continue to improve and optimize your product titles. 5. Build benefit-rich product features Whether they’re browsing Google or Amazon, users will always skim through search results and the content they click to view. That’s why your product features are so critical — they provide users with valuable information about your product in bite-sized chunks. Amazon allows you to highlight five product features. These features appear as bullet points beneath your product’s pricing, inventory, style, and color information. Depending on your product, some of these features may not display, such as a color choice for a product that only comes in one color. Optimize your product features by following these tips: Start each bullet point with a capital letter Write all numbers as numerals Spell out all measurements Use a primary keyword in each bullet point Separate phrases in a single feature with semicolons Maximize the success of your Amazon listing’s optimization by avoiding the following missteps: Including seller, company, or shipping information Featuring promotional or pricing information Using hyphens, symbols, periods, exclamation points, and any ending punctuation Writing vague, uninformative statements If you’re unsure which product features to highlight, Amazon recommends showcasing the following: Warranty or guarantee information Product dimensions Product age group Product origin Care instructions Package contents It’s also essential to include product features that emphasize value to consumers. For pool fencing, users may not care that much about the product’s age group. Instead, they’re probably focused on the warranty, dimensions, and contents. If you look at the earlier example of product features, you can see that the seller highlights the product’s convenience. It’s easy for you to install and remove the fence, which includes a limited lifetime warranty and non-corrosive latching system. Plus, the system includes almost everything — except a gate. All this information comes from the product features, making it even easier for users to buy from you. 6. Write compelling product descriptions Another core part of Amazon listing optimization is your product descriptions, which have a max length of 2000 characters. These appear lower on the product page, which means shoppers that are reading this description are interested in learning more about your product, such as pool fencing. Follow these best practices for product descriptions to improve your ranking in search results: Include information on major product features and uses Note warranty information, care instructions, dimensions, and other helpful information Use complete sentences and correct grammar and punctuation Include primary keywords when appropriate It’s also critical that you don’t include the following information: Company-specific information Promotional information Information for another product Website URL Seller name Contact information, such as an email address When you’re optimizing your product description, it’s worth looking back on your competitor analysis. While you focused on their keyword strategy, it’s likely you noticed their customer reviews. These reviews may have noted the perks of the product, as well as the pain points of it. In your product description, highlight how your product relieves these pain points. Maybe your competitor doesn’t offer a comprehensive warranty, but you do — note this in your product description, as well as your product features. That can help you convert a shopper faster, which can have a massive impact when considering the number of shoppers on Amazon. 7. Upload high-quality product images A core part of Amazon listing optimization is your product images. That’s why it’s critical that you provide shoppers with a series of high-quality images that showcase your product, as well as its benefits and its uses. A few technical requirements for Amazon images include the following: JPEG, TIFF, GIF, or PNG format sRGB or CMYK color mode Dimension of 1000 pixels or larger in height or width It’s critical to adhere to Amazon’s standards for an sRGB (standard Red Green Blue) or CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) color mode because they can impact your sales, as well as return rate. If you use RGB (Red Green Blue), you’re providing shoppers with an inaccurate image of your product. To demonstrate, look at the example below: While they’re the same exact shades of green, they look for different. That provides consumers with a different idea of what your product will look like, versus what it actually looks like. To prevent that, use the sRGB or CMYK color mode, which you can set in a photo editing software, like Adobe Photoshop. Your filename should also feature an identifier of your product, such as its: ASIN: The Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) is a product identifier that consists of 10 letters or numbers. Amazon creates an ASIN for every product listing. ISBN: The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is an identifier for commercial books. It features 10 or 13 digits and appears on the back cover of a book. EAN: The European Article Number (EAN) is a 12- or 13-digit product identifier that denotes the product and product’s manufacturer. If a product does not have an EAN, you will need to purchase one. JAN: The Japanese Article Number (JAN) is a 13-digit product identifier for Japanese products. UPC: The Universal Product Code (UPC) is a 12-digit product identifier for goods sold in the U.S. Image filenames cannot include spaces, dashes, or special characters. On Amazon, you can upload two types of images: Primary image: A primary image of your product displays in search results — and it’s the first image users see on your product listing. That’s why Amazon has a separate set of standards for primary images. Other view images: Your other view images only display on your product listing. These often provide additional information about your product. The rules for these images are often more flexible than for primary images. For your primary image, follow these standards: Professional photograph or cover art of product Image dots per inch (dpi) of 1000 Entire product and all included items displayed Pure white background, which is RGB 255, 255, 255 Zero text, graphics, or inset images Avoid these bad practices for primary images to prevent a quality alert from Amazon: Promotional text Lifestyle pictures Colored backgrounds Images of the product in different colors Borders, watermarks, or text over images Product blueprints, sketches, or drawings Products not included with the listed product If you’re preparing to photograph your product for its Amazon listing, do not upload an image placeholder. A placeholder image, such as one that says, “No Image Available,” can result in a quality alert from Amazon. When it comes to your other view images, follow these recommendations: Use backgrounds or environments Ensure a 1000 dpi Demonstrate the scale of a product with other objects or related products Have the product and any additional items occupy at least 85 percent of the image Include close-up or cropped images For other view images, Amazon allows you to use text and demonstrative graphics. While you can include these on your images, make sure they offer value to shoppers. A graphic of how to install your pool fencing, for instance, can provide value to consumers. 8. Encourage verified Amazon reviews To provide shoppers with high-quality results, Amazon weighs product reviews and ratings in its search algorithm.

That ensures shoppers receive the best customer experience possible, which can lead to positive reviews from shoppers — and an improvement in your search results rank. Create product bundles: With bundled products, you can also optimize your Amazon listings. This strategy is excellent for products that have lower sales numbers but offer value to shoppers. When you build a bundle on Amazon, make sure the bundle make sense, such as packaging a pool fence with a gate for that fence. Try Amazon ads: If you’re launching a new product — and have optimized its listing — you can also experiment with advertising on Amazon. Like pay-per-click (PPC) advertising options on other platforms, like Google, your ad tops organic search results, and you only pay when users click on your ad.

Here are the top six ways to optimise your Amazon product listings for increased sales, a better ranking, improved conversion… and more money in your pocket! 1. Here’s the #1 way to squeeze every last dime out of your listings. Have you had your listing text (copy) optimised? Who wrote the copy for your listings? You could be missing out on potentially thousands (or tens of thousands) of dollars in lost revenue because: A: Your listings aren’t attracting as much traffic they could be because they’re lacking the proper keywords in the right places B: Your listings aren’t converting as much of the traffic (turning browsers into buyers) as they should be because your listings aren’t written in a way that’s compelling or benefit-driven enough to convince someone who is browsing to push the “Add to Cart” button. If you haven’t invested in having your listings written by a qualified copywriter who specialises in Amazon listings…I would highly, highly recommend trying it. This could be one of the best investments you make this year. Do a test with just one listing, first, and compare the difference before having them all rewritten. 2. The biggest tragedy on Amazon…The majority of listings are NOT optimised. You’ve seen them… They’re the listings with short, three word bullets that point out obvious product features. They’ve got the mashed-up description that goes into scientific detail about the product that makes little to no sense to you. There are far more poor listings than good ones…which is fantastic news for you…because that’s an opportunity for you to cash-in on your competitors’ ignorance. Take the copy of your Amazon listings seriously, this is a critically important aspect of your listing (as much as price is). 3. Want to quickly boost your sale? Make sure your copy (listing text) is written as if you were sitting across from your reader. When was the last time you found yourself stuck listening to someone who only talked about him/herself? Your listing should be written as if you were sitting down across from your reader, speaking to them directly….you’ll see a much higher ROI by writing directly to your audience. Avoid speaking about yourself…swap out the words “we” and “us” with “you”. This will substantially increase engagement, will get them to read the entire listing, and will increase your sales dramatically. 4. Here’s the single biggest mistake sellers on Amazon are making; it’s monkey-simple. What’s the whole point of Amazon? It’s a place that consumers go to buy stuff. That’s it. You can easily beat your competitors by simply tweaking your listing to meet the situation your potential customers are in. Why are they on Amazon? To buy stuff. They’re not there to seek information or to be told why they need your item. They already know why they need it…now they’re searching for the best deal, the most powerful, the highest reviewed, or whatever else. What most sellers do wrong is they waste vital space trying to convince their browsers why they need the product in the first place. For example… Somebody on Amazon looking for a diet pill doesn’t need to be convinced why they need the diet pill. They have already done their research and chose to buy the diet pill; they are on Amazon to BUY, not to learn. They also do not need to be explained the science behind the product. (Example: when was the last time you were at a car dealership and the salesman went into detail about how the vehicle converted gasoline/electricity into power that turned the wheels?) Instead, they should be reminded of all the benefits that reaching their weight loss/diet goals would look and feel like…along with reasons why THIS particular product is better/cheaper/more effective/easier than all other options. It’s not a matter of convincing them they need the product itself, your potential customer already knows they need it. It’s actually a matter of convincing them they need YOUR product over your competitors. Make sure to meet your potential customers with where they are. They’re not at the library or on Google looking up ways to solve their problem. They’re at the store, pushing their cart, browsing the aisle your product resides in…comparing yours against the ones right next to it. There is an absolute goldmine of money waiting for you to claim if you simply write your listing the proper way. 5. What’s the quickest, easiest way to make even more money without spending hardly any? Make sure to have a smart follow-up campaign in place. There are dozens of reasons to have a follow-up email campaign in place…but I’ll brush on a few. Proper follow-up campaigns can help you to build a relationship with your customers, which can: Easily result in repeat business (it’s 10x easier to sell to someone who has purchased from you in the past than to someone who hasn’t) Quickly build up your product reviews, boosting your ranking and sales Allow you to cross-promote products, giving you another channel to maximise your profits Create incentives for your customers to share your products with friends and on social media, giving you infinite free marketing Be an effortless way to explain your product, give extra bonus tips/tricks to get the most out of it, and minimise bad feedback or returns If you aren’t already doing this, you need to be. This is the quickest, easiest way to generate revenue without spending extra money. 6. Are you making this mistake and losing money? Don’t waste money on sending traffic to your listings until they are FULLY optimised. A major mistake I see many sellers make, that still has me cringing, is sending paid traffic to their listing when the copy isn’t optimised. It’s amazing how much money is being thrown away because of this. Having said that, make sure you’ve taken care of all of the copy on your listings so that they’re optimised before you spend money on advertising. You’re going to maximise your ROI, save money on wasted/missed opportunities, and ensure you’re operating at 100%. If you’ve already spent money on advertising, that’s okay. Just make sure to correct this before spending more. You could end up saving literally tens of thousands of dollars in wasted advertising by cleaning up your listings and making sure they’re properly optimised. These are only a few ways you can pump-up your listings so they’re doing what they’re supposed to: squeezing every last drop out of the visitors that reach them. Rewriting your listings so that the copy is optimised could mean tens of thousands of dollars in increased revenue for your business…I’ve seen it time and time again. Final Thoughts When you have your listings optimised and products easily found, the final piece in the jigsaw is to ensure your prices are competitive—24/7. With an Amazon repricing solution like RepricerExpress, you’ll maintain competitive prices on your products without constant attention, so why not give the 15-day free trial a try to see the difference.

Back to Resources The Ultimate Amazon SEO Quick Start Guide for 2025 AI-driven competition is here to stay. In this era of intelligent algorithms, it’s more important than ever to master your Amazon SEO! Amazon Advertising Selling On Amazon November 29, 2024 / Ashlynn Ruman The level of sophistication of Amazon sellers has never been higher. Add in the revolution to artificial intelligence and you have a scenario in which entrepreneurs are racing to gain every edge they can. That’s why optimizing for Amazon SEO is more important than ever. This post focuses on strategies you can use to get ahead of your competition, and details a 9-step checklist that covers everything you need to know about SEO in the age of AI-augmented competition. But first . . . What is Amazon SEO? Amazon search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of making carefully considered improvements to product listings to rank higher in product searches on Amazon.com. A well-crafted Amazon SEO strategy helps you improve your Amazon listings for product search, boosts sales, and makes it easier for Amazon shoppers to find your listings and brand store. *Why Do So Many Amazon Search Results Look the Same?* Amazon’s ecosystem is packed full with cookie-cutter courses offering easy-to-follow directions that promise to get new ecommerce sellers onto Amazon’s first page. Unfortunately, those Amazon cookie-cutter courses lead to cookie-cutter products. There are a lot of Amazon sellers doing a pretty good job with their ecommerce business. That leaves a lot of room at the top for those few Amazon sellers that want to take their digital marketing to another level, and do a great job. *How to Get Your Product Found on Amazon* Amazon shoppers conduct product searches by typing a term or phrase (the keywords) into the search box located at the top of the Amazon.com homepage. Then, Amazon’s algorithm goes to work and spits out the relevant organic search results for the word or phrase. At that point, the shopper has the opportunity to look more closely at an individual listing or continue to search using additional highly-descriptive keywords. That’s where Amazon listing optimization comes in. In today’s digital marketplace, Amazon listing optimization has become pivotal for sellers aiming to capture a larger market share and ensure their ASINs are prominently showcased in their product category. At the heart of this process are Amazon product listings. Essentially, they’re your digital storefront for products on Amazon. A well-optimized product listing not only catches the eye of a potential online shopper, it also significantly improves product ranking on Amazon’s search pages, ultimately resulting in enhanced visibility and more sales. Here’s a checklist to get started: *9-Step Amazon SEO Checklist* Keyword Research High-Quality Product Images Evocative Product Titles Bullet Points That Tell Your Product’s Story Product Descriptions to Describe and Explain Backend Search Terms Help Fill In the Gaps Competitive Pricing Strategy Amazon PPC Advertising to Increase Visibility Sales Velocity Step 1 – Amazon Keyword Research Good SEO strategy begins with Amazon keyword research. Keywords (also known as “SEO keywords,” “keyphrases,” “search terms,” or “search queries”) are words and phrases users type into search engines to find information on a particular topic. They are the “trigger” for Amazon’s search results. Front-facing keywords show up in product titles, descriptions, and bullet points. These are the keywords most likely to bring your product to your target audience’s attention in the form of a search result. Backend keywords are not visible to prospective buyers, but they are a great way to become searchable in Amazon’s database. The backend is a good place to include foreign language translations of your keywords. Ready to Start Growing Your Amazon Brand? Canopy’s Partners Achieve an Average 84% Profit Increase! Find out more There are four opportunities to use the best keywords to optimize your Amazon listing: Product Title Key Product Features Product Description Backend Search Terms Step 2 – High-Quality Amazon Product Images Stop the Scroll After users search on Amazon, the first thing they’ll look at are the images of a product. High quality images enable customers to quickly decide if a product is worth taking a closer look at. They’re a big part of why Amazon shoppers might actually read the title, bullet points, and the description. Amazon Image Guidelines Six images and one video is ideal Images should be clear, informative, and attractive Images should have a white background and fill at least 85% of the image space. Use 500 x 500 or 1000 x 1,000 pixels to increase listing quality. Make sure to show the entire product Include only what the customer will receive Canopy Pro Tip: Be sure that your images include lifestyle, infographics, and video. Not only will they help stop the scroll, they will help eliminate a majority of your returns and customer service issues. Take full advantage of Amazon A+ Content featuring ultra-high quality images Amazon’s native AI-powered image “generator” leverages generative artificial intelligence to deliver lifestyle- and brand-themed images, based on product details, in a matter of seconds. This can level the field for smaller sellers Step 3 – Evocative Product Titles Help Form the Right First Impression It only takes 5-10 seconds after meeting someone new to form a first impression. The same is true of your product title. While you have a limit of up to 200 characters, only the first 5-10 words in your product title are what appear as a search result, making these 5-10 words the most important piece of copy for your listing. Your product title should match what would be on the product package itself Amazon recommends an efficiently descriptive title of between 60 and 80 characters Make your title clear, but keep it short! Canopy Pro Tip: Don’t forget about Amazon shoppers using their smartphones. There’s limited room, so your title will be truncated. Make sure to place your main keywords at the very front of your titles. While you want to be sure to include three or four of your top keywords, be careful to not “keyword stuff.” Include your band name in the title. It’s important to begin to instill brand confidence and recognition. Step 4 – Bullet Points That Tell Your Brand Story Trying to get your entire product description and targeted keywords into the tight 200 characters of the product title can be challenging. With a 1000-character limit, Amazon’s product features section gives you a bit more room to help Amazon shoppers really appreciate the unique features of your product. A good list of key features starts each point with a key benefit that directly appeals to what your customer needs. Canopy Pro Tip: Lead off with a summarization of each bullet point with bolded and/or capital letters. By doing this, you’re making it much easier for the large numbers of customers that prefer to quickly skim the listing. You want to include most of your medium and high search volume long-tail keywords in the copy of your bullet points. Take the time to expand on your product’s features. Put yourself in the shopper’s shoes and anticipate questions that they might have. Use customer reviews for similar products to identify the questions that prospective customers have had. They will also give you a clearer idea of the product features that they loved. That way you can highlight similar features in your own listings. Step 5 – Product Descriptions to Describe, Explain and Reduce Returns Your product description section should be the area where you expand on your key product features and benefits. You will also use this area to include the long-tail keywords that you’ve identified in your keyword research. Amazon allows you the use of 2,000 characters to describe your product and explain its function and uses. Canopy Pro Tip: Do: Strategically incorporate relevant keywords into your copy in a way that sounds natural. Create a buyer persona by considering your ideal customer and what they want. Highlight differentiators between your product and your competitors. Think about what you have to offer that others don’t. Tell a story. Everyone loves a good story, and it can help contextualize your product to show how it might fit into your customer’s life. Don’t: Stuff your listing with keywords. Remember, you’re selling to humans, not to algorithms Follow the crowd. Focus on what makes your product special Step 6 – Fill In the Gaps with Amazon Backend Search Terms Amazon sellers have the opportunity to provide more information about a product in the administrative backend of the product page Utilizing meta tags in your product page backend helps Amazon recognize the relevance of your product offering. You should never use this section as a way to stuff keywords that aren’t specific to those you targeted on the frontend. If you wouldn’t use it on the frontend, don’t put it in the backend. Amazon’s Guidelines: Maintain the text length limit of search terms. Make use of synonyms. Use spelling variations, but don’t include common misspellings. Include abbreviations. Use all lowercase letters. Avoid punctuation marks such as: “;”, “:”, and “-.” Separate words with spaces. Avoid repetitions. Avoid articles, prepositions, or other short words such as “a,” “an,” “and,” “by,” “for,” “of,” “the,” or “with.” Use either singular or plural words Step 7 – A Competitive Pricing Strategy Gives You the Inside Track Because shoppers navigate to Amazon’s marketplace with the assumption that they’re going to get a very competitive price, it’s critical that you take the time to research the competition and make adjustments to arrive at a price point that’s in sync with the niche you’re selling in. It’s important to remember that Amazon is very concerned about their shoppers’ overall experience. That’s why your price has such a big influence on your conversion rate and ultimate overall sales growth. Step 8 – Amazon PPC Advertising to Increase Visibility Amazon Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising is a powerful tool for enhancing your Amazon Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategy. By bidding on relevant keywords, your products gain increased visibility at the top of search results, potentially leading to higher click-through rates and sales. Because they’ve become such a big part of how Amazon sellers launch products, they’ve also a very important way to increase your Amazon SEO. Amazon will automatically generate and match ads to shopping queries. Combined with a well-structured keyword research campaign and a fully optimized listing, Amazon advertising has become a necessary ingredient to an optimum Amazon SEO score. This increased engagement sends positive signals to Amazon’s algorithm, which can improve your organic search rankings over time. Additionally, the targeted nature of PPC allows you to reach the most relevant audience, increasing the likelihood of conversions and further boosting your product’s performance metrics. Step 9 – Sales Velocity Sales performance plays a pivotal role in Amazon’s SEO strategy, directly influencing a product’s visibility and ranking in search results. It creates a flywheel effect and becomes a driver of SEO and ultimately, overall success on the platform. Amazon’s algorithm heavily favors products with strong sales history, interpreting high sales volumes as indicators of popularity and relevance. As sales increase, so does the product’s conversion rate, creating a positive feedback loop that further boosts its ranking. At the same time, increased sales often lead to more customer reviews and higher ratings, which are crucial factors in Amazon’s ranking algorithm. These elements collectively enhance a product’s credibility and visibility, potentially leading to better positioning in organic search results. Amazon SEO: What’s New for 2025 It’s not a surprise to most of you that artificial intelligence has changed our lives in one way or another. Update your Amazon SEO for 2025 by including AI-driven optimization, voice search strategies, video content, and a heavy mobile-first approach. Highlight sustainability, leverage features like Amazon Live, and emphasize data analytics and cross-platform integration to stay competitive. Here’s how: AI-Driven Optimization Artificial intelligence continues to revolutionize Amazon SEO, offering sellers constantly updated tools allowing them to gain a competitive edge. AI can be leveraged for advanced keyword research, identifying high-converting, low-competition terms tailored to specific niches. For content optimization, AI tools quickly analyze top-performing listings to suggest improvements in titles, bullet points, and descriptions. You can also use AI for competitive analysis, tracking competitor strategies, pricing trends, and market dynamics. AI is moving at the speed of light. To stay ahead of AI-powered competition, it’s a good idea to integrate some version of AI-driven methodology while updating your strategies. Voice Search Optimization The rise of voice-activated devices like Alexa and Echo has made voice search optimization a priority for Amazon sellers. Voice queries tend to be more conversational, resembling natural language, so integrating long-tail keywords and question-based phrases into listings is crucial. Updating FAQs, using bullet points with straightforward answers, and optimizing titles for voice search can significantly improve discoverability in this growing segment. Video Content Video is becoming a central component of Amazon’s marketplace. In 2025, sellers who effectively use product videos will have a distinct advantage. To optimize for video, ensure content is concise, visually appealing, and includes key product features within the first few seconds. Adding call-to-actions (e.g., “Add to Cart Now”) and ensuring videos are optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing are essential. Videos should also be incorporated into A+ Content, where they can boost engagement and conversion rates. Additionally, consider using customer testimonials or how-to guides in video format to build trust and demonstrate product value. Mobile Optimization Mobile shopping continues to dominate, making mobile-first strategies essential for 2025. Ensure your images, videos, and text are optimized for smaller screens, with compressed file sizes for faster load times. Use shorter, punchier bullet points and avoid overly complex descriptions. Prioritize the ease of navigation on mobile devices of clickable elements, like “Add to Cart” or product variations. Additionally, leverage Amazon’s mobile-specific features, such as mobile-exclusive promotions, to drive engagement and sales. Amazon’s Algorithm Updates Amazon’s algorithm now places greater emphasis on factors beyond keyword density. In 2025 you’re going to want to prioritize sales velocity, focusing on strategies like lightning deals, competitive pricing, and promotional campaigns. Generating off-Amazon traffic, such as through social media ads or blog partnerships, is increasingly critical. Building seller authority by maintaining a high feedback rating, fast shipping times, and consistent inventory levels also contributes to better ranking. Keep refining your listings based on data insights to align with the Amazon algorithm’s evolving priorities. Social Proof and User-Generated Content Social commerce is booming. Live streaming allows sellers to showcase products in real-time, answer customer questions, and drive engagement. Incorporate this into your SEO strategy by scheduling regular live sessions and promoting them via social media. Features like offer exciting opportunities for New features, such as Amazon Live, interactive storefronts, and enhanced brand analytics boost visibility to help you to stay ahead of the curve. Customer reviews and user-generated content will remain vital for SEO success. Showcase positive reviews and photos in your A+ Content to build trust. Responding promptly to reviews, especially negative ones, demonstrates customer care and helps maintain a strong seller rating. Also, consider featuring user-generated videos or testimonials in your Amazon posts or Live sessions to further engage your audience. Cross-Platform Integration An effective Amazon SEO strategy doesn’t operate in isolation. By integrating your efforts with additional marketplaces such as Walmart, and TikTok Shop as well as platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest, you can drive traffic back to Amazon listings, improving off-platform traffic metrics favored by Amazon’s algorithm.

Back to Resources The Ultimate Amazon SEO Quick Start Guide for 2025 AI-driven competition is here to stay. In this era of intelligent algorithms, it’s more important than ever to master your Amazon SEO! Amazon Advertising Selling On Amazon November 29, 2024 / Ashlynn Ruman The level of sophistication of Amazon sellers has never been higher. Add in the revolution to artificial intelligence and you have a scenario in which entrepreneurs are racing to gain every edge they can. That’s why optimizing for Amazon SEO is more important than ever. This post focuses on strategies you can use to get ahead of your competition, and details a 9-step checklist that covers everything you need to know about SEO in the age of AI-augmented competition. But first . . . What is Amazon SEO? Amazon search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of making carefully considered improvements to product listings to rank higher in product searches on Amazon.com. A well-crafted Amazon SEO strategy helps you improve your Amazon listings for product search, boosts sales, and makes it easier for Amazon shoppers to find your listings and brand store. *Why Do So Many Amazon Search Results Look the Same?* Amazon’s ecosystem is packed full with cookie-cutter courses offering easy-to-follow directions that promise to get new ecommerce sellers onto Amazon’s first page. Unfortunately, those Amazon cookie-cutter courses lead to cookie-cutter products. There are a lot of Amazon sellers doing a pretty good job with their ecommerce business. That leaves a lot of room at the top for those few Amazon sellers that want to take their digital marketing to another level, and do a great job. *How to Get Your Product Found on Amazon* Amazon shoppers conduct product searches by typing a term or phrase (the keywords) into the search box located at the top of the Amazon.com homepage. Then, Amazon’s algorithm goes to work and spits out the relevant organic search results for the word or phrase. At that point, the shopper has the opportunity to look more closely at an individual listing or continue to search using additional highly-descriptive keywords. That’s where Amazon listing optimization comes in. In today’s digital marketplace, Amazon listing optimization has become pivotal for sellers aiming to capture a larger market share and ensure their ASINs are prominently showcased in their product category. At the heart of this process are Amazon product listings. Essentially, they’re your digital storefront for products on Amazon. A well-optimized product listing not only catches the eye of a potential online shopper, it also significantly improves product ranking on Amazon’s search pages, ultimately resulting in enhanced visibility and more sales. Here’s a checklist to get started: *9-Step Amazon SEO Checklist* Keyword Research High-Quality Product Images Evocative Product Titles Bullet Points That Tell Your Product’s Story Product Descriptions to Describe and Explain Backend Search Terms Help Fill In the Gaps Competitive Pricing Strategy Amazon PPC Advertising to Increase Visibility Sales Velocity Step 1 – Amazon Keyword Research Good SEO strategy begins with Amazon keyword research. Keywords (also known as “SEO keywords,” “keyphrases,” “search terms,” or “search queries”) are words and phrases users type into search engines to find information on a particular topic. They are the “trigger” for Amazon’s search results. Front-facing keywords show up in product titles, descriptions, and bullet points. These are the keywords most likely to bring your product to your target audience’s attention in the form of a search result. Backend keywords are not visible to prospective buyers, but they are a great way to become searchable in Amazon’s database. The backend is a good place to include foreign language translations of your keywords. Ready to Start Growing Your Amazon Brand? Canopy’s Partners Achieve an Average 84% Profit Increase! Find out more There are four opportunities to use the best keywords to optimize your Amazon listing: Product Title Key Product Features Product Description Backend Search Terms Step 2 – High-Quality Amazon Product Images Stop the Scroll After users search on Amazon, the first thing they’ll look at are the images of a product. High quality images enable customers to quickly decide if a product is worth taking a closer look at. They’re a big part of why Amazon shoppers might actually read the title, bullet points, and the description. Amazon Image Guidelines Six images and one video is ideal Images should be clear, informative, and attractive Images should have a white background and fill at least 85% of the image space. Use 500 x 500 or 1000 x 1,000 pixels to increase listing quality. Make sure to show the entire product Include only what the customer will receive Canopy Pro Tip: Be sure that your images include lifestyle, infographics, and video. Not only will they help stop the scroll, they will help eliminate a majority of your returns and customer service issues. Take full advantage of Amazon A+ Content featuring ultra-high quality images Amazon’s native AI-powered image “generator” leverages generative artificial intelligence to deliver lifestyle- and brand-themed images, based on product details, in a matter of seconds. This can level the field for smaller sellers Step 3 – Evocative Product Titles Help Form the Right First Impression It only takes 5-10 seconds after meeting someone new to form a first impression. The same is true of your product title. While you have a limit of up to 200 characters, only the first 5-10 words in your product title are what appear as a search result, making these 5-10 words the most important piece of copy for your listing. Your product title should match what would be on the product package itself Amazon recommends an efficiently descriptive title of between 60 and 80 characters Make your title clear, but keep it short! Canopy Pro Tip: Don’t forget about Amazon shoppers using their smartphones. There’s limited room, so your title will be truncated. Make sure to place your main keywords at the very front of your titles. While you want to be sure to include three or four of your top keywords, be careful to not “keyword stuff.” Include your band name in the title. It’s important to begin to instill brand confidence and recognition. Step 4 – Bullet Points That Tell Your Brand Story Trying to get your entire product description and targeted keywords into the tight 200 characters of the product title can be challenging. With a 1000-character limit, Amazon’s product features section gives you a bit more room to help Amazon shoppers really appreciate the unique features of your product. A good list of key features starts each point with a key benefit that directly appeals to what your customer needs. Canopy Pro Tip: Lead off with a summarization of each bullet point with bolded and/or capital letters. By doing this, you’re making it much easier for the large numbers of customers that prefer to quickly skim the listing. You want to include most of your medium and high search volume long-tail keywords in the copy of your bullet points. Take the time to expand on your product’s features. Put yourself in the shopper’s shoes and anticipate questions that they might have. Use customer reviews for similar products to identify the questions that prospective customers have had. They will also give you a clearer idea of the product features that they loved. That way you can highlight similar features in your own listings. Step 5 – Product Descriptions to Describe, Explain and Reduce Returns Your product description section should be the area where you expand on your key product features and benefits. You will also use this area to include the long-tail keywords that you’ve identified in your keyword research. Amazon allows you the use of 2,000 characters to describe your product and explain its function and uses. Canopy Pro Tip: Do: Strategically incorporate relevant keywords into your copy in a way that sounds natural. Create a buyer persona by considering your ideal customer and what they want. Highlight differentiators between your product and your competitors. Think about what you have to offer that others don’t. Tell a story. Everyone loves a good story, and it can help contextualize your product to show how it might fit into your customer’s life. Don’t: Stuff your listing with keywords. Remember, you’re selling to humans, not to algorithms Follow the crowd. Focus on what makes your product special Step 6 – Fill In the Gaps with Amazon Backend Search Terms Amazon sellers have the opportunity to provide more information about a product in the administrative backend of the product page Utilizing meta tags in your product page backend helps Amazon recognize the relevance of your product offering. You should never use this section as a way to stuff keywords that aren’t specific to those you targeted on the frontend. If you wouldn’t use it on the frontend, don’t put it in the backend. Amazon’s Guidelines: Maintain the text length limit of search terms. Make use of synonyms. Use spelling variations, but don’t include common misspellings. Include abbreviations. Use all lowercase letters. Avoid punctuation marks such as: “;”, “:”, and “-.” Separate words with spaces. Avoid repetitions. Avoid articles, prepositions, or other short words such as “a,” “an,” “and,” “by,” “for,” “of,” “the,” or “with.” Use either singular or plural words Step 7 – A Competitive Pricing Strategy Gives You the Inside Track Because shoppers navigate to Amazon’s marketplace with the assumption that they’re going to get a very competitive price, it’s critical that you take the time to research the competition and make adjustments to arrive at a price point that’s in sync with the niche you’re selling in. It’s important to remember that Amazon is very concerned about their shoppers’ overall experience. That’s why your price has such a big influence on your conversion rate and ultimate overall sales growth. Step 8 – Amazon PPC Advertising to Increase Visibility Amazon Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising is a powerful tool for enhancing your Amazon Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategy. By bidding on relevant keywords, your products gain increased visibility at the top of search results, potentially leading to higher click-through rates and sales. Because they’ve become such a big part of how Amazon sellers launch products, they’ve also a very important way to increase your Amazon SEO. Amazon will automatically generate and match ads to shopping queries. Combined with a well-structured keyword research campaign and a fully optimized listing, Amazon advertising has become a necessary ingredient to an optimum Amazon SEO score. This increased engagement sends positive signals to Amazon’s algorithm, which can improve your organic search rankings over time. Additionally, the targeted nature of PPC allows you to reach the most relevant audience, increasing the likelihood of conversions and further boosting your product’s performance metrics. Step 9 – Sales Velocity Sales performance plays a pivotal role in Amazon’s SEO strategy, directly influencing a product’s visibility and ranking in search results. It creates a flywheel effect and becomes a driver of SEO and ultimately, overall success on the platform. Amazon’s algorithm heavily favors products with strong sales history, interpreting high sales volumes as indicators of popularity and relevance. As sales increase, so does the product’s conversion rate, creating a positive feedback loop that further boosts its ranking. At the same time, increased sales often lead to more customer reviews and higher ratings, which are crucial factors in Amazon’s ranking algorithm. These elements collectively enhance a product’s credibility and visibility, potentially leading to better positioning in organic search results. Amazon SEO: What’s New for 2025 It’s not a surprise to most of you that artificial intelligence has changed our lives in one way or another. Update your Amazon SEO for 2025 by including AI-driven optimization, voice search strategies, video content, and a heavy mobile-first approach. Highlight sustainability, leverage features like Amazon Live, and emphasize data analytics and cross-platform integration to stay competitive. Here’s how: AI-Driven Optimization Artificial intelligence continues to revolutionize Amazon SEO, offering sellers constantly updated tools allowing them to gain a competitive edge. AI can be leveraged for advanced keyword research, identifying high-converting, low-competition terms tailored to specific niches. For content optimization, AI tools quickly analyze top-performing listings to suggest improvements in titles, bullet points, and descriptions. You can also use AI for competitive analysis, tracking competitor strategies, pricing trends, and market dynamics. AI is moving at the speed of light. To stay ahead of AI-powered competition, it’s a good idea to integrate some version of AI-driven methodology while updating your strategies. Voice Search Optimization The rise of voice-activated devices like Alexa and Echo has made voice search optimization a priority for Amazon sellers. Voice queries tend to be more conversational, resembling natural language, so integrating long-tail keywords and question-based phrases into listings is crucial. Updating FAQs, using bullet points with straightforward answers, and optimizing titles for voice search can significantly improve discoverability in this growing segment. Video Content Video is becoming a central component of Amazon’s marketplace. In 2025, sellers who effectively use product videos will have a distinct advantage. To optimize for video, ensure content is concise, visually appealing, and includes key product features within the first few seconds. Adding call-to-actions (e.g., “Add to Cart Now”) and ensuring videos are optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing are essential. Videos should also be incorporated into A+ Content, where they can boost engagement and conversion rates. Additionally, consider using customer testimonials or how-to guides in video format to build trust and demonstrate product value. Mobile Optimization Mobile shopping continues to dominate, making mobile-first strategies essential for 2025. Ensure your images, videos, and text are optimized for smaller screens, with compressed file sizes for faster load times. Use shorter, punchier bullet points and avoid overly complex descriptions. Prioritize the ease of navigation on mobile devices of clickable elements, like “Add to Cart” or product variations. Additionally, leverage Amazon’s mobile-specific features, such as mobile-exclusive promotions, to drive engagement and sales. Amazon’s Algorithm Updates Amazon’s algorithm now places greater emphasis on factors beyond keyword density. In 2025 you’re going to want to prioritize sales velocity, focusing on strategies like lightning deals, competitive pricing, and promotional campaigns.
