  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, let’s dive into this. So, you’ve got the URL https://playpickups.app/. Just looking at it, the name \"playpickups\" instantly gives off this vibe that we’re talking about some kind of app related to games or maybe sports. “Play” usually hints at interaction, like gaming or engaging in an activity, and “pickups” feels like it’s got that sporty edge to it, like picking up players or teams. My guess? This site is likely some kind of platform where you can make picks for games—think fantasy sports style. You know, where you select players for your team and compete against others based on their real-life performance. It’s a popular thing these days. You might be able to join leagues, set line-ups, and maybe even place bets—if that’s legal in your neck of the woods. Given that it’s an app, it's probably super user-friendly, possibly with a slick design and intuitive layout. You could easily see folks hopping on their phones to make last-minute changes to their lineups while sitting on the couch or even at a bar watching the game. It might even have social features, where you can brag about your picks or challenge your friends to head-to-head matchups. And let’s not skip over the community aspect. A lot of these sites are all about connecting with other fans. You might find forums or chat features where you can dish out advice or just talk smack about your buddies’ terrible picks. What really stands out, though, is the “app” part. It suggests that this is more than just a website; it's optimized for mobile, which is key nowadays. Maybe there’s a focus on real-time stats, updates, and notifications to keep you in the loop while you’re on the go. Picture this: you’re out with friends, and the game’s on. You get a notification that one of your players just scored, and you’re feeling like the king of the world because your picks are killing it. All in all, I'm picturing a vibrant, interactive platform that taps into the excitement of sports through some fun, competitive gameplay. If you’re into games, sports, or just want a little friendly rivalry with your pals, then this site sounds like it’s got you covered. Cheers to that!",

Stokastic Odds: Reverse Line Movement Login DFS News & ArticlesLearn DFS How to Win in DFS: Expert Strategy Tips & Advice Updated January 23, 2025 1:15 pm by Alex Baker The most popular tournaments on fantasy sites such as DraftKings and FanDuel allow you to throw down $5 to $10 with the prospect of winning $100,000. We all enter with the goal of outsmarting the competition and coming away with a life-changing sum of money. All DFS ads emphasize the amount you can win and the thrill of coming up with those plays that no one has that go off. In my experience, success in these tournaments is a feasible goal for anyone willing to put in the work exactly because the tournaments are filled with players who are unwilling or unable to put in the work. By playing the biggest low-stakes tournaments daily, you can make a nice income over the course of a year if you apply the right DFS strategy. Let’s break down how to win in DFS as I dive into my expert strategy tips and advice. Starting off in DFS is challenging for most players now because using your knowledge from watching a sport alone won’t get you very far. You have to learn the strategy of salary cap games, which include identifying the top plays and understanding who the popular plays. If your lineups are the same as everyone else’s, you won’t get very far! Most people who start playing DFS have full-time jobs and lack the necessary time to accomplish these goals on their own. Fortunately, it becomes a lot easier if you have the right tools and resources, like our DFS Sim tools. How to Win in DFS: Expert Strategy Tips & Advice Stokastic’s industry-leading NBA DFS tools have fueled remarkable achievements, including a memorable week where one user secured wins in two NBA DFS tournaments! If you’re ready to take your DFS game to the next level, a Stokastic+ NBA subscription is the competitive edge you need to stay ahead. How to Win in DFS: Expert Strategy Tips & Advice Since only about 85% of entry fees are paid out as prizes in each contest, not everyone can win on DraftKings and FanDuel. In fact, based on my historical research, only about 25% of lineups entered have a positive expected value. The catch is that once you go beyond the easiest tournaments, a lot more than a quarter of lineups are made by relatively sharp players. It’s easier to break lineups into two categories to determine their chances of success: their chance of achieving a high enough score to cash and their chance of a top finish. The first one can be measured in terms of overall projection and correlation, but the score to cash and win will fluctuate with how the most popular picks end up performing. As a result, a lineup that is more differentiated versus the field might have a better chance of winning if their score is moderately high on nights that the popular plays disappoint. It’s rare that my highest-scoring lineups are my biggest winners in DFS because lineup scores are so correlated across the field; I have had more success on days where the winning score is low. Managing the trade-off between projection and differentiation is the single most critical factor to success in GPPs — and it’s often overlooked by novice players. Making Projections For several years, accurate projections were all you needed to succeed at GPPs, as the field wasn’t great at identifying the best players each night. While just plugging in highly projected lineups won’t get you far in tournaments today, it’s still a great starting point for determining how strong of a lineup you have. If you have the highest-projected lineup, your lineup will be a favorite in one-on-one matchups versus every lineup in the tournament. That bodes well for your chances of cashing in a tournament, but it isn’t a great metric for determining your chances of coming in first. If you don’t have your own projections, you can still make great tournament lineups using the resources we have here. With my DFS projections, you can narrow the player pool to only include players that are average or better plays on a given day. Spending most of your salary while preferentially choosing players with high-value rankings will ensure that your lineup has a good median projection. Correlation: Selecting the best-scoring players across numerous games is extraordinarily difficult from an odds standpoint — unless you factor in correlations between players. Usually, players are good to pair together in a GPP if one is more likely to score points when the other performs above expectations. On the other hand, you want to avoid situations where one player’s excellent performance comes at the expense of another one on your same roster: these lineups are more likely to produce a consistent score for your team than the outlier you need. The levels of correlation vary greatly with each sport and greatly affect DFS strategy for those games. “Upside”: DFS players often seek out players with higher upside. Most athletes worth considering because of their price and projection have enough upside to win you a GPP. What you usually need from a player to win is a performance that is at least one standard deviation above their projection, which happens about 1/6 of the time. But if you target players with more variance (i.e. a higher standard deviation), they may give you the tournament-winning upside you need 1/5 or even 1/4 of the time. These could be athletes who get more run if they’re the hot hand in NBA and NFL — or ones who have great power but a low batting average in MLB. Players with high variance are more valuable in GPPs than their median projection may indicate. Accuracy: Projections won’t get you far unless they are at least as accurate as your competition’s. Checking your projections for errors is essential to avoid costly mistakes. What I like doing is to compare my projections against other sources to challenge my assumptions. To narrow down the scope of my error checking I will only look at players I have projected significantly differently than the sources. If I can figure out why my projection is erroneous, I will adjust the factors that led to my projection. My favorite sources to check are sportsbooks — while they have their own biases, they have to be fairly accurate because they are throwing their own money down on them. You can also use my rankings to identify athletes whose projections are worth a closer look. Being Contrarian Each lineup in a tournament wins under certain circumstances. You’ll have the most success if your lineup is the winning lineup under the broadest set of outcomes. The way you can achieve this goal is by having a lineup that overlaps less with other lineups but is still relatively likely to be a high scorer that night. In a perfect strategy, you would overlap less in winner-take-all contests than contests where 20% of the field cashes because picking the most popular players helps you get a cashing score but not that much to winning one. Ownership: The simplest way to make your lineup different than others is to choose lower-owned players. It goes without saying that the fewer players with someone rostered, the more it helps each lineup to win a tournament. Usually, the best strategy is to make a roster with a combination of best values and sleeper picks. That gives you a good chance to cash while still having reasonably likely conditions to win the tournament. To predict player ownership, you must first understand that most lineups are strongly influenced by outside factors, whether it be recommendations by fantasy influencers, box scores in the DFS site’s app, or what games are televised. Then you compare the options at each position to determine the relative popularity of each. Finally, you build lineups because all of these factors have to fit in the constraints of the salary cap. If you don’t have hours a day to devote to studying the slate, the best place to stop is my ownership projections which use a proprietary algorithm that I have developed over years of playing. Roster Construction: Another way to achieve a lineup that is highly differentiated from others is to pair players together who may not usually be present in the same lineup. For example, two tight ends may both be popular in isolation, but if you create a roster with a tight end in the flex, that combination of players may be present in much fewer lineups than you would expect given the high ownership of each. You can also spend different amounts of salary than the cap to achieve this goal, which is especially popular in large field tournaments with small slates. One of my biggest wins was in a 104,575-person showdown NFL tournament on DraftKings in which I only spent $47,600 of the $50,000 salary cap; only one other person had the same lineup, which split the prize many fewer ways than normal. The catch is that each of my players had to outscore each player within $2,400 of salary. In sports where the perfect lineup frequently spends less than the salary cap, this is a more viable strategy: Diversification: If you’re entering more than one lineup, you should have your lineups work together to maximize your chance of winning on a given night. On one extreme, you could have two lineups with only one different player in them: that means that on a night where one lineup finishes first, the other is likely to finish second, which hurts the expected value of each lineup. The other extreme is picking a lineup that relies on the opposite result of the first, most likely the other team winning the game. The problem with that strategy is the second lineup isn’t likely to be a good one because, assuming the first lineup was the best one you could build, the first team’s success is the more likely outcome. The best way to diversify is to pick lineups with at least three or more players different from each of your other lineups. Trade-offs: Daily fantasy is no easy game: it’s unusual to find a player who is both optimal in value and projection while being low-owned. Being a successful DFS player is all about finding the inefficiencies; in particular, identifying players who are owned higher or lower than they should be. And the context of your lineup matters a lot too. You want to evaluate your projection and ownership for your whole lineup so that you can guarantee whether you’re making trade-offs in the right spots. It’s a losing strategy to play all sub-1% owned players even if all of those players are lower owned than they should be. The ideal lineup will have some players with a high probability of success (which inevitably will come with higher ownership) sprinkled with a few players with lower probabilities of success (and lower ownership). React App My Process Have a set strategy and stick to it. You can reevaluate your approach every few weeks but don’t try to change it up every day. You want to conserve your energy for the most important decisions of the day by having a process for most decisions you make. Here’s what a typical main slate looks like for me (ET): 11 AM: Review the previous games that each team has played and adjust variables in my model accordingly (e.g. study snap counts, target share, minutes played). 4 PM: Compare projections for each player to other data sources and identify areas where my model differs and determine whether my projection is right or wrong. 5-7 PM: Watch YouTube content to stay up to date with the latest news and be exposed to differing viewpoints that challenge my own conclusions. 6 PM: Start building lineups on the Sims. Identify players that are showing up much more or less than projected ownership and determine my position. 6:30-6:50 PM: Sort through my lineups to determine which ones I want to enter into contests. 6:50-7 PM: Check lineups on site to make sure that there were no errors in my process. 10-11 PM: Review tournaments to see if assumptions were accurate. Identify issues with model. While DFS can be a full-time job, there are several areas where you can simplify the process. I started this company so that you can be successful in the games today without making it a full-time job. Using our scoring and ownership projections greatly expedites the process. You can also reduce the complexity of the day by only making a handful of lineups or limiting the number of sites you play on. Finally, automating things as much as possible will save you valuable time. Want our DFS Sims for FREE? Sign up with one of our partners and unlock the best DFS tools!

How to Win in DFS: Concluding Thoughts on Strategy DFS is in its essence a competition. Success in the long run requires an edge over your opponents. The less experienced the competition is, the easier it is to achieve that edge. So, begin with the easiest tournaments – the huge low-stakes tournaments and contests where experienced players are restricted from entering. You don’t have to be an expert to be a winner at low stakes because there are so many people who aren’t putting in enough work to craft good lineups. Applying the basic strategy for the sport you’re entering and applying the concept of balancing projection and ownership will get you far in the long run. As your competitors get more sophisticated, you’ve got to step up your game. In the tougher tournaments, it’s even more important to understand the tendencies of the field and adapting to them is critical to success. You can’t optimize every element of your DFS strategy because there are so many areas to work on: it’s death by a thousand cuts. What is more effective is identifying the most important areas and focusing on them one at a time. Looking at content from other players will help you identify differences between your strategy and your competitors. Then you have to do a little research and figure out whether your initial assumptions were right or if there is something they picked up that you missed. Once you iterate your strategy a lot of times by doing this, you’ll be prepared for anything. We all enter DFS tournaments for our love of sports and competition, but with life-changing prizes available every day, spending time on your game can pay off. Fantasy tournaments are survival of the fittest in action. You have to continuously evolve to compete in this ever-changing climate. Know the sport you’re playing but also familiarize yourself with general DFS strategy concepts. The intuition you get following a sport isn’t essential, but is immensely useful to identify errors in your reasoning. But DFS tournaments are also similarly structured across all sports, so many elements of the strategy like projecting performance and ownership remain the same. Daily fantasy is a demanding game because you have to keep up with both the sport and DFS strategy, but that’s exactly what makes it so fun. When you put in the work, fantasy can be a tremendously rewarding experience. Why Stokastic’s NBA DFS Single Lineup Simulator Is Better Than Traditional Hand-Building Best Bet365 Bonus Code Today Author Alex Baker Alex is better known to fantasy players by his handle \"Awesemo\" from seeing him in every big tournament in the industry. Playing poker professionally from 2009-2015, he heard that daily fantasy was the next big game picking up steam, and he quickly saw the potential of the relatively new game. Growing his bankroll from 2015-2016, he made a big step in 2017 by claiming the #1 overall ranking on RotoGrinders for the year. After completing his primary objective, he was looking for what's next. Attending dozens of fantasy events, Alex realized that everyone was repeating the same story: wanting to be a great DFS player while holding down a full-time job. He realized that the resources available to fantasy players while great weren't enough to help hobbyists get to the level of competing with the top pros. Having met Tom Kennedy during the FanDuel Scottish Open, the two decided to take on the realm of fantasy content along with co-founder Eddie Lai. Alex creates his own projections for each sport he plays, publishing rankings derived directly from them updated for each major slate. He also writes strategy content for how to become a better DFS player in his Game Plan series. You can contact Alex by emailing support@awesemo.com.

Stokastic Odds: Reverse Line Movement Login DFS News & ArticlesLearn DFS How to Win in DFS: Expert Strategy Tips & Advice Updated January 23, 2025 1:15 pm by Alex Baker The most popular tournaments on fantasy sites such as DraftKings and FanDuel allow you to throw down $5 to $10 with the prospect of winning $100,000. We all enter with the goal of outsmarting the competition and coming away with a life-changing sum of money. All DFS ads emphasize the amount you can win and the thrill of coming up with those plays that no one has that go off. In my experience, success in these tournaments is a feasible goal for anyone willing to put in the work exactly because the tournaments are filled with players who are unwilling or unable to put in the work. By playing the biggest low-stakes tournaments daily, you can make a nice income over the course of a year if you apply the right DFS strategy. Let’s break down how to win in DFS as I dive into my expert strategy tips and advice. Starting off in DFS is challenging for most players now because using your knowledge from watching a sport alone won’t get you very far. You have to learn the strategy of salary cap games, which include identifying the top plays and understanding who the popular plays. If your lineups are the same as everyone else’s, you won’t get very far! Most people who start playing DFS have full-time jobs and lack the necessary time to accomplish these goals on their own. Fortunately, it becomes a lot easier if you have the right tools and resources, like our DFS Sim tools. How to Win in DFS: Expert Strategy Tips & Advice Stokastic’s industry-leading NBA DFS tools have fueled remarkable achievements, including a memorable week where one user secured wins in two NBA DFS tournaments! If you’re ready to take your DFS game to the next level, a Stokastic+ NBA subscription is the competitive edge you need to stay ahead. How to Win in DFS: Expert Strategy Tips & Advice Since only about 85% of entry fees are paid out as prizes in each contest, not everyone can win on DraftKings and FanDuel. In fact, based on my historical research, only about 25% of lineups entered have a positive expected value. The catch is that once you go beyond the easiest tournaments, a lot more than a quarter of lineups are made by relatively sharp players. It’s easier to break lineups into two categories to determine their chances of success: their chance of achieving a high enough score to cash and their chance of a top finish. The first one can be measured in terms of overall projection and correlation, but the score to cash and win will fluctuate with how the most popular picks end up performing. As a result, a lineup that is more differentiated versus the field might have a better chance of winning if their score is moderately high on nights that the popular plays disappoint. It’s rare that my highest-scoring lineups are my biggest winners in DFS because lineup scores are so correlated across the field; I have had more success on days where the winning score is low. Managing the trade-off between projection and differentiation is the single most critical factor to success in GPPs — and it’s often overlooked by novice players. Making Projections For several years, accurate projections were all you needed to succeed at GPPs, as the field wasn’t great at identifying the best players each night. While just plugging in highly projected lineups won’t get you far in tournaments today, it’s still a great starting point for determining how strong of a lineup you have. If you have the highest-projected lineup, your lineup will be a favorite in one-on-one matchups versus every lineup in the tournament. That bodes well for your chances of cashing in a tournament, but it isn’t a great metric for determining your chances of coming in first. If you don’t have your own projections, you can still make great tournament lineups using the resources we have here. With my DFS projections, you can narrow the player pool to only include players that are average or better plays on a given day. Spending most of your salary while preferentially choosing players with high-value rankings will ensure that your lineup has a good median projection. Correlation: Selecting the best-scoring players across numerous games is extraordinarily difficult from an odds standpoint — unless you factor in correlations between players. Usually, players are good to pair together in a GPP if one is more likely to score points when the other performs above expectations. On the other hand, you want to avoid situations where one player’s excellent performance comes at the expense of another one on your same roster: these lineups are more likely to produce a consistent score for your team than the outlier you need. The levels of correlation vary greatly with each sport and greatly affect DFS strategy for those games. “Upside”: DFS players often seek out players with higher upside. Most athletes worth considering because of their price and projection have enough upside to win you a GPP. What you usually need from a player to win is a performance that is at least one standard deviation above their projection, which happens about 1/6 of the time. But if you target players with more variance (i.e. a higher standard deviation), they may give you the tournament-winning upside you need 1/5 or even 1/4 of the time. These could be athletes who get more run if they’re the hot hand in NBA and NFL — or ones who have great power but a low batting average in MLB. Players with high variance are more valuable in GPPs than their median projection may indicate. Accuracy: Projections won’t get you far unless they are at least as accurate as your competition’s. Checking your projections for errors is essential to avoid costly mistakes. What I like doing is to compare my projections against other sources to challenge my assumptions. To narrow down the scope of my error checking I will only look at players I have projected significantly differently than the sources. If I can figure out why my projection is erroneous, I will adjust the factors that led to my projection. My favorite sources to check are sportsbooks — while they have their own biases, they have to be fairly accurate because they are throwing their own money down on them. You can also use my rankings to identify athletes whose projections are worth a closer look. Being Contrarian Each lineup in a tournament wins under certain circumstances. You’ll have the most success if your lineup is the winning lineup under the broadest set of outcomes. The way you can achieve this goal is by having a lineup that overlaps less with other lineups but is still relatively likely to be a high scorer that night. In a perfect strategy, you would overlap less in winner-take-all contests than contests where 20% of the field cashes because picking the most popular players helps you get a cashing score but not that much to winning one. Ownership: The simplest way to make your lineup different than others is to choose lower-owned players. It goes without saying that the fewer players with someone rostered, the more it helps each lineup to win a tournament. Usually, the best strategy is to make a roster with a combination of best values and sleeper picks. That gives you a good chance to cash while still having reasonably likely conditions to win the tournament. To predict player ownership, you must first understand that most lineups are strongly influenced by outside factors, whether it be recommendations by fantasy influencers, box scores in the DFS site’s app, or what games are televised. Then you compare the options at each position to determine the relative popularity of each. Finally, you build lineups because all of these factors have to fit in the constraints of the salary cap. If you don’t have hours a day to devote to studying the slate, the best place to stop is my ownership projections which use a proprietary algorithm that I have developed over years of playing. Roster Construction: Another way to achieve a lineup that is highly differentiated from others is to pair players together who may not usually be present in the same lineup. For example, two tight ends may both be popular in isolation, but if you create a roster with a tight end in the flex, that combination of players may be present in much fewer lineups than you would expect given the high ownership of each. You can also spend different amounts of salary than the cap to achieve this goal, which is especially popular in large field tournaments with small slates. One of my biggest wins was in a 104,575-person showdown NFL tournament on DraftKings in which I only spent $47,600 of the $50,000 salary cap; only one other person had the same lineup, which split the prize many fewer ways than normal. The catch is that each of my players had to outscore each player within $2,400 of salary. In sports where the perfect lineup frequently spends less than the salary cap, this is a more viable strategy: Diversification: If you’re entering more than one lineup, you should have your lineups work together to maximize your chance of winning on a given night. On one extreme, you could have two lineups with only one different player in them: that means that on a night where one lineup finishes first, the other is likely to finish second, which hurts the expected value of each lineup. The other extreme is picking a lineup that relies on the opposite result of the first, most likely the other team winning the game. The problem with that strategy is the second lineup isn’t likely to be a good one because, assuming the first lineup was the best one you could build, the first team’s success is the more likely outcome. The best way to diversify is to pick lineups with at least three or more players different from each of your other lineups. Trade-offs: Daily fantasy is no easy game: it’s unusual to find a player who is both optimal in value and projection while being low-owned. Being a successful DFS player is all about finding the inefficiencies; in particular, identifying players who are owned higher or lower than they should be. And the context of your lineup matters a lot too. You want to evaluate your projection and ownership for your whole lineup so that you can guarantee whether you’re making trade-offs in the right spots. It’s a losing strategy to play all sub-1% owned players even if all of those players are lower owned than they should be. The ideal lineup will have some players with a high probability of success (which inevitably will come with higher ownership) sprinkled with a few players with lower probabilities of success (and lower ownership). React App My Process Have a set strategy and stick to it. You can reevaluate your approach every few weeks but don’t try to change it up every day. You want to conserve your energy for the most important decisions of the day by having a process for most decisions you make. Here’s what a typical main slate looks like for me (ET): 11 AM: Review the previous games that each team has played and adjust variables in my model accordingly (e.g. study snap counts, target share, minutes played). 4 PM: Compare projections for each player to other data sources and identify areas where my model differs and determine whether my projection is right or wrong. 5-7 PM: Watch YouTube content to stay up to date with the latest news and be exposed to differing viewpoints that challenge my own conclusions. 6 PM: Start building lineups on the Sims. Identify players that are showing up much more or less than projected ownership and determine my position. 6:30-6:50 PM: Sort through my lineups to determine which ones I want to enter into contests. 6:50-7 PM: Check lineups on site to make sure that there were no errors in my process. 10-11 PM: Review tournaments to see if assumptions were accurate. Identify issues with model. While DFS can be a full-time job, there are several areas where you can simplify the process. I started this company so that you can be successful in the games today without making it a full-time job. Using our scoring and ownership projections greatly expedites the process. You can also reduce the complexity of the day by only making a handful of lineups or limiting the number of sites you play on. Finally, automating things as much as possible will save you valuable time. Want our DFS Sims for FREE? Sign up with one of our partners and unlock the best DFS tools!

How to Win in DFS: Concluding Thoughts on Strategy DFS is in its essence a competition. Success in the long run requires an edge over your opponents. The less experienced the competition is, the easier it is to achieve that edge. So, begin with the easiest tournaments – the huge low-stakes tournaments and contests where experienced players are restricted from entering. You don’t have to be an expert to be a winner at low stakes because there are so many people who aren’t putting in enough work to craft good lineups. Applying the basic strategy for the sport you’re entering and applying the concept of balancing projection and ownership will get you far in the long run. As your competitors get more sophisticated, you’ve got to step up your game. In the tougher tournaments, it’s even more important to understand the tendencies of the field and adapting to them is critical to success. You can’t optimize every element of your DFS strategy because there are so many areas to work on: it’s death by a thousand cuts. What is more effective is identifying the most important areas and focusing on them one at a time. Looking at content from other players will help you identify differences between your strategy and your competitors. Then you have to do a little research and figure out whether your initial assumptions were right or if there is something they picked up that you missed. Once you iterate your strategy a lot of times by doing this, you’ll be prepared for anything. We all enter DFS tournaments for our love of sports and competition, but with life-changing prizes available every day, spending time on your game can pay off. Fantasy tournaments are survival of the fittest in action. You have to continuously evolve to compete in this ever-changing climate. Know the sport you’re playing but also familiarize yourself with general DFS strategy concepts. The intuition you get following a sport isn’t essential, but is immensely useful to identify errors in your reasoning. But DFS tournaments are also similarly structured across all sports, so many elements of the strategy like projecting performance and ownership remain the same. Daily fantasy is a demanding game because you have to keep up with both the sport and DFS strategy, but that’s exactly what makes it so fun. When you put in the work, fantasy can be a tremendously rewarding experience. Why Stokastic’s NBA DFS Single Lineup Simulator Is Better Than Traditional Hand-Building Best Bet365 Bonus Code Today Author Alex Baker Alex is better known to fantasy players by his handle \"Awesemo\" from seeing him in every big tournament in the industry. Playing poker professionally from 2009-2015, he heard that daily fantasy was the next big game picking up steam, and he quickly saw the potential of the relatively new game. Growing his bankroll from 2015-2016, he made a big step in 2017 by claiming the #1 overall ranking on RotoGrinders for the year. After completing his primary objective, he was looking for what's next. Attending dozens of fantasy events, Alex realized that everyone was repeating the same story: wanting to be a great DFS player while holding down a full-time job. He realized that the resources available to fantasy players while great weren't enough to help hobbyists get to the level of competing with the top pros. Having met Tom Kennedy during the FanDuel Scottish Open, the two decided to take on the realm of fantasy content along with co-founder Eddie Lai. Alex creates his own projections for each sport he plays, publishing rankings derived directly from them updated for each major slate. He also writes strategy content for how to become a better DFS player in his Game Plan series. You can contact Alex by emailing support@awesemo.com.

Table of contents Example H2 Example H3 Daily fantasy sports (DFS) are a thrilling way to engage with your favorite sports by building a fantasy team that competes against others in short-term, often daily, contests. Unlike traditional fantasy sports, where you're committed for an entire season, DFS offers immediate gratification, with contests wrapping up in a single day or week. Here, you select players from a given pool and earn points based on their real-life performances in games. The goal is to compile a team that scores higher than the competition. This format allows for frequent adjustments and strategies, making it both challenging and rewarding. Exploring DFS Contest Types Pick’em and Survivor Contests In fantasy contests, two popular formats stand out: Pick'em contests and fantasy survivor contests. Pick'em contests simplify the player selection process by eliminating salary caps; instead, you choose from a set of matchups across players. These contests focus on picking the winner between two competing players, which is less about budget management and more about pure sports insight. On the other hand, survivor contests challenge participants to choose a team or player each week that they believe will perform well. The catch is that once you've chosen a team or player, you cannot pick them again for the remainder of the season, adding a strategic layer to your choices. Entry Fees, Player Pools, and Prize Structures The structure of DFS contests can vary widely, impacting your strategy. Entry fees are required and contribute to the overall prize pool, with higher fees often leading to larger payouts. Player pools are also a critical aspect, as they determine the pool of athletes from which you can choose. Larger pools offer more diversity but require more knowledge and research. Prize structures can be top-heavy, rewarding the top performers with the majority of the winnings, or more evenly distributed, offering many participants smaller prizes. Choosing the Right Contest for Your Skill Level For beginners, it's advisable to start with contests that match their skill level. Beginners might prefer smaller, less competitive pools to get a feel for the gameplay without the pressure of competing against top-tier DFS players. As you gain more experience, you can progress to larger, more competitive contests that offer bigger prizes and require more sophisticated strategies. Selecting the Best Players for Your DFS Lineup Player Analysis A critical component of building a successful DFS lineup is thorough player analysis, focusing on recent performance and the specific matchups a player will face. This analysis includes examining statistical trends like scoring averages, defensive matchups, and even location advantages that could impact performance. A player facing a weak defense or playing in a venue known for high scoring can significantly boost your team's points. Such an analysis requires not only looking at raw numbers but also interpreting these numbers in the context of upcoming games, ensuring you're making decisions based on relevant and timely data. Identifying High-Scoring Potential by Sport Each sport has its own intricacies that can impact how points are accrued, making it essential to tailor your approach to the nuances of basketball, football, baseball, or other DFS offerings. Recognizing factors like matchup dynamics, venue impacts, and platform-specific scoring rules ensures you stay ahead in the game. Below are key strategies: Analyze The Scoring Format: Some platforms might reward additional points for three-pointers in basketball or give bonuses for rushing yards in football. Thoroughly understanding the scoring system helps you pinpoint players who excel in categories with the highest point potential. Being aware of penalties, such as deductions for turnovers, is crucial. Focus On Matchup Advantages: One of the most effective ways to identify high-scoring potential is by analyzing matchups. Players facing weaker opponents, such as teams with poor defensive records, are more likely to produce standout performances. In football, for instance, a wide receiver matched against a struggling secondary could be a goldmine for points. Similarly, in basketball, targeting a player going up against a team with weak defensive rebounding can yield significant benefits. Evaluating these matchup advantages helps you select players who are positioned to exploit vulnerabilities, ensuring consistent scoring opportunities. Consider The Venue: The venue where a game is played can significantly impact scoring, particularly in sports like baseball and football. Some baseball stadiums, known as \"hitter-friendly parks,\" tend to produce higher run totals, favoring batters. Similarly, in football, home-field advantage can often lead to improved offensive performances for the home team. Environmental factors, such as weather conditions in outdoor venues, can also play a role. By tailoring your selections to the specific dynamics of scoring systems, matchups, and venues, you can consistently identify players with high-scoring potential. This attention to detail not only boosts your chances of winning but also helps you refine your approach with every contest. Factoring in Player Usage and Game Scenarios Usage rate refers to how involved a player is in their team's offensive plays, which can provide insights into their likelihood of scoring points. Additionally, the game's context—such as whether a team is fighting for a playoff spot or if they'll likely be leading or trailing—can influence how a player is used. Players in teams chasing a game often have more opportunities to score, whereas those in leading teams might be pulled out early to rest, affecting their overall scoring potential. Balancing Stars and Value Picks Star players often have high costs attached but provide reliability and high-scoring potential, making them worth the investment. However, balancing these fantasy sports picks with undervalued players who have the potential for breakout performances is essential to maximizing the overall points. This strategy involves deep research and sometimes taking calculated risks on lower-cost players who might be set for a significant game due to favorable conditions or increased responsibilities within their team. Mastering DFS Scoring Systems How Scoring Differs Across Sports and Platforms This variance requires players to adapt their strategies accordingly. A platform might award points for receptions in football, while another may not, influencing the value of wide receivers compared to running backs. Similarly, in basketball, points for defensive stats like blocks and steals may differ, which can shift the focus toward more defensively active players. Understanding these distinctions is crucial as it affects every decision from player selection to captain picks in your daily fantasy sports lineups. The Value of High-Volume Players In both basketball and football, players who are involved in a high volume of play are more likely to accumulate points. In basketball, this often means prioritizing players who have high usage rates, which indicates they take many shots and make numerous assists. In football, running backs who carry the ball frequently or wide receivers with a lot of targets are typically the most valuable. The key here is to focus on securing players who are central to their team's offensive game plans, as this increases the likelihood of scoring high points in DFS contests. Understanding Bonus Points and Special Scoring Rules Many DFS platforms incorporate bonus points and special scoring rules that can significantly influence lineup decisions. A quarterback might receive extra points for achieving over 300 passing yards, or a hockey player might gain additional points for a hat trick. Being aware of these potential bonuses can provide a competitive edge. It allows players to target those who not only have a high baseline performance but also a high ceiling due to these additional scoring opportunities. Optimizing Lineups Based on Scoring Nuances To truly excel in DFS, understanding the subtle scoring nuances of each platform and sport is essential. This means not only picking the best players for DFS lineup based on their skills and matchups but also considering how different scoring elements, such as point-per-reception (PPR) in football or power-play points in hockey, can affect overall scores. By optimizing your lineup to exploit these specific scoring rules, you can maximize your points and enhance your chances of crafting a winning daily fantasy lineup. Strategies for Creating a Winning DFS Lineup Stacking This method leverages the natural interactions between teammates to maximize scoring potential, especially in sports where team collaboration is a critical aspect of gameplay. The strategy works best when thoughtfully executed, as it requires understanding team dynamics, opponent matchups, and game conditions. Here are four essential tips: Identify Offensive Juggernauts: In basketball, this could mean choosing players from a team that excels in fast-paced, high-scoring matchups. For football, it often means focusing on teams with elite offensive units that frequently put up significant points. These teams create more opportunities for teammates to assist each other in scoring, whether it’s through shared touchdowns in football or assists in basketball. Researching recent performances and offensive trends can help identify which teams are primed for success, giving your stack a solid foundation for accumulating fantasy points. Perform Matchup Analysis: Examining the defensive weaknesses of opposing teams is a crucial aspect of stacking. For example, in football, stacking players from a high-powered offense against a defense that struggles to stop the run or pass can result in explosive fantasy performances. In baseball, targeting batters from a lineup facing a struggling pitcher can provide an edge. Correlate Positions Effectively: Position correlation is a vital component of stacking. In football, quarterback-wide receiver or quarterback-tight end pairs are popular choices because of the direct link between a quarterback’s success and the fantasy points scored by their targets. In baseball, stacking consecutive batters in the lineup enhances the potential for runs and RBIs, as teammates hitting back-to-back often create scoring opportunities. Leverage Game Scripts: Game scripts play a significant role in stacking effectiveness. For example, in a game projected to be high-scoring, stacking players from both teams can be advantageous, as it increases exposure to a wealth of fantasy points. Conversely, in games where one team is expected to dominate, stacking players from the favored team ensures you capture the bulk of the scoring. Monitoring game odds, over/under projections, and team trends helps you predict game flow and tailor your stacking strategy accordingly, ensuring it aligns with the expected outcomes. Stacking strategically can take advantage of team synergies to create high-potential DFS lineups. This approach allows you to maximize points while reducing the unpredictability of individual performances. With careful research and execution, stacking can elevate your DFS strategy and give you a competitive edge. Value Hunting It involves identifying players who are priced lower than their expected output for a contest, making them excellent additions to a lineup constrained by salary caps. These players often provide the budget flexibility to afford higher-priced, high-scoring athletes, balancing your lineup. To effectively find these undervalued assets, you must dive deep into player statistics, recent form, and even external factors such as weather conditions or team dynamics that might impact performance. Successful value hunters continuously research and adapt, seizing on information gaps that less diligent competitors might overlook. Monitoring Injury Reports Staying updated on injury reports and last-minute lineup changes is crucial in DFS. Player values can shift dramatically based on their health status or unexpected role changes within their team. A backup becoming a starter due to an injury can offer a low-cost, high-opportunity pick that others might miss if they aren’t vigilant. Vigilance can be the difference between a middling and a top-performing lineup, especially in sports where player availability can change up until game time. Diversification to Spread Risk In multi-entry contests, diversifying your lineups is a strategic approach to spread risk and increase the chances of hitting on a winning combination. This involves creating multiple lineups that vary in player selection and contest strategies, reducing the impact of any single event or game outcome on your overall performance. Effective diversification considers different potential game flows and scenarios, ensuring that while some lineups might underperform, others have the potential to score highly. Advanced DFS Tips and Long-Term Strategies Budgeting and Bankroll Management Effective budgeting and bankroll management are crucial for sustained success in daily fantasy sports. Wise financial strategies prevent you from depleting your funds on a few high-stakes games and allow for prolonged engagement across many contests. Set limits on what percentage of your bankroll you're willing to risk in any given contest and stick to these boundaries to maintain a healthy financial status. A disciplined approach helps mitigate losses during an inevitable downswing and capitalizes on winning streaks by strategically increasing stakes in alignment with your confidence and past performance. Using Analytics and Projections In today’s data-driven sports environment, leveraging advanced analytics and projections is a must for making informed decisions about your lineup. These tools offer insights into player performance trends, potential scoring opportunities, and statistical likelihoods of game outcomes. By integrating this data-driven approach into your daily sports contest strategy, you refine your ability to select players who are most likely to perform well based on objective measures rather than gut feelings or biases. Crafting a winning lineup in daily sports contests is both an art and a science, requiring a blend of strategic thinking, statistical analysis, and ongoing adaptation to the ever-changing sports landscape. The key to sustained success lies in consistently applying the fundamentals of player selection, contest choice, and money management while also staying flexible to incorporate new data and trends into your decision-making process.

Understanding these distinctions is crucial as it affects every decision from player selection to captain picks in your daily fantasy sports lineups. The Value of High-Volume Players In both basketball and football, players who are involved in a high volume of play are more likely to accumulate points. In basketball, this often means prioritizing players who have high usage rates, which indicates they take many shots and make numerous assists. In football, running backs who carry the ball frequently or wide receivers with a lot of targets are typically the most valuable. The key here is to focus on securing players who are central to their team's offensive game plans, as this increases the likelihood of scoring high points in DFS contests. Understanding Bonus Points and Special Scoring Rules Many DFS platforms incorporate bonus points and special scoring rules that can significantly influence lineup decisions. A quarterback might receive extra points for achieving over 300 passing yards, or a hockey player might gain additional points for a hat trick. Being aware of these potential bonuses can provide a competitive edge. It allows players to target those who not only have a high baseline performance but also a high ceiling due to these additional scoring opportunities. Optimizing Lineups Based on Scoring Nuances To truly excel in DFS, understanding the subtle scoring nuances of each platform and sport is essential. This means not only picking the best players for DFS lineup based on their skills and matchups but also considering how different scoring elements, such as point-per-reception (PPR) in football or power-play points in hockey, can affect overall scores. By optimizing your lineup to exploit these specific scoring rules, you can maximize your points and enhance your chances of crafting a winning daily fantasy lineup. Strategies for Creating a Winning DFS Lineup Stacking This method leverages the natural interactions between teammates to maximize scoring potential, especially in sports where team collaboration is a critical aspect of gameplay. The strategy works best when thoughtfully executed, as it requires understanding team dynamics, opponent matchups, and game conditions. Here are four essential tips: Identify Offensive Juggernauts: In basketball, this could mean choosing players from a team that excels in fast-paced, high-scoring matchups. For football, it often means focusing on teams with elite offensive units that frequently put up significant points. These teams create more opportunities for teammates to assist each other in scoring, whether it’s through shared touchdowns in football or assists in basketball. Researching recent performances and offensive trends can help identify which teams are primed for success, giving your stack a solid foundation for accumulating fantasy points. Perform Matchup Analysis: Examining the defensive weaknesses of opposing teams is a crucial aspect of stacking. For example, in football, stacking players from a high-powered offense against a defense that struggles to stop the run or pass can result in explosive fantasy performances. In baseball, targeting batters from a lineup facing a struggling pitcher can provide an edge. Correlate Positions Effectively: Position correlation is a vital component of stacking. In football, quarterback-wide receiver or quarterback-tight end pairs are popular choices because of the direct link between a quarterback’s success and the fantasy points scored by their targets. In baseball, stacking consecutive batters in the lineup enhances the potential for runs and RBIs, as teammates hitting back-to-back often create scoring opportunities. Leverage Game Scripts: Game scripts play a significant role in stacking effectiveness. For example, in a game projected to be high-scoring, stacking players from both teams can be advantageous, as it increases exposure to a wealth of fantasy points. Conversely, in games where one team is expected to dominate, stacking players from the favored team ensures you capture the bulk of the scoring. Monitoring game odds, over/under projections, and team trends helps you predict game flow and tailor your stacking strategy accordingly, ensuring it aligns with the expected outcomes. Stacking strategically can take advantage of team synergies to create high-potential DFS lineups. This approach allows you to maximize points while reducing the unpredictability of individual performances. With careful research and execution, stacking can elevate your DFS strategy and give you a competitive edge. Value Hunting It involves identifying players who are priced lower than their expected output for a contest, making them excellent additions to a lineup constrained by salary caps. These players often provide the budget flexibility to afford higher-priced, high-scoring athletes, balancing your lineup. To effectively find these undervalued assets, you must dive deep into player statistics, recent form, and even external factors such as weather conditions or team dynamics that might impact performance. Successful value hunters continuously research and adapt, seizing on information gaps that less diligent competitors might overlook. Monitoring Injury Reports Staying updated on injury reports and last-minute lineup changes is crucial in DFS. Player values can shift dramatically based on their health status or unexpected role changes within their team. A backup becoming a starter due to an injury can offer a low-cost, high-opportunity pick that others might miss if they aren’t vigilant. Vigilance can be the difference between a middling and a top-performing lineup, especially in sports where player availability can change up until game time. Diversification to Spread Risk In multi-entry contests, diversifying your lineups is a strategic approach to spread risk and increase the chances of hitting on a winning combination. This involves creating multiple lineups that vary in player selection and contest strategies, reducing the impact of any single event or game outcome on your overall performance. Effective diversification considers different potential game flows and scenarios, ensuring that while some lineups might underperform, others have the potential to score highly. Advanced DFS Tips and Long-Term Strategies Budgeting and Bankroll Management Effective budgeting and bankroll management are crucial for sustained success in daily fantasy sports. Wise financial strategies prevent you from depleting your funds on a few high-stakes games and allow for prolonged engagement across many contests. Set limits on what percentage of your bankroll you're willing to risk in any given contest and stick to these boundaries to maintain a healthy financial status. A disciplined approach helps mitigate losses during an inevitable downswing and capitalizes on winning streaks by strategically increasing stakes in alignment with your confidence and past performance. Using Analytics and Projections In today’s data-driven sports environment, leveraging advanced analytics and projections is a must for making informed decisions about your lineup. These tools offer insights into player performance trends, potential scoring opportunities, and statistical likelihoods of game outcomes. By integrating this data-driven approach into your daily sports contest strategy, you refine your ability to select players who are most likely to perform well based on objective measures rather than gut feelings or biases. Crafting a winning lineup in daily sports contests is both an art and a science, requiring a blend of strategic thinking, statistical analysis, and ongoing adaptation to the ever-changing sports landscape. The key to sustained success lies in consistently applying the fundamentals of player selection, contest choice, and money management while also staying flexible to incorporate new data and trends into your decision-making process.

Top Tips For Fantasy Sports to Help You Win Great Rewards Here are some of the best fantasy sports strategies or tactics that you can use to win amazing cash prizes at the end of the tournament. ● Check the Statistics of Each Player Rather than fully relying on the luck factor, researching a little bit can help you win.

Getting player stats involves everything: the number of tournaments the player has played, his performance in the last tournament, injuries he got, and more. ● Get Well Versed With the Playing Conditions Next, you need to learn about the specific match conditions. For instance, if you’re playing fantasy cricket, in overcast conditions, the fast bowlers bowling during the initial innings will be beneficial.

Also, the first few matches of the tournament help you tell about the player’s performance. Thus, investing in a few matches after analyzing everything properly is a great idea. ● Create Multiple Teams If you plan to participate in a fantasy sports tournament or match, do not invest all your money in one team. Instead, it is best practice to create teams with various combinations. Your aim should be to create a team that performs well. Thus, creating multiple teams gives you better chances to get the right combination. ● Don’t Invest Everything In A Single Match Investing all the funds you have set aside for playing fantasy games in one match isn’t a great idea. Thus, ensure that you limit the investment to a great extent. You can consider joining head-to-head contests and creating a balanced team if you have a good budget. If you have a small budget, consider investing in contests with smaller joining amounts. It’s A Wrap Playing fantasy sports requires a combination of planning, research, and analysis.

Home of AMAugust where the biggest names in the industry answer your questions. Members Online • [deleted] [OC] 3-step advanced guide to winning fantasy football, Part 1: Complete guide to fantasy drafting, tier-based drafting and how to evaluate player value Fantasy can be divided into 3 categories: -Drafting a team: Player value, tier-based drafting, optimizing pre-season roster space -In-season moves (trades/waivers): How to trade successfully with your league mates, how to identify breakout candidates on early-season waivers, bench structure -Setting your lineup: Streaming D/ST and Kicker, how to play your matchup, using ceiling/floor projections for a balanced lineup That's it. This post covers #1: how to use the draft, as well as how to evaluate players overall. At some point, every single fantasy player will go through the following arc of understanding fantasy drafts: True novice stage. Draft 3 kickers/defenses, reach for favorite players in the first round, etc. Probably finish near dead last. After this novice stage, realize you need to approach fantasy football from a different perspective. Start listening to fantasy football experts exactly, following the ECR of a site like FantasyPros or using numerous different experts. After this stage, realize that certain experts are dumb as fuck and have no idea what they're talking about. Choose a few experts you believe in and follow their rankings exactly. 4. Realize the inherent flaws of fantasy football rankings and move to tier-based drafting. Use the experts that you believe in to form \"tiers\" and then pick/fade players within those tiers for your draft in order to optimize both value and your opinion. 5) (optional/experimental) Actual fantasy analysts, where you make your own rankings entirely. This takes a lot of time investment and honestly might not be worth it for most people, considering you'll come to some of the same conclusions as your favorite experts with double the time spent. Your goal in fantasy football should be optimizing time spent to championships won. The goal in this post is to get you to that 4th step if you're not there yet in order to dominate your leagues, and to explain why this 4th step is the most efficient and fun way to play fantasy. Let's get into it. First of all: If you're just following expert advice, what's the point? It's not fun and it removes the skill aspect of fantasy. It can also be an inherent competitive disadvantage. Here are all the flaws in following expert-only advice: You miss out on sleepers, busts, and breakout candidates - FantasyPros and similar accuracy evaluation competitions give analysts points for whoever gets closer to predicting the QB5 on the year to be the QB5, the RB23 to be the RB23, etc. Because of this, these competitions inherently preventing experts/analysts from taking large risks in their rankings, as analysts who do so are punished severely in the accuracy competition. This makes it harder to identify sleepers/busts, as once a general consensus forms, the optimal way to \"win\" these competitions is to put your sleepers/busts a few spots above or below consensus. Want proof? Look at James Robinson from last year. Many experts did believe in him, but didn't move him up to his eventual RB1 status until he already proved 10x over that he was that dude. You miss out on players that can move up based on people wanting to win that competition. When you reach this stage of your fantasy knowledge, your opinion in many cases may be more valid than many experts - These experts did not go to college for fantasy football and there really isn't any credibility to what they say beyond the fact that they have a website and you don't. What they do have, however, is fantasy football as a career. This means they probably have more time than you and probably have more access to advanced analytics and stats that you don't. This is USEFUL for finding a player's general VALUE, but on a surface level, they are not more informed about all aspects of football than you. Your picks for certain players every year will be better than the most accurate experts because you know things about certain players that they don't. All of that is well and good, but why not just draft completely based on your own, and go back to what you probably did in your first fantasy season ever? Here's why you shouldn't just make your own rankings, unless you genuinely have the time to pore through projections, and targets, and analytics. Here's what experts DO provide: The best possible experts will be able to gage a player's general value much better than you can - Their projection software and access to advanced analytics will always be greater than yours unless you go into fantasy football as a career and choose to pay for these services as well. This has VALUE, because... They can create value tiers of players that are more accurate than any you'll put together - With these tools, they can create TIERS of players that are similar in value at certain points in the draft. These tiers are actually incredibly value, as they provide players that you can get at certain spots in the draft, allowing you to get good players at their value (for example, Patrick Mahomes is the QB1 in fantasy and has been for a while, but he would still be a reach at 1.01 in a draft, due to the way positional value works) while not following their rankings exactly. So how do you go about using tier-based drafting strategies? Here's how. You are going to use your favorite fantasy experts. I really like FantasyPros layout, despite the flaws with their accuracy rankings and ECR. Let's say your favorite experts are Joe Bond and Sean Koerner. Pick them in the \"Pick Experts\" section of the cheatsheets (https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/consensus-cheatsheets.php) and sort. You'll see that players are auto-sorted into tiers. Print these out, both for overall and for each position, and: Cross out the players that you do not want/are not high on. The value is already AUTOMATICALLY calculated for you and curated by your favorite experts, so you don't have to worry about passing on a high value player because you don't like them. Cross out any player you do not want or do not like. Look for players in certain tiers that you believe could make the jump to the next tier up. Experts are wrong, even on these tiers (they are significantly LESS wrong about value in these tiers but they are still wrong). Circle these players if you believe they can make that jump to the next tier up. On draft day, draft in this order: Players you want in a tier, players you don't want in a tier, players you think could make it to the next tier. Repeat for each tier until the draft is over. After a certain round (normally when your starting lineup and most of your bench is filled), start drafting players that you believe in, as breakouts down at this area tend to be entirely impossible to predict and your guess is as good as any experts. I'd do this around the 12th or 14th round. Other general draft tips: -Do not draft a defense or a kicker. Each year, these positions are entirely too volatile, and the 2 bench spots up until the first game of the season are more valuable for potential injuries than holding a defense or a kicker through the preseason could be. Some leagues drafted last week and some were able to roster Gus Edwards because I didn't have a Kicker or a Defense rostered. Huge payoff on that. Eventually, before the night of the first NFL game, cut 2 players that have proven the least in the preseason and pick up a defense and a kicker. (I really love u/subvertadown's rankings, they're ahead of the rest of the industry in almost all aspects and his Patreon is great too.) I will get into more setting your lineup stuff in Pt. 2 of this post. -Try to draft at least one player marked as Out or on IR if you have an IR spot. Don't reach into a lower tier for it, but drafting one of these players essentially gives you another bench spot and the more breakout candidates you can roster, the better. Michael Thomas is the target here this year, here's a post about that from yesterday: https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/pe304j/oc_michael_thomas_adp_is_straight_up_robbery_in/ -Handcuffs are good, but you need to optimize your handcuffs. If you are going to roster a handcuff, they either need to have standalone flex value (Kareem Hunt), a chance at the starting job (Michael Carter) or need to have RB1 level production when the starter is out (Tony Pollard). These guys are insanely valuable and are potential league winners. Rostering a handcuff that does none of these things is completely pointless. Rostering a guy that does multiple of these things? Bingo. For example, Kareem Hunt both has standalone flex value and is a RB1 if Nick Chubb gets hurt. -RBs > WRs. You should probably be rostering more RBs than WRs, but an equal amount is fine. I'll cover this in the trade guide, but WRs that can produce a solid amount of points every week are super easy to find on waivers in non 32-team leagues, especially early in the season, and RBs are not. Unless a WR is a much better player than an RB (obviously you roster Davante Adams over Sony Michel), RBs/WRs that produce similar points per week are not created equal. -Know your league/be wary of runs. To get the most possible value out of your draft, you need to realize that every league is different and certain positions will fly off the board as soon as the dam bursts. As soon as Patrick Mahomes is drafted, QBs will start getting drafted by everyone. At positions with value scarcity (QB/TE have a clear top 2 tiers that are much better than every other tier and provide insane value every week), you need to either commit to getting a top tier guy or going yin-yang (I'll cover this later, but basically drafting a medium floor, low ceiling guy instead of chasing QB1 upside). After Kelce/Mahomes get drafted, be wary of how quickly QBs/TEs will fly off the board. EDIT: SUMMARY SECTION TL;DR: Do not use fantasy experts rankings exactly, use their rankings to form value-based tiers and pick the players in those tiers that you believe in the most, take shots at breakout players in later rounds (Marquez Callaway and Gus Edwards were good gets this year for leagues that drafted early) -Do not draft a defense or a kicker -Try to target at least one player to stash on IR -Be wary of \"runs\" in your draft and know your league In the next post, we will cover #2: In-Season Moves. This includes bench structure, Yin-Yang TEs/QBs (shoutout Andrew Cooper), finding a breakout, when to cut bait on a player, a complete guide to trades, and tips and tricks on how to create extra roster space mid-season.

Home of AMAugust where the biggest names in the industry answer your questions. Members Online • [deleted] [OC] 3-step advanced guide to winning fantasy football, Part 1: Complete guide to fantasy drafting, tier-based drafting and how to evaluate player value Fantasy can be divided into 3 categories: -Drafting a team: Player value, tier-based drafting, optimizing pre-season roster space -In-season moves (trades/waivers): How to trade successfully with your league mates, how to identify breakout candidates on early-season waivers, bench structure -Setting your lineup: Streaming D/ST and Kicker, how to play your matchup, using ceiling/floor projections for a balanced lineup That's it. This post covers #1: how to use the draft, as well as how to evaluate players overall. At some point, every single fantasy player will go through the following arc of understanding fantasy drafts: True novice stage. Draft 3 kickers/defenses, reach for favorite players in the first round, etc. Probably finish near dead last. After this novice stage, realize you need to approach fantasy football from a different perspective. Start listening to fantasy football experts exactly, following the ECR of a site like FantasyPros or using numerous different experts. After this stage, realize that certain experts are dumb as fuck and have no idea what they're talking about. Choose a few experts you believe in and follow their rankings exactly. 4. Realize the inherent flaws of fantasy football rankings and move to tier-based drafting. Use the experts that you believe in to form \"tiers\" and then pick/fade players within those tiers for your draft in order to optimize both value and your opinion. 5) (optional/experimental) Actual fantasy analysts, where you make your own rankings entirely. This takes a lot of time investment and honestly might not be worth it for most people, considering you'll come to some of the same conclusions as your favorite experts with double the time spent. Your goal in fantasy football should be optimizing time spent to championships won. The goal in this post is to get you to that 4th step if you're not there yet in order to dominate your leagues, and to explain why this 4th step is the most efficient and fun way to play fantasy. Let's get into it. First of all: If you're just following expert advice, what's the point? It's not fun and it removes the skill aspect of fantasy. It can also be an inherent competitive disadvantage. Here are all the flaws in following expert-only advice: You miss out on sleepers, busts, and breakout candidates - FantasyPros and similar accuracy evaluation competitions give analysts points for whoever gets closer to predicting the QB5 on the year to be the QB5, the RB23 to be the RB23, etc. Because of this, these competitions inherently preventing experts/analysts from taking large risks in their rankings, as analysts who do so are punished severely in the accuracy competition. This makes it harder to identify sleepers/busts, as once a general consensus forms, the optimal way to \"win\" these competitions is to put your sleepers/busts a few spots above or below consensus. Want proof? Look at James Robinson from last year. Many experts did believe in him, but didn't move him up to his eventual RB1 status until he already proved 10x over that he was that dude. You miss out on players that can move up based on people wanting to win that competition. When you reach this stage of your fantasy knowledge, your opinion in many cases may be more valid than many experts - These experts did not go to college for fantasy football and there really isn't any credibility to what they say beyond the fact that they have a website and you don't. What they do have, however, is fantasy football as a career. This means they probably have more time than you and probably have more access to advanced analytics and stats that you don't. This is USEFUL for finding a player's general VALUE, but on a surface level, they are not more informed about all aspects of football than you. Your picks for certain players every year will be better than the most accurate experts because you know things about certain players that they don't. All of that is well and good, but why not just draft completely based on your own, and go back to what you probably did in your first fantasy season ever? Here's why you shouldn't just make your own rankings, unless you genuinely have the time to pore through projections, and targets, and analytics. Here's what experts DO provide: The best possible experts will be able to gage a player's general value much better than you can - Their projection software and access to advanced analytics will always be greater than yours unless you go into fantasy football as a career and choose to pay for these services as well. This has VALUE, because... They can create value tiers of players that are more accurate than any you'll put together - With these tools, they can create TIERS of players that are similar in value at certain points in the draft. These tiers are actually incredibly value, as they provide players that you can get at certain spots in the draft, allowing you to get good players at their value (for example, Patrick Mahomes is the QB1 in fantasy and has been for a while, but he would still be a reach at 1.01 in a draft, due to the way positional value works) while not following their rankings exactly. So how do you go about using tier-based drafting strategies? Here's how. You are going to use your favorite fantasy experts. I really like FantasyPros layout, despite the flaws with their accuracy rankings and ECR. Let's say your favorite experts are Joe Bond and Sean Koerner. Pick them in the \"Pick Experts\" section of the cheatsheets (https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/consensus-cheatsheets.php) and sort. You'll see that players are auto-sorted into tiers. Print these out, both for overall and for each position, and: Cross out the players that you do not want/are not high on. The value is already AUTOMATICALLY calculated for you and curated by your favorite experts, so you don't have to worry about passing on a high value player because you don't like them. Cross out any player you do not want or do not like. Look for players in certain tiers that you believe could make the jump to the next tier up. Experts are wrong, even on these tiers (they are significantly LESS wrong about value in these tiers but they are still wrong). Circle these players if you believe they can make that jump to the next tier up. On draft day, draft in this order: Players you want in a tier, players you don't want in a tier, players you think could make it to the next tier. Repeat for each tier until the draft is over. After a certain round (normally when your starting lineup and most of your bench is filled), start drafting players that you believe in, as breakouts down at this area tend to be entirely impossible to predict and your guess is as good as any experts. I'd do this around the 12th or 14th round. Other general draft tips: -Do not draft a defense or a kicker. Each year, these positions are entirely too volatile, and the 2 bench spots up until the first game of the season are more valuable for potential injuries than holding a defense or a kicker through the preseason could be. Some leagues drafted last week and some were able to roster Gus Edwards because I didn't have a Kicker or a Defense rostered. Huge payoff on that. Eventually, before the night of the first NFL game, cut 2 players that have proven the least in the preseason and pick up a defense and a kicker. (I really love u/subvertadown's rankings, they're ahead of the rest of the industry in almost all aspects and his Patreon is great too.) I will get into more setting your lineup stuff in Pt. 2 of this post. -Try to draft at least one player marked as Out or on IR if you have an IR spot. Don't reach into a lower tier for it, but drafting one of these players essentially gives you another bench spot and the more breakout candidates you can roster, the better. Michael Thomas is the target here this year, here's a post about that from yesterday: https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/pe304j/oc_michael_thomas_adp_is_straight_up_robbery_in/ -Handcuffs are good, but you need to optimize your handcuffs. If you are going to roster a handcuff, they either need to have standalone flex value (Kareem Hunt), a chance at the starting job (Michael Carter) or need to have RB1 level production when the starter is out (Tony Pollard). These guys are insanely valuable and are potential league winners. Rostering a handcuff that does none of these things is completely pointless. Rostering a guy that does multiple of these things? Bingo. For example, Kareem Hunt both has standalone flex value and is a RB1 if Nick Chubb gets hurt. -RBs > WRs. You should probably be rostering more RBs than WRs, but an equal amount is fine. I'll cover this in the trade guide, but WRs that can produce a solid amount of points every week are super easy to find on waivers in non 32-team leagues, especially early in the season, and RBs are not. Unless a WR is a much better player than an RB (obviously you roster Davante Adams over Sony Michel), RBs/WRs that produce similar points per week are not created equal. -Know your league/be wary of runs. To get the most possible value out of your draft, you need to realize that every league is different and certain positions will fly off the board as soon as the dam bursts.

As the NFL grows to a nearly $13 billion business, fantasy football has soared in popularity. BI spoke with expert analysts Nick Zylak and Liz Loza about the top tips for building a team. They recommended looking at your league's scoring format and focusing on high-ceiling players early. As the NFL prepares to kick off the regular season on September 5, fans are already rejoicing with the return of one of the season's favorite pastimes: fantasy. According to the Fantasy Sports and Gaming Association, 79% of fantasy players are involved in fantasy football, and the total number of fantasy sports players across the US and Canada in 2022 totaled upward of 60 million. As fans draft their fantasy squads for the 2024 season, Business Insider spoke with Fantasy Football Advice founder Nick Zylak and ESPN fantasy sports analyst Liz Loza to learn the top tips for building a fantasy football team. Whether you're a beginner or your league's reigning champion, here's everything you need to know. Before you think about players, remember to consider your league's scoring format. Christian McCaffrey is one of the best running backs in the league. Ryan Kang/Contributor/Getty Images \"A lot of people don't pay full attention to the scoring format, and if their league is different from normal,\" Zylak said. A common league scoring format is PPR, which stands for \"point per reception.\" In this type of league, each player in your starting lineup receives 1 point for every catch they make, as well as points for other factors like yardage (0.1 points per yard) and touchdowns. For example, if Christian McCaffrey were to catch 5 passes for 42 yards and rush for 80 yards, his total fantasy points in a PPR league would be equivalent to 5 (PPR points) + 4.2 + 8, so 17.2 points. Other league scoring formats include half-PPR (which awards 0.5 points per reception) and Standard/non-PPR (which doesn't award any points for receptions). Each league has specific rules and point allotments for things like scoring, fumbles, interceptions, etc. so make sure to research your league's rules to understand what players will best maximize your point potential. Then make a draft strategy. Wide receivers and running backs are valuable in PPR leagues. Carmen Mandato/Staff/Getty Images Zylak told BI that the best teams this year are taking running backs early and wide receivers in the middle rounds of the draft. \"And then, ideally, you probably want a top seven tight end, because there's a really good group of tight ends,\" he added. \"It doesn't really matter which one you get, just getting one of them, and then probably a top 11 quarterback.\" While you don't have to stick to a formula, it's helpful to at least have a plan. That way, you're not overwhelmed with choices when you're on the clock. When determining your draft strategy, Loza also recommended considering who you're drafting with. \"Is there a person who's a giant Buffalo Bills fan? If so, then you should probably anticipate that Josh Allen is going to get drafted earlier than the ADP, which stands for average draft position, right? Or [drafted] ahead of the rankings, the ESPN consensus rankings that one may be using as a guide,\" Loza said. This way, you can set more realistic expectations and strategies for both positions and players before your draft. While drafting, don't be afraid to hit the upside early. Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson has a high talent ceiling. Andy Lyons/Staff/Getty Images The NFL has an incredible amount of depth, particularly on offense, so Loza recommends using that to your advantage by going for players with high ceilings during the first half of your draft. One high-ceiling player she said to look out for is Anthony Richardson. The 22-year-old quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts didn't play much during his rookie season due to injuries. \"However, his upside, the potential that he could produce, is wild,\" Loza said. \"So, I often get like, 'Why would you want to take Anthony Richardson?' And my answer is like, well, there is a 100% injury rate in the NFL, but not 100% of the players in the NFL present with Richardson's ceiling.\" She continued, \"He averaged 18 fantasy points per game and 49% of those points came via his legs. And in fantasy, rushing, mobile quarterbacks are great because of the numbers they put up.\" So, you can afford to take a risk on a high-ceiling player in the beginning, knowing that the league's incredible depth will provide you with more tried-and-true, dependable players in the later rounds. Remember volume is king. Derrick Henry led the league in carries last season for the Tennessee Titans. This year, he'll be playing for the Baltimore Ravens. Wesley Hitt/Contributor/Getty Images \"The more times a player touches the ball, the more opportunities that player has to put up points. So volume is always king,\" Loza said. This is particularly relevant for running backs — those with higher fantasy value are the players who consistently get an opportunity to run the ball, which is why you'll see them go in the first round of the draft. However, she cautioned that the worry is if one of those players gets hurt, finding a replacement of equal value becomes much harder. Don't stack pass catchers from the same team. Stefon Diggs joins Nico Collins, Tank Dell, and Joe Mixon in Houston this season. Perry Knotts/Contributor/Getty Images Traditionally, \"stacking\" refers to taking a quarterback and a pass catcher from the same team, like a Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce duo, so you can maximize your points. What you want to avoid, though, is stacking two pass catchers from the same team, analysts told BI. \"I don't like to take two pass catchers from the same team because I think again, the volume is dipped,\" Loza said, offering the Houston Texans as an example. With Nico Collins, Stefon Diggs, Tank Dell, and Joe Mixon all competing for touches, Loza said it's an offense \"you want a piece of,\" but if you were to take Tank Dell and Nico Collins, you could miss out \"on a receiver who might not be part of as efficient an offense, but would see more targets.\" \"The targets don't always have to be pretty to be productive,\" she added. Defenses don't win championships in fantasy — and neither do kickers. Unlike in the league, Loza said defenses don't win championships in fantasy. Ryan Kang/Contributor/Getty Images Both Zylak and Loza said you shouldn't pick a defense and a kicker until the last two rounds of the draft. Otherwise, you're just wasting valuable picks. Speaking of value, focus on what's in front of you and remember not to panic. If you notice people are all starting to draft one position, don't panic and rush to do the same. Candice Ward/Contributor/Getty Images Starting a positional run is always better than ending one, according to Loza. \"So if quarterbacks start coming off the board, do not panic and say like, 'Oh my god, if I don't take a quarterback now, the one I want is gonna be gone,'\" she said. \"He may be, but also, you want to zig when everyone else is zagging because you want to take full advantage of the value in front of you at every time.\" Context is key, so don't focus too much on what happened in previous seasons. Aaron Rodgers is set to return from a season-ending Achilles injury. Perry Knotts/Contributor/Getty Images Take a look at Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Drake London. At first glance, the 23-year-old may not seem like an obvious choice. He averaged 6.1 fantasy points per game last season, and just 5.8 the season prior, according to CBS Sports. However, one could argue that London was undervalued in former head coach Arthur Smith's run-heavy system. But now that the Falcons are being led by Raheem Morris and veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins, London's chances of becoming a breakout star have significantly increased. He's the 14th-ranked wide receiver in ESPN's current fantasy rankings compared to the 30th-ranked choice a year ago. Not all changes are as big as a coaching change, though. \"There are little wrinkles, and you're like, 'Hmm, how much is this fourth-round rookie really going to affect this offense?'\" Loza said, adding, \"You kind of have to gauge it.\" You don't have to be super focused on statistics if you don't want to be. Instead, you can use existing rankings to help judge the strength of your choices. CeeDee Lamb of the Dallas Cowboys is ESPN's highest-rated wide receiver for fantasy this season. Michael Owens/Contributor/Getty Images \"Don't let the weeds of the stats bring you down,\" Loza said. \"You're allowed to just root for the players that you're excited about.\" So if there's a player that's amazing strategically, but isn't someone you feel like rooting for every week, just don't draft them — that's the benefit of the league having such depth. And with all those options, Loza encourages everyone to use the rankings available. \"Me and my colleagues do not spend all of this time to make rankings so that you can't use 'em,\" she said. So, if someone has caught your eye, check the rankings to ensure you draft them at an appropriate time. \"If you are someone who's like, 'Oh, I know Player X is a really good player and they're fun and I'm into them,' then look where they are on the rankings, like maybe they're wide receiver 30, and then see who else in that range is going and circle them,\" Loza said. \"Just be like, 'OK, when we get to this general part of the draft, I'm going to get that guy.'\" This way, you won't pass up on valuable talent in an effort to pick them. Don't give up if your season starts off slow — and remember to have fun. Zylak advises players not to feel defeated if their team doesn't perform well initially. Courtney Culbreath/Stringer/Getty Images Building a fantasy team extends beyond the initial draft, so Zylak advises players not to feel discouraged if they don't start the season with a winning record. \"Like, really, all you have to do is make the playoffs. It doesn't really matter what your seeding is,\" he said. \"And in most leagues, either half or like 40% of people make playoffs, so as long as you can squeak in — even if you start one and four — like look for trades, look for the waiver wire, because you just got to squeak into the playoffs, then anything can happen.\" And as cheesy as it may sound, remember to have fun. \"This is a secondary experience that only enriches the primary experience of watching football on Sundays,\" Loza said.

Andy Lyons/Staff/Getty Images The NFL has an incredible amount of depth, particularly on offense, so Loza recommends using that to your advantage by going for players with high ceilings during the first half of your draft. One high-ceiling player she said to look out for is Anthony Richardson. The 22-year-old quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts didn't play much during his rookie season due to injuries. \"However, his upside, the potential that he could produce, is wild,\" Loza said. \"So, I often get like, 'Why would you want to take Anthony Richardson?' And my answer is like, well, there is a 100% injury rate in the NFL, but not 100% of the players in the NFL present with Richardson's ceiling.\" She continued, \"He averaged 18 fantasy points per game and 49% of those points came via his legs. And in fantasy, rushing, mobile quarterbacks are great because of the numbers they put up.\" So, you can afford to take a risk on a high-ceiling player in the beginning, knowing that the league's incredible depth will provide you with more tried-and-true, dependable players in the later rounds. Remember volume is king. Derrick Henry led the league in carries last season for the Tennessee Titans. This year, he'll be playing for the Baltimore Ravens. Wesley Hitt/Contributor/Getty Images \"The more times a player touches the ball, the more opportunities that player has to put up points. So volume is always king,\" Loza said. This is particularly relevant for running backs — those with higher fantasy value are the players who consistently get an opportunity to run the ball, which is why you'll see them go in the first round of the draft. However, she cautioned that the worry is if one of those players gets hurt, finding a replacement of equal value becomes much harder. Don't stack pass catchers from the same team. Stefon Diggs joins Nico Collins, Tank Dell, and Joe Mixon in Houston this season. Perry Knotts/Contributor/Getty Images Traditionally, \"stacking\" refers to taking a quarterback and a pass catcher from the same team, like a Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce duo, so you can maximize your points. What you want to avoid, though, is stacking two pass catchers from the same team, analysts told BI. \"I don't like to take two pass catchers from the same team because I think again, the volume is dipped,\" Loza said, offering the Houston Texans as an example. With Nico Collins, Stefon Diggs, Tank Dell, and Joe Mixon all competing for touches, Loza said it's an offense \"you want a piece of,\" but if you were to take Tank Dell and Nico Collins, you could miss out \"on a receiver who might not be part of as efficient an offense, but would see more targets.\" \"The targets don't always have to be pretty to be productive,\" she added. Defenses don't win championships in fantasy — and neither do kickers. Unlike in the league, Loza said defenses don't win championships in fantasy. Ryan Kang/Contributor/Getty Images Both Zylak and Loza said you shouldn't pick a defense and a kicker until the last two rounds of the draft. Otherwise, you're just wasting valuable picks. Speaking of value, focus on what's in front of you and remember not to panic. If you notice people are all starting to draft one position, don't panic and rush to do the same. Candice Ward/Contributor/Getty Images Starting a positional run is always better than ending one, according to Loza. \"So if quarterbacks start coming off the board, do not panic and say like, 'Oh my god, if I don't take a quarterback now, the one I want is gonna be gone,'\" she said. \"He may be, but also, you want to zig when everyone else is zagging because you want to take full advantage of the value in front of you at every time.\" Context is key, so don't focus too much on what happened in previous seasons. Aaron Rodgers is set to return from a season-ending Achilles injury. Perry Knotts/Contributor/Getty Images Take a look at Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Drake London. At first glance, the 23-year-old may not seem like an obvious choice. He averaged 6.1 fantasy points per game last season, and just 5.8 the season prior, according to CBS Sports. However, one could argue that London was undervalued in former head coach Arthur Smith's run-heavy system. But now that the Falcons are being led by Raheem Morris and veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins, London's chances of becoming a breakout star have significantly increased. He's the 14th-ranked wide receiver in ESPN's current fantasy rankings compared to the 30th-ranked choice a year ago. Not all changes are as big as a coaching change, though. \"There are little wrinkles, and you're like, 'Hmm, how much is this fourth-round rookie really going to affect this offense?'\" Loza said, adding, \"You kind of have to gauge it.\" You don't have to be super focused on statistics if you don't want to be. Instead, you can use existing rankings to help judge the strength of your choices. CeeDee Lamb of the Dallas Cowboys is ESPN's highest-rated wide receiver for fantasy this season. Michael Owens/Contributor/Getty Images \"Don't let the weeds of the stats bring you down,\" Loza said. \"You're allowed to just root for the players that you're excited about.\" So if there's a player that's amazing strategically, but isn't someone you feel like rooting for every week, just don't draft them — that's the benefit of the league having such depth. And with all those options, Loza encourages everyone to use the rankings available. \"Me and my colleagues do not spend all of this time to make rankings so that you can't use 'em,\" she said. So, if someone has caught your eye, check the rankings to ensure you draft them at an appropriate time. \"If you are someone who's like, 'Oh, I know Player X is a really good player and they're fun and I'm into them,' then look where they are on the rankings, like maybe they're wide receiver 30, and then see who else in that range is going and circle them,\" Loza said. \"Just be like, 'OK, when we get to this general part of the draft, I'm going to get that guy.'\" This way, you won't pass up on valuable talent in an effort to pick them. Don't give up if your season starts off slow — and remember to have fun. Zylak advises players not to feel defeated if their team doesn't perform well initially. Courtney Culbreath/Stringer/Getty Images Building a fantasy team extends beyond the initial draft, so Zylak advises players not to feel discouraged if they don't start the season with a winning record. \"Like, really, all you have to do is make the playoffs. It doesn't really matter what your seeding is,\" he said. \"And in most leagues, either half or like 40% of people make playoffs, so as long as you can squeak in — even if you start one and four — like look for trades, look for the waiver wire, because you just got to squeak into the playoffs, then anything can happen.\" And as cheesy as it may sound, remember to have fun. \"This is a secondary experience that only enriches the primary experience of watching football on Sundays,\" Loza said.

Three Positions in Management Science How to Build the Best Fantasy Football Team, Part 2 → September 28, 2015 · 8:00 am ↓ Jump to Comments How to Build the Best Fantasy Football Team Note 1: This is Part 1 of a two-part post on building fantasy league teams. Read this first and then read Part 2 here. Note 2: Although the title says “Fantasy Football”, the model I describe below can, in principle, be modified to fit any fantasy league for any sport. I’ve been recently approached by several people (some students, some friends) regarding the creation of optimal teams for fantasy football leagues. With the recent surge of betting sites like Fan Duel and Draft Kings, this has become a multi-million (or should I say, billion?) dollar industry. So I figured I’d write down a simple recipe to help everybody out. We’re about to use Prescriptive Analytics to bet on sports. Are you ready? Let’s do this! I’ll start with the math model and then show you how to make it all work using a spreadsheet. The Rules The fantasy football team rules state that a team must consist of: 1 quarterback (QB) 2 running backs (RB) 3 wide receivers (WR) 1 tight end (TE) 1 kicker 1 defense Some leagues also have what’s called a “flex player”, which could be either a RB, WR, or TE. I’ll explain how to handle the flex player below. In addition, players have a cost and the person creating the team has a budget, call it , to abide by (usually is $50,000 or $60,000). The Data For each player , we are given the cost mentioned above, call it , and a point projection . The latter is an estimate of how many points we expect that player to score in a given week or game. When it comes to the defense, although it doesn’t always score, there’s also a way to calculate points for it (e.g. points prevented). How do these point projections get calculated, you may ask? This is where Predictive Analytics come into play. It’s essentially forecasting. You look at past/recent performance, you look at the upcoming opponent, you look at players’ health, etc. There are web sites that provide you with these projections, or you can calculate your own. The more accurate you are at these predictions, the more likely you are to cash in on the bets. Here, we’ll take these numbers as given. The Optimization Model The main decisions to be made are simple: which players should be on our team? This can be modeled as a yes/no decision variable for each player. So let’s create a binary variable called which can only take two values: it’s equal to the value 1 when player is on our team, and it’s equal to the value zero when player is not on our team. The value of (the player ID) ranges from 1 to the total number of players available to us. Our objective is to create a team with the largest possible aggregate value of projected points. That is, we want to maximize the sum of point projections of all players we include on the team. This formula looks like this: The formula above works because when a player is on the team (), its gets multiplied by one and is added to the sum, and when a player isn’t on the team () its gets multiplied by zero and doesn’t get added to the final sum. The mechanism I just described is the main idea behind what makes all formulas in this model work. For example, if the point predictions for the first 3 players are 12, 20, and 10, the maximization function start as: The budget constraint can be written by saying that the sum of the costs of all players on our team has to be less than or equal to our budget , like this: For example, if the first 3 players cost 9000, 8500, and 11000, and our budget is 60,000, the above formula would look like this: . To enforce that the team has the right number of players in each position, we do it position by position. For example, to require that the team have one quarterback, we write: To require that the team have two running backs and three wide receivers, we write: The constraints for the remaining positions would be: The Curious Case of the Flex Player The flex player adds an interesting twist to this model. It’s a player that, if I understand correctly, takes the place of the kicker (meaning we would not have the kicker constraint above) and can be either a RB, WR, or TE. Therefore, right away, we have a new decision to make: what kind of player should the flex be? Let’s create three new yes/no variables to represent this decision: , , and . These variables mean, respectively: is the flex RB?, is the flex WR?, and is the flex TE? To indicate that only one of these things can be true, we write the constraint below: In addition, having a flex player is equivalent to increasing the right-hand side of the constraints that count the number of RB, WR, and TE by one, but only for a single one of those constraints. We achieve this by changing these constraints from the format they had above to the following: Note that because only one of the variables can be equal to 1, only one of the three constraints above will have its right-hand side increased from its original value of 2, 3, or 1. Other Potential Requirements Due to personal preference, inside information, or other esoteric considerations, one might want to include other requirements in this model. For example, if I want the best team that includes player number 8 and excludes player number 22, I simply have to force the x variable of player 8 to be 1, and the x variable of player 22 to be zero. Another constraint that may come in handy is to say that if player 9 is on the team, then player 10 also has to be on the team. This is achieved by: If you wanted the opposite, that is if player 9 is on the team then player 10 is NOT on the team, you’d write: Other conditions along these lines are also possible. Putting It All Together If you were patient enough to stick with me all the way through here, you’re eager to put this math to work. Let’s do it using Microsoft Excel. Start by downloading this spreadsheet and opening it on your computer. Here’s what it contains: Column A: list of player names. Column B: yes/no decisions for whether a player is on the team (these are the x variables that Excel Solver will compute for us). Columns C through H: flags indicating whether or not a player is of a given type (0 = no, 1 = yes). Columns I and J: the cost and point projections for each player. Now scroll down so that you can see rows 144 through 150. The cells in column B are currently empty because we haven’t chosen which players to add to the team yet. But if those choices had been made (that is, if we had filled column B with 0’s and 1’s), multiplying column B with column C in a cell-wise fashion and adding it all up would tell you how many quarterbacks you have. I have included this multiplication in cell C144 using the SUMPRODUCT formula. In a similar fashion, cells D144:H144 calculate how many players of each kind we’d have once the cells in column B receive values. The calculations of total team cost and total projected points for the team are analogous to the previous calculations and also use the SUMPRODUCT formula (see cells I144 and J144). You can try picking some players by hand (putting 1’s in some cells of column B) to see how the values of the cells in row 144 will change. If you now open the Excel Solver window (under the Data tab, if your Solver add-in is active), you’ll see that I already have the entire model set up for you. If you’ve never used Excel Solver before, the following two-part video will get you started with it: part 1 and part 2. The objective cell is J144, and that’s what we want to maximize. The variables (a.k.a. changing cells) are the player selections in column B, plus the flex-player type decisions (cells D147:F147). The constraints say that: (1) the actual number of players of each type (C144:H144) are equal to the desired number of each type (C146:H146), (2) the total cost of the team (I144) doesn’t exceed the budget (I146), (3) the three flex-player binary variables add up to 1 (D150 = F150), and, (4) all variables in the problem are binary. (I set the required number of kickers in cell G146 to zero because we are using the flex-player option. If you can have both a flex player and a kicker, just type a 1 in cell G146.) If you click on the “Solve” button, you’ll see that the best answer is a team that costs exactly $50,000 and has a total projected point value of 78.3. Its flex player ended up being an RB. This model is small enough that I can solve it with the free student version of Excel Solver (which comes by default with any Office installation). If you happen to have more players and your total variable count exceeds 200, the free solver won’t work. But don’t despair! There exists a great Solver add-in for Excel that is also free and has no size limit. It’s called OpenSolver, and it will work with the exact same setup I have here. That’s it! If you have any questions or remarks, feel free to leave me a note in the comments below. UPDATE: In a follow-up post, I explain how to model a few additional fantasy-league requirements that are not included in the model above. Share this: Twitter Facebook Like Loading...

Three Positions in Management Science How to Build the Best Fantasy Football Team, Part 2 → 18 responses to “How to Build the Best Fantasy Football Team” Matthew Galati September 28, 2015 at 10:16 am Don’t forget the team restrictions present on some sites. E.g., DraftKings: “Rosters will consist of 9 players and must include players from at least 2 different NFL teams, and representing at least 2 different football games.” There are many (just started recently) small analytics companies providing both the predictive and prescriptive side of lineup builders for daily fantasy sports. Some of them are using integer programming to build the lineups (some are just hacking it). One of my favorites is here: https://www.dailyfantasycafe.com/ When you start adding features like “exposure” or “diversity” for generating multiple lineup entries (not just the optimal) – the problem starts to get interesting. Andreas Thorsen September 28, 2015 at 10:38 am This is a great analytics problem. I was playing FanDuel last season and developed a similar model, and I tested it for about three weeks against friends. An important skill to learn is how to collect data. I simply scraped data from the web using a Chrome extension called ‘Table Capture’. Next, it is important to understand the uncertain nature of the data. From what I recall, FanDuel gives point predictions for each player, and DraftKings gives average points the player scored that season. FanDuel seemed to have poor predictions, and historical averages are not useful either, so instead I used the predicted points from Yahoo Fantasy Sports website. These predictions at least in some way took into account important determinants of points such as who their next opponent is. The next issue was that the instances I solved tended to have multiple optimal solutions. If my predicted points per player hadn’t been integer numbers, and instead was measured in tenths or hundredths, perhaps this wouldn’t have been an issue. However, it was nice to be able to look at different optimal solutions which looked very different (whole new lineups). This model was able to beat my friends about 50% of the time. However, if an appropriate predictive analytics component can be added, as well as using some “subject matter expertise” when analyzing the output, I think there is potential to make some money with this game. Alas, I live in Montana, a state that is banned from participating in the money version of these games, so I will never know. orbythebeach September 28, 2015 at 10:42 am Thank you for pointing out these omissions, Matthew. Is there a place online where all of them are listed? (Do I have to create an account on one of these sites to see these rules?) I’ll try googling for this and will write a follow-up post showing how to model these extra requirements. orbythebeach September 28, 2015 at 10:43 am Very good points, Andreas. Thank you! Matthew Galati September 28, 2015 at 10:51 am Tallys – I do not know of a central place to find all the different rules. There are MANY sites now (FanDuel, DraftKings, Yahoo, FantasyHub, …..). But you can probably find them easily by googling. Andreas – due to the uncertainty of the projections — Robust Optimization fits nicely here. But that all depends on which type of game you are playing (head to heads vs tournaments). Obviously, your strategy is different in each case. orbythebeach September 28, 2015 at 10:52 am Thanks! I’ll try compiling a list with whatever I can find online. Pingback: How to Build the Best Fantasy Football Team, Part 2 | O.R. by the Beach Pingback: Fantasy Football using Excel « OpenSolver for Excel JackR October 2, 2015 at 9:40 am For fantasy baseball, some players can play multiple positions. E.g. Miguel Cabrera can play 1B or 3B. I currently use OpenSolver for DFS and haven’t found a good way to incorporate this into my model. Any ideas? Matthew Galati October 2, 2015 at 10:38 am JackR, each player_position should be a separate variable. Then force at most one to be selected. Be careful of some details when doing it this way… like double counting for #players on a team, etc… I even found it easier to model it with an extra player variable = sum{positions} player_position. And then use the player or player_position variables where appropriate. orbythebeach October 5, 2015 at 1:15 pm JackR: Matthew’s answer explains what you need to do. Because I like your question very much, I’ve updated the second part of this post with a detailed explanation of what you need to do to take care of your situation (I refer to it as Requirement 4). Take a look: https://orbythebeach.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/how-to-build-the-best-fantasy-football-team-part-2/ Pete Cacioppi October 7, 2015 at 2:12 pm Great minds think alike…. how does your approach differ from this one? http://www.opsrules.com/supply-chain-optimization-blog/get-an-edge-in-fantasy-football-with-analytics orbythebeach October 7, 2015 at 3:11 pm Hi Pete. Thank you for the link. Indeed the model described on that page has the same essential ideas that mine has. The main difference I see is that in my post I went all the way down to the detailed model, including all the formulas and a running spreadsheet showing how things are implemented. I also address some extra requirements in the follow-up post (part 2). Pingback: Optimizing Daily Fantasy Sports Lineups With Ruby | Jeff January 1, 2017 at 2:49 pm So I reading this and I have looked at your spreadsheet all are great, but I wondering how you would set a lineup based strictly off of data and it not involve salary costs? I ask this because I work more without draftkings, or fanduel and more with just standard leagues. orbythebeach January 1, 2017 at 3:29 pm Hi Jeff. If costs are not part of your version of the problem, you simply remove the constraint that says “don’t spend more money than what you have.” If you give me more details about what you’re trying to do, I can try and explain what changes are needed. Jeff January 1, 2017 at 7:37 pm Thanks for responding back. I only use Yahoo public league that has no salary or auction feature we use standard scoring with the addition of a flex wr/te. I have built a a VBD cheat sheet that goes off of yahoo’s scoring for every position. It worked great but what I couldn’t make it do is use it weekly to decide if I had the best line up a could according to projections given, or if there was a player trending up or down I was missing from historical numbers. So I am wondering if there was a way to take your line builder and use it with projected and historical numbers or one of them to help with a weekly line builder. Now to through this out there I actually did set my line up against Las Vegas projected point odds using Floor, Ceiling avg point and that seemed to work out as well. I hope this helps, let me know if you need more clarification from me. orbythebeach January 1, 2017 at 10:41 pm The model I describe is set up to take a single number for each player to represent his expected performance. From my understanding of what you describe, it looks like you’d be better off running a simulation (there are Excel Add-ins for this, such as Crystal Ball, @Risk, etc.). The idea of the simulation would be to take this same model as a starting point and run it thousands of times, each time changing the players’ expected performance number to a value within the range of values we believe to be adequate for each player. At the end of all these runs you’ll have thousands of “optimal lineups”, one for each combination of input numbers. Then, you could, for example, pick the lineup that most often appeared as the best lineup.

Putting It All Together If you were patient enough to stick with me all the way through here, you’re eager to put this math to work. Let’s do it using Microsoft Excel. Start by downloading this spreadsheet and opening it on your computer. Here’s what it contains: Column A: list of player names. Column B: yes/no decisions for whether a player is on the team (these are the x variables that Excel Solver will compute for us). Columns C through H: flags indicating whether or not a player is of a given type (0 = no, 1 = yes). Columns I and J: the cost and point projections for each player. Now scroll down so that you can see rows 144 through 150. The cells in column B are currently empty because we haven’t chosen which players to add to the team yet. But if those choices had been made (that is, if we had filled column B with 0’s and 1’s), multiplying column B with column C in a cell-wise fashion and adding it all up would tell you how many quarterbacks you have. I have included this multiplication in cell C144 using the SUMPRODUCT formula. In a similar fashion, cells D144:H144 calculate how many players of each kind we’d have once the cells in column B receive values. The calculations of total team cost and total projected points for the team are analogous to the previous calculations and also use the SUMPRODUCT formula (see cells I144 and J144). You can try picking some players by hand (putting 1’s in some cells of column B) to see how the values of the cells in row 144 will change. If you now open the Excel Solver window (under the Data tab, if your Solver add-in is active), you’ll see that I already have the entire model set up for you. If you’ve never used Excel Solver before, the following two-part video will get you started with it: part 1 and part 2. The objective cell is J144, and that’s what we want to maximize. The variables (a.k.a. changing cells) are the player selections in column B, plus the flex-player type decisions (cells D147:F147). The constraints say that: (1) the actual number of players of each type (C144:H144) are equal to the desired number of each type (C146:H146), (2) the total cost of the team (I144) doesn’t exceed the budget (I146), (3) the three flex-player binary variables add up to 1 (D150 = F150), and, (4) all variables in the problem are binary. (I set the required number of kickers in cell G146 to zero because we are using the flex-player option. If you can have both a flex player and a kicker, just type a 1 in cell G146.) If you click on the “Solve” button, you’ll see that the best answer is a team that costs exactly $50,000 and has a total projected point value of 78.3. Its flex player ended up being an RB. This model is small enough that I can solve it with the free student version of Excel Solver (which comes by default with any Office installation). If you happen to have more players and your total variable count exceeds 200, the free solver won’t work. But don’t despair! There exists a great Solver add-in for Excel that is also free and has no size limit. It’s called OpenSolver, and it will work with the exact same setup I have here. That’s it! If you have any questions or remarks, feel free to leave me a note in the comments below. UPDATE: In a follow-up post, I explain how to model a few additional fantasy-league requirements that are not included in the model above. Share this: Twitter Facebook Like Loading...

Three Positions in Management Science How to Build the Best Fantasy Football Team, Part 2 → 18 responses to “How to Build the Best Fantasy Football Team” Matthew Galati September 28, 2015 at 10:16 am Don’t forget the team restrictions present on some sites. E.g., DraftKings: “Rosters will consist of 9 players and must include players from at least 2 different NFL teams, and representing at least 2 different football games.” There are many (just started recently) small analytics companies providing both the predictive and prescriptive side of lineup builders for daily fantasy sports. Some of them are using integer programming to build the lineups (some are just hacking it). One of my favorites is here: https://www.dailyfantasycafe.com/ When you start adding features like “exposure” or “diversity” for generating multiple lineup entries (not just the optimal) – the problem starts to get interesting. Andreas Thorsen September 28, 2015 at 10:38 am This is a great analytics problem. I was playing FanDuel last season and developed a similar model, and I tested it for about three weeks against friends. An important skill to learn is how to collect data. I simply scraped data from the web using a Chrome extension called ‘Table Capture’. Next, it is important to understand the uncertain nature of the data. From what I recall, FanDuel gives point predictions for each player, and DraftKings gives average points the player scored that season. FanDuel seemed to have poor predictions, and historical averages are not useful either, so instead I used the predicted points from Yahoo Fantasy Sports website. These predictions at least in some way took into account important determinants of points such as who their next opponent is. The next issue was that the instances I solved tended to have multiple optimal solutions. If my predicted points per player hadn’t been integer numbers, and instead was measured in tenths or hundredths, perhaps this wouldn’t have been an issue. However, it was nice to be able to look at different optimal solutions which looked very different (whole new lineups). This model was able to beat my friends about 50% of the time. However, if an appropriate predictive analytics component can be added, as well as using some “subject matter expertise” when analyzing the output, I think there is potential to make some money with this game. Alas, I live in Montana, a state that is banned from participating in the money version of these games, so I will never know. orbythebeach September 28, 2015 at 10:42 am Thank you for pointing out these omissions, Matthew. Is there a place online where all of them are listed? (Do I have to create an account on one of these sites to see these rules?) I’ll try googling for this and will write a follow-up post showing how to model these extra requirements. orbythebeach September 28, 2015 at 10:43 am Very good points, Andreas. Thank you! Matthew Galati September 28, 2015 at 10:51 am Tallys – I do not know of a central place to find all the different rules. There are MANY sites now (FanDuel, DraftKings, Yahoo, FantasyHub, …..). But you can probably find them easily by googling. Andreas – due to the uncertainty of the projections — Robust Optimization fits nicely here. But that all depends on which type of game you are playing (head to heads vs tournaments). Obviously, your strategy is different in each case. orbythebeach September 28, 2015 at 10:52 am Thanks! I’ll try compiling a list with whatever I can find online. Pingback: How to Build the Best Fantasy Football Team, Part 2 | O.R. by the Beach Pingback: Fantasy Football using Excel « OpenSolver for Excel JackR October 2, 2015 at 9:40 am For fantasy baseball, some players can play multiple positions. E.g. Miguel Cabrera can play 1B or 3B. I currently use OpenSolver for DFS and haven’t found a good way to incorporate this into my model. Any ideas? Matthew Galati October 2, 2015 at 10:38 am JackR, each player_position should be a separate variable. Then force at most one to be selected. Be careful of some details when doing it this way… like double counting for #players on a team, etc… I even found it easier to model it with an extra player variable = sum{positions} player_position. And then use the player or player_position variables where appropriate. orbythebeach October 5, 2015 at 1:15 pm JackR: Matthew’s answer explains what you need to do. Because I like your question very much, I’ve updated the second part of this post with a detailed explanation of what you need to do to take care of your situation (I refer to it as Requirement 4). Take a look: https://orbythebeach.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/how-to-build-the-best-fantasy-football-team-part-2/ Pete Cacioppi October 7, 2015 at 2:12 pm Great minds think alike…. how does your approach differ from this one? http://www.opsrules.com/supply-chain-optimization-blog/get-an-edge-in-fantasy-football-with-analytics orbythebeach October 7, 2015 at 3:11 pm Hi Pete. Thank you for the link. Indeed the model described on that page has the same essential ideas that mine has. The main difference I see is that in my post I went all the way down to the detailed model, including all the formulas and a running spreadsheet showing how things are implemented. I also address some extra requirements in the follow-up post (part 2). Pingback: Optimizing Daily Fantasy Sports Lineups With Ruby | Jeff January 1, 2017 at 2:49 pm So I reading this and I have looked at your spreadsheet all are great, but I wondering how you would set a lineup based strictly off of data and it not involve salary costs? I ask this because I work more without draftkings, or fanduel and more with just standard leagues. orbythebeach January 1, 2017 at 3:29 pm Hi Jeff. If costs are not part of your version of the problem, you simply remove the constraint that says “don’t spend more money than what you have.” If you give me more details about what you’re trying to do, I can try and explain what changes are needed. Jeff January 1, 2017 at 7:37 pm Thanks for responding back. I only use Yahoo public league that has no salary or auction feature we use standard scoring with the addition of a flex wr/te. I have built a a VBD cheat sheet that goes off of yahoo’s scoring for every position. It worked great but what I couldn’t make it do is use it weekly to decide if I had the best line up a could according to projections given, or if there was a player trending up or down I was missing from historical numbers. So I am wondering if there was a way to take your line builder and use it with projected and historical numbers or one of them to help with a weekly line builder. Now to through this out there I actually did set my line up against Las Vegas projected point odds using Floor, Ceiling avg point and that seemed to work out as well. I hope this helps, let me know if you need more clarification from me. orbythebeach January 1, 2017 at 10:41 pm The model I describe is set up to take a single number for each player to represent his expected performance. From my understanding of what you describe, it looks like you’d be better off running a simulation (there are Excel Add-ins for this, such as Crystal Ball, @Risk, etc.). The idea of the simulation would be to take this same model as a starting point and run it thousands of times, each time changing the players’ expected performance number to a value within the range of values we believe to be adequate for each player. At the end of all these runs you’ll have thousands of “optimal lineups”, one for each combination of input numbers. Then, you could, for example, pick the lineup that most often appeared as the best lineup.

specifically with each of the positions if you listen to me and you pay attention throughout the year you'll have a shot of the title by the end roughly 40 million people play Fantasy Football and Matthew Barry is the absolute expert so my name is Matthew Bary and my official title is senior fantasy and sports betting analyst for NBC Sports and peacock how often refer to the Godfather of fantasy football Matthew Barry is going to take us position by position highlighting what stats make a successful fantasy option when it comes to quarterbacks in general what you want as dual thread quarterbacks quarterbacks that not only get you fantasy points with their arm but with their legs last season of the top six quarterbacks and fantasy points per game four of them had 700 or more rushing yards and in fact eight of the top 10 fantasy quarterbacks at points per game last year had at least 350 rushing yards you really want a dual threat quarterback because if they don't get you fantasy points with their legs you need them to have 40 passing touchdown upside and there just aren't a lot of quarterbacks like that in the NFL right now I also think it's important to understand tiers Josh Allen Patrick romes and Jaylen birds are kind of the elite top three but there's a clear top eight quarterbacks what you really want is quarterbacks that run and throw that have talent around them you can be the best quarterback in the world but if you got the worst offensive line it's hard to throw from your back Josh Allen is a great example Josh Allen had a bad completion percentage they said he was more of a runner than a thrower year three Josh Allen gets Stephon digs one of the best wide receivers in the NFL what happens he becomes the number one quarterback in fantasy everyone talks about his accuracy his Elite passing did Josh all suddenly become a better quarterback yes he did having Stefon dig to throw to makes you a better quarterback for the running back position bam is kick the top five running backs and fantasy points per game last season all had at least 310 touches 16 to the top 20 had at least 250 touches all finished as top 20 running backs in fantasy points per game the next thing is what kind of touches are they getting specifically we want to look for high value touches receptions and Red Zone touches are they getting the ball when the team gets inside their opponent's 20 yard line that's the red zone are they getting it in goal to go situations which is inside an opponent's 10 yard so ideally you want running backs that touch the ball a lot and that they touch the ball a lot when they get close to the goal line and they touch the ball a lot from their quarterback not just on first and second down but also on third down as part of the passing attack in terms of wide receiver that's somebody that is earning a high percentage of Target Target share and targets for routes run wide receivers need to have the ability to earn targets by getting open the actual best wide receivers in the NFL tend to be the ones who scored the most fantasy points Justin Jefferson Jamar Chase Cooper cup Tyreek Hill Stefon digs those guys are the best wide receivers in the NL and they also are the ones who score the most fantasy points if you want some efficiency metrics if you want to get a little bit dirty Target share targets per route run yards for Route run are all good efficiency metrics for wide receivers wide receivers tend to be safer early round picks due to consistency and lower injury risk when you think about it running backs are being tackled hard they're going in between the pile wide receiv receivers they bounce out of bounds they're being hit by a defensive back not an defensive lineman wide receivers tend to have a lower injury risk I also like rookies by the way look at the second half rookie wide receivers there's a number of talented wide receivers who might start slow as rookies but over the second half of the year will have a huge impact if you think about last year with guys like Garrett Wilson Chris o Jan doson at times that's another place to look for as you get further into the season and then at the tit end position what you want is you want to see how many Snaps are they out on a passing play are they used primarily as a blocker or they used as a passer some Titans are really just glorified wide receivers what's their opportunity we can look at Talent they have a good quarterback is the tight end used more as a Blocker in this offense or is the tight end used as a passing weapon in the offense generally speaking I either want to be one of the first people in my leite to get a tight end or one of the last because having an elite tight end can be a huge huge Advantage Travis Kelsey Mark Andrew TJ hackinson for me are those top three I think they stand up Above the Rest we' spent a lot of time looking at trying to predict kicker scoring and kicker scoring year over year over year and generally speaking the best kicker in fantasy football and like the 12 kicker in fantasy football the difference is like one and a half points a game there's just not much difference there's a lot of variants you like kickers on good offenses you like kickers that play indoors in warm weather cities so they're not often kicking in bad weather you can look at defenses that give up the most field goals that have good red zone defense but bad defense in the middle of the field you know kind of their B don't break defenses their teams will come down on the off and will kick but generally speaking it doesn't make sense to draft a kicker before the last round with defenses You can predict some things you can predict hey this is a team that likes to Blitz a lot so probably they'll generate you know some sacks maybe a few more turnovers but honestly it's generally fairly fluky if you look at defensive scoring year after year it rarely Carri from season to season so streaming is always a much better option than saying I'm going to go out and Target this there are defenses that we think are going to be pretty good the Eagles and the nighers but you're often better off of just picking the defense that's playing in an offense week after week now that you have your team built let's get to the most important part a fantasy team name is very important right this is not a decision take lightly the team name should reflect your personality and ideally insult somebody else in your League fantasy football there is no one right way to play there is no one one right way to draft ultimately you have to figure out what works for you and do what you want to do",
