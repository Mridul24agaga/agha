  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, my friend, let’s take a chill look at what softgen.ai could be dishing out. Given the name, it’s pretty clear we’re diving into the realm of AI—specifically, something to do with \"soft\" tech or solutions.

At the end of the day, AI is such a collaborative space, and folks digging into it often want to connect and share ideas. Wrapping it all up, softgen.ai is likely a melting pot of solutions, tools, and resources powered by AI, aimed at making life easier for developers and businesses alike. Whether they’re focusing on generative solutions, analytics, or making AI approachable, you can bet they’re trying to help folks ride the tech wave without wiping out. So, if you’re in the game for some soft, AI-driven magic, this site might just have what you need to level up. Cheers to that!",

      "content": "Published Time: 2024-11-20T10:23:16+00:00 2025's AI Revolution: Mind-Blowing Advances You Need to Know Skip to content Home Our Offering About Us Contact Us Careers the AI Hub Home Our Offering About Us Contact Us Careers the AI Hub the AI Hub 2025’s AI Revolution: Mind-Blowing Advances You Need to Know November 20, 2024 2025's AI Revolution: Mind-Blowing Advances You Need to Know As we look toward 2025, the landscape of AI is poised for transformative advancements. Key breakthroughs have been mentioned by industry stakeholders like Eric Schmidt, Mustafa Suleyman and others. These include: large context windows, memory capabilities, AI agents, and “text to action” functionalities promise to redefine the possibilities of generative AI systems. Each of these advancements is significant on its own, but their combined impact will be nothing short of revolutionary. 1. Large Context Windows At present, large language models (LLMs) are constrained by limited context windows, often only processing a few thousand tokens at a time. This limitation means models struggle with tasks requiring a deep understanding of long sequences, such as analyzing entire books or maintaining continuity across extensive dialogues. The result is inefficiency, with models frequently “forgetting” crucial information from earlier in the conversation. By 2025, large context windows are set to make a significant leap forward. Innovations like “infinite attention” will enable models to handle far greater amounts of data, summarizing and prioritizing essential information to maintain coherence without being overwhelmed. For example, an AI system could analyze an entire book, remember key themes and arguments, and still refer back to specific chapters as needed, similar to how a human would keep track of important details. This advancement will be invaluable for applications in research, content generation, and educational tools. Extended context windows will also improve chain-of-thought reasoning, allowing AI to perform multi-step logical processes more effectively. Imagine an AI capable of guiding you through a thousand-step recipe, troubleshooting complex technical issues, or engaging in a long-term research project. These capabilities will open new possibilities in fields like healthcare, where patient history tracking is crucial, and software development, where a holistic understanding of a project can lead to more efficient solutions. As these innovations become widely implemented, they will set new standards for AI-driven services, offering a level of continuity and understanding that feels genuinely human-like. 2. Memory Capabilities Today’s generative AI models have limited memory, affecting their ability to recall past interactions. This makes conversations feel disjointed, as models often fail to remember user preferences, discussions, or specific details from earlier exchanges. In 2025, AI memory capabilities will undergo a transformative shift. Future models will incorporate permanent memory, maintaining a persistent and evolving understanding of past interactions. This will allow generative AI to remember user preferences, recall prior discussions, and maintain context across multiple sessions, making interactions more cohesive and intuitive. With robust memory, AI can provide personalized experiences, track evolving interests, and suggest follow-up actions, creating a more engaging and efficient user experience. This breakthrough will revolutionize applications like virtual assistants and personalized learning platforms. Imagine an AI that remembers your progress on a complex project or tracks your changing goals. Such a system could proactively offer recommendations and adapt its behavior to your needs, acting like a reliable, evolving partner in both personal and professional settings. The long-term memory capability will enhance productivity and make AI more valuable and indispensable. 3. AI Agents Creating reliable and autonomous AI agents remains one of the most significant challenges in artificial intelligence today. Current limitations include difficulties in ensuring consistent and accurate decision-making, maintaining situational awareness, and enabling seamless collaboration between multiple agents. These agents can often struggle in unstructured or unpredictable environments, which hampers their effectiveness and reliability. By 2025, advancements are expected to address these hurdles, leading to more robust and dependable AI agents. Researchers are focusing on enhancing agents’ ability to adapt and learn in real time, improve their situational awareness, and collaborate more effectively with other AI systems. This means developing agents that can better manage uncertainty, handle complex scenarios without human intervention, and reliably complete multi-step processes. The improvements will enable AI agents to make more consistent and informed decisions, optimizing operations in areas like healthcare, logistics, and customer service. At Superbo, we’re tackling these challenges head-on with our GenAI Fabric Agent framework. Our system enables the creation of sophisticated microassistants—AI agents designed to emulate human skills and work collaboratively in complex environments.

questions I've been getting on our channel about drywall and repairs and home maintenance and I have a simple message to tell you don't worry about it it's just drywall so in today's video I'm gonna show you all the tips and tricks that learn from my past years of working on the construction site now to fix messes like this messes like this gaps and cracks unevenness holes oil paint transition when you put your drywall in backwards how to cover up stucco ceilings and different kinds of scenarios where you've got texture on the roof there is a lot of information out there that can be really simply applied to solve your problems but if you're intimidated with touching your drywall that you're gonna be too creative and do something risky for instance if you want to know if you have a leaking plumbing valve don't be afraid to open a huge hole in the back of the closet take a look it's so easy to replace and repair drywall we're gonna show you all the steps today to take the fear out of been opening up your walls and solving your problems number one if you have a hole and you've got to repair it the easiest way to do it without damaging your house cutting your electrical circuits cutting a hole in your plumbing take your often knife okay you can get on Amazon just follow our link in the description you set it to just a little bit more than 1/2 inch okay and you want to cut the hole wider than the damage because impact damage always is bigger on the back side of the drywall than the front it's kind of like a hollow-point bullet it doesn't look too bad up front but it's not designed to make a big mess on the front right here we go all right and you want to just run a couple of passes until you're all the way through piece of cake because once you've got a square hole it's easy to patch it now if you've seen some of our other videos you've probably seen this already but this is such a great technique it's worth revisiting this is called the California patch and what I'm doing is I'm just eyeballing to cut a piece of drywall a couple inches wider in both directions so that'll cover my hole okay what I'm gonna do line it up take my knife just inside the cut and I'm gonna score the brown paper from the backside it's both sides and we're gonna do the same here and we're gonna try to give ourselves a little bit of room to work with cuz you only want to do this once it's okay if it's a little smaller than the hole break it and then hold them and then peel it from the paper leaving the paper on the front this makes the perfect patch one of the most amazing benefits is at the white paper on the front of the drywall is thinner than the drywall tape that you would buyer to patch it with so it actually creates a lot less work when you go to finish you're gonna take your drywall compound and you can buy this in a variety of different ways if you're a homeowner you're just doing one repair you can get in a little tub if you're gonna buy just a little bit I would recommend buying the powder by the 45 or the 90 mix up for yourself because then you'll always have it on hand you get real good value it's only ten bucks for a huge bag and the other stuff that you buy in the little tubs generally is really difficult to sand it's gonna drive you crazy now you take a little bit of mud and the idea here is to leave it on the inside of that framing that of the cut okay doesn't work too well in the top ever but here we go here we go alright and then all the way around take it and we're gonna put a little bit on the inside edges of all the rope as well and we're just gonna press it in if you find it not going in all the way maybe there's a little bit of restriction just use your knife to level off the corners and then press the tape in you're just embedding the drywall tape and you want to do this just once okay if you work it too much it's gonna wrinkle because of the moisture and it'll cause you all kinds of pain so get it in wipe off the extra mud and walk away after that's dry you can come back and do another coat and it should be done with a four by ten knife like this alright and I know it's not dry yet so bear with me okay and use outward pressure on the top pull it nice and tight and then come through the middle at the end all right if you let it dry between coats sometimes a second application with this knife is all you're gonna need so you don't have to do it over and over and over again you don't have to sand it between coats just let it set up less is more pull it tight and flat and you'll be happy every single time the second situation I see a lot of people commenting about is they need to check their and do an inspection on their valve or they want to change the valve from the backside if you want to do an inspection anywhere in your house let's say there's sharkbite valves and maybe you think might be dripping or something like that you can buy one of these spring-loaded trap door okay they work great and the idea is the hole that you have on the wall needs to be as big as this framework here plus some distance for this to tie in and put some compression on so what I generally try to do this isn't 8x8 but I'll try to cut the hole so that it's about that big nice and square so here we go not I'm not big enough here and you can use a drywall saw for this and you can cut the hole bigger than you need okay [Music] it only cost six bucks and all we do to set this in is put pressure on the single tab first because it will slide and you push it over and you rest this in and it's snaps back in place now if this is down on the wall by the toilet or if this is in the ceiling of your basement or if this is in the closet on the back wall nobody cares you can put these in all day long you can even paint them the same color as the wall or the ceiling it's very standard you can also use the same trapdoor in the ceiling in the basement for shutoff valves and pipes in different situations or clean outs for your sink island whatever have you so don't be intimidated if you need to have access to the area behind drywall cut a hole stick in a cover because it's that easy to take off and it looks just pretty good the next the next trick I'm going to show you is actually it answers a few different questions what do I do to fill big gaps what about if I'm going from a new wall to an old wall and there's lots of damage or it's lath and plaster and there's lots of damage okay or if the old wall is a different thickness these situations are all taken care of if you own one of these guns having a foam gun gives you lots of control I'm going to just get this started here here we go turn the trigger really low and you can feel just about any gap or crack exactly the amount of foam that you're going to need now if it's really nasty you can overfill it it doesn't matter because what this does this sets up in about 15 or 20 minutes okay and you might find that this is a great alternative to using 45-minute drywall compound all right if you already have this tool it's really handy it does a great job and it becomes the backing remember we're just adding mud and the surface this becomes the backing it also is an adhesive between the different material so you don't get cracks you don't need to apply any paper that's amazing so one of the questions I get is a lot of people their first time renovators they've done all the installation they're down to their last piece of drywall it's not quite big enough to fit or you've got a big gap in the ceiling because you're in an old house like mine and the ceiling has a bit of a ball to it and you can't install everything square and level so again take about the foam open it up pretty healthy shoot it at the corner so it has something to hit and it'll expand in and out of that corner and don't worry about how much of a mess it makes remember the goal here is that when that's done drying its expanded in behind got solid so you can trim off the face and have a backing to do your taping now we're gonna go up to the top of the ceiling where I did this yesterday and I'll show you how it looks so the secret here is we're trading backing right so open up your blade so I this tough to boat where do you think the depth is all right and we've been sawing action and then just gently trim it across there okay and then you can clean it up nice and tight all right now I'm only gonna demonstrate just a little bit less I'll go right into the corners I actually do need this to be finished today okay I'm happy with that it's not looks pretty nasty but it's ready to be worked with so I'm just gonna tape out the joint here a little bit real quick now when you've got a scenario like this I've actually got about an inch gap from where the drywall finished till the ceiling and the ceiling doesn't make it all the way into the corner it's a nasty mess and I made it a nasty mess on purpose to show you how easy it is to fix there we go run your mud off the side of this knife here no this foam does not react to the compound this isn't gonna melt it or affect it at all okay yeah got to keep the dirt out of your mud yeah I'm just gonna go what I call flat taping flat taping flat taping is the process of just going on one surface I'm not going around the corner and you can push that up as nice tight as you want okay and then we'll press it in now that we've got that pressed in you don't have to wait till tomorrow to come back to fix it here's one other trick when you're taping with much you can do multiple layers of mud and paper it's okay you can sandwich it as long as you give it time to dry before you come back the next time to fiddle around with it okay try to keep your mud in the middle of your hock the whole time you're working all right now we're gonna apply them under the ceiling catch your drips try to work as clean as possible okay there we go and then again off the side of the knife we're gonna snowplow it right in there okay just pretend that that paper and bud there it wasn't a tear of previously and I measure off a piece of tape gonna get a nice straight edge pre fold it there we go we have a nice flat surface up top so I'm gonna use that to trust my line gentle pressure all the way across okay painting the edge one more pass that's good now hold the knife flat against the wall cuz if you are ain't too loosey-goosey with it you'll just push everything in and make a mess there we go IMAX zoom in there and tell me if that corner doesn't look perfect now if you want to save even more time and you're comfortable with using your knife you can go back over top and you can apply the inside corner of the forage application right over that paper tape alright and then the next time you come back all you'll need to do is a six inch knife just to make sure that it's perfectly smooth and feathered oh all right done it's not that tricky anybody can do this the next issue you're gonna run into is I get questions like this all the time hey I got a rusty nail or a rusty staple or residue from tape or oops I was doing a weird angle and I installed the drywall backwards and I see the brown paper can i tape over that and the answer is yes of course but you have to prep it first you need to use a Primus so here we go I've got tape let's get this out of here okay well the tapes gone but I still got that red stuff left got broke a poor showing I've got dark pencil I don't care even if it's marker there is one solution for all your problems and if you're taping your house you've got to have this can on you at all times pom pom yeah if you're a fan of the channel you've seen me use it before I put this on everything okay brown paper no problem oil-based primer red tape no problem oil-based primer marker no problem oil-based primer with the pigment look at that this just disappearing I'm doing an infomercial here oil-based primer works on everything let's say you have an old house with laughs and plaster and oil paint kills you can buy it in a can and roll it on the wall they even have an odorless formula of an oil primer just for transitioning from oil to latex so that you don't have your paint peeling off over time if you're ever stuck and you were in trouble and you don't know how to solve a problem think oil-based primer and then all of your new muds and compounds will bond to it if you use oil-based primer over plaster new drywall compound will bond to that so you don't have to go to the buy plaster and mix it up yourself saves a lot of time and money this is money in the bank and before anybody starts putting it in the comment section no kills did not sponsor this video I just love the stuff okay let's move on I don't need the tape here anymore now we're gonna get away from the traditional drywall compound we're gonna get into the quick-set mud we're gonna show you everything that it can do here's another one of the most popular questions out there I can't find sheetrock for five anywhere what do I get this is a CGC company that means Canadian gypsum corporation trade from the United States you're gonna find a u.s. G which is United States gypsum okay they make a forty five mix as well this is not proprietary technology all right it's really basic stuff so 45 here is 45 there it's the same stuff just a different supplier we have border issues right so okay I'll just get along all right then what we're gonna do with the powder of course and a lot of you might have seen this alright so we're gonna just do a quick short version of this we're gonna make a lot of volcano on the hawk and I don't know sometimes it's easier to move the hawk than the knife all right volcano time here we go the higher the walls the easier it is to control everything okay now I'm using hot water if you want your coat 45 minute mud to set super fast so you can keep on working use hot water throw a little salt in it right this is a chemical reaction we're dealing with now so basic science grade eight heat plus salt changes all the chemical reactions and speeds things up so we're gonna go add my hot water Oh making a mess this is not the way the demonstrations supposed to work better close that up got a dam up the hole alright got it to do to do I'm gonna sprinkle it in of course and try not to have another dam break on us but it happens here we go doesn't have to go over the top sometimes it start leaking from underneath if you want to you can go with a little bit less water until you know you've got it under control but I found with this hot water and you've really just got to be able to move and manage the mess and it's worth paying for here we go ready now we're gonna go for it we're gonna go making a mess that's okay construction site yeah that's okay we're not gonna worry about it because this reaction happens so fast that if I don't move and get it done by the time I'm done fiddling around it'll ought to be red rock hard try to mix it somewhat smooth this is a race against time here we go and it's already turning into a hard pace now just for fun we're gonna come back after this brief brief word from our sponsors we don't have a sponsor or am I talking about I'm just saying it's not yet yeah I know it's gonna happen that quick give it about 60 seconds okay so now we're back we have only been a couple minutes and to be honest it's not completely hard but it is setup okay it's stiff enough that I can work with and I'm just gonna cover this now with my regular compound and it won't end up blending together and peeling out of the hole and when this is dry it's not gonna shrink or expand or do anything crazy like that on you you can do all this at the same time all right I mean is this mud my goodness it's a little loosey-goosey what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put paper tape majority on the old wall all right and I'm pressing it on the original hard surface and now I'm just gonna set it into the soft with a little bit of pressure and then I'll watch the mud just rising away from the tape and that's how I know that I've embedded it I don't have a ridge from the mud I haven't embedded it and it will bubble there we go you remember earlier we talked about that we can use expansion foam and it bridges the gap and it seals it together so you don't need the paper tape you should use the tape anyway if you're using the 45 you have to use the tape all right again we're just gonna come down and set this up with a nice new layer mud and we're gonna embed it on the surface here now nice force here on the original drywall okay and what we're trying to do is eliminate the action of having too much blood stuck in behind the basement we don't want to raise the surface off too much now we're going to just press those two pieces of paper together that are floating over that mud in the middle okay look at that it used to be a nasty mess is now really well embedded together and if you see any areas where the paper tape looks like it's coming apart just get your knife in there put a little mud follow it up make sure the surface is nice and wet so that it doesn't bubble so okay while you're working you can always use the pail as a table okay so we're getting close to the end of all of the questions I've still got one two I got three more things to show you but before I do my floor is creaky I've got to screw that down oh yeah let me just address this one issue if you have dents remember drywall is just dust compressed between papers so if you have a dent if it's dented on the surface it's also dented on the backside it doesn't get compressed it gets moved and that's fine because dents can be adjusted simply like that you don't even think twice about them just fill them and go unless they're big enough that they've actually broken through the backside my rule is this if it's not bigger than one and a half inches it's not concerned about all right you don't need tape you don't have to fuss with it just fill it and you'll be fine now getting back to this all right once this is filled you got to treat this like a butt joint you want to fill this side and then you want to fill this side okay and by Phil meaning pressure on the outside here and pressure on the outside here I think it'd take a little bit of mud and run it right down the middle with a fair amount of pressure and here's a secret will be even it be don't touch it again let that's right completely what we've done now is we've set the depth of the wall to this point this Ridge simply means that I have to fill a little bit here and a little bit here to get this nice and smooth this Ridge actually becomes your guide line now tomorrow when it's dry I can come back and I can use my four inch knife just scrape off that Ridge all right and I'll start in the middle with a thin coat and I'll be using pressure going the outside if you want to know how to actually finish a butt joint properly you can click the link to this video here we've done some information on this series previously and it'll go through all of you how to fill corners and do it all that sort of thing when to use the 45 minute mud versus the other it's a great video I think you're gonna like it and one other thing I'm not going to cover today is nail pops we've got a great video on nail pops we call them nail pops if it's a nail or a screw so don't get offended if you have one or the other it's all the same business and it's all dealt with in the same manner if it's a nail hammered in a little bit if it's a screw you screw it in a little bit but follow all that information in the card up in the corner okay yeah let's get on to the next two things that are going to be life savers on your job site so the next thing that people get intimidated about dealing with drywall is the mess and rightly so because drywall dust is actually lighter than air it seems right it goes everywhere there are two things you can do to manage your mess well actually three one you can clean as you go resist the temptation to sweep unless you but this this is what we call drywall sweeping compound all right and there are a couple of different companies that make this stuff one of them makes it green one of them makes it red I buy this stuff because it's available on my local Home Depot and the truth is I've been shopping Home Depot forever because Raya grew up we didn't have options it was Home Depot or no Depot so I'm just really used to their store and products what you do is you just sprinkle it just like as if you're raking your grass right you throw it up against the wall and this step is formulated it instantly bonds with that light drywall compound okay and it will bond to it and then you can sweep so it doesn't go up in the air all right if I sweep compound regular you see all the dust floating around did you see it if I sweep it with the red dust you're not kicking anything up in the air all right that whole bag will last the entire job so 15 20 bucks whatever it is to not be kicking that dust up brilliant invention the other thing you can do is you're gonna open your window and you can shove a fan in it okay the best defense you have against dust in your house - putting a fan in your window like this you can get these at home table for 40 bucks and they blow a ton of air that's what I do without a doubt the most intimidating project in everybody's house is the stucco ceilings everybody's worried about and we get comments every day how do I deal with my stipple ceiling what if I have asbestos should I remove it should I take it down should I go over top should I skim coat it dear Lord no skim coating that ceiling will take you more time to energy and money than doing this take your piece of drywall get yourself a lift or a couple friends okay throw some mud on it and the thicker the texture the more mud you're gonna want to have I'm just doing a quick demonstration so I think for purpose of demonstration I'm gonna cut this down to size you're gonna want to use these to install these are called drywall laminating screws and it's just like it sounds it's for sticking one sheet of drywall into another sheet of drywall when you have no idea where the framework is here's our worse you take your sheet with your compound okay you stick it under your ceiling yeah that easy and you throw these in all right now these screws will not tighten up and be pretty okay what they will do is they'll hold that sheet in place until the drywall compound dries then the next day you come back you guess it um removed the screws tape your joints fill your little holes you can put in one of these screws every couple of feet it's not necessary to put a ton of them in just make sure you're holding it in place till it's dry and you can put a brand new ceiling over top of any textured ceiling in just a couple of hours no mess no worry about asbestos mwah perfect every time and if you want to know how good that drywall mud holds trust me when I say it's not going anywhere it creates like a vacuum so here is my secret for what to do with my mud at the end of the day you've already mixed it in a pail clean down the sides okay and if you like you can even use a sponge the closer you get to the bottom the more you're going to want to have a sponge clean all the mud off okay you know nothing's perfect in this world this mud has been exposed to the air the whole time you're working and drying it you're going to put your hock on top of it as a lid and it's going to dry out a little bit more so what you do just put a layer of water on there here's your lid there's your tools okay and you're good to go the next day now the next day when you get here you don't have crusty dry mud on the pail so when you're taking your compound on you're not gonna have those hard chunks in the mud which will wreck your finish this is how you protect it so it's silky smooth all the time soapy smooth like Zohan now one of the questions we get all the time is should I buy the small tubs no I always buy it buy a big box or big pail it's not a lot of money and if you don't use it all it'll only last three or four weeks after you've opened it up and started using it okay it's not a big deal you can make your own compound and put it in a pail and store it like this in the last three weeks bottom line is you want to make sure that your mud is in perfect condition for doing the job now listen guys we've got other great drywall videos that help you with a

questions I've been getting on our channel about drywall and repairs and home maintenance and I have a simple message to tell you don't worry about it it's just drywall so in today's video I'm gonna show you all the tips and tricks that learn from my past years of working on the construction site now to fix messes like this messes like this gaps and cracks unevenness holes oil paint transition when you put your drywall in backwards how to cover up stucco ceilings and different kinds of scenarios where you've got texture on the roof there is a lot of information out there that can be really simply applied to solve your problems but if you're intimidated with touching your drywall that you're gonna be too creative and do something risky for instance if you want to know if you have a leaking plumbing valve don't be afraid to open a huge hole in the back of the closet take a look it's so easy to replace and repair drywall we're gonna show you all the steps today to take the fear out of been opening up your walls and solving your problems number one if you have a hole and you've got to repair it the easiest way to do it without damaging your house cutting your electrical circuits cutting a hole in your plumbing take your often knife okay you can get on Amazon just follow our link in the description you set it to just a little bit more than 1/2 inch okay and you want to cut the hole wider than the damage because impact damage always is bigger on the back side of the drywall than the front it's kind of like a hollow-point bullet it doesn't look too bad up front but it's not designed to make a big mess on the front right here we go all right and you want to just run a couple of passes until you're all the way through piece of cake because once you've got a square hole it's easy to patch it now if you've seen some of our other videos you've probably seen this already but this is such a great technique it's worth revisiting this is called the California patch and what I'm doing is I'm just eyeballing to cut a piece of drywall a couple inches wider in both directions so that'll cover my hole okay what I'm gonna do line it up take my knife just inside the cut and I'm gonna score the brown paper from the backside it's both sides and we're gonna do the same here and we're gonna try to give ourselves a little bit of room to work with cuz you only want to do this once it's okay if it's a little smaller than the hole break it and then hold them and then peel it from the paper leaving the paper on the front this makes the perfect patch one of the most amazing benefits is at the white paper on the front of the drywall is thinner than the drywall tape that you would buyer to patch it with so it actually creates a lot less work when you go to finish you're gonna take your drywall compound and you can buy this in a variety of different ways if you're a homeowner you're just doing one repair you can get in a little tub if you're gonna buy just a little bit I would recommend buying the powder by the 45 or the 90 mix up for yourself because then you'll always have it on hand you get real good value it's only ten bucks for a huge bag and the other stuff that you buy in the little tubs generally is really difficult to sand it's gonna drive you crazy now you take a little bit of mud and the idea here is to leave it on the inside of that framing that of the cut okay doesn't work too well in the top ever but here we go here we go alright and then all the way around take it and we're gonna put a little bit on the inside edges of all the rope as well and we're just gonna press it in if you find it not going in all the way maybe there's a little bit of restriction just use your knife to level off the corners and then press the tape in you're just embedding the drywall tape and you want to do this just once okay if you work it too much it's gonna wrinkle because of the moisture and it'll cause you all kinds of pain so get it in wipe off the extra mud and walk away after that's dry you can come back and do another coat and it should be done with a four by ten knife like this alright and I know it's not dry yet so bear with me okay and use outward pressure on the top pull it nice and tight and then come through the middle at the end all right if you let it dry between coats sometimes a second application with this knife is all you're gonna need so you don't have to do it over and over and over again you don't have to sand it between coats just let it set up less is more pull it tight and flat and you'll be happy every single time the second situation I see a lot of people commenting about is they need to check their and do an inspection on their valve or they want to change the valve from the backside if you want to do an inspection anywhere in your house let's say there's sharkbite valves and maybe you think might be dripping or something like that you can buy one of these spring-loaded trap door okay they work great and the idea is the hole that you have on the wall needs to be as big as this framework here plus some distance for this to tie in and put some compression on so what I generally try to do this isn't 8x8 but I'll try to cut the hole so that it's about that big nice and square so here we go not I'm not big enough here and you can use a drywall saw for this and you can cut the hole bigger than you need okay [Music] it only cost six bucks and all we do to set this in is put pressure on the single tab first because it will slide and you push it over and you rest this in and it's snaps back in place now if this is down on the wall by the toilet or if this is in the ceiling of your basement or if this is in the closet on the back wall nobody cares you can put these in all day long you can even paint them the same color as the wall or the ceiling it's very standard you can also use the same trapdoor in the ceiling in the basement for shutoff valves and pipes in different situations or clean outs for your sink island whatever have you so don't be intimidated if you need to have access to the area behind drywall cut a hole stick in a cover because it's that easy to take off and it looks just pretty good the next the next trick I'm going to show you is actually it answers a few different questions what do I do to fill big gaps what about if I'm going from a new wall to an old wall and there's lots of damage or it's lath and plaster and there's lots of damage okay or if the old wall is a different thickness these situations are all taken care of if you own one of these guns having a foam gun gives you lots of control I'm going to just get this started here here we go turn the trigger really low and you can feel just about any gap or crack exactly the amount of foam that you're going to need now if it's really nasty you can overfill it it doesn't matter because what this does this sets up in about 15 or 20 minutes okay and you might find that this is a great alternative to using 45-minute drywall compound all right if you already have this tool it's really handy it does a great job and it becomes the backing remember we're just adding mud and the surface this becomes the backing it also is an adhesive between the different material so you don't get cracks you don't need to apply any paper that's amazing so one of the questions I get is a lot of people their first time renovators they've done all the installation they're down to their last piece of drywall it's not quite big enough to fit or you've got a big gap in the ceiling because you're in an old house like mine and the ceiling has a bit of a ball to it and you can't install everything square and level so again take about the foam open it up pretty healthy shoot it at the corner so it has something to hit and it'll expand in and out of that corner and don't worry about how much of a mess it makes remember the goal here is that when that's done drying its expanded in behind got solid so you can trim off the face and have a backing to do your taping now we're gonna go up to the top of the ceiling where I did this yesterday and I'll show you how it looks so the secret here is we're trading backing right so open up your blade so I this tough to boat where do you think the depth is all right and we've been sawing action and then just gently trim it across there okay and then you can clean it up nice and tight all right now I'm only gonna demonstrate just a little bit less I'll go right into the corners I actually do need this to be finished today okay I'm happy with that it's not looks pretty nasty but it's ready to be worked with so I'm just gonna tape out the joint here a little bit real quick now when you've got a scenario like this I've actually got about an inch gap from where the drywall finished till the ceiling and the ceiling doesn't make it all the way into the corner it's a nasty mess and I made it a nasty mess on purpose to show you how easy it is to fix there we go run your mud off the side of this knife here no this foam does not react to the compound this isn't gonna melt it or affect it at all okay yeah got to keep the dirt out of your mud yeah I'm just gonna go what I call flat taping flat taping flat taping is the process of just going on one surface I'm not going around the corner and you can push that up as nice tight as you want okay and then we'll press it in now that we've got that pressed in you don't have to wait till tomorrow to come back to fix it here's one other trick when you're taping with much you can do multiple layers of mud and paper it's okay you can sandwich it as long as you give it time to dry before you come back the next time to fiddle around with it okay try to keep your mud in the middle of your hock the whole time you're working all right now we're gonna apply them under the ceiling catch your drips try to work as clean as possible okay there we go and then again off the side of the knife we're gonna snowplow it right in there okay just pretend that that paper and bud there it wasn't a tear of previously and I measure off a piece of tape gonna get a nice straight edge pre fold it there we go we have a nice flat surface up top so I'm gonna use that to trust my line gentle pressure all the way across okay painting the edge one more pass that's good now hold the knife flat against the wall cuz if you are ain't too loosey-goosey with it you'll just push everything in and make a mess there we go IMAX zoom in there and tell me if that corner doesn't look perfect now if you want to save even more time and you're comfortable with using your knife you can go back over top and you can apply the inside corner of the forage application right over that paper tape alright and then the next time you come back all you'll need to do is a six inch knife just to make sure that it's perfectly smooth and feathered oh all right done it's not that tricky anybody can do this the next issue you're gonna run into is I get questions like this all the time hey I got a rusty nail or a rusty staple or residue from tape or oops I was doing a weird angle and I installed the drywall backwards and I see the brown paper can i tape over that and the answer is yes of course but you have to prep it first you need to use a Primus so here we go I've got tape let's get this out of here okay well the tapes gone but I still got that red stuff left got broke a poor showing I've got dark pencil I don't care even if it's marker there is one solution for all your problems and if you're taping your house you've got to have this can on you at all times pom pom yeah if you're a fan of the channel you've seen me use it before I put this on everything okay brown paper no problem oil-based primer red tape no problem oil-based primer marker no problem oil-based primer with the pigment look at that this just disappearing I'm doing an infomercial here oil-based primer works on everything let's say you have an old house with laughs and plaster and oil paint kills you can buy it in a can and roll it on the wall they even have an odorless formula of an oil primer just for transitioning from oil to latex so that you don't have your paint peeling off over time if you're ever stuck and you were in trouble and you don't know how to solve a problem think oil-based primer and then all of your new muds and compounds will bond to it if you use oil-based primer over plaster new drywall compound will bond to that so you don't have to go to the buy plaster and mix it up yourself saves a lot of time and money this is money in the bank and before anybody starts putting it in the comment section no kills did not sponsor this video I just love the stuff okay let's move on I don't need the tape here anymore now we're gonna get away from the traditional drywall compound we're gonna get into the quick-set mud we're gonna show you everything that it can do here's another one of the most popular questions out there I can't find sheetrock for five anywhere what do I get this is a CGC company that means Canadian gypsum corporation trade from the United States you're gonna find a u.s. G which is United States gypsum okay they make a forty five mix as well this is not proprietary technology all right it's really basic stuff so 45 here is 45 there it's the same stuff just a different supplier we have border issues right so okay I'll just get along all right then what we're gonna do with the powder of course and a lot of you might have seen this alright so we're gonna just do a quick short version of this we're gonna make a lot of volcano on the hawk and I don't know sometimes it's easier to move the hawk than the knife all right volcano time here we go the higher the walls the easier it is to control everything okay now I'm using hot water if you want your coat 45 minute mud to set super fast so you can keep on working use hot water throw a little salt in it right this is a chemical reaction we're dealing with now so basic science grade eight heat plus salt changes all the chemical reactions and speeds things up so we're gonna go add my hot water Oh making a mess this is not the way the demonstrations supposed to work better close that up got a dam up the hole alright got it to do to do I'm gonna sprinkle it in of course and try not to have another dam break on us but it happens here we go doesn't have to go over the top sometimes it start leaking from underneath if you want to you can go with a little bit less water until you know you've got it under control but I found with this hot water and you've really just got to be able to move and manage the mess and it's worth paying for here we go ready now we're gonna go for it we're gonna go making a mess that's okay construction site yeah that's okay we're not gonna worry about it because this reaction happens so fast that if I don't move and get it done by the time I'm done fiddling around it'll ought to be red rock hard try to mix it somewhat smooth this is a race against time here we go and it's already turning into a hard pace now just for fun we're gonna come back after this brief brief word from our sponsors we don't have a sponsor or am I talking about I'm just saying it's not yet yeah I know it's gonna happen that quick give it about 60 seconds okay so now we're back we have only been a couple minutes and to be honest it's not completely hard but it is setup okay it's stiff enough that I can work with and I'm just gonna cover this now with my regular compound and it won't end up blending together and peeling out of the hole and when this is dry it's not gonna shrink or expand or do anything crazy like that on you you can do all this at the same time all right I mean is this mud my goodness it's a little loosey-goosey what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put paper tape majority on the old wall all right and I'm pressing it on the original hard surface and now I'm just gonna set it into the soft with a little bit of pressure and then I'll watch the mud just rising away from the tape and that's how I know that I've embedded it I don't have a ridge from the mud I haven't embedded it and it will bubble there we go you remember earlier we talked about that we can use expansion foam and it bridges the gap and it seals it together so you don't need the paper tape you should use the tape anyway if you're using the 45 you have to use the tape all right again we're just gonna come down and set this up with a nice new layer mud and we're gonna embed it on the surface here now nice force here on the original drywall okay and what we're trying to do is eliminate the action of having too much blood stuck in behind the basement we don't want to raise the surface off too much now we're going to just press those two pieces of paper together that are floating over that mud in the middle okay look at that it used to be a nasty mess is now really well embedded together and if you see any areas where the paper tape looks like it's coming apart just get your knife in there put a little mud follow it up make sure the surface is nice and wet so that it doesn't bubble so okay while you're working you can always use the pail as a table okay so we're getting close to the end of all of the questions I've still got one two I got three more things to show you but before I do my floor is creaky I've got to screw that down oh yeah let me just address this one issue if you have dents remember drywall is just dust compressed between papers so if you have a dent if it's dented on the surface it's also dented on the backside it doesn't get compressed it gets moved and that's fine because dents can be adjusted simply like that you don't even think twice about them just fill them and go unless they're big enough that they've actually broken through the backside my rule is this if it's not bigger than one and a half inches it's not concerned about all right you don't need tape you don't have to fuss with it just fill it and you'll be fine now getting back to this all right once this is filled you got to treat this like a butt joint you want to fill this side and then you want to fill this side okay and by Phil meaning pressure on the outside here and pressure on the outside here I think it'd take a little bit of mud and run it right down the middle with a fair amount of pressure and here's a secret will be even it be don't touch it again let that's right completely what we've done now is we've set the depth of the wall to this point this Ridge simply means that I have to fill a little bit here and a little bit here to get this nice and smooth this Ridge actually becomes your guide line now tomorrow when it's dry I can come back and I can use my four inch knife just scrape off that Ridge all right and I'll start in the middle with a thin coat and I'll be using pressure going the outside if you want to know how to actually finish a butt joint properly you can click the link to this video here we've done some information on this series previously and it'll go through all of you how to fill corners and do it all that sort of thing when to use the 45 minute mud versus the other it's a great video I think you're gonna like it and one other thing I'm not going to cover today is nail pops we've got a great video on nail pops we call them nail pops if it's a nail or a screw so don't get offended if you have one or the other it's all the same business and it's all dealt with in the same manner if it's a nail hammered in a little bit if it's a screw you screw it in a little bit but follow all that information in the card up in the corner okay yeah let's get on to the next two things that are going to be life savers on your job site so the next thing that people get intimidated about dealing with drywall is the mess and rightly so because drywall dust is actually lighter than air it seems right it goes everywhere there are two things you can do to manage your mess well actually three one you can clean as you go resist the temptation to sweep unless you but this this is what we call drywall sweeping compound all right and there are a couple of different companies that make this stuff one of them makes it green one of them makes it red I buy this stuff because it's available on my local Home Depot and the truth is I've been shopping Home Depot forever because Raya grew up we didn't have options it was Home Depot or no Depot so I'm just really used to their store and products what you do is you just sprinkle it just like as if you're raking your grass right you throw it up against the wall and this step is formulated it instantly bonds with that light drywall compound okay and it will bond to it and then you can sweep so it doesn't go up in the air all right if I sweep compound regular you see all the dust floating around did you see it if I sweep it with the red dust you're not kicking anything up in the air all right that whole bag will last the entire job so 15 20 bucks whatever it is to not be kicking that dust up brilliant invention the other thing you can do is you're gonna open your window and you can shove a fan in it okay the best defense you have against dust in your house - putting a fan in your window like this you can get these at home table for 40 bucks and they blow a ton of air that's what I do without a doubt the most intimidating project in everybody's house is the stucco ceilings everybody's worried about and we get comments every day how do I deal with my stipple ceiling what if I have asbestos should I remove it should I take it down should I go over top should I skim coat it dear Lord no skim coating that ceiling will take you more time to energy and money than doing this take your piece of drywall get yourself a lift or a couple friends okay throw some mud on it and the thicker the texture the more mud you're gonna want to have I'm just doing a quick demonstration so I think for purpose of demonstration I'm gonna cut this down to size you're gonna want to use these to install these are called drywall laminating screws and it's just like it sounds it's for sticking one sheet of drywall into another sheet of drywall when you have no idea where the framework is here's our worse you take your sheet with your compound okay you stick it under your ceiling yeah that easy and you throw these in all right now these screws will not tighten up and be pretty okay what they will do is they'll hold that sheet in place until the drywall compound dries then the next day you come back you guess it um removed the screws tape your joints fill your little holes you can put in one of these screws every couple of feet it's not necessary to put a ton of them in just make sure you're holding it in place till it's dry and you can put a brand new ceiling over top of any textured ceiling in just a couple of hours no mess no worry about asbestos mwah perfect every time and if you want to know how good that drywall mud holds trust me when I say it's not going anywhere it creates like a vacuum so here is my secret for what to do with my mud at the end of the day you've already mixed it in a pail clean down the sides okay and if you like you can even use a sponge the closer you get to the bottom the more you're going to want to have a sponge clean all the mud off okay you know nothing's perfect in this world this mud has been exposed to the air the whole time you're working and drying it you're going to put your hock on top of it as a lid and it's going to dry out a little bit more so what you do just put a layer of water on there here's your lid there's your tools okay and you're good to go the next day now the next day when you get here you don't have crusty dry mud on the pail so when you're taking your compound on you're not gonna have those hard chunks in the mud which will wreck your finish this is how you protect it so it's silky smooth all the time soapy smooth like Zohan now one of the questions we get all the time is should I buy the small tubs no I always buy it buy a big box or big pail it's not a lot of money and if you don't use it all it'll only last three or four weeks after you've opened it up and started using it okay it's not a big deal you can make your own compound and put it in a pail and store it like this in the last three weeks bottom line is you want to make sure that your mud is in perfect condition for doing the job now listen guys we've got other great drywall videos that help you with a

Videos Using AI #aitools #bestaitools 42 comments hey guys Jason here I'm using tons of AI tools every day in my business and I'm testing out new ones every single week so today I want to share with you guys five AI tools that I recently found that surprisingly not many people know about but really powerful so let's dive into the first one so the first tool here is called napkin AI so I recently came across this tool and for anybody that creates content this is really mind-blowing so the idea here is that you can just type in a line of prompt and it will automatically create diagrams flowcharts Graphics uh that you can use in your videos blog posts newsletters or just anything that you publish online and this AI tool makes it incredibly easy and the best part about this is that it's still in beta so it's completely free to use I don't know how long that's going to last though so I would jump in right now so I'm going to show you what this can do for you so how this works is that you first paste in your text and you click generate and it will turn that text into visuals and then you have a bunch of options to change the icons colors fonts things like that so I'm going to give you real example here so you can just go ahead and click on get napkin free and once you're in you can just click on this button here and you have two different options you can either draft it with AI or create a blank napkin now I'm going to choose this one here cuz I have my own text already now for this example I'm going to use a timeline on Tesla's product milestones and so I just got this information from the internet and just going to give you an example based on this data here so I'm going to move this here and then I'll just click on this blue button here to generate now in just a few seconds it's generated some visuals for us wow you really have a few options here and all of these look really good but I kind of want a timeline based visual so I'm going to look for that so this is the one and I can click on more Styles here to give me more visuals more Graphics so let's say I like this one I'm just going to click on this now you can also change all the icons here by clicking on each item and you can change it from a lot of these different options here you can change the colors change the icons you can change basically any element that you see here now I'm going to give you another example here so I'm going to create a new napkin so let's say I'm writing an article about Uber's market share and I got this information in Wikipedia so I'm just going to select all this and generate visuals wow this looks amazing right so you got all this different styles that you can choose from and maybe if I like this one I just click on this and again you can change all the elements here all the font sizes or the colors or the different icons but once you're happy with this you can click download here and it will just save it to your computer as a PNG so if you want a background to be off as well gives you a transparent file so you can paste it into your newsletter or your website or even a YouTube video right so I think a couple use cases here if you are a freelancer and maybe you're writing blogs newsletters or even editing YouTube videos it makes your work stand out and with the help of this tool it doesn't even take much of your time right cuz this would have taken me like two to three hours to design all this with canva but it just took me a couple seconds with napkin AI right and speaking on canva I can see canva just adding this feature into the platform cuz I think all this is just a feature that can easily be integrated into the platform or maybe they'll get bought out by canva one day who knows now the next little that I want to show you is even crazier because when you give it an input it doesn't just create a visual but it generates an entire presentation for you and this is called gamma AI so this AI tool does a lot of things not just create presentations but it can also create social media post landing pages and you can even turn your existing notes into presentations so let's give it a try I'm just going to try it for free and log in so once you're in you have three different options here you can paste in from your text you can generate from a single line of prompt or you can import a file or a URL from your existing notes so I'm going to choose this middle option here now for the topic I'm going to ask SK it to create a presentation on how to become a content creator on YouTube and make sure it's presentation and you can just hit generate outline and once you do that it will come up with all the outline of the presentation I think looking at this it looks prettyy on point to me all the topics and if you look up here this is something called cards which is basically like slides on PowerPoint so if you have the free version you get a limited number of cards maybe like eight or 10 but if you have the Premium plan you get a lot more cards okay so there are a bit more settings down here but I'm just going to leave everything as default because I just want to show you guys how powerful this tool really is so I'm just going to hit continue here now it's asking me to pick a theme here for the presentation so I'm just going to probably click on this one and just hit generate now as you can see it's generating everything in real time just look at that and I was actually blown away by this when I first tried it and keep in mind that it's creating all this from just one line of prompt that's crazy isn't it I mean just look at this detail here from the images all the headings if you go up here it even gives you an introduction here now obviously you can change every element here like all the images and the the headings the text you can replace them with anything that you like or even if you have created some visuals on napkin AI you can also bring it here but I just think that this is so impressive that it's able to complete 80 90% of the work for you and you just need to change all the elements I'm going to give you guys another example but this time I'm going to create a website instead of a presentation so if you go back to this page you just click on generate again but this time you want to pick web page and maybe I want to create a photography website portfolio website for I don't know Json Lee Design and then hit continue here or generate outline and again all the cards are automatically populated here now instead of slid these are basically sections of a website so I'm not going to change anything but you can move this around if you like like if you want this about me page to be on the bottom you can do that here okay now I'm just going to hit continue so it's creating everything in real time here uh I think the beauty about this is that you don't have to think of like which color palette suits well you know it's bringing in everything for you automatically and you can even change change the theme after it's generated the website so if you click on any of these let's say I want it to be a bit more professional maybe I click on this one here and then it will just change everything right so if I want a light theme here I can just click on light here and maybe I'll just pick this one here and it will change everything automatically so I do think that this is really handy if you guys do any type of freelance work like a copywriter or a video editor you want to create a portfolio website but you don't want to spend that much time designing the website I think this will save you a lot of time cuz it will build the entire structure of the website all the image placeholders here so you just need to change the text and the images cuz what takes a lot of time is trying to adjust every single element here and figuring out which colors are best suited for your type of branding so it does everything for you basically now in terms of pricing gamma has a free plan and you can immediately get 400 credits to test out your presentation or websites and just for contact landing page that I just created took me about 40 credits so if you upgrade to the plan it's $8 here and I think to be honest it's very inexpensive compared to many of the AI tools out there and with this Premium plan you basically get unlimited AI creation so try this out for yourself and let me know in the comments guys if you like this app now the next tool actually surprised me but before I show you that I want to introduce you to this tool called Neo who is kindly sponsoring this video so with any business that you guys start you're going to need a professional domain and an email address that matches your business domain cuz a brand domain looks just more professional than a Gmail or a Hotmail account and you also need a website to Showcase your products or service and this tool Neo does all of that for you so let me first show you guys how easy it is to set up a domain here and an email address so if you guys click on the link below it will bring you to this page and you can click on get started for free and I'm just going to click I need a new domain name get new domain and I'm just going to type in maybe Json online growth and check if it's available perfect so I'm going to click get domain now I'm going to create a username here maybe hello and I'm going to set a password and create mailbox and I can also add additional accounts for team members so for example I can create one for my colleague Tom maybe and click continue now if you need a website Neo can also create an entire website using AI but before I show you that I want to quickly show you Neo's pricing plan so the pricing plan starts at $1.99 a month and obviously you get more features with the standard plan but if you want to take this seriously you can go with a Max plan here at $7.99 a month cuz with this plan you get the calendar bookings you can get an AI email writer and advanced mail tracking and just a lot more features so you don't need another subscription cuz everything is pretty much here and it's definitely a lot more affordable than Google's business plans especially when this tool even builds the entire website for you so let's go back and try the website builder so I'm just going to click on this button here on Apper and then click here I'm going to enter the website name Jason online growth and for description how to grow your online business and I hit enter and just in about 30 seconds the a I generates the entire website and from the dashboard I can make changes I can add more details update my logo upload images or even include a call Scheduling button and I can also change the design of the website using templates here so I think this was pretty quick and it looks quite professional so instead of having to subscribe to many different tools I think Neo gives you everything like the domain website builder a business email and a lot more for just the fraction of the cost now you guys can try all of this for free but when you're ready I have a special link that gives you an additional 20% off of all these plans thanks again Neo for sponsoring this video now the third tool here is called Adobe Express now everybody knows Adobe the company behind Photoshop and premere pro but as we all know canva is stealing a lot of Adobes market share right now and most people don't know this but canva has about 180 million monthly active users right now while Adobe only has about 30 million so they are six times bigger which is insane so Adobe Express is actually their answer to steal back on the market share from canva and I was actually playing around with this stool for a while and I think there are some features that are really amazing which canva doesn't have and I'm going to show you what that is so if you're on the homepage here you can choose what you want to do you can create banners social media posts like Instagram story or Tik Tok video or if you want to create a flyer or resum or a poster or a presentation they've got a bunch of templates you can start with but what I really want to show you guys is the AI tool here that can help you edit photos so I'm just going to click on this purple button here so I'm going to start with a square template here and I'm just going to resize it it to fit the whole screen now if you notice this is a square photo so let's say I want to make this landscape meaning I want to expand this to the left and to the right so I can actually ask the AI to expand this image for me so I can just click on the image here and click resize and there's a option here called generative expand which will get the AI to actually expand this image for us so make sure that this is ticked and also you want to maybe indicate a size so I would do 1920 by 1080 and just down here you click size and just in a couple minutes it will just expand the image for you wow look at that it looks really clean right and of course gives you a couple of options here so you can choose from any of these and if you're not happy with the results you can click and generate more and it will do more for you I think this one looks pretty good so I'm just going to click keep so if you guys are a Photoshop user you're probably familiar with this generative expand tool but now it's available onbi Express now there's more cool tricks that you can do with this image so let's say I want to remove objects from the image I can do that as well so let's say I want to remove this small boat here so I can just click the image again and I click on remove object and just brush over that image that or the object that you want to remove and click remove here and just like that it's gone right or maybe instead of removing you want to add something right so I'm just going to hit this card here so I'm going to click on insert object and let's say you want to add I don't know a whale maybe right and again you're going to use a brush to indicate where the whale is going to be so maybe I'll just brush it around this area here and I'm just going to click insert wow that looks really good and I think it looks quite real to me and again you have couple more options here see which one's the best so I think this one looks better I think the only thing I should have done is probably place it a bit deeper into the lake here so it's not too close to the side here so but I think it looks pretty real I mean you can see the water splashes and even the shadow on the water as well so yeah I mean I really like this tool for many of us who are not Advanced Photoshop users I think this could be very user friendly if you look here all the layout is very very similar to canva right now in terms of pricing I believe Adobe has Dynamic pricing which means that they offer different prices depending on where you live but if you already have a subscription to photoshop or any of the Adobe products this will be included in that subscription so you don't have to pay anything extra to get this features now the next tool that I want to talk about is a little bit creepy but it is super interesting so this tool is called rewind a I and it's basically an AI tool that records every single second of your life it sounds creepy right so rewind records everything like your screen your mic even your camera if you want right it's running in the background all day it records anything and once you want to search for something in database you can just ask it and it will pull up that information for you so for example let's say you read an article online last week but you forgot to save it so with rewind you can just type in a few words that you remember and the AI will look up that information for you now I know some developers who use it to backtrack through their coding sessions so one guy told me that he solved the bug because he could go back and see exactly what was done before everything broke and a lot of content creators are also using it to kind of capture those random moments of inspiration that usually get lost but here's what it gets really interesting so they have this new device here called the pendant it's this Sleek little device that you wear around your neck and it records every conversation so whenever you're going into a meeting or you're having a discussion in the car when you can't take notes this device captures every single thing and it's writing summaries in the back end so you'll never forget what was said in those conversations so I can definitely see use case for this cuz for me all the best ideas come when I'm probably driving or when I'm having a walk and during those times I won't be able to take notes but I definitely want to save those ideas so I think definitely useful in those scenarios but one big downside to this is privacy obviously rewind claims that everything is stored in your local machine and even they don't have access to it right but that means that it will take up a lot of your storage space now pricing wise the computer version here is $19 a month and the Limitless pendant that I just showed you is going for $99 with no subscription and I think the pendant is pretty impressive with $100 hour battery life and it's also weatherproof but yeah let me know what you guys think of this one are you guys worried about the fact that you're being recorded 247 cuz to be honest our phones are already recording our conversations anyway so I personally don't don't think this is something too crazy now the next tool here is something that I've personally been using and it's has saved me a lot of hours when I'm creating videos so this tool is called gling AI so many of us content creators on YouTube when we record our videos we make a lot of mistakes so we have pauses we say the wrong thing and I can say a sentence three to four times just to get it right so for example if I'm just trying to create a 10-minute video my raw footage could take 30 minutes cuz I make so many mistakes so what gling does for me is that it takes my Raw videos and removes all the pauses all the Ms and asss and even all the bad takes right so if I say the same sentence three times it will choose the best one and it removes the rest right and there's a lot of other apps that does this like descript or even Loom can remove silences but as of right now gling is the only one that can remove bad takes right which is huge for me so I'm going to give you an example here so I have a sample video already so I'm just going to drop it in here and maybe call it Sample video and hit continue and now you can select what you want the AI to do so I would normally just want it to clean up the silences and remove bad takes but you can also apply some jump Cuts or remove audio noise if you want to but I'm going to leave this to these two options here and hit enhance and edit so once it's done processing you can see that it actually transcribes everything which makes it so much easier for you to edit so if I see something I don't want I can just highlight it here and click on this cut button and it will just remove it from the video so I don't have have to scroll through the timeline here to edit so I think editing with text is so much easier and if you look to the right here there's something called past so this is something that you can adjust to improve the pacing of your video so if you want more Cuts or you don't mind the pauses between sentences you can set it all here and once you're done you can hit export here and now you have a couple more options if you don't want to make further edits to this video you don't want to add animations or anything like that you can just export it to a video file here or if you want to make more edits you can export as an XML file here and with these files you can easily import them into Premiere Pro or Final Cut so I usually just export it to this format and I can just send it to my editors for further processing but you know just by using gling to clean up all the footage here saves me a lot of hours of manual editing so if you're a content creator on YouTube or even Tik Tok or Instagram you don't have to worry about restarting the video after you make every single mistake you can just record everything in one go dump it into gling and it will clean it up for you all right so those are the five AI tools that I wanted to share with you guys today but there's this one tool that's been blowing up online and it's using a deep fake technology to create this super real short videos and people are making a lot of money on Tik Tok with these AI videos so if you want to check this out click on this video next and I'll see you guys there",

Videos Using AI #aitools #bestaitools 42 comments hey guys Jason here I'm using tons of AI tools every day in my business and I'm testing out new ones every single week so today I want to share with you guys five AI tools that I recently found that surprisingly not many people know about but really powerful so let's dive into the first one so the first tool here is called napkin AI so I recently came across this tool and for anybody that creates content this is really mind-blowing so the idea here is that you can just type in a line of prompt and it will automatically create diagrams flowcharts Graphics uh that you can use in your videos blog posts newsletters or just anything that you publish online and this AI tool makes it incredibly easy and the best part about this is that it's still in beta so it's completely free to use I don't know how long that's going to last though so I would jump in right now so I'm going to show you what this can do for you so how this works is that you first paste in your text and you click generate and it will turn that text into visuals and then you have a bunch of options to change the icons colors fonts things like that so I'm going to give you real example here so you can just go ahead and click on get napkin free and once you're in you can just click on this button here and you have two different options you can either draft it with AI or create a blank napkin now I'm going to choose this one here cuz I have my own text already now for this example I'm going to use a timeline on Tesla's product milestones and so I just got this information from the internet and just going to give you an example based on this data here so I'm going to move this here and then I'll just click on this blue button here to generate now in just a few seconds it's generated some visuals for us wow you really have a few options here and all of these look really good but I kind of want a timeline based visual so I'm going to look for that so this is the one and I can click on more Styles here to give me more visuals more Graphics so let's say I like this one I'm just going to click on this now you can also change all the icons here by clicking on each item and you can change it from a lot of these different options here you can change the colors change the icons you can change basically any element that you see here now I'm going to give you another example here so I'm going to create a new napkin so let's say I'm writing an article about Uber's market share and I got this information in Wikipedia so I'm just going to select all this and generate visuals wow this looks amazing right so you got all this different styles that you can choose from and maybe if I like this one I just click on this and again you can change all the elements here all the font sizes or the colors or the different icons but once you're happy with this you can click download here and it will just save it to your computer as a PNG so if you want a background to be off as well gives you a transparent file so you can paste it into your newsletter or your website or even a YouTube video right so I think a couple use cases here if you are a freelancer and maybe you're writing blogs newsletters or even editing YouTube videos it makes your work stand out and with the help of this tool it doesn't even take much of your time right cuz this would have taken me like two to three hours to design all this with canva but it just took me a couple seconds with napkin AI right and speaking on canva I can see canva just adding this feature into the platform cuz I think all this is just a feature that can easily be integrated into the platform or maybe they'll get bought out by canva one day who knows now the next little that I want to show you is even crazier because when you give it an input it doesn't just create a visual but it generates an entire presentation for you and this is called gamma AI so this AI tool does a lot of things not just create presentations but it can also create social media post landing pages and you can even turn your existing notes into presentations so let's give it a try I'm just going to try it for free and log in so once you're in you have three different options here you can paste in from your text you can generate from a single line of prompt or you can import a file or a URL from your existing notes so I'm going to choose this middle option here now for the topic I'm going to ask SK it to create a presentation on how to become a content creator on YouTube and make sure it's presentation and you can just hit generate outline and once you do that it will come up with all the outline of the presentation I think looking at this it looks prettyy on point to me all the topics and if you look up here this is something called cards which is basically like slides on PowerPoint so if you have the free version you get a limited number of cards maybe like eight or 10 but if you have the Premium plan you get a lot more cards okay so there are a bit more settings down here but I'm just going to leave everything as default because I just want to show you guys how powerful this tool really is so I'm just going to hit continue here now it's asking me to pick a theme here for the presentation so I'm just going to probably click on this one and just hit generate now as you can see it's generating everything in real time just look at that and I was actually blown away by this when I first tried it and keep in mind that it's creating all this from just one line of prompt that's crazy isn't it I mean just look at this detail here from the images all the headings if you go up here it even gives you an introduction here now obviously you can change every element here like all the images and the the headings the text you can replace them with anything that you like or even if you have created some visuals on napkin AI you can also bring it here but I just think that this is so impressive that it's able to complete 80 90% of the work for you and you just need to change all the elements I'm going to give you guys another example but this time I'm going to create a website instead of a presentation so if you go back to this page you just click on generate again but this time you want to pick web page and maybe I want to create a photography website portfolio website for I don't know Json Lee Design and then hit continue here or generate outline and again all the cards are automatically populated here now instead of slid these are basically sections of a website so I'm not going to change anything but you can move this around if you like like if you want this about me page to be on the bottom you can do that here okay now I'm just going to hit continue so it's creating everything in real time here uh I think the beauty about this is that you don't have to think of like which color palette suits well you know it's bringing in everything for you automatically and you can even change change the theme after it's generated the website so if you click on any of these let's say I want it to be a bit more professional maybe I click on this one here and then it will just change everything right so if I want a light theme here I can just click on light here and maybe I'll just pick this one here and it will change everything automatically so I do think that this is really handy if you guys do any type of freelance work like a copywriter or a video editor you want to create a portfolio website but you don't want to spend that much time designing the website I think this will save you a lot of time cuz it will build the entire structure of the website all the image placeholders here so you just need to change the text and the images cuz what takes a lot of time is trying to adjust every single element here and figuring out which colors are best suited for your type of branding so it does everything for you basically now in terms of pricing gamma has a free plan and you can immediately get 400 credits to test out your presentation or websites and just for contact landing page that I just created took me about 40 credits so if you upgrade to the plan it's $8 here and I think to be honest it's very inexpensive compared to many of the AI tools out there and with this Premium plan you basically get unlimited AI creation so try this out for yourself and let me know in the comments guys if you like this app now the next tool actually surprised me but before I show you that I want to introduce you to this tool called Neo who is kindly sponsoring this video so with any business that you guys start you're going to need a professional domain and an email address that matches your business domain cuz a brand domain looks just more professional than a Gmail or a Hotmail account and you also need a website to Showcase your products or service and this tool Neo does all of that for you so let me first show you guys how easy it is to set up a domain here and an email address so if you guys click on the link below it will bring you to this page and you can click on get started for free and I'm just going to click I need a new domain name get new domain and I'm just going to type in maybe Json online growth and check if it's available perfect so I'm going to click get domain now I'm going to create a username here maybe hello and I'm going to set a password and create mailbox and I can also add additional accounts for team members so for example I can create one for my colleague Tom maybe and click continue now if you need a website Neo can also create an entire website using AI but before I show you that I want to quickly show you Neo's pricing plan so the pricing plan starts at $1.99 a month and obviously you get more features with the standard plan but if you want to take this seriously you can go with a Max plan here at $7.99 a month cuz with this plan you get the calendar bookings you can get an AI email writer and advanced mail tracking and just a lot more features so you don't need another subscription cuz everything is pretty much here and it's definitely a lot more affordable than Google's business plans especially when this tool even builds the entire website for you so let's go back and try the website builder so I'm just going to click on this button here on Apper and then click here I'm going to enter the website name Jason online growth and for description how to grow your online business and I hit enter and just in about 30 seconds the a I generates the entire website and from the dashboard I can make changes I can add more details update my logo upload images or even include a call Scheduling button and I can also change the design of the website using templates here so I think this was pretty quick and it looks quite professional so instead of having to subscribe to many different tools I think Neo gives you everything like the domain website builder a business email and a lot more for just the fraction of the cost now you guys can try all of this for free but when you're ready I have a special link that gives you an additional 20% off of all these plans thanks again Neo for sponsoring this video now the third tool here is called Adobe Express now everybody knows Adobe the company behind Photoshop and premere pro but as we all know canva is stealing a lot of Adobes market share right now and most people don't know this but canva has about 180 million monthly active users right now while Adobe only has about 30 million so they are six times bigger which is insane so Adobe Express is actually their answer to steal back on the market share from canva and I was actually playing around with this stool for a while and I think there are some features that are really amazing which canva doesn't have and I'm going to show you what that is so if you're on the homepage here you can choose what you want to do you can create banners social media posts like Instagram story or Tik Tok video or if you want to create a flyer or resum or a poster or a presentation they've got a bunch of templates you can start with but what I really want to show you guys is the AI tool here that can help you edit photos so I'm just going to click on this purple button here so I'm going to start with a square template here and I'm just going to resize it it to fit the whole screen now if you notice this is a square photo so let's say I want to make this landscape meaning I want to expand this to the left and to the right so I can actually ask the AI to expand this image for me so I can just click on the image here and click resize and there's a option here called generative expand which will get the AI to actually expand this image for us so make sure that this is ticked and also you want to maybe indicate a size so I would do 1920 by 1080 and just down here you click size and just in a couple minutes it will just expand the image for you wow look at that it looks really clean right and of course gives you a couple of options here so you can choose from any of these and if you're not happy with the results you can click and generate more and it will do more for you I think this one looks pretty good so I'm just going to click keep so if you guys are a Photoshop user you're probably familiar with this generative expand tool but now it's available onbi Express now there's more cool tricks that you can do with this image so let's say I want to remove objects from the image I can do that as well so let's say I want to remove this small boat here so I can just click the image again and I click on remove object and just brush over that image that or the object that you want to remove and click remove here and just like that it's gone right or maybe instead of removing you want to add something right so I'm just going to hit this card here so I'm going to click on insert object and let's say you want to add I don't know a whale maybe right and again you're going to use a brush to indicate where the whale is going to be so maybe I'll just brush it around this area here and I'm just going to click insert wow that looks really good and I think it looks quite real to me and again you have couple more options here see which one's the best so I think this one looks better I think the only thing I should have done is probably place it a bit deeper into the lake here so it's not too close to the side here so but I think it looks pretty real I mean you can see the water splashes and even the shadow on the water as well so yeah I mean I really like this tool for many of us who are not Advanced Photoshop users I think this could be very user friendly if you look here all the layout is very very similar to canva right now in terms of pricing I believe Adobe has Dynamic pricing which means that they offer different prices depending on where you live but if you already have a subscription to photoshop or any of the Adobe products this will be included in that subscription so you don't have to pay anything extra to get this features now the next tool that I want to talk about is a little bit creepy but it is super interesting so this tool is called rewind a I and it's basically an AI tool that records every single second of your life it sounds creepy right so rewind records everything like your screen your mic even your camera if you want right it's running in the background all day it records anything and once you want to search for something in database you can just ask it and it will pull up that information for you so for example let's say you read an article online last week but you forgot to save it so with rewind you can just type in a few words that you remember and the AI will look up that information for you now I know some developers who use it to backtrack through their coding sessions so one guy told me that he solved the bug because he could go back and see exactly what was done before everything broke and a lot of content creators are also using it to kind of capture those random moments of inspiration that usually get lost but here's what it gets really interesting so they have this new device here called the pendant it's this Sleek little device that you wear around your neck and it records every conversation so whenever you're going into a meeting or you're having a discussion in the car when you can't take notes this device captures every single thing and it's writing summaries in the back end so you'll never forget what was said in those conversations so I can definitely see use case for this cuz for me all the best ideas come when I'm probably driving or when I'm having a walk and during those times I won't be able to take notes but I definitely want to save those ideas so I think definitely useful in those scenarios but one big downside to this is privacy obviously rewind claims that everything is stored in your local machine and even they don't have access to it right but that means that it will take up a lot of your storage space now pricing wise the computer version here is $19 a month and the Limitless pendant that I just showed you is going for $99 with no subscription and I think the pendant is pretty impressive with $100 hour battery life and it's also weatherproof but yeah let me know what you guys think of this one are you guys worried about the fact that you're being recorded 247 cuz to be honest our phones are already recording our conversations anyway so I personally don't don't think this is something too crazy now the next tool here is something that I've personally been using and it's has saved me a lot of hours when I'm creating videos so this tool is called gling AI so many of us content creators on YouTube when we record our videos we make a lot of mistakes so we have pauses we say the wrong thing and I can say a sentence three to four times just to get it right so for example if I'm just trying to create a 10-minute video my raw footage could take 30 minutes cuz I make so many mistakes so what gling does for me is that it takes my Raw videos and removes all the pauses all the Ms and asss and even all the bad takes right so if I say the same sentence three times it will choose the best one and it removes the rest right and there's a lot of other apps that does this like descript or even Loom can remove silences but as of right now gling is the only one that can remove bad takes right which is huge for me so I'm going to give you an example here so I have a sample video already so I'm just going to drop it in here and maybe call it Sample video and hit continue and now you can select what you want the AI to do so I would normally just want it to clean up the silences and remove bad takes but you can also apply some jump Cuts or remove audio noise if you want to but I'm going to leave this to these two options here and hit enhance and edit so once it's done processing you can see that it actually transcribes everything which makes it so much easier for you to edit so if I see something I don't want I can just highlight it here and click on this cut button and it will just remove it from the video so I don't have have to scroll through the timeline here to edit so I think editing with text is so much easier and if you look to the right here there's something called past so this is something that you can adjust to improve the pacing of your video so if you want more Cuts or you don't mind the pauses between sentences you can set it all here and once you're done you can hit export here and now you have a couple more options if you don't want to make further edits to this video you don't want to add animations or anything like that you can just export it to a video file here or if you want to make more edits you can export as an XML file here and with these files you can easily import them into Premiere Pro or Final Cut so I usually just export it to this format and I can just send it to my editors for further processing but you know just by using gling to clean up all the footage here saves me a lot of hours of manual editing so if you're a content creator on YouTube or even Tik Tok or Instagram you don't have to worry about restarting the video after you make every single mistake you can just record everything in one go dump it into gling and it will clean it up for you all right so those are the five AI tools that I wanted to share with you guys today but there's this one tool that's been blowing up online and it's using a deep fake technology to create this super real short videos and people are making a lot of money on Tik Tok with these AI videos so if you want to check this out click on this video next and I'll see you guys there"

Tool on Notion #aitools #aitoolsforbusiness 22 comments hey guys Jason here today I want to share with you guys nine AI tools that I wish I found sooner so I've been using some of these on a daily basis and it has saved me countless hours and the crazy thing is that some of these tools are completely free so let's get started now the first tool here is really something that I wish I found earlier cuz if you do any kind of Zoom meetings this will save you a lot of time and this is called fathom AI so fathom is an AI tool that will record your Zoom meetings but not only that but it also take notes for you and this is super useful cuz you don't have to try to remember what was said in the meetings uh yes we already have a lot of tools that can record meetings but this tool also summarizes meetings and also take notes for you so I find this tool particularly useful when I'm having a meeting on the go so let's say I'm driving and I'm having an audio Zoom call I can't bew writing notes right so fathom will not only record but it will take notes for me and later on when I'm back in the office I can just view the meeting summary or I could even share the link to the recording directly to my client and because everything is stored in the Cloud you don't have to download the recording and send huge files to share it with somebody because anyone who has the link can instantly view the recordings and all the meeting notes and also one really cool feature here is that you can also transform the whole meeting into a Q&A format cuz if you do a lot of q&as on your calls this will be super useful because you can use that for Content later on and and the best part about this is that it is free uh I mean they do have a Premium plan but the free plan is more than enough for my use case now the next tool here is called humata AI so if you do a lot of research search whether for your work or school I think you're going to like this one so humata AI is like having a research assistant so let's say you're a student you can upload your academic papers and you can ask it specific questions right if you are a working professional you can probably upload a 50 page market report and you get answers in seconds instead of having to manually scan every page now this is where the tool gets quite interesting so unlike chat gbt humata is made to handle all types of files and it can pretty much handle anything like PDF documents ments Word documents PowerPoints right which is something that you don't see very often so let me give you a quick example here so let's say you're doing research on e-commerce Trends so I've got this three market research reports about this topic so you can just direct and drop your files here and once the AI is done processing everything you can ask it to make a summary or you can ask any question about the document now if you're going over a lot of legal documents this can also do that you can ask it to watch for things that you wouldn't have caught yourself I do sign a lot of legal documents as a Creator so this is super useful as well now the next tool that I'm going to talk about has all the basic features of humata but it's actually taking it a step further and it is also a free tool and this is notebook LM so this is tool created by Google and you guys have probably seen this before and I'm not going to just tell you that it can create a podcast but I want to show you guys one really interesting trick that nobody really covered before but before I get to that for those of you who are seeing this for the first time let's talk quickly about the basic feature of notebook LM so let's say I want to create a Content about certain top topic let's say Bitcoin which is a very Hot Topic at the moment so you go to the homepage and you have the ability to upload your sources here and this tool let you add more than one source which is good because the more sources you have the better output is going to be right so I'm going to now upload an article from Wikipedia and I'm also going to upload a PDF article on bitcoin and also a YouTube video that I found on this topic so I can just paste in the URL here all right so you can see we have three files here and they're all uploaded now once you have everything in you can ask it any question you want so for example you can ask it something like can you make a summary of what Bitcoin is now you can see that it clearly breaks down everything into a summary here so it even gives you all the sources to where it got the information from which is very good and now you can even turn this entire thing into a podcast with two people talking about Bitcoin right which is by the way is my favorite feature of notebook LM so let me play this quick sample here okay so Bitcoin you're hearing about it everywhere right we're going to take a deep dive into it try to like really understand it not just like the buzzwords but like how it really works you know yeah like down to the nuts and bolts exactly that sounds crazy right now this sounds great and all but you know I've always thought how can we use this podcast for something useful and I think I found an idea and let me know what you guys think so once you have this audio podcast you can actually download this file and use the audio to create short form content that you can later post on Instagram Tik Tok or YouTube shorts and you can use a tool like revid here so this is a AI video creation tool it is really easy to use you can just upload the audio that we just created on Notebook LM and Revit will automatically generate the visuals and also the captions and here's what I was able to create in just a few minutes coin you're hearing about it everywhere right we're going to take a deep dive into it try to like really understand it not just like the buzzwords but like how it really works you know yeah like down to the nuts and bolts exactly that's really cool isn't it so yeah let me know in the comments what you guys think about this if you have some interesting use cases for Notebook LM let me know now if you're doing any kind of writing blogging social media post or even YouTube scripting this next tool here is something that you're going to want to see and this tool is not just like chat gbt that writes your content but it also includes the citations all the sources and even can automatically embed YouTube videos in your content and this tool is called SEO writing Ai and they're kindly sponsoring this video so let me show you what this tool can do now if you use chat CPT before and ask it to write an article it will probably sound like Ai and it doesn't sound natural but this AI tool has a new feature called brand voice which will let you input your writing style and all the output is going to be in your own voice and your own writing style so let me show you quickly how this works so once you're logged in you can click on brand voice and click on new brand voice now here's where you can upload any content that you've written before or any social media content so for this example I've added my documents here now you can see that it's detected my writing style and it's now G giving you a summary of how I write so I'm just going to hit save Rand voice here now let's go back to the dashboard again and create a blog post so for today's example I'm going to be writing about AI tools right so I'm going to ask it to generate the titles here and you can just regenerate until you find the one that you like and under AI model you want to select AI Cloud 3.5 Sonet I use this personally for almost all my work cuz it sounds very natural and you want your content to be easy to read as well right so set the reading level to a fifth grade student under AI words REM removal you going click basic can add any extra details if you want like specific tool names or any key points that you want to cover so I'm going to leave this blank for now but it is super useful when you need the AI to include certain information on the article and yes you can also get the AI to embed relevant YouTube videos for your post as well and now since this is a blog post we want to make it SEO friendly as well so you can either add your own keywords or let AI handle everything right I'm going to let AI do this thing here now once you're ready to publish you just hit run and watch this in about a couple seconds you get a complete blog post so if you scroll down you can see that AI has written all the content and you see the images you even have the embedded videos here and even an FAQ section which is really good for SEO right and you can see that it also has all the sources down here which is really impressive and honestly I think one of my favorite features here is the Deep Web and citation which allows the AI to use real-time data from the internet to write the most upto-date content right and of course you can go back in there and edit anything you want but this is definitely a time saer things that would take you normally hours or even days to create it's now done just in a few minutes so if you guys want to check this out you can click on the link below and use code Json 25 for 25% off on all their plans thanks again SEO writing for sponsoring this video now the next tool is called text.com so you know many of us have different messaging platforms like Instagram WhatsApp slack telegram iMessage LinkedIn right there's so many apps to manage and sometimes it's very timeconsuming to to check every single app to see if somebody's reaching out to you now this app text.com allows you to connect everything into one platform or one inbox I should say so this will work with most popular apps you see here uh even Discord and x and just look at how clean the UI is because all your conversations here are organized by person and not by app so if somebody sends you a DM on Instagram and then also another message on WhatsApp from the same person you can see the whole conversation together so you don't have to switch around different apps to see your message mesages but here's my favorite part if somebody sends you a message in another language it gets translated instantly so I think if you're using multiple platforms for your business I think this is super useful pricing wise they do have a completely free account where you can connect to 10 different platforms but obviously with a Premium plan you can access to all their AI features now the next tool is canva AI now everyone knows canva but today I'm going to show you some new AI features that they just added that you might not know about so first I'm going to talk about their new AI image generators so if you're creating banners for your website you know sometimes it's hard to find the perfect stock photo but now canva has an AI feature where you can create the perfect stock photo so you can head over a page called dreamlabs so this is where we're going to generate this stock images I'm going to type in exactly what I want like entrepreneur working from home with a cat on their desk and when I hit create it creates a unique stock image in just seconds and obviously if you don't like the results you can regenerate again and it will give you more variation so I think this is good if you already have an existing canvas subscription and you don't want to subscribe to Mid Journey or any other tools I think everything is here already but here's what I really want to show you this feature is called Magic edit so let me show you what I can do so I'm going to go back to the home screen here and create a new design and I'm going to pick Instagram post now you have two options here you can either upload your own image or you can use whatever canva has in the library so let's go to elements here and search for pen and then click on photos I'm just going to take this one here now I'm going to resize the image to fit the screen now let's say you want to replace this pan with a pencil so all you have to do here is click on Magic edit and select that specific area and type in pencil in the text box and when you hit generate in a couple seconds you can see that now the pen is replaced by a pencil pretty cool right now what if I want to remove the pencil instead I can do that as well so I can just click on edit image in the toolbar here and I'm going to look for the erase button with the Magic One icon and all you do is brush over that pencil just like this and that's it and now the pencil's gone now of course sometimes results are not perfect but canva is constantly updating this feature so the output is going to get better and more accurate with each update but this is a feature that you can normally find in Photoshop but now it's already on canvas so you don't need another subscription to get access to this feature now this next tool is what a lot of people are already using for writing and it's called clae AI but I want to show you guys a feature within claw that I really like and it's something that I use in a daily basis now if you guys are wondering yes CLA is very similar to chat TBT but I personally like this one better because I feel like the output sounds more human and more conversational and you can even train it to write or sound like a certain person right so let me give you an example here so let's say I'm creating a new YouTube video and I want it to help script it for me now I don't usually write out the entire script for my YouTube videos but I would do it on some ideas that I have trouble articulating and it's been very helpful now in order for for it to produce the content in the way I speak I can use a feature on cloud called projects and this is where you basically input all your past videos to it and all the writing will match the way you speak now the main benefit of using projects is that it will save the instructions you give it to memory so you don't have to always remind it to use your voice every time you want to ask it to write something so to do this is very simple so for example I'm going to go to this YouTube video here so I have this tool called glasp it is a Chrome extension that allows me to transform subcribe any YouTube video so I will just scroll down here and hit the copy icon here and it will just copy the entire transcript of the video now I'm going to go back to Cloud create new project and and select add content here and I'll just paste the script right here and for the title I'll just copy and paste the title from the video as well and obviously I can add more videos the more videos the better context you're going to give Claude and now you can also set the project instructions here so I like to give it more context so I would write something like this so you're an expert in business startups solopreneur ideas Founders you will be an agent acting for me to create YouTube scripts you can also make it aoid using words that sound like AI for example like digital landscape intricate pivotal it doesn't sound natural so I usually try to avoid these words and by the way you can also add to this list over time and that's it click save you're good to go now anytime you want to ask it to write whatever you want it will write it based on your instructions so you don't have to tell it to write this way or that way cuzz everything is now in memory now obviously you can use it to write whatever you want not just YouTube scripts you can use it to help you write Instagram captions LinkedIn posts X post or even Facebook ad copy all right so the next tool here is a tool that is perfect if you are a content creator on YouTube so this is called pixels and it is an AI tool that will help you replicate viral thumbnails in just seconds and I was actually impressed on what this tool can do so let me just show you briefly how this works so let's say I found a thumbnail that I like on YouTube so so I can just copy the link of the YouTube video and paste it into pixel and you will just recreate the thumbnail with the same theme same color palette and all that right look at that looks really good right now with any thumbnail generation you got three options here you got high similarity which makes it almost identical to the original thumbnail or medium which it will change some elements but you keep the style or low which allows the AI to just take some inspiration from it now here's something that's quite insane cuz you can actually take a viral thumbnail and do a face swap as well so you can use your photo to swap out the face which is really good right and you can also now add some text to the thumbnail as well now in terms of pricing the tool cost about 20 bucks a month if you upload tons of videos a month I think it's super worth it or if you're a thumbnail designer I definitely think that this will help you a lot because you can design multiple thumbnails all at once without having to edit every element manually in Photoshop now this next tool here is something that a lot of people are already using and this is notion AI now I've been using notion for a long time now to manage all my notes even planning my videos for YouTube but there's one feature of notion AI that I really like and I'm talking about the ability for the AI to help you improve your writing so as a contact Creator I write all my scripts on notion and I also have a newsletter that I write every week so I do that on notion as well so notion AI can help me improve my writing as I'm doing it on the platform so I don't have to go to CLA chat GPT to do it notion AI can do it for me right on here right so let me give you an example here so let's say I have written an introduction par paragraph on the best AI tools maybe for my newsletter so I can select the text like this and click improve writing and just in a few seconds it took my basic sentence and made it more engaging so this is super helpful if you are writing any type of copy cuz sometimes you're thinking of you know how do I structure this sentence correctly or how do I make this more convincing or more engaging and I can even ask it to change the tone of voice here so the AI will do everything right here on this page so I think this is a great feature if you already have a paid subscription to notion so you don't have to subscribe to another app to help you WR so that's all the nine tools that I have for you guys today but if you guys want to see more tools I have a list of five more tools that I use on a daily basis so if you want to check them out click on this video here and I'll see you there",

Tool on Notion #aitools #aitoolsforbusiness 22 comments hey guys Jason here today I want to share with you guys nine AI tools that I wish I found sooner so I've been using some of these on a daily basis and it has saved me countless hours and the crazy thing is that some of these tools are completely free so let's get started now the first tool here is really something that I wish I found earlier cuz if you do any kind of Zoom meetings this will save you a lot of time and this is called fathom AI so fathom is an AI tool that will record your Zoom meetings but not only that but it also take notes for you and this is super useful cuz you don't have to try to remember what was said in the meetings uh yes we already have a lot of tools that can record meetings but this tool also summarizes meetings and also take notes for you so I find this tool particularly useful when I'm having a meeting on the go so let's say I'm driving and I'm having an audio Zoom call I can't bew writing notes right so fathom will not only record but it will take notes for me and later on when I'm back in the office I can just view the meeting summary or I could even share the link to the recording directly to my client and because everything is stored in the Cloud you don't have to download the recording and send huge files to share it with somebody because anyone who has the link can instantly view the recordings and all the meeting notes and also one really cool feature here is that you can also transform the whole meeting into a Q&A format cuz if you do a lot of q&as on your calls this will be super useful because you can use that for Content later on and and the best part about this is that it is free uh I mean they do have a Premium plan but the free plan is more than enough for my use case now the next tool here is called humata AI so if you do a lot of research search whether for your work or school I think you're going to like this one so humata AI is like having a research assistant so let's say you're a student you can upload your academic papers and you can ask it specific questions right if you are a working professional you can probably upload a 50 page market report and you get answers in seconds instead of having to manually scan every page now this is where the tool gets quite interesting so unlike chat gbt humata is made to handle all types of files and it can pretty much handle anything like PDF documents ments Word documents PowerPoints right which is something that you don't see very often so let me give you a quick example here so let's say you're doing research on e-commerce Trends so I've got this three market research reports about this topic so you can just direct and drop your files here and once the AI is done processing everything you can ask it to make a summary or you can ask any question about the document now if you're going over a lot of legal documents this can also do that you can ask it to watch for things that you wouldn't have caught yourself I do sign a lot of legal documents as a Creator so this is super useful as well now the next tool that I'm going to talk about has all the basic features of humata but it's actually taking it a step further and it is also a free tool and this is notebook LM so this is tool created by Google and you guys have probably seen this before and I'm not going to just tell you that it can create a podcast but I want to show you guys one really interesting trick that nobody really covered before but before I get to that for those of you who are seeing this for the first time let's talk quickly about the basic feature of notebook LM so let's say I want to create a Content about certain top topic let's say Bitcoin which is a very Hot Topic at the moment so you go to the homepage and you have the ability to upload your sources here and this tool let you add more than one source which is good because the more sources you have the better output is going to be right so I'm going to now upload an article from Wikipedia and I'm also going to upload a PDF article on bitcoin and also a YouTube video that I found on this topic so I can just paste in the URL here all right so you can see we have three files here and they're all uploaded now once you have everything in you can ask it any question you want so for example you can ask it something like can you make a summary of what Bitcoin is now you can see that it clearly breaks down everything into a summary here so it even gives you all the sources to where it got the information from which is very good and now you can even turn this entire thing into a podcast with two people talking about Bitcoin right which is by the way is my favorite feature of notebook LM so let me play this quick sample here okay so Bitcoin you're hearing about it everywhere right we're going to take a deep dive into it try to like really understand it not just like the buzzwords but like how it really works you know yeah like down to the nuts and bolts exactly that sounds crazy right now this sounds great and all but you know I've always thought how can we use this podcast for something useful and I think I found an idea and let me know what you guys think so once you have this audio podcast you can actually download this file and use the audio to create short form content that you can later post on Instagram Tik Tok or YouTube shorts and you can use a tool like revid here so this is a AI video creation tool it is really easy to use you can just upload the audio that we just created on Notebook LM and Revit will automatically generate the visuals and also the captions and here's what I was able to create in just a few minutes coin you're hearing about it everywhere right we're going to take a deep dive into it try to like really understand it not just like the buzzwords but like how it really works you know yeah like down to the nuts and bolts exactly that's really cool isn't it so yeah let me know in the comments what you guys think about this if you have some interesting use cases for Notebook LM let me know now if you're doing any kind of writing blogging social media post or even YouTube scripting this next tool here is something that you're going to want to see and this tool is not just like chat gbt that writes your content but it also includes the citations all the sources and even can automatically embed YouTube videos in your content and this tool is called SEO writing Ai and they're kindly sponsoring this video so let me show you what this tool can do now if you use chat CPT before and ask it to write an article it will probably sound like Ai and it doesn't sound natural but this AI tool has a new feature called brand voice which will let you input your writing style and all the output is going to be in your own voice and your own writing style so let me show you quickly how this works so once you're logged in you can click on brand voice and click on new brand voice now here's where you can upload any content that you've written before or any social media content so for this example I've added my documents here now you can see that it's detected my writing style and it's now G giving you a summary of how I write so I'm just going to hit save Rand voice here now let's go back to the dashboard again and create a blog post so for today's example I'm going to be writing about AI tools right so I'm going to ask it to generate the titles here and you can just regenerate until you find the one that you like and under AI model you want to select AI Cloud 3.5 Sonet I use this personally for almost all my work cuz it sounds very natural and you want your content to be easy to read as well right so set the reading level to a fifth grade student under AI words REM removal you going click basic can add any extra details if you want like specific tool names or any key points that you want to cover so I'm going to leave this blank for now but it is super useful when you need the AI to include certain information on the article and yes you can also get the AI to embed relevant YouTube videos for your post as well and now since this is a blog post we want to make it SEO friendly as well so you can either add your own keywords or let AI handle everything right I'm going to let AI do this thing here now once you're ready to publish you just hit run and watch this in about a couple seconds you get a complete blog post so if you scroll down you can see that AI has written all the content and you see the images you even have the embedded videos here and even an FAQ section which is really good for SEO right and you can see that it also has all the sources down here which is really impressive and honestly I think one of my favorite features here is the Deep Web and citation which allows the AI to use real-time data from the internet to write the most upto-date content right and of course you can go back in there and edit anything you want but this is definitely a time saer things that would take you normally hours or even days to create it's now done just in a few minutes so if you guys want to check this out you can click on the link below and use code Json 25 for 25% off on all their plans thanks again SEO writing for sponsoring this video now the next tool is called text.com so you know many of us have different messaging platforms like Instagram WhatsApp slack telegram iMessage LinkedIn right there's so many apps to manage and sometimes it's very timeconsuming to to check every single app to see if somebody's reaching out to you now this app text.com allows you to connect everything into one platform or one inbox I should say so this will work with most popular apps you see here uh even Discord and x and just look at how clean the UI is because all your conversations here are organized by person and not by app so if somebody sends you a DM on Instagram and then also another message on WhatsApp from the same person you can see the whole conversation together so you don't have to switch around different apps to see your message mesages but here's my favorite part if somebody sends you a message in another language it gets translated instantly so I think if you're using multiple platforms for your business I think this is super useful pricing wise they do have a completely free account where you can connect to 10 different platforms but obviously with a Premium plan you can access to all their AI features now the next tool is canva AI now everyone knows canva but today I'm going to show you some new AI features that they just added that you might not know about so first I'm going to talk about their new AI image generators so if you're creating banners for your website you know sometimes it's hard to find the perfect stock photo but now canva has an AI feature where you can create the perfect stock photo so you can head over a page called dreamlabs so this is where we're going to generate this stock images I'm going to type in exactly what I want like entrepreneur working from home with a cat on their desk and when I hit create it creates a unique stock image in just seconds and obviously if you don't like the results you can regenerate again and it will give you more variation so I think this is good if you already have an existing canvas subscription and you don't want to subscribe to Mid Journey or any other tools I think everything is here already but here's what I really want to show you this feature is called Magic edit so let me show you what I can do so I'm going to go back to the home screen here and create a new design and I'm going to pick Instagram post now you have two options here you can either upload your own image or you can use whatever canva has in the library so let's go to elements here and search for pen and then click on photos I'm just going to take this one here now I'm going to resize the image to fit the screen now let's say you want to replace this pan with a pencil so all you have to do here is click on Magic edit and select that specific area and type in pencil in the text box and when you hit generate in a couple seconds you can see that now the pen is replaced by a pencil pretty cool right now what if I want to remove the pencil instead I can do that as well so I can just click on edit image in the toolbar here and I'm going to look for the erase button with the Magic One icon and all you do is brush over that pencil just like this and that's it and now the pencil's gone now of course sometimes results are not perfect but canva is constantly updating this feature so the output is going to get better and more accurate with each update but this is a feature that you can normally find in Photoshop but now it's already on canvas so you don't need another subscription to get access to this feature now this next tool is what a lot of people are already using for writing and it's called clae AI but I want to show you guys a feature within claw that I really like and it's something that I use in a daily basis now if you guys are wondering yes CLA is very similar to chat TBT but I personally like this one better because I feel like the output sounds more human and more conversational and you can even train it to write or sound like a certain person right so let me give you an example here so let's say I'm creating a new YouTube video and I want it to help script it for me now I don't usually write out the entire script for my YouTube videos but I would do it on some ideas that I have trouble articulating and it's been very helpful now in order for for it to produce the content in the way I speak I can use a feature on cloud called projects and this is where you basically input all your past videos to it and all the writing will match the way you speak now the main benefit of using projects is that it will save the instructions you give it to memory so you don't have to always remind it to use your voice every time you want to ask it to write something so to do this is very simple so for example I'm going to go to this YouTube video here so I have this

the video as well and obviously I can add more videos the more videos the better context you're going to give Claude and now you can also set the project instructions here so I like to give it more context so I would write something like this so you're an expert in business startups solopreneur ideas Founders you will be an agent acting for me to create YouTube scripts you can also make it aoid using words that sound like AI for example like digital landscape intricate pivotal it doesn't sound natural so I usually try to avoid these words and by the way you can also add to this list over time and that's it click save you're good to go now anytime you want to ask it to write whatever you want it will write it based on your instructions so you don't have to tell it to write this way or
