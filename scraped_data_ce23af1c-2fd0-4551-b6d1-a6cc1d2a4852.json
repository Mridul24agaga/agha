The convenience of browsing, comparing and purchasing products from the comfort of one’s home has fueled a shift from traditional brick-and-mortar stores to digital marketplaces. This shift isn’t just about moving online — it’s about creating smarter, faster and more efficient experiences. At the heart of this transformation is artificial intelligence (AI), a technology that is reshaping modern e-commerce in ways we could only imagine a decade ago. AI has become a cornerstone of the online retail revolution, driving innovations across the entire shopping journey. From powering advanced recommendation systems to automating customer service and optimizing logistics, AI enables retailers to scale their operations while delivering highly personalized experiences. What makes this shift so significant is how it aligns with the evolving expectations of today’s consumers. Modern shoppers are no longer satisfied with a one-size-fits-all approach. They demand hyper-personalized, fast and seamless interactions. They expect recommendations tailored to their preferences, search results that are intuitive and accurate and checkout processes that are effortless and secure. This demand for instant gratification has pushed retailers to innovate continuously, adopting AI technologies that can predict customer needs, adapt to their preferences and anticipate their next moves. This article explores the key AI trends shaping online retail in 2025, offering a roadmap for businesses looking to thrive in this competitive landscape. It will delve into how AI is revolutionizing personalization, streamlining operations and enhancing customer engagement. By understanding these trends, retailers can make informed decisions about how to integrate AI into their strategies, ensuring they stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly changing industry. Whether you’re looking to improve efficiency, enhance the shopping experience or unlock new opportunities, this guide will provide valuable insights to help you navigate the future of online retail. Hyper-Personalization and Customer Engagement The days of generic, one-size-fits-all shopping experiences are long gone. In 2025, online retail is all about hyper-personalization, where every interaction feels tailor-made for the individual customer. Advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies play a crucial role in making this possible by analyzing vast amounts of data to craft unique shopping journeys that drive engagement and loyalty. AI-Driven Personalization AI algorithms excel at processing and understanding behavioral and demographic data, uncovering patterns that human analysis might miss. By analyzing customer browsing history, purchase behavior, search queries and even time spent on specific pages, AI can deliver highly personalized recommendations. For example, a customer searching for athletic shoes might see suggestions for running-specific gear, paired with complementary items like fitness trackers or moisture-wicking socks. This level of personalization not only improves the shopping experience but also increases the likelihood of repeat purchases. Moreover, AI goes beyond individual interactions by segmenting customers into micro-groups based on shared preferences or behaviors. Retailers can then tailor their messaging, offers and product displays to align with each group’s unique characteristics, ensuring every customer feels seen and valued. Dynamic Pricing and Targeted Marketing In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, static pricing strategies are no longer effective. AI enables dynamic pricing, which adjusts product prices in real-time based on factors such as market demand, competitor pricing and inventory levels. For example, if a product is trending on social media or nearing low stock, AI can automatically increase its price to maximize profitability. Conversely, slow-moving inventory can be discounted strategically to attract bargain hunters. Targeted marketing takes this one step further. AI-powered systems can analyze customer data to create hyper-focused campaigns that resonate deeply with specific audiences. Imagine a holiday promotion where shoppers receive personalized emails showcasing products they’ve recently viewed, coupled with time-limited discounts. By delivering the right message at the right time, retailers can significantly improve conversion rates and foster a sense of exclusivity. Predictive Analytics for User Intent Understanding what customers want — sometimes even before they know it themselves — is the holy grail of online retail. AI-driven predictive analytics leverages historical and real-time data to anticipate user intent. For instance, if a customer frequently purchases seasonal items, the system can predict when they’ll need similar products again and proactively suggest them. These insights can also help reduce customer churn. By identifying patterns that indicate dissatisfaction — such as abandoned carts or a sudden drop in engagement — AI can trigger personalized interventions like offering discounts or personalized assistance. This proactive approach helps retailers retain customers and maintain strong relationships. By leveraging AI for hyper-personalization, dynamic pricing and predictive analytics, retailers can transform the shopping experience into something that feels intuitive, relevant and enjoyable. These technologies empower businesses to meet customer expectations while building long-term loyalty, a combination that will be essential for success in 2025’s competitive online retail landscape. Visual Intelligence for a Seamless Shopping Journey In the rapidly evolving world of online retail, visual intelligence has emerged as a game-changer. It bridges the gap between what customers see and what they seek, making the shopping experience more intuitive and enjoyable. From visual search to augmented reality (AR), AI-driven visual tools are helping retailers create a seamless journey that meets and exceeds customer expectations. Visual Search and Product Discovery For many shoppers, describing what they want in words can be frustrating. Visual search solves this problem by allowing customers to upload images of products they like — whether it’s a stylish jacket they saw on a friend or a unique piece of furniture spotted online. AI-powered systems then analyze the uploaded image and find matching or similar items in the retailer’s catalog, making product discovery effortless and precise. This capability not only speeds up the shopping process but also reduces the chances of customers abandoning their search out of frustration. It’s a powerful tool for retailers, enabling them to capture the interest of visually driven shoppers and stand out in a competitive market. Smart Product Tagging and Labeling Managing product data is a daunting task for retailers with large inventories, especially when it comes to creating accurate and detailed product descriptions. AI-powered image recognition automates this process by analyzing product images and generating appropriate tags and labels. For example, a photo of a dress might be tagged with attributes like “sleeveless”, “floral print” and “summer wear”, all without human intervention. This automated tagging ensures consistency across product listings, which not only improves searchability but also enhances the overall user experience. Shoppers can easily find what they’re looking for using filters and search terms, while retailers save time and resources on manual data entry. Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Try-On One of the biggest challenges of online shopping is the inability to physically interact with products before buying. Augmented reality is changing this by offering immersive experiences that allow customers to visualize products in their own environments. For instance, AR tools let shoppers see how a piece of furniture would look in their living room or how a pair of glasses would fit on their face. Clothing retailers are also embracing virtual try-on features, where customers can upload a photo or use their device’s camera to see how an outfit might look on them in real time. These solutions do more than just reduce uncertainty — they build customer confidence, leading to higher conversion rates and fewer returns. By offering these interactive experiences, retailers can foster stronger connections with their customers and create memorable shopping journeys. From simplifying product discovery with visual search to enhancing decision-making through AR, visual intelligence is transforming how customers shop online. By adopting these AI-driven technologies, retailers can provide a seamless and engaging experience that keeps customers coming back for more, paving the way for long-term success in the competitive e-commerce landscape of 2025. AI-Enhanced Operations and Efficiency In the fast-paced world of online retail, operational efficiency is as critical as customer experience. AI technologies are revolutionizing how businesses manage their back-end processes, making them smarter, faster and more reliable. From inventory management to content moderation, AI ensures that operations run smoothly while optimizing resources and minimizing risks. Intelligent Inventory Management Balancing inventory is a perpetual challenge for online retailers. Overstocking ties up capital and storage space, while understocking leads to missed sales opportunities and frustrated customers. AI solves this problem with intelligent inventory management powered by computer vision and demand forecasting. By analyzing historical sales data, market trends and customer behavior, AI can predict demand for products with remarkable accuracy. Retailers can use these insights to maintain optimal stock levels, ensuring that popular items are always available while minimizing excess inventory. Computer vision further enhances this process by automating stock monitoring in warehouses, identifying low-stock items and even detecting damaged goods. This real-time visibility reduces human error and improves overall inventory efficiency. Streamlined Supply Chain and Logistics The supply chain is the backbone of any retail operation and AI is streamlining every aspect of it. AI-powered sensors and detection systems automate quality checks, ensuring that products meet standards before they are shipped. This not only saves time but also reduces returns and customer dissatisfaction caused by faulty goods. In warehouses, AI-driven robots and systems handle tasks like sorting, packing and inventory tracking with speed and precision. Predictive analytics helps optimize shipping routes and schedules, reducing delivery times and costs. For example, AI can analyze weather patterns, traffic conditions and other variables to suggest the most efficient delivery routes in real time. By automating these logistics processes, retailers can improve efficiency and provide a smoother experience for customers. Automated Content Moderation With the rise of user-generated content, retailers face the challenge of maintaining a brand-safe environment. Customer reviews, photos and social media interactions are valuable for engagement but can sometimes include offensive or inappropriate material. AI-powered content moderation ensures that such content is identified and removed in real time. Advanced image recognition algorithms can scan uploaded images to detect harmful content, such as offensive symbols or explicit imagery and flag them for review. Similarly, AI systems can analyze text for inappropriate language or spam. This not only protects the brand’s reputation but also fosters a safe and inclusive space for customers to interact. By enhancing operations with AI, online retailers can achieve higher efficiency, reduce costs and maintain a strong brand reputation. Intelligent inventory management, streamlined logistics and automated content moderation ensure that businesses can focus on growth while delivering exceptional experiences to their customers. In 2025, embracing these AI-driven solutions will be key to staying competitive and thriving in the ever-evolving e-commerce landscape. Data Security, Ethics and Trust in AI As online retail increasingly relies on artificial intelligence to enhance customer experiences and streamline operations, the importance of data security, ethical practices and consumer trust cannot be overstated. In 2025, retailers must not only leverage AI’s potential but also address the challenges it brings to ensure their systems remain fair, secure and transparent. Responsible Data Handling AI in retail relies heavily on data — whether it’s customer preferences, purchase history or browsing behavior. Handling this data responsibly is crucial for maintaining customer trust and complying with privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. Best practices include anonymizing personal information, encrypting sensitive data and limiting access to ensure only authorized individuals or systems can retrieve it. Retailers should also implement clear policies for data collection and usage. Customers are more likely to engage with brands that openly explain how their data will be used and stored. Regular audits and updates to security protocols further strengthen data protection, reducing the risk of breaches and enhancing consumer confidence. Fairness and Bias Mitigation AI systems are only as good as the data they’re trained on. If the training data contains biases — intentional or otherwise — it can lead to unfair outcomes that harm customer trust and damage a brand’s reputation. For example, biased algorithms might exclude certain groups from receiving product recommendations or result in pricing strategies that favor one demographic over another. To address this, retailers should focus on bias mitigation strategies such as diverse and representative training datasets, regular algorithm audits and fairness checks. Partnering with diverse teams during development and testing stages can also help identify potential biases early on. By committing to fairness, businesses ensure that their AI systems promote inclusivity and deliver equitable results for all customers. Ensuring Transparency and Explainability AI’s complexity can sometimes make it seem like a “black box”, where customers have little understanding of how decisions are made. This lack of transparency can lead to mistrust, especially when AI influences critical aspects of the shopping journey, such as pricing or product recommendations. Retailers can counter this by providing clear disclosures about how AI is used. For example, a simple statement explaining that pricing is adjusted dynamically based on demand or that recommendations are generated using purchase history can go a long way in building trust. Additionally, investing in explainable AI — where decisions are presented in understandable terms — helps customers feel more confident about the systems in place. By prioritizing data security, fairness and transparency, retailers can harness the power of AI while maintaining consumer trust. Responsible data handling reassures customers that their information is safe, bias mitigation ensures equitable outcomes and clear communication fosters loyalty. In 2025, the brands that excel will be those that balance innovation with ethics, proving that AI can be a force for both progress and integrity in online retail. Exploring Advanced Image Analysis Possibilities As e-commerce continues to evolve, advanced image analysis is emerging as a powerful tool to tackle a wide range of challenges. From ensuring brand consistency to streamlining document handling and exploring specialized recognition needs, AI-driven image analysis offers innovative solutions that drive efficiency and enhance customer experiences. Brand Recognition and Compliance Maintaining consistent brand presentation is vital for building trust and loyalty in a competitive retail landscape. Advanced image recognition technologies now enable retailers to automatically detect brand marks and logos across a variety of channels, such as product images, social media and advertisements. This ensures that branding remains consistent, recognizable and impactful wherever it appears. Moreover, these tools can track the unauthorized use of logos or product images, helping retailers protect their intellectual property. For example, a company can identify counterfeit products being sold online by detecting subtle variations in logo placement or design. By leveraging brand recognition technologies, retailers can not only safeguard their reputation but also maintain a competitive edge in an increasingly crowded market. OCR and Document Handling Managing the influx of documentation in e-commerce can be overwhelming, especially when it involves manual data entry. Optical character recognition (OCR) simplifies this process by extracting text from images — such as receipts, invoices, product labels or shipping documents — and converting it into usable digital data. This automation not only saves time but also reduces errors, making workflows more efficient. For instance, OCR can instantly capture and verify information from a product label to ensure accurate inventory tracking or streamline the return process by automatically processing receipts uploaded by customers. Retailers can use these capabilities to minimize operational bottlenecks and improve the overall shopping experience. Specialized Recognition Solutions The potential of AI-driven image analysis extends beyond traditional applications. Specialized recognition solutions are opening up new possibilities for retailers to cater to niche needs. For example: Household item and furniture identification: AI can classify and tag specific items in product catalogs, making it easier for customers to find exactly what they’re looking for, whether it’s a mid-century modern chair or a specific type of kitchen appliance. NSFW detection: Automated systems can scan user-generated content, such as product reviews or photos, to identify and filter out inappropriate material, ensuring a safe and family-friendly platform. Industry-specific solutions: Retailers in sectors like fashion, electronics or food can deploy custom recognition models tailored to their unique requirements. For instance, recognizing subtle differences in wine labels can help sellers organize their inventory more effectively and assist customers in making informed decisions. These specialized applications demonstrate how versatile and transformative image analysis technologies can be, helping retailers adapt to diverse challenges and customer expectations. Advanced image analysis is reshaping the way retailers operate, offering tools to ensure brand consistency, streamline workflows and explore innovative use cases tailored to specific industries. By embracing these capabilities, online businesses can unlock new levels of efficiency, customer satisfaction and competitiveness, making them well-equipped to navigate the dynamic e-commerce landscape of 2025 and beyond. Conclusion: Preparing for the Future of Online Retail As we look toward 2025, it’s clear that artificial intelligence is no longer just a helpful tool for online retail — it’s a game-changer. From enhancing personalization and streamlining product discovery to optimizing operations and ensuring ethical data governance, AI is reshaping the e-commerce landscape in profound ways.

At the same time, responsible AI deployment and transparency are building trust and long-term customer loyalty. Opportunities Ahead The competitive advantages of adopting advanced AI solutions are immense. Retailers leveraging image analysis, dynamic pricing, predictive analytics and augmented reality are already setting themselves apart. These innovations not only improve operational efficiency but also offer exciting new ways to connect with customers on a deeper level. In an increasingly saturated market, businesses that adapt quickly to these technologies will stay ahead of the curve, securing their place as industry leaders. Next Steps for Retailers The road to successfully integrating AI into your business starts with choosing the right solutions. While off-the-shelf AI tools can address general challenges, custom-developed solutions tailored to your unique business needs can deliver even greater impact. Specialized providers with expertise in AI and image processing can help retailers design and implement systems that align perfectly with their goals, whether it’s creating hyper-personalized shopping experiences, automating tedious processes or safeguarding brand identity. For retailers ready to invest in their future, now is the time to explore these possibilities. Partnering with experienced providers can ensure that AI implementations are not only effective but also scalable, empowering businesses to grow while staying agile in a fast-changing industry. The future of online retail is being defined by innovation and AI is at the heart of this transformation. By staying informed about the latest trends and embracing advanced technologies, retailers can create a seamless shopping journey, foster customer loyalty and unlock new opportunities for growth. In 2025, the businesses that succeed will be those that see AI not as a challenge but as a powerful tool for shaping the future of e-commerce.

Considering the convenience of customers in online shopping, 23% of retail sales are also expected to be online by 2027. The rapidly growing eCommerce world demanded more for personalization in 2024. Artificial intelligence, user-generated content, direct-to-customer, and conversational commerce were the key eCommerce trends in 2024. But what next? What innovations does 2025 hold in store for the industry? Where are the customer expectations from brands leading to? Let's explore the top 20 most expected eCommerce industry trends you should brace yourself for in 2025. 1. Smart Shoppers Meet Smarter AI Agents According to Statista, around 69% of retail businesses use AI agents to boost their revenue growth. Marketers' adoption of AI agents makes shopping and marketing more personalized and targeted. Gone are the days of robotic AI chatbots communicating with mere pre-recorded conversations. AI agents will dominate the eCommerce industry in 2025 giving customers the feel of a personalized salesman available to shop with them 24/7, making their experiences a better and more manageable. Jay Patel, SVP & GM, Webex Customer Experience Solutions, Cisco says: While 2023 and 2024 [was for] realizing the initial benefits of AI in customer experience, 2025 will be the year where we really start to see the profound impact it will have. In 2025, AI will be woven into the fabric of everyday customer service operations — including AI agents that have natural voice capabilities and the ability to act on customer requests….. Source While shooting the customers with intelligent recommendations, these AI agents are available 24/7, ready to help the customers at any time with any service request. They are changing the face of eCommerce by streamlining operations and increasing customer engagement. About 32% of Gen Z customers are comfortable shopping with an AI agent. 2. See, Touch, and Shop Virtually - Rise of AR and VR Technologies Customers think twice before completing a conversion because they're unable to see, touch, and feel the product before buying it. With augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, customers can enjoy a virtual product try-on. Over 40% of customers are ready to pay more for this experience. Nevertheless, about 79% of them are inclined to interact with a product in AR before buying it. Moreover, businesses can recreate the in-store shopping experience with a VR store wherein users can walk into the store, interact with virtual salesmen, and try their favorite products virtually. Snap and Ipsos published a Global Report which says that 65% of customers agree that AR technologies make shopping easier. Source ‍The adoption of AR/VR in the industry is expected to hit a market value of $7.95 billion in 2025. Besides bridging online and offline shopping, AR also helps create a seamless connection between various marketing channels, making it more convenient for shoppers to shop with hyper-personalized offers. 3. AI-Powered Shopping Will Craft Unmatched Shopping Journeys and Experience In 2025, AI-powered shopping is expected to hit $8.65 billion globally and expand to $22.60 billion by 2032. AI is improving how customers shop - it's making online shopping less transactional and more of a journey fostering loyal customer relationships. With AI agents and shopping assistants, customers get real-time advice and suggestions. It goes beyond to provide hyper-personalized suggestions, offers, and discounts based on the customer behavior on the platform. Thus, the customers’ shopping journey in 2025 is not set to be the traditional linear one; it will be more curated and tailored, making it unique for every next one. 4. AI Automates eCommerce marketing The AI marketing industry is expected to hit $107.5 billion by 2028. From segmenting customers based on their preferences to preparing tailored and targeted content to drive them into the conversion funnel, AI makes marketing sound so easy. Writing product descriptions, preparing website content, enhancing product pages & discovery is a matter of a few clicks with AI writing tools. Launching a full-fledged marketing campaign and analyzing its performance doesn't require much effort with the AI analytics tool in the picture. AI also makes omnichannel marketing more efficient by integrating online and offline marketing channels. Source A recent survey claims that around 61.4% of marketers have already integrated it into their marketing strategies, of which 44.4% are using it just for content production. Thus, AI is in the eCommerce industry, not just as a shopping assistant or customer service bot; it will also help businesses automate their marketing and management efforts. 5. Growing Rise of Live Commerce The concept of live commerce emerged in 2016 in Alibaba’s Taobao live launch session. It allows customers to shop right during the live product launch in real-time while allowing them to interact with a host. Since then, it has been the next wave the eCommerce industry is yet to adopt in complete form. In China, live streaming generated over $150 billion in revenue in 2022. Nevertheless, it's expected to make up for over 20 percent of sales in the upcoming years. Source This unique combination of eCommerce and live streaming has been used as a great tactic to boost engagement, awareness, and impulse purchases. Popular on platforms like TikTok Live Shopping and FaceBook Live Shopping, it's a trend the US and UK audiences are looking forward to joining in full-fledged. However, a 2024 survey also says that 45% of US customers have participated and shopped from live shopping events in the previous years. 6. Global Inflation Pressures Concerns Customers & Businesses 2024 saw the effects of inflation with the rise of financial burden in the manufacturing process of eCommerce goods. This also affected business sales and the spending behavior and habits of customers. The budget-picky customers didn't make many purchases, which affected sales and profits. Within the past six months, about 79% of American retailers have faced the diverse effects of inflation. This concern is not just on the part of eCommerce businesses but also for consumers. According to Retail Economics and Metapack, around 57% of customers are concerned about inflation and rising prices, of which 72% are looking ahead to change their shopping and buying behavior and patterns. In the already competitive world of eCommerce, this poses a significant challenge. Businesses are constantly hunting for solutions to encourage shoppers to buy and mitigate the rippling effects of inflation. For example, some businesses are implementing proactive omnichannel marketing channels, which allow the customer exposure to a maximum number of touchpoints, thus encouraging them to purchase. Others are looking for adaptable solutions to help them maintain their sales and position in the cutthroat competition. 7. A Stable Supply Chain Will Change Global Ecommerce in 2025 After years of turbulence caused by geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, and pandemic aftershocks, businesses are now prioritizing resilience. Strategies like diversifying supplier bases, regionalizing operations, and investing in friend-shoring create more secure and agile supply networks. E-commerce giants are leveraging advanced technologies like AI and blockchain to detect disruptions early and enhance transparency across the supply chain. Meanwhile, governments and global organizations are collaborating to address bottlenecks and strengthen critical trade corridors. These efforts will translate into reliable product availability, faster delivery times, and reduced costs for businesses and consumers. This means a seamless experience for shoppers while businesses enjoy improved operational efficiency and customer trust. As the supply chain stabilizes, e-commerce in 2025 will be defined by consistency, reliability, and growth. 8. Eco-Conscious Ecommerce and Sustainable Ecommerce Gain Popularity Along with a fair price, consumers are now concerned about the product's eco-friendliness. McKinsey’s 2020 survey revealed that 6 in 10 US consumers are willing to spend more on products with environmentally friendly packaging. Customers often associate eco-friendly products free from harmful chemicals and toxins. It gives them psychological relief that it's also safe for them and their family. Source Though government regulations bind brands to ban single-use plastics or encourage carbon-neutral goals, consumers also derive moral satisfaction from associating with brands that support sustainability. A collaborative study (from 2018-22) conducted by McKinsey and NielsenIQ revealed that products with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) claims contributed 56% to overall market growth, exceeding projections by 18%. Additionally, products with no ESG-related claim received 8% less cumulative growth than ESG-related products. 9. Customers Are Inclining Towards Second Hand Ecommerce In 2022, the resale eCommerce market produced sales worth $77 billion, expected to surpass $100 billion by 2026. Customers are more towards secondhand ecommerce, considering sustainability practices and the rise of inflation. Books rank in the list of popular resale segments, followed by fashion and apparel, which has grown to a $12-billion-dollar sector in the US in the previous years. An online survey also says that 27% of participants shopped for resale books online, and 25% of them shipped for used clothes. Source New circular business models are coming up based on recycling and reusing, such as refurbishment and rentals. According to Andy Ruben, the founder and CEO of Trove, resale will be a part of every brand's distribution channel by 2032. She says: We’ve all seen the glossy campaigns and tabs on our favorite e-commerce sites... From Second Show on Showroomprivé to 2nd Life on Boulanger, second-hand, pre-owned, pre-loved and even recommerce items have been completely repurposed, rebranded, repackaged, and are having a moment on traditional e-retail channels! Gone are the days when purchasing pre-owned goods came with a stigma. 10. Rise of Subscription-Based Commerce Subscription-based models, known for their steady cash flow and predictable revenue streams, are becoming more widely accepted among ecommerce businesses. In 10 years, the subscription economy has grown 4.35 times its original size and is projected to surpass the $1.5 trillion mark by 2025. Customers can conveniently pay a definite amount reliably for a specific period without any hassle. Meanwhile, businesses benefit by locking in customers during that period, which helps reduce their churn rate. The model is primarily dominated by the global digital subscription (e.g., cloud services, premium apps, or online tools), which accounts for nearly half of all the revenue in the subscription economy. Streaming platforms, ecommerce, and the SaaS industry cover another 38% of the share. Source According to The Business, the subscription eCommerce market will jump from $539.16 billion in 2025 to $3485.51 billion by 2029. This forecast of the exponential rise in market size includes various disciplines of subscription models, such as specialized subscription boxes, rental services, TBYB (Try Before You Buy) models, and flexible subscription models, among others. 11. Enhanced Logistics and Fast or Same-Day Delivery Many eCommerce giants have developed their logistics chain strong enough to offer same-day delivery facilities to their customers. With the same-day delivery option, customers receive their purchase within a few hours on the same day after ordering. The trend confined earlier to only grocery items is now applied to general products. Categories like pharmaceutical, fashion, and electronics are gaining exponentially, considering speed as a crucial factor in purchase behavior. Brands took the help of customer purchase habits to categorize most ordered products to make them available in multiple locations before placing them to speed up the process. Source Customers' buying decisions are also affected by the expected delivery date. The convenience of same-day delivery is a factor for 49% of shoppers to opt for online stores. A study found that 41% of customers are willing to pay higher fees for the benefit of same-day delivery. This highlights that customer experience has a direct impact on the performance of the business. By providing same-day delivery, businesses can achieve a 20X boost online business conversion rates. 12. Managing the Surge in Online Returns Year-over-year eCommerce returns climbed 15% during the 2023 peak shopping season. Seeing the rise of return rates, eCommerce platforms work on improving return policies to maintain customer trust and satisfaction. Additionally, 49% of retailers make online shopping easier by including free return shipping in their services. Though product quality (damaged or broken items) is one of the significant factors behind this high return rate, long and flexible return policy also surprisingly contributed to this rate. Meanwhile, 30% of returns stem from customers changing their minds and deciding they no longer want the product. Source eCommerce saw an average return rate of 17.6% for all purchases made in 2023. However, these numbers are double in the clothing industry with an average return rate of 25% to 40%, which is highest among other industries. Businesses increasingly adopt automation and technology to provide a smoother return experience. Features such as auto-approval of return requests, automatic marking of items as received, and instant refund generation are becoming standard practices. These innovations significantly reduce the time to resolve a return request and profoundly improve customer satisfaction. 13. Customers Expect Multiple Convenient Payment Options Checkout is the final and most crucial part of closing the deal and conversion. A safe and quick checkout wins the customer's trust and attention. Even the slightest mishaps on the checkout page will cost you a valuable customer. According to a survey, over 65% of Gen Zers will abandon their purchase if they don't find their preferred payment option. For the millennials, the percentage rises to 80%. Considering the data from 2022, which says that 49% of global eCommerce transactions happened through digital wallets, they offer diverse payment options. Offer multiple payment methods ranging from one-click checkout options like Bolt to wallets like Apple Wallet and credit cards. You can also offer Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) options from partners such as Klarna, Affirm, Apple Pay Later, etc. BNPL spending options are expected to hit $95 billion by the end of 2024. Source Furthermore, companies such as PayPal and Shopify have also started accepting crypto payments, considering that these are faster to process and have lower processing fees. In 2025, the global crypto payments are expected to hit $11.43 billion. 14. Influencer-Driven Marketing Influencer marketing’s global market value hit $21.1 billion in 2023, reflecting a threefold expansion since 2019. Brands find it easy to target a particular number of audiences in specific industries. Instagram influence with a minimum follower base of 1k-10k followers (nano-influencer) was also hired to gain a reach of 2.19%, which is the highest among all the other levels of influencers. Nano-influencers charge less and give better conversational rates, but brands hire micro, mega, or celebrity influencers with 50k or more followers to gain more reach. Source Influencers are reliable faces for their followers; it's a smart step to reach targeted audiences and seed trust in their minds about the product. Nearly 7 in 10 consumers prefer advice from influencers over what brands say. Along with brand awareness, it also impacts consumers' buying habits. As per the 2024 Influencer Marketing Report, influencer content leads 49% of individuals to buy products monthly. 15. The Rise of \"Phygital\" Stores The convenience of physical stores with the personalization of online shopping is now a reality in the form of phygital stores. Online shoppers have reached 2.77 billion, nearly one-third of the world's population. They have embraced the ease and personalization online shopping offers. Phygital stores enhance customers’ shopping experience, allowing them to order using the same online portal but receive their purchases from physical stores after physically trying and checking the products. Phygital stores also offer customers access to their in-store interactive technology to explore and try various products. Digital screens, kiosks, and AI-powered mirrors will collectively enhance the customer's buying experience. Recently, many industries have gained sustainable growth from online business (travel, entertainment, and banking), while many show a sharp downfall (education and healthcare). Phygital stores fill this gap and help to provide a comprehensive effort with dual experience to the customer. Over the next few years, the global phygital market will expand at an annual growth rate of 16.1%, ultimately reaching a valuation of USD 950.18 billion by 2027. Seeing this, brands like IKEA and McDonald's have already shifted to phygital concepts with interactive kiosks in the store for self-service purposes. 16. The Growth of Social Commerce Along with the rise in social media users and influencers, social commerce is also catching up with a similar trend. In 2023, the social commerce sector took a giant leap, generating nearly 571 billion U.S. dollars. According to the forecast, the trend will soon surpass the trillion-dollar benchmark by 2028 or earlier. Unlike traditional eCommerce, where the audience is redirected to the shopping portal, social commerce reaches itself where the audience is already present in mass. Platforms like TikTok and Instagram keep engaging with the audience and driving more audience into the platform with time. The trend is to follow quite the same path, as Mark Zuckerberg said: If I had to guess, social commerce is next to blow up. Social media sites develop features that support social commerce and allow brands to take the most out of it. Brands and influencers can make shoppable posts by tagging products, allowing users to view details and make purchases with a few clicks. Source For instance, social media giant Meta has introduced Meta Pay, eliminating the need for external apps for payments and in-app shopping. Similarly, WhatsApp (a meta product) can place an order, assess the catalog, and make payments from WhatsApp business users. 17. Gamification in Shopping Retail is considered one of the most common users of gamification in business. Implementing game design principles in non-gaming contexts like shipping is one of the new tactics marketers are adopting. The gamification industry is forecast to grow at 25.85% CAGR from 2025 to 2030, starting at USD 19.42 billion and reaching USD 61.30 billion by the end of the period. Similarly to a gaming experience, customers earn rewards badges and participate in challenges to maintain the leadership board. Customers like to share the rewards they have achieved on social media or with friends and family, expanding brand reach even further. eCommerce websites use gamification tactics to make users perform tasks they consider dull or essential to the brand. For example, coupons after completing a profile, earning rewards after completing a survey, etc. The American sports and athleticwear brand Nike has its Nike Run Club, which provides new challenges to running and earning product rewards or discounts. Similarly, Amazon Prime games and Starbucks Rewards are prime examples of brands' adoption gamifications. 18. Building Visibility with SEO Basics Despite the advanced marketing strategies and technologies dominating the digital landscape, brands and businesses will return to their roots. They’ll fine-tune their basics: faster website load times to reduce bounce rates, compelling product descriptions that rank and convert, and SEO-friendly URLs designed for users and search engines. Structured data and schema markup will enhance visibility on search engine results pages (SERPs). Additionally, brands will invest in local SEO to dominate regional searches and build customer loyalty. By prioritizing SEO fundamentals, e-commerce companies will ensure their brands are visible and positioned as leaders in search, driving sustainable growth in 2025. 19. Prioritizing Mobile-First Experiences Statistics show that over six of every ten website visits come from mobile devices. This data will spike up shortly, drawing the world's attention. Specifically, the U.S. mobile commerce industry in 2024 relied heavily on smartphones, which generated $418.9 billion in sales. The key motivation behind these insights is the ease of accessibility and seamless smartphone navigation. Source As reliance on mobile devices grows exponentially, e-commerce businesses have significantly changed their approach. Along with fast site navigation and smoother mobile experiences, a sharp rise in availability can be seen, shifting from mobile websites to mobile apps. Orders placed through mobile apps have a higher average value of $102 compared to $92 from mobile websites. Integration of payment applications with smartphones made online transactions faster and more reliable. This gives customers a more effortless shopping experience than a desktop or tablet. 20. Cybersecurity: Securing the Digital Marketplace E-commerce sites are improving their security standards to match the growing number of online transactions. To improve the shopping experience, eCommerce platforms store and handle sensitive customer information(names, addresses, payment details, etc.), protected from high-level cyber attacks, threats, and data breaches. The global eCommerce industry saw retail sales climb to 6.3 trillion U.S. dollars in 2024, highlighting the growing confidence of customers in online transactions. To ensure users feel safe and protected, eCommerce platforms have implemented strict security measures and comply with data protection laws such as GDPR, CCPA, and PCI DSS. For secure payment gateways, a space for new innovative solutions can bloom. Advanced biometric authentication methods, Cybersecurity-as-a-Service (CaaS) rise, and an accelerated push for Blockchain technology adoption are emerging as transformative trends. Wrapping Up While these were the top 20 eCommerce trends for 2025, one thing is to be kept in mind: 2025 is about creating memorable customer journeys with the proper technology. Despite economic challenges and circumstances that may unfold, the eCommerce customer base is expected to continue their spending habits. All you need to do is brace yourself with the right technology set to stay ahead of the competition and leave a long-lasting impression in the customer's minds. Nevertheless, security, personalization, and transparency will be the key goals of all trends.

Customers Are Inclining Towards Second Hand Ecommerce In 2022, the resale eCommerce market produced sales worth $77 billion, expected to surpass $100 billion by 2026. Customers are more towards secondhand ecommerce, considering sustainability practices and the rise of inflation. Books rank in the list of popular resale segments, followed by fashion and apparel, which has grown to a $12-billion-dollar sector in the US in the previous years. An online survey also says that 27% of participants shopped for resale books online, and 25% of them shipped for used clothes. Source New circular business models are coming up based on recycling and reusing, such as refurbishment and rentals. According to Andy Ruben, the founder and CEO of Trove, resale will be a part of every brand's distribution channel by 2032. She says: We’ve all seen the glossy campaigns and tabs on our favorite e-commerce sites... From Second Show on Showroomprivé to 2nd Life on Boulanger, second-hand, pre-owned, pre-loved and even recommerce items have been completely repurposed, rebranded, repackaged, and are having a moment on traditional e-retail channels! Gone are the days when purchasing pre-owned goods came with a stigma. 10. Rise of Subscription-Based Commerce Subscription-based models, known for their steady cash flow and predictable revenue streams, are becoming more widely accepted among ecommerce businesses. In 10 years, the subscription economy has grown 4.35 times its original size and is projected to surpass the $1.5 trillion mark by 2025. Customers can conveniently pay a definite amount reliably for a specific period without any hassle. Meanwhile, businesses benefit by locking in customers during that period, which helps reduce their churn rate. The model is primarily dominated by the global digital subscription (e.g., cloud services, premium apps, or online tools), which accounts for nearly half of all the revenue in the subscription economy. Streaming platforms, ecommerce, and the SaaS industry cover another 38% of the share. Source According to The Business, the subscription eCommerce market will jump from $539.16 billion in 2025 to $3485.51 billion by 2029. This forecast of the exponential rise in market size includes various disciplines of subscription models, such as specialized subscription boxes, rental services, TBYB (Try Before You Buy) models, and flexible subscription models, among others. 11. Enhanced Logistics and Fast or Same-Day Delivery Many eCommerce giants have developed their logistics chain strong enough to offer same-day delivery facilities to their customers. With the same-day delivery option, customers receive their purchase within a few hours on the same day after ordering. The trend confined earlier to only grocery items is now applied to general products. Categories like pharmaceutical, fashion, and electronics are gaining exponentially, considering speed as a crucial factor in purchase behavior. Brands took the help of customer purchase habits to categorize most ordered products to make them available in multiple locations before placing them to speed up the process. Source Customers' buying decisions are also affected by the expected delivery date. The convenience of same-day delivery is a factor for 49% of shoppers to opt for online stores. A study found that 41% of customers are willing to pay higher fees for the benefit of same-day delivery. This highlights that customer experience has a direct impact on the performance of the business. By providing same-day delivery, businesses can achieve a 20X boost online business conversion rates. 12. Managing the Surge in Online Returns Year-over-year eCommerce returns climbed 15% during the 2023 peak shopping season. Seeing the rise of return rates, eCommerce platforms work on improving return policies to maintain customer trust and satisfaction. Additionally, 49% of retailers make online shopping easier by including free return shipping in their services. Though product quality (damaged or broken items) is one of the significant factors behind this high return rate, long and flexible return policy also surprisingly contributed to this rate. Meanwhile, 30% of returns stem from customers changing their minds and deciding they no longer want the product. Source eCommerce saw an average return rate of 17.6% for all purchases made in 2023. However, these numbers are double in the clothing industry with an average return rate of 25% to 40%, which is highest among other industries. Businesses increasingly adopt automation and technology to provide a smoother return experience. Features such as auto-approval of return requests, automatic marking of items as received, and instant refund generation are becoming standard practices. These innovations significantly reduce the time to resolve a return request and profoundly improve customer satisfaction. 13. Customers Expect Multiple Convenient Payment Options Checkout is the final and most crucial part of closing the deal and conversion. A safe and quick checkout wins the customer's trust and attention. Even the slightest mishaps on the checkout page will cost you a valuable customer. According to a survey, over 65% of Gen Zers will abandon their purchase if they don't find their preferred payment option. For the millennials, the percentage rises to 80%. Considering the data from 2022, which says that 49% of global eCommerce transactions happened through digital wallets, they offer diverse payment options. Offer multiple payment methods ranging from one-click checkout options like Bolt to wallets like Apple Wallet and credit cards. You can also offer Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) options from partners such as Klarna, Affirm, Apple Pay Later, etc. BNPL spending options are expected to hit $95 billion by the end of 2024. Source Furthermore, companies such as PayPal and Shopify have also started accepting crypto payments, considering that these are faster to process and have lower processing fees. In 2025, the global crypto payments are expected to hit $11.43 billion. 14. Influencer-Driven Marketing Influencer marketing’s global market value hit $21.1 billion in 2023, reflecting a threefold expansion since 2019. Brands find it easy to target a particular number of audiences in specific industries. Instagram influence with a minimum follower base of 1k-10k followers (nano-influencer) was also hired to gain a reach of 2.19%, which is the highest among all the other levels of influencers. Nano-influencers charge less and give better conversational rates, but brands hire micro, mega, or celebrity influencers with 50k or more followers to gain more reach. Source Influencers are reliable faces for their followers; it's a smart step to reach targeted audiences and seed trust in their minds about the product. Nearly 7 in 10 consumers prefer advice from influencers over what brands say. Along with brand awareness, it also impacts consumers' buying habits. As per the 2024 Influencer Marketing Report, influencer content leads 49% of individuals to buy products monthly. 15. The Rise of \"Phygital\" Stores The convenience of physical stores with the personalization of online shopping is now a reality in the form of phygital stores. Online shoppers have reached 2.77 billion, nearly one-third of the world's population. They have embraced the ease and personalization online shopping offers. Phygital stores enhance customers’ shopping experience, allowing them to order using the same online portal but receive their purchases from physical stores after physically trying and checking the products. Phygital stores also offer customers access to their in-store interactive technology to explore and try various products. Digital screens, kiosks, and AI-powered mirrors will collectively enhance the customer's buying experience. Recently, many industries have gained sustainable growth from online business (travel, entertainment, and banking), while many show a sharp downfall (education and healthcare). Phygital stores fill this gap and help to provide a comprehensive effort with dual experience to the customer. Over the next few years, the global phygital market will expand at an annual growth rate of 16.1%, ultimately reaching a valuation of USD 950.18 billion by 2027. Seeing this, brands like IKEA and McDonald's have already shifted to phygital concepts with interactive kiosks in the store for self-service purposes. 16. The Growth of Social Commerce Along with the rise in social media users and influencers, social commerce is also catching up with a similar trend. In 2023, the social commerce sector took a giant leap, generating nearly 571 billion U.S. dollars. According to the forecast, the trend will soon surpass the trillion-dollar benchmark by 2028 or earlier. Unlike traditional eCommerce, where the audience is redirected to the shopping portal, social commerce reaches itself where the audience is already present in mass. Platforms like TikTok and Instagram keep engaging with the audience and driving more audience into the platform with time. The trend is to follow quite the same path, as Mark Zuckerberg said: If I had to guess, social commerce is next to blow up. Social media sites develop features that support social commerce and allow brands to take the most out of it. Brands and influencers can make shoppable posts by tagging products, allowing users to view details and make purchases with a few clicks. Source For instance, social media giant Meta has introduced Meta Pay, eliminating the need for external apps for payments and in-app shopping. Similarly, WhatsApp (a meta product) can place an order, assess the catalog, and make payments from WhatsApp business users. 17. Gamification in Shopping Retail is considered one of the most common users of gamification in business. Implementing game design principles in non-gaming contexts like shipping is one of the new tactics marketers are adopting. The gamification industry is forecast to grow at 25.85% CAGR from 2025 to 2030, starting at USD 19.42 billion and reaching USD 61.30 billion by the end of the period. Similarly to a gaming experience, customers earn rewards badges and participate in challenges to maintain the leadership board. Customers like to share the rewards they have achieved on social media or with friends and family, expanding brand reach even further. eCommerce websites use gamification tactics to make users perform tasks they consider dull or essential to the brand. For example, coupons after completing a profile, earning rewards after completing a survey, etc. The American sports and athleticwear brand Nike has its Nike Run Club, which provides new challenges to running and earning product rewards or discounts. Similarly, Amazon Prime games and Starbucks Rewards are prime examples of brands' adoption gamifications. 18. Building Visibility with SEO Basics Despite the advanced marketing strategies and technologies dominating the digital landscape, brands and businesses will return to their roots. They’ll fine-tune their basics: faster website load times to reduce bounce rates, compelling product descriptions that rank and convert, and SEO-friendly URLs designed for users and search engines. Structured data and schema markup will enhance visibility on search engine results pages (SERPs). Additionally, brands will invest in local SEO to dominate regional searches and build customer loyalty. By prioritizing SEO fundamentals, e-commerce companies will ensure their brands are visible and positioned as leaders in search, driving sustainable growth in 2025. 19. Prioritizing Mobile-First Experiences Statistics show that over six of every ten website visits come from mobile devices. This data will spike up shortly, drawing the world's attention. Specifically, the U.S. mobile commerce industry in 2024 relied heavily on smartphones, which generated $418.9 billion in sales. The key motivation behind these insights is the ease of accessibility and seamless smartphone navigation. Source As reliance on mobile devices grows exponentially, e-commerce businesses have significantly changed their approach. Along with fast site navigation and smoother mobile experiences, a sharp rise in availability can be seen, shifting from mobile websites to mobile apps. Orders placed through mobile apps have a higher average value of $102 compared to $92 from mobile websites. Integration of payment applications with smartphones made online transactions faster and more reliable. This gives customers a more effortless shopping experience than a desktop or tablet. 20. Cybersecurity: Securing the Digital Marketplace E-commerce sites are improving their security standards to match the growing number of online transactions. To improve the shopping experience, eCommerce platforms store and handle sensitive customer information(names, addresses, payment details, etc.), protected from high-level cyber attacks, threats, and data breaches. The global eCommerce industry saw retail sales climb to 6.3 trillion U.S. dollars in 2024, highlighting the growing confidence of customers in online transactions. To ensure users feel safe and protected, eCommerce platforms have implemented strict security measures and comply with data protection laws such as GDPR, CCPA, and PCI DSS. For secure payment gateways, a space for new innovative solutions can bloom. Advanced biometric authentication methods, Cybersecurity-as-a-Service (CaaS) rise, and an accelerated push for Blockchain technology adoption are emerging as transformative trends. Wrapping Up While these were the top 20 eCommerce trends for 2025, one thing is to be kept in mind: 2025 is about creating memorable customer journeys with the proper technology. Despite economic challenges and circumstances that may unfold, the eCommerce customer base is expected to continue their spending habits. All you need to do is brace yourself with the right technology set to stay ahead of the competition and leave a long-lasting impression in the customer's minds. Nevertheless, security, personalization, and transparency will be the key goals of all trends.

The Resilient Retail Blog 10 Best AI Tools For eCommerce in 2025 Running an eCommerce product business sometimes feels like being pulled in all directions at once. Sound familiar? You’ve got to write new product descriptions, update your store, answer customer queries, and send packages. Even as you expand your team, it never seems enough. What’s the solution? Is there a way to lighten the load without spending a fortune on new employees? Yes! It’s called artificial intelligence (AI). As of 2025, small business owners have access to some of the best AI tools ever developed for eCommerce. From AI copywriters to automated customer service experts, there’s a tool for almost every job in an eCommerce product business. Let’s go through the best AI tools in 2025 for eCommerce, looking at their top features, potential benefits, and affordability. 10 Best AI Tools for eCommerce in 2025 Best AI Writing Tools 1. Jasper What Is It? Building out your website? Creating more product pages? Usually, that involves extensive copywriting to capture your customer’s attention and convince them to stick around or purchase a product. Enter Jasper – an AI-powered writing assistant. Jasper isn’t just a regular generative AI platform; it’s tailored to creating blog posts, product descriptions, and marketing copy. How Does It Work? It works by leveraging advanced algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. Business owners simply input a topic or brief description of what they want, and Jasper gets to work. It’s impressive stuff. At the same time, it’s still not on the level of the best human copywriters (and sometimes the writing can be a little clunky); however, with a few edits, you can save yourself hours of writing. Pricing Creator Package – $49 per month Teams Package – $125 per month Business Package – Available Upon Request 2. ChatGPT What Is It? Haven’t heard of ChatGPT? It’s the world’s most advanced AI language model (developed by OpenAI). Designed to simulate human-like conversations and generate text-based responses, users can ask it to do just about anything, and the program will respond accordingly. How Does It Work? ChatGPT is remarkably versatile. From generating new product ideas to planning your marketing strategy, the platform can help spark ideas, refine your processes, and write product descriptions. Just be careful; some responses can seem a little generic and bland. Pricing GPT-4 is priced at $0.03 per 1K tokens for input and $0.06 per 1K tokens for output. Approximately 1,000 tokens are equivalent to 750 words. 3. Copy.ai What Is It? Like its two competitors, Copy.ai is a versatile generative AI platform. If it can be written in English, Copy.ai can produce it. Brainstorming, research assisting, and content writing are all just a prompt or request away. How Does It Work? As before, simply enter a prompt (a text description of what you want), and Copy.ai will get to work. Take product descriptions, for example. Simply ask the platform to create a description for a specific product highlighting its benefits, and you’ll get a new description in seconds. You can even include a product’s URL in the prompt to speed up the process. Pricing Free Package – $0 per month Pro Package – $49 per month Team Package – $249 per month Growth Package – $1,333 per month Scale Package – $4,000 per month Best AI Customer Service Tools 4. SiteGPT What Is It? SiteGPT is an AI-driven tool tailored for enhancing website interactivity and customer support. It seamlessly integrates with web platforms, offering features like automated FAQs, content personalisation, and instant query resolution. How Does It Work? When users input questions or requests on a website, SiteGPT employs sophisticated algorithms to analyse and respond accurately and contextually. For example, suppose a visitor asks about a product. In that case, it generates a detailed response or directs them to relevant site sections, improving user experience and reducing reliance on human customer service. Pricing Starter Package – $49 per month Growth Package – $99 per month Scale Package – $399 per month 5. ZenDesk What Is It? Zendesk for Service is an all-in-one customer service solution designed to enhance customer interactions and streamline support processes. It integrates various support channels like email, chat, and social media into a single platform, offering a unified view of customer interactions. How Does It Work? Zendesk for Service uses an advanced ticketing system and AI-driven automation to route and handle customer queries efficiently. Businesses can set up automated responses for common questions, while more complex issues are directed to the appropriate support agents. This system optimises response times and improves overall customer satisfaction by addressing each inquiry promptly and accurately. Pricing Suite Team Package – £59 Suite Growth Package – £99 Suite Professional Package – £115 Suite Enterprise Package – Available Upon Request Note: prices are based on 5 customer service agents 6. Ada What Is It? From customer service automation to insightful analytics, Ada is far more than just a basic chatbot. A key problem for businesses is scaling their customer service team as demand skyrockets. Ada handles this effortlessly. Integrating with existing systems, Ada provides personalised interactions across a broad spectrum of queries, from basic information requests to complex problem-solving. How Does It Work? Using machine learning, Ada learns from every interaction. The more customers it speaks to, the more queries it answers, the better the responses become – Ada becomes ever more attuned to your business. When a customer initiates a chat, Ada analyses their questions to provide accurate, immediate answers or directs the inquiry to the right human agent if necessary. Think of Ada as your customer service triage. No more endless shipping questions. No expensive customer service costs. Just answered questions and satisfied customers. Pricing Pricing is available upon request. Contact Ada directly for a quote for either Generative or Scripted customer service assistance. Best AI eCommerce Store Tools 7. Shopify’s “Magic” What Is It? Sometimes, people think running a small business happens by magic. By what if it did – Shopify Magic is an advanced AI tool that leverages artificial intelligence to streamline your online eCommerce store. Forget the headache of inventory management, personalising product recommendations, or customer service – Magic does it all. How Does It Work? Magic uses AI algorithms to analyse customer behaviour and store data. It then delivers insights, automates tasks like adjusting inventory levels based on sales trends, and offers personalised product recommendations to customers. For customer inquiries, “Sidekick” (a soon-to-be-released Magic feature) automates responses or directs complex queries to human support. Not only that, but it also helps draft emails and provide instant answers, e.g., personalised FAQs. Pricing Shopify Magic tools are available for free to all Shopify merchants, regardless of the user’s subscription plan. 8. Algolia What Is It? Ever find yourself searching for something in an eCommerce store only to get a bunch of irrelevant results? Frustrating, right? Don’t let that be your store! Algolia is an AI-powered search and discovery platform harnessing the power of “NeuralSearchTM” to understand customer intent and pair up the query with the right results. How Does It Work? Algolia pioneered several cutting-edge technologies, including natural language understanding (NLU), automatic query suggestions, neural hashtags, and AI adaptive learning. That means (in English) that whatever your customer types – exact terms or free-form expressions – Algolia will swiftly scan your store’s inventory to find the most relevant website content. Pricing Build Package – $0 Grow Package – $0.50 per 1,000 search requests/month Premium Package – Price Available Upon Request Elevate Package – Price Available Upon Request 9. Recombee What Is It? Personalise your product recommendations with Recombee. Using AI, this platform analyses customer behaviour to identify the right products to suggest to your customers. With easy integration with popular eCommerce platforms, it’s a powerful tool to skyrocket your sales. How Does It Work? Using geolocation and customer preferences, Recombee’s product recommendation engine leverages customer insights to personalise everything from your homepage to the shopping cart. The recommendation engine analyses item properties such as title, description, availability, and price to market the right product to the right customers. Pricing Free Package – $0 per month Standard Package – $99 per month Plus Package – $899 per month Pro Package – $1,499 per month Premium Package – $2,499 per month 10. Koala Inspector What Is It? Koala Inspector is a Shopify competitor analysis extension for Google Chrome. Ever wondered what makes a competitor’s store tick? Want to reveal their hidden secrets? You can do so in an instant, understanding the strategies, best-selling products, and traffic sources fuelling the business. How Does It Work?

Challenges with AI for retail Despite its many advantages, the adoption of AI in retail still comes with its own set of challenges: High implementation costs: The initial setup of AI solutions can be costly, particularly for smaller retailers. Retailers can address this by choosing scalable, cloud-based solutions like Vonage AI, which offers flexible pricing and integration options even for small businesses. Data privacy concerns: AI systems usually rely on customer data, which can raise concerns about data privacy and compliance with regulatory bodies. Luckily, Vonage provides built-in security and compliance measures to guarantee safe data handling.

But you can overcome this by using API-driven AI solutions like Vonage AI that seamlessly connect with existing platforms. You’ll also receive personalized support so that the transition is smooth. Skill gaps: Implementing and managing AI require specialized knowledge, which may require hiring or upskilling employees. That’s why you should look for tools like Vonage, which offers user-friendly, no-code, and low-code tools to empower your retail teams without needing extensive technical expertise. Resistance to change: Some employees may resist AI adoption due to fear of job displacement or a lack of understanding of how AI can complement their roles. It’s important that you foster acceptance through comprehensive training programs and demonstrate AI’s role in enhancing—not replacing—human efforts.

Here are five key examples of the use of AI in retail: 1. Virtual assistants Think of AI virtual agents as your always-on, always-ready customer service team. They can answer questions, help process orders, and even make returns a breeze without taking a coffee break. With their quick responses and 24/7 availability, AI virtual assistants make life much easier for your customers and can boost satisfaction simultaneously. 2. Customer sentiment analysis AI also has the power to dive into customer reviews and social media chatter. It can use this to determine how people feel about your products or services. The best AI social listening tools don’t just stop at the “what.” They track the “how it’s changing” too, so you know if things are looking up or need some attention. This way, you can tweak what you offer and fix problems faster. 3. Proactive customer engagement AI doesn’t wait around for customers to reach out. It takes initiative. You can use AI to automate messages such as restock alerts or abandoned cart reminders. That way, your customers get timely and relevant communications that could lead to higher conversion rates. Vonage Conversational Marketing is useful for exactly this. You can send messages across multiple channels, such as social media or email, encouraging customers to finalize their purchases. 4. Personalized recommendations Remember those product recommendations based on something you viewed last week? Well, that’s AI. AI algorithms suggest products based on a customer’s previous purchases and browsing history. That means a more personalized experience and even better sales. Online retail can also benefit from AI-driven tech like virtual try-ons and other video-based experiences so customers can easily shop from home. 5. Fraud detection Many people who shop online are concerned about online fraud. AI monitors transaction data in real time, spotting suspicious activity to help stop fraud before it happens. It’s like having a super-smart security guard who learns new tricks daily, so they’re always ready for the latest scams. Plus, it makes life easier by reducing false alarms and keeping things running smoothly. How AI is transforming retail: statistics to prove that AI in retail works AI is already having a massive impact on the retail sector, with measurable results across key areas such as customer experience, operational efficiency, sales, marketing, innovation, and security. Let’s dive deeper into how AI solutions for retail are transforming it, with statistics to back us up. Customer experience Personalization has become essential in retail. According to Deloitte, 80% of customers are more likely to purchase from a company that offers a personalized experience. AI is playing a key role in delivering tailored interactions. Analyzing data from past purchases, browsing behavior, and demographic information allows AI algorithms to make highly accurate recommendations. You can then deliver these offers via email, virtual agents, or even personalized product carousels on your website. Increased sales and revenue One of the most important ways AI can boost sales is through its marketing and customer experience applications. For example, AI can tailor email marketing content based on a customer’s purchase history, increasing the likelihood that the message will lead to a conversion. You can also leverage generative AI for your virtual assistants, social media, or rich messaging service for speedy support, two-way conversations, and personalized recommendations. AI can have a real impact on your revenue. Accenture found that 75% of surveyed retail executives view generative AI as essential to revenue growth. Enhanced marketing ROI AI can analyze large amounts of consumer data in real time and quickly identify patterns and trends that human marketers might miss. This data-driven approach allows for more precise targeting and higher engagement rates. For example, AI can segment your customers based on past purchase behavior and social media activity. Your marketers can craft personalized advertisements more likely to resonate with each segment. This, of course, saves time for your marketers, too. Emarsys’s AI in retail report shows that 89% of marketers agree that AI saves them an hour or more when working on a campaign launch. This means your staff can focus on revenue-driving tasks and boost the overall ROI of every campaign. Innovation in shopping experience AI is not just improving existing retail processes — it’s also driving innovation. Verint’s report suggests that 52% of retailers see AI as a “big” part of their customer experience strategy. AI-powered innovations such as voice-activated shopping assistants and augmented reality try-ons are becoming increasingly common. As AI continues to evolve, retailers will need to use it increasingly to differentiate their brands from others and offer tech-driven, personalized customer experiences. Fraud detection and security You don’t want to fall behind with customer security. 83% of businesses plan to use AI in fraud prevention programs in the next few years. Retailers are using AI to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns in customer behavior. This allows them to identify anomalies and flag suspicious activities in real time. Additionally, AI-powered tools can analyze social media and other online sources to detect potential fraudsters and prevent them from accessing customer accounts or making fraudulent purchases. As fraud increasingly threatens the retail industry, AI can offer a powerful tool to safeguard your business and customers. General AI benefits The widespread adoption of AI tools is not just a trend; it’s becoming necessary for retailers looking to stay competitive in an increasingly tech-driven marketplace. Integrating AI into retail operations can help you automate mundane tasks and make smarter decisions based on real-time insights. These capabilities are yielding measurable benefits, including reduced operational costs. For example, automated customer support via AI-powered virtual agents allows businesses to handle customer queries 24/7 without additional human resources. Consumer expectations are also shifting as customers increasingly expect seamless and responsive shopping experiences. The rise of AI has set a new standard for these experiences. As a result, embracing AI doesn’t just mean you can meet customer demands. It’ll position you to drive long-term loyalty.

Imagine having a personal shopping guide who understands exactly what you want, when you want it, and why you’re looking for it. Enter AI Shopping Assistants: the digital companions transforming how we discover and purchase products online. Traditional E-Commerce (left) vs. AI Shopping Assistant Ecommerce (right) What exactly are AI Shopping Assistants? Think of them as the next evolution of online shopping — intelligent digital helpers that go far beyond traditional search bars and recommendation algorithms. These advanced systems use artificial intelligence to understand context, intent, and personal preferences in ways previous technologies could only dream of. Why are they revolutionary? Traditional online shopping comes with frustrations that make customers want to pull their hair out: Keyword searches that return irrelevant results Generic product recommendations that miss the mark Endless clicking to find basic product information Slow, impersonal customer support AI Shopping Assistants solve these problems by introducing something radical: actual understanding.‍ Sources: Ninetailed, MyTotalRetail, Accenture These intelligent assistants can: Interpret search queries conversationally Ask clarifying questions to understand exact needs Recommend products that truly match a shopper’s intent Provide instant, accurate product information Offer personalized support in real-time‍ “_Are AI Shopping Assistants going to disrupt the ecommerce industry? Is that a rhetorical question? There’s no question there is a huge opportunity here.” ~Veeral Rathod, retail innovator and Founder of J Hilburn_‍ As e-commerce continues to evolve, AI Shopping Assistants aren’t just a nice-to-have — they’re becoming the standard for businesses serious about customer experience and conversion rates. In the next sections, we’ll dive deep into the top players revolutionizing online shopping, showing you exactly how AI is turning digital storefronts into intelligent, responsive shopping experiences.‍ AI Shopping Assistant Competitive Landscape Let’s explore the companies leading the AI shopping revolution as we enter 2025. While there are plenty of players in the space building both consumer apps as well as utilizing a combination of human and AI agents, we’re going to focus specifically on the B2B AI Shopping Assistants for this analysis. Nobi: Conversational Shopping Assistant for E-commerce Growth At Nobi, we tackle the three biggest frustrations in online shopping: broken search, irrelevant recommendations, and slow support. Unlike consumer-focused alternatives, Nobi integrates directly with e-commerce stores, transforming their existing infrastructure into intelligent shopping experiences. Nobi recommends outfits that go with a specific product. In this case, boots. What sets us apart? Our technology doesn’t just match keywords — it understands context. When a shopper searches for a “black purse,” Nobi knows to show black bags, clutches, and totes, even if those exact terms weren’t used in the product descriptions. This intelligent interpretation of customer intent leads to higher conversion rates and happier shoppers. And Nobi’s cross-sell recommendations can understand contextual nuance. For example, if you’re shopping for outfits for an NYC trip that include a Board meeting, dinner out with friends, and visiting your young nieces, Nobi can recommend clothes for each occasion and even take into account the weather in NYC this time of year. Manifest AI: Enhancing Engagement with Personalized Nudges Manifest AI has revolutionized customer engagement through their sophisticated behavioral analytics platform. Their system doesn’t just respond to customer actions — it anticipates them. By analyzing patterns in how customers browse, what they click, and where they hesitate, Manifest AI creates perfectly timed interaction points. The platform’s strength lies in its ability to distinguish between different shopping mindsets. For example, when a customer repeatedly views the same item category, Manifest AI can determine whether they’re comparison shopping or struggling to find the right variant. This understanding enables the platform to offer relevant assistance, whether that’s showing similar products or providing detailed specification comparisons. Rep AI: Turning Browsers Into Buyers with Behavioral Insights Rep AI has transformed the way online stores understand and respond to customer behavior. Their platform goes beyond basic analytics by creating detailed shopping personas in real-time. Through their advanced machine learning algorithms, Rep AI can identify subtle patterns that indicate buying intent, price sensitivity, and decision-making style. What makes Rep AI particularly effective is its ability to adapt the entire shopping experience based on these insights. From adjusting the layout of product recommendations to personalizing promotional offers, the platform creates unique journeys for each shopper. Their integration with inventory management systems also enables smart stock level notifications that create urgency without feeling manipulative. Anagram: Revolutionizing Product Discovery through Visual AI Anagram has transformed the product discovery experience through their innovative approach to visual and conversational AI. Their platform stands out by combining sophisticated image recognition with natural language understanding, creating a uniquely intuitive shopping experience. When customers upload images or describe what they’re looking for, Anagram’s AI can understand both visual attributes and contextual nuances. Anagram’s product Q&A capability What makes Anagram particularly powerful is their ability to understand product relationships across visual, functional, and stylistic dimensions. Their technology doesn’t just match products based on appearance — it understands how items work together in real-world contexts. This means shoppers can find products that not only look similar to their inspiration but also serve their specific needs. Ada: AI-Powered Customer Experience Automation While not exclusively focused on ecommerce and shopping, Ada has carved out a unique position in the space by focusing on automated customer experience at scale. Their platform goes beyond simple chatbot functionality to create what they call “automated brand interactions.” Through their sophisticated AI engine, Ada can handle complex customer service scenarios while maintaining a consistent brand voice. Ada shines when it comes to customer service The platform’s strength lies in its ability to seamlessly integrate with existing e-commerce systems and customer service workflows. Ada doesn’t just answer questions — it proactively assists customers throughout their shopping journey. From providing personalized product recommendations to handling post-purchase support, their automation creates consistent experiences across all customer touchpoints. This comprehensive approach has made them particularly effective for businesses looking to scale their customer service operations without sacrificing quality.‍ Choosing the right AI Shopping Assistant for your business isn’t just about picking the most advanced technology — it’s about finding the solution that best fits your specific needs.

Imagine having a personal shopping guide who understands exactly what you want, when you want it, and why you’re looking for it. Enter AI Shopping Assistants: the digital companions transforming how we discover and purchase products online. Traditional E-Commerce (left) vs. AI Shopping Assistant Ecommerce (right) What exactly are AI Shopping Assistants? Think of them as the next evolution of online shopping — intelligent digital helpers that go far beyond traditional search bars and recommendation algorithms. These advanced systems use artificial intelligence to understand context, intent, and personal preferences in ways previous technologies could only dream of. Why are they revolutionary? Traditional online shopping comes with frustrations that make customers want to pull their hair out: Keyword searches that return irrelevant results Generic product recommendations that miss the mark Endless clicking to find basic product information Slow, impersonal customer support AI Shopping Assistants solve these problems by introducing something radical: actual understanding.‍ Sources: Ninetailed, MyTotalRetail, Accenture These intelligent assistants can: Interpret search queries conversationally Ask clarifying questions to understand exact needs Recommend products that truly match a shopper’s intent Provide instant, accurate product information Offer personalized support in real-time‍ “_Are AI Shopping Assistants going to disrupt the ecommerce industry? Is that a rhetorical question? There’s no question there is a huge opportunity here.” ~Veeral Rathod, retail innovator and Founder of J Hilburn_‍ As e-commerce continues to evolve, AI Shopping Assistants aren’t just a nice-to-have — they’re becoming the standard for businesses serious about customer experience and conversion rates. In the next sections, we’ll dive deep into the top players revolutionizing online shopping, showing you exactly how AI is turning digital storefronts into intelligent, responsive shopping experiences.‍ AI Shopping Assistant Competitive Landscape Let’s explore the companies leading the AI shopping revolution as we enter 2025. While there are plenty of players in the space building both consumer apps as well as utilizing a combination of human and AI agents, we’re going to focus specifically on the B2B AI Shopping Assistants for this analysis. Nobi: Conversational Shopping Assistant for E-commerce Growth At Nobi, we tackle the three biggest frustrations in online shopping: broken search, irrelevant recommendations, and slow support. Unlike consumer-focused alternatives, Nobi integrates directly with e-commerce stores, transforming their existing infrastructure into intelligent shopping experiences. Nobi recommends outfits that go with a specific product. In this case, boots. What sets us apart? Our technology doesn’t just match keywords — it understands context. When a shopper searches for a “black purse,” Nobi knows to show black bags, clutches, and totes, even if those exact terms weren’t used in the product descriptions. This intelligent interpretation of customer intent leads to higher conversion rates and happier shoppers. And Nobi’s cross-sell recommendations can understand contextual nuance. For example, if you’re shopping for outfits for an NYC trip that include a Board meeting, dinner out with friends, and visiting your young nieces, Nobi can recommend clothes for each occasion and even take into account the weather in NYC this time of year. Manifest AI: Enhancing Engagement with Personalized Nudges Manifest AI has revolutionized customer engagement through their sophisticated behavioral analytics platform. Their system doesn’t just respond to customer actions — it anticipates them. By analyzing patterns in how customers browse, what they click, and where they hesitate, Manifest AI creates perfectly timed interaction points. The platform’s strength lies in its ability to distinguish between different shopping mindsets. For example, when a customer repeatedly views the same item category, Manifest AI can determine whether they’re comparison shopping or struggling to find the right variant. This understanding enables the platform to offer relevant assistance, whether that’s showing similar products or providing detailed specification comparisons. Rep AI: Turning Browsers Into Buyers with Behavioral Insights Rep AI has transformed the way online stores understand and respond to customer behavior. Their platform goes beyond basic analytics by creating detailed shopping personas in real-time. Through their advanced machine learning algorithms, Rep AI can identify subtle patterns that indicate buying intent, price sensitivity, and decision-making style. What makes Rep AI particularly effective is its ability to adapt the entire shopping experience based on these insights. From adjusting the layout of product recommendations to personalizing promotional offers, the platform creates unique journeys for each shopper. Their integration with inventory management systems also enables smart stock level notifications that create urgency without feeling manipulative. Anagram: Revolutionizing Product Discovery through Visual AI Anagram has transformed the product discovery experience through their innovative approach to visual and conversational AI. Their platform stands out by combining sophisticated image recognition with natural language understanding, creating a uniquely intuitive shopping experience. When customers upload images or describe what they’re looking for, Anagram’s AI can understand both visual attributes and contextual nuances. Anagram’s product Q&A capability What makes Anagram particularly powerful is their ability to understand product relationships across visual, functional, and stylistic dimensions. Their technology doesn’t just match products based on appearance — it understands how items work together in real-world contexts. This means shoppers can find products that not only look similar to their inspiration but also serve their specific needs. Ada: AI-Powered Customer Experience Automation While not exclusively focused on ecommerce and shopping, Ada has carved out a unique position in the space by focusing on automated customer experience at scale. Their platform goes beyond simple chatbot functionality to create what they call “automated brand interactions.” Through their sophisticated AI engine, Ada can handle complex customer service scenarios while maintaining a consistent brand voice. Ada shines when it comes to customer service The platform’s strength lies in its ability to seamlessly integrate with existing e-commerce systems and customer service workflows. Ada doesn’t just answer questions — it proactively assists customers throughout their shopping journey. From providing personalized product recommendations to handling post-purchase support, their automation creates consistent experiences across all customer touchpoints. This comprehensive approach has made them particularly effective for businesses looking to scale their customer service operations without sacrificing quality.‍ Choosing the right AI Shopping Assistant for your business isn’t just about picking the most advanced technology — it’s about finding the solution that best fits your specific needs.

This finding comes from Honeywell's AI in Retail Survey. The survey also found that 35% of major retailers plan to significantly increase their AI investment.

They determine when and where your ads will appear. Here’s how you can find the right keywords for your products: ### Step-by-Step Keyword Research 1. **Use Amazon’s Search Bar**: Start typing relevant terms related to your product. Amazon will suggest popular searches, which can give you ideas on what customers are looking for. 2. **Utilize Tools**: Consider using keyword research tools like SellerMate, which can provide insights into search volume and competition for different keywords.
