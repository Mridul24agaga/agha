  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, so let’s kick back and dive into this URL, playpickups.app. First off, the name itself gives off some casual, sporty vibes – like, imagine a spot where you can just chill with your buddies and pick teams or players for some kind of game. It’s probably about fantasy sports or some sort of daily pick-em game, where you can flex your skills in predicting who’s going to crush it in whatever sport is hot right now. From the sounds of it, they might be capitalizing on that whole fantasy league craze, letting you draft players and compete against your friends for bragging rights or some sweet prizes. You know how folks love to gather around during big game days, talking smack about their rosters or calling out picks based on stats or just gut feelings? Yeah, this could be the online hub for all that banter and competition. Now, considering it’s an app, I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s super user-friendly, maybe even gamified to keep things lively. You know, lots of flashy graphics, cool features, and low-key ways to track your teams. Think of it as a digital playground where the sports fans can gather, drop their picks, and see how they stack up against the rest of the player pool. They probably have a community vibe going on too. Maybe forums or chat features where you can discuss strategies, share memes, or just brag if you’re killing it in your league. Plus, they might have some fun features like live stats, player updates, and maybe even integration with social media to share your picks and victories. And let’s be real, anyone who’s into sports knows that having a solid way to keep track of games, players, and stats is essential. So, aside from just making picks, I’d guess they’ve got a ton of info to help you stay updated on injuries, trades, and key matchups. This way, you’re not just guessing; you’re making informed decisions, and that’s what makes it fun! Also, it’s likely they’ve got some sort of user base ranking system. You know how it goes – the more you play, the higher up you climb. It adds that competitive edge while making sure everyone’s just having a good time. In a nutshell, playpickups.app sounds like a laid-back, interactive platform where sports fans can connect, compete, and just enjoy the thrill of the game. It’s all about camaraderie, competition, and maybe winning a little something on the side while you’re at it. So grab a cold one and hop on; it’s probably time to show off those sports smarts!",

How could you not be? Our love for fun goes beyond the pure joy and excitement of betting. We also have created this beginners guide to sports betting and having fun. Our team wants to make sure you have the best betting experience possible. It can be easy to take gambling a bit too seriously. Of course, it’s a good idea to check out and be familiar with betting terms or how to make smart bets. But fun should be central. While the list is finite, we have compiled the best tactics to help guide you through having fun with sports betting. See all Sportsbooks Add In Creative Bets The most basic bets are moneylines. In these bets you just bet on who will win the match. Don’t get me wrong, these can be a lot of fun. However, they can run a little dry. It can quickly become monotonous making the same type of bet. So, spice it up! Try something new Get into parlay or props, also known as proposition bets. Parlays combine multiple bets into one. Take your time to make a solid action-reverse bet. This can create a whole new type of excitement. This excitement builds and builds to a beautiful climax. Props are bets on happenings during the match. It’s fun to bet on who will score the first or last goal, for example. Changing up the rhythm of betting is like everything else. Variety adds spice to life. Mixing in different bet types will keep you having more fun longer. BetOnline is a great sportsbook for props. If you want to add creative, quirky bets, check them out! Of course, they also have a full selection of traditional sports odds. Join BetOnline Connect with your Friends Connecting with friends is a great way to have more fun while sports betting. We can all have a good time by ourselves, but friends make it even better. Friends are good for developing strategies together, or for a few laughs over good-hearted competition. Let’s look at a few ways to bring friends together to have fun while sports betting. Bovada has a great Refer-a-Friend promotion. Plus their great website is welcoming to new bettors. Join bovada now Hosting parties We all look forward to the annual Super Bowl party. Our favorite chip and dip combination and the commercials are the typical high points. Making a Super Bowl party a little more interesting with some betting is an easy way to spice things up. This will give friends more reason to get together, and will add stakes even for those whose favorite team does not make it to the championship game. You can host Super Bowl parties, but there is no reason to wait until February. You can host betting parties for the Kentucky Derby, or the World Series. In fact, you can even use this to make regular-season sports betting even more fun. You can pick a game that seems particularly exciting for you to rope your friends into getting hyped up as well. Or you could pick a game that you feel more indifferent about. Organizing a betting and watching party will take this humdrum game and make it an exciting evening. Betting Pools Pools are fun ways to bet with friends. They do not require being together to watch a game, and end up creating long-term fun. Organize a sports betting pool among your friends, and you’ll have plenty to joke, talk, and strategize about for weeks. For example, the most popular sports betting pool is the March Madness bracket. Once everyone fills out their bracket, you have a long-running competition. They stay competitive the whole time because later games are worth more, so people who are behind can end up catching up and fast. They are easy to get started too. Just collect money from friends and print out brackets with points assigned to each match. Have your friends return their brackets and keep a copy for themselves. Plus this will give you plenty of opportunities to watch these NCAA basketball matches together. Best NCAAB Betting Sites Think beyond Sports Sports are very exciting. Who could deny the adrenaline rush we feel when the underdog comes back to win the last minutes? Almost all online sportsbooks also have bets that go beyond sports. These can be a lot of fun too! They combine some of the other tactics into one. These bets will inevitably add variety to your sports betting routine. It is also a great opportunity to bring people together. You can host an Oscar’s watching party. Or an elections result watching party. In addition to the usual excitement and cultural recommendations, adding an extra layer of betting makes the whole thing more fun. The list of specialty bets will vary quite a bit between sportsbooks. Some of the most common ones are: Politics Entertainment Religion Weather Reality TV Shows MyBookie is well known for their politics markets. This is a great place to bet on sports and more! Join MyBookie Conclusion: Why Focus on Fun We probably do not have to try too hard to convince you that you should enjoy yourself. But this beginner’s guide to sports betting and fun is nonetheless very important. Fun is a value unto itself. It’s something that we should take with us wherever we go and whatever we do. We do not need any other reason to have a good time. We do, however, have those reasons too! Having fun at work can make us more productive. Making fun the center of your gambling also makes you a more responsible bettor. Betting to pay rent is far from a full-proof plan. Even safe bets could swing the other way, sinking an entire parlay. Plus if that is your goal, and it does not start well, many people react by digging themselves a deeper hole. But if you are betting among friends for fun, whether or not you complete that goal is totally up to you! Even if you lose a bet, you can be grateful for the fun you had along the way, what you learned, or the laughs you shared with friends. This means that you will be more able to gamble responsibly because you will have a feeling of satisfaction. Betting for fun is betting responsibly.

We can all have a good time by ourselves, but friends make it even better. Friends are good for developing strategies together, or for a few laughs over good-hearted competition. Let’s look at a few ways to bring friends together to have fun while sports betting. Bovada has a great Refer-a-Friend promotion. Plus their great website is welcoming to new bettors. Join bovada now Hosting parties We all look forward to the annual Super Bowl party. Our favorite chip and dip combination and the commercials are the typical high points. Making a Super Bowl party a little more interesting with some betting is an easy way to spice things up. This will give friends more reason to get together, and will add stakes even for those whose favorite team does not make it to the championship game. You can host Super Bowl parties, but there is no reason to wait until February. You can host betting parties for the Kentucky Derby, or the World Series. In fact, you can even use this to make regular-season sports betting even more fun. You can pick a game that seems particularly exciting for you to rope your friends into getting hyped up as well. Or you could pick a game that you feel more indifferent about. Organizing a betting and watching party will take this humdrum game and make it an exciting evening. Betting Pools Pools are fun ways to bet with friends. They do not require being together to watch a game, and end up creating long-term fun. Organize a sports betting pool among your friends, and you’ll have plenty to joke, talk, and strategize about for weeks. For example, the most popular sports betting pool is the March Madness bracket. Once everyone fills out their bracket, you have a long-running competition. They stay competitive the whole time because later games are worth more, so people who are behind can end up catching up and fast. They are easy to get started too. Just collect money from friends and print out brackets with points assigned to each match. Have your friends return their brackets and keep a copy for themselves. Plus this will give you plenty of opportunities to watch these NCAA basketball matches together. Best NCAAB Betting Sites Think beyond Sports Sports are very exciting. Who could deny the adrenaline rush we feel when the underdog comes back to win the last minutes? Almost all online sportsbooks also have bets that go beyond sports. These can be a lot of fun too! They combine some of the other tactics into one. These bets will inevitably add variety to your sports betting routine. It is also a great opportunity to bring people together. You can host an Oscar’s watching party. Or an elections result watching party. In addition to the usual excitement and cultural recommendations, adding an extra layer of betting makes the whole thing more fun. The list of specialty bets will vary quite a bit between sportsbooks. Some of the most common ones are: Politics Entertainment Religion Weather Reality TV Shows MyBookie is well known for their politics markets. This is a great place to bet on sports and more! Join MyBookie Conclusion: Why Focus on Fun We probably do not have to try too hard to convince you that you should enjoy yourself. But this beginner’s guide to sports betting and fun is nonetheless very important. Fun is a value unto itself. It’s something that we should take with us wherever we go and whatever we do. We do not need any other reason to have a good time. We do, however, have those reasons too! Having fun at work can make us more productive. Making fun the center of your gambling also makes you a more responsible bettor. Betting to pay rent is far from a full-proof plan. Even safe bets could swing the other way, sinking an entire parlay. Plus if that is your goal, and it does not start well, many people react by digging themselves a deeper hole. But if you are betting among friends for fun, whether or not you complete that goal is totally up to you! Even if you lose a bet, you can be grateful for the fun you had along the way, what you learned, or the laughs you shared with friends. This means that you will be more able to gamble responsibly because you will have a feeling of satisfaction. Betting for fun is betting responsibly.

I say this nonchalantly, like it’s no big deal, but let’s not pretend; it’s the coolest thing I have ever done. I am chalant as fuck. My friend and I had just been to a feminist spoken word/poetry night — yeah, I know — and we were high on inspiration. He, a professional photographer and filmmaker, suggested that we go for a drink while we dissect the night’s poetics. Me, a hospital lackey with no creative credentials, told him I had to be up at six thirty the next morning, and I had an important interview, so I really shouldn’t. “Come on, it’s only half nine,” he said. (The early finish sort of detracts from the coolness of the poetry night, so I’m going to make it cooler by telling you it took place in an exclusive clubhouse with no front door. Yeah. That’s right.) I looked at my watch. “It’s disrespectful to go home before ten, isn’t it?” “One drink?” “One drink.” Three pints and a double rum later, and we are in the smoking area of Mr B’s, the city’s most loved jazz room. We are shivering in jackets that are neither warm nor retro enough to suit the environment we find ourselves in; there are no patches of semi-ironic faux fur or cracks or tears, and I am praying my beige, double-breasted Cloak of Conformity comes across as a subversive middle finger to The Man, and not just the jacket I wore on the way back from work. God, if the jazz fans could see my job — the closest we get to art is a leaky colour cartridge in the printer. My friend has the remnants of a cigarette between his fingers, and the night smells of smoke and citrus — I ordered a fragrant cocktail, something tart called a New Fashioned. The air is stained orange with light from the bar. We have been laughing about poetry for an hour now, which you wouldn’t think would be funny, but you weren’t there. One woman wrote a Dr Seuss-style rhyme about rape, and another sang a song about wind turbines. There was a godawful woman that got on stage, shouted “POETRY.” and started rubbing herself. That one took a lot of analysis, and we have only just recovered. In the quiet that follows, as I sip my New Fashioned and he takes another drag, we hear the jazz thrum through the open door. I’ve never been into jazz, but I have to admit, it’s perfect for a night like this. There is a tiny girl dominating the sax, and a man in a bucket hat is tearing riffs from the piano. It is joyful and defiant, but still fades into the background at just the right moments, letting our laughter flow over it. My friend exhales and says, “I wish I’d learnt the piano.” It’s strange, because Alex is not one for regrets. He pursues his dreams like a particularly clever serial killer, planning, biding his time, making his bizarre fantasies a reality. Even now, he is devoted to being a filmmaker, washing dishes in a restaurant and taking pictures at birthday parties to fund his passion. He started the night by showing me the horror film he made in his bathroom. To hear him use the past tense, put the dream behind him, makes me a bit sad. A bit confused, too, because I’m meant to be the boring one. “I wish I’d learnt the drums,” I say. It’s true. My arms are as skinny as the drumsticks and I am utterly dwarfed by a drum kit, but I wish I’d had the chance. The primal pulse of a drum, even on its own, wakes something in me. And when you put a whole set together, a one-man army of bass, it’s just glorious. I could never do it — I have neither the rhythm, nor the stamina — but I wish I could make that noise mine. Alex laughs. It feels a little mean, but sure. I take a drink. He says. “Let’s make a bet.” “For what?” “It doesn’t matter. Pride. A round of drinks.” I shrug. I’ve already bought one of those — what’s another? “In ten years time,” Alex says, “I’ll be able to play the piano and you’ll be able to play the drums.” Now I see why he was laughing. “Yeah. Sure.” “No, seriously,” he says. “We should do it. We’re gonna do it, right?” I don’t commit, and I certainly don’t commit to things after this much cider and rum, but… With the jazz behind me, the drum beating away in the background, and the bracing chill, and the tiny voice in the back of my mind saying yeah, you know, you could, actually, if you just… I raise a glass. “Ten years,” I say. “You’re playing me some Tchaikovsky.” I don’t even slur the name. He lifts his cocktail. “And you’re playing me some Tool.” I’ll spend more on the lessons and the kit than I ever could on a pint for Alex, but he was right; it doesn’t matter what we bet, because it isn’t a bet against each other. It’s a bet for ourselves. I can’t wait for us both to win. We drink, and I scrolled forwards ten years on my phone and added a new event. 19th February, 2030 - Be able to play the drums. I added a reminder ten minutes before, too, just in case I forget the bet tomorrow. Upvote · 999132 9915 92 Sponsored by Amazon Business Learn smart buying strategies from industry experts.

So his buddy would pick a card. My Dad would wager some money that the wizard will tell him what the card is. They would together go to the pay phone and Dad would call home. Who ever answered the phone had to play. Phone rings. Mom answers. “Hello” Dad: “Is the wizard in?” Mom: “ace… two… three… four…” and so on, slow enough until he asks another question. Indicating to stop counting as that is the number of the card Dad: “Does he have a minute to talk?” Mom: heart… club… spade… diamond Dad: (stops her again at the right suit) “I have a friend here who want to talk to the wizard, can you put him on please” Mom: (depending on when Dad stopped her, she says what she thinks the card is) eg: “four of spades” (if she says the card wrong Dad would say “OK I will try back later”) Dad: (if Mom says the right card) “My buddy here has a question for you wizard” Buddy: laughs usually and says, “can you tell me what my card is?” Mom: “four of spades, four of spades, four spades” Hang up. The buddy is always stunned and pays up. Dad comes home later and him and Mom have a good laugh about it and Dad has a few more bucks in his pocket. In those days this was a pretty impressive trick and a sure to win bet.

Example 1- if your vehicle is due for an oil change, purchase the oil and filter and find a friend capable of the job. Bet him $5 that he can't change your oil in 15 minutes. This should be fairly easy to accomplish but would normally cost more than $5 to get done. It's basically a win/win for you. Example 2- bet your significant other a dollar that they can't change the babies shitty diaper in under 5 minutes. For me this again is a win either way. Example 3- bet the neighbor boy $5 he can't mow your lawn completely in a full day. Get it? I have used this magic MANY times successfully but currently am unable to think of some of my greatest hits to use as examples, but it should give you some great ideas.

Example 2- bet your significant other a dollar that they can't change the babies shitty diaper in under 5 minutes. For me this again is a win either way. Example 3- bet the neighbor boy $5 he can't mow your lawn completely in a full day. Get it? I have used this magic MANY times successfully but currently am unable to think of some of my greatest hits to use as examples, but it should give you some great ideas.

While we have most often used Vrbo for Florida vacations, their site has over 2 millions vacation homes for rent at locations all around the world. We show you the home we stayed in on our most recent rental in the Orlando area and discuss our experiences booking through Vrbo. Do you like the home you see in this video? We enjoyed our stay there. You can check it out for yourself if you think you may be interested. You can do a Google search for Vrbo property # 912196ha to find the listing. We are not affiliated with Vrbo nor have we been compensated in any way for this review. We have used their site to book several vacation home rentals over the years for which we paid full price. In this video, we share our honest opinion about our experiences - what we enjoyed and a few things to look out for. Since Vrbo is a broker for home owners renting their property, your experience may vary.

#airbnb #vacationhomerentals 86 comments because we visit walt disney world at least once a year we are often asked whether it is better to stay on property in a disney resort or off property we love to stay on property at the disney resorts they are all so well themed and they're all really nice however if your budget is stretched thin there are less expensive options in the orlando area today we are going to talk about an option that is often less expensive and that is renting a vacation home we have rented a vacation home four times over the years in orlando and also a few times at other travel destinations the company we usually use is vrbo this stands for vacation rentals by owner although you will probably hear it called verbo online that's what so many people started calling it that the company itself actually goes by verbo now so we're going to talk about them and their website and the things that we liked and didn't like about renting vacation homes instead of staying in hotels if you're traveling as a couple or a couple with one or two young children in tow it would be cheaper to just find an inexpensive hotel and get a room for your trip than it would be to rent a house but we sometimes travel with another couple or with extended family and once your travel party needs more than just one hotel room that is when you can really save money by running a vacation home as an example i just did a quick search and vrbo has numerous rental homes in the orlando area with two or three bedrooms for a hundred and fifty dollars a night or less there are a few additional fees that we'll talk about in a minute but even with those you can get a whole house for about the cost of just one of the more inexpensive rooms in a disney-owned resort even if you are just traveling with your immediate family there are still some perks to renting your home you will have a full kitchen multiple bathrooms multiple bedrooms most rental homes in florida have a private pool or access to a neighborhood pool some have game rooms and many have hot tubs most have laundry rooms which we love because then you can pack less knowing that you'll have the ability to do laundry during your stay the verbo website has filters that allow you to enter exactly what you're looking for down to the type of home the amenities offered the neighborhood you are in and what attractions you are near so you can really drill down into what you're looking for we were really happy with the home we stayed in back on our most recent trip a few months ago it was four bedrooms one king-size bed one queen bed and two kids rooms with two twin beds each the kids rooms were disney themed the garage was converted into a game room having a private pool and hot tub was amazing there's a grill outside too so while we enjoyed several restaurants at the parks and resorts during our week-long stay we also cooked several meals in the kitchen and on the grill outside that saved us a little money it's so relaxing to have a private home base to come to at the end of each day and for those of us concerned about the ongoing pandemic this seemed like a better option to have a break where you can not worry about masks and social distancing like you would have to at a hotel where you will encounter others in the lobby and the elevator and the pool and the hallways we have heard some complaints about verbo from people who had trips booked in spring 2020 where they were not given full refunds for cancelled home rentals when attractions closed due to the onset of the pandemic we actually had a trip booked in a verbo home for april 2020 for orlando which did get cancelled but the owner of the home that we rented did agree to give us a full refund even though we were already past the cancellation date for our trip due to the circumstances and verbo did request all homeowners who booked guests through the verbo website to fully refund those cancelled trips we know this because they sent us a letter as well as everyone else who booked saying that they expected homeowners who used verbo to rent their vacation homes to honor this request but from what we've seen in other videos some owners did not do this verbo is just a broker so depending on their contract with the owners they may not have been able to force the owners to offer full refunds they did say going forward that owners who offered full refunds for stays booked during the spring of 2020 would have the advantage of greater visibility in verbo.com searches but since the company is just a broker they likely had little ability to force the homeowners who had already received payment for those now cancelled vacations to process a full refund verbo allows homeowners to set how strict or how lenient their cancellation policy is so that does vary by owner yeah most of the complaints we've seen online were about the cancellation policy during the pandemic or not with most hotels you can cancel your reservation right up until a day or two before your scheduled stay the owners of the homes rented through vrbo set their own cancellation policy so look into that and know the details going in another complaint about vrbo is the extra fees as you search for a place to rent they list a nightly fee but vrbo adds a service fee on top of that of over a hundred dollars and most properties then add a cleaning fee of over a hundred dollars on top of that the site does clearly list the full price and a breakdown of each fee so the information is all there in advance and again if you need several bedrooms for several nights renting a home through vrbo will still be less expensive than renting multiple hotel rooms at most any area hotel i would encourage everyone to read all the reviews for the home that you're considering renting the experience of other renters will tell you if the description and the photos match the actual reality of the home as well as whether the owner was easy to deal with and if there are any concerns that you should be aware of we have never used airbnb which is the main competitor of verbo they have a lot more housing options to choose from but that is largely because airbnb allows people to rent out a room in their house without renting the entire home so you could at a very low price comparatively rent just a single bedroom while other people are staying in the same house with you we're not really into the whole staying with strangers thing but that certainly is another way that you could save some money the prices and policies of airbnb and verbo are otherwise pretty similar with the range of competitive pricing and varied cancellation policies in fact many homes are rented through both verbo and airbnb the footage of the rental home in this video was filmed at our most recent vrbo rental in late 2020 it was a lovely home and we had no problems at all of any kind in this home the owner was helpful and gracious so we're going to put the verbo property id in the description below if you want to try running a home in the orlando area for your family's vacation check to see if this place is available we feel like it's a good one have you rented a vacation home leave a comment below on your experiences positive or negative if you enjoyed this video please consider subscribing to our channel i'm alice and

The Pikkit team Lllllllllllldjdjcjfjfj , 10/17/2022 Solid App, Needs Improvement I love how this app is able to track my bets and allows me to see my friends. However, I almost exclusively use PrizePicks which this app does not handle very well. First, it doesn’t pull all my betting history. It only pulled from a few months back and not when I first started on PrizePicks. My second and biggest suggestion is creating a feature where promotional money counts in a positive manner, but not a negative one. Since this is how it works IRL. What I mean is a feature where I lose a promo bet, nothing negative happens. While if I win the promo bet, I would like it to show up as profit. That way I could have an accurate representation of if I am up or down money when including promo winnings. At the moment you can only turn on a feature where promo money doesn’t count at all or where it counts entirely as real money. A loss on a free-play bet should not count as a “loss” in my returns. A win on a free-play bet should count as a win on my returns IMO. That’s the one thing that has never made sense to me about this app. Developer Response , Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to leave us with your review. There is a setting that allows you to treat PrizePicks Promo Cash bets as free bets! If you have any additional questions around this, please let us know at support@pikkit.app and we will gladly assist further for you. Thanks! The Pikkit team Conor_Cas , 06/21/2022 Better than Action Network As someone that bets with multiple sportsbooks, I’ve been searching for a good app to help track all my action. I had been using Action Network, but their selection of syncable books was too limited for me. When I learned Pikkit works with Draftkings, FanDuel, Caesars, MGM and Barstool, I decided to give it a shot. After using it for a few months, I feel the Pikkit team deserves recognition. It’s been the perfect solution for me, and I’m very happy I discovered it. Their tracking feature is nice, but where Pikkit really shines is their ability to give you quick and meaningful insights into your betting performance. League, team, and even player prop splits are viewable with just a few clicks. I’ve seen league splits before but never team or player props. I knew I liked betting Connor McDavid props, but to see my ROI on those bets plotted through time is fascinating. There’s also a social element that functions similar to Twitter. It’s a neat way to share and debate picks and see what others are playing, and I like how there are no character limits. For all these reasons, I’m glad I found this app when I did and highly recommend giving it a try if you’re in a legal betting state. Developer Response , Hi there!

The Pikkit team Lllllllllllldjdjcjfjfj , 10/17/2022 Solid App, Needs Improvement I love how this app is able to track my bets and allows me to see my friends. However, I almost exclusively use PrizePicks which this app does not handle very well. First, it doesn’t pull all my betting history. It only pulled from a few months back and not when I first started on PrizePicks. My second and biggest suggestion is creating a feature where promotional money counts in a positive manner, but not a negative one. Since this is how it works IRL. What I mean is a feature where I lose a promo bet, nothing negative happens. While if I win the promo bet, I would like it to show up as profit. That way I could have an accurate representation of if I am up or down money when including promo winnings. At the moment you can only turn on a feature where promo money doesn’t count at all or where it counts entirely as real money. A loss on a free-play bet should not count as a “loss” in my returns.
