Ready to see how it can transform your workflow? Why Video Automation is Essential in 2025 In 2025, video automation is not just a luxury—it’s a necessity. With over 500 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, standing out requires more than just creativity; it requires efficiency and scale. According to CalCalistech, internet traffic is projected to increase by 190 times this year​​. This highlights the growing demand for video content and the importance of producing high-quality videos consistently to capture and retain audience attention.

Well, the good thing is you can actually do all that easily with video automation tools. That’s why this article is your jackpot. Here, I’ll be showing you the five most useful video automation tools for content creators. But before we go into that proper, what are video automation tools? What are Video Automation tools Video automation tools are tools that make the process of filming, editing, and publishing video content easier and less manual. These tools are powered by advanced technology to simplify the various tasks involved in video content creation. Video automation tools are easy to use, intuitive, and often have free trials or demos where users can understand and try out the software. You can use them for your filming and editing to produce engaging, captivating content for your audience. The importance of video automation tools is increasing with the increasing need for video content. 72% of internet users would rather watch video content rather than read blocks of text. In fact, social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok are primarily populated by video content and other visual forms of content creation. Content creators who are interested in building their personal brands using video content should therefore use video automation tools to make their creation process a breeze. I have rounded up some of the best tools from my personal experience and the opinions of other content creators on Instagram and TikTok. Let’s get into it.

You should get lights, a sound system and a good camera. However, you don’t have to have all of these before you start. Start out with what you have at the moment and work towards improving your tools. 2.) Research your target audience You should make sure to identify the kind of videos your target audience is more drawn to. Do they want a short video? Do they want a long one? Do they want an entertaining or educational video? You can ask them what kind of videos they want to see from you. You can also look out for the videos where you have the most engagement and try to replicate them. 3.) Plan and schedule your videos To be consistent with posting video content, planning and scheduling are key factors. Create a content plan that includes the subject matter of each video, the intent of the video, the video’s big idea, and the script. When you’re done filming the video, schedule it using social media scheduling tools like Buffer or Later so you can post consistently even on days when you’re busy. 4.) Write a script While it is convenient to just freestyle your videos, sometimes, it is important to write a video script you can follow. A script gives you creative direction and allows you to stay with the important points of your video rather than blabbing about. Writing a script doesn’t mean you must follow the script to the letter. You can still include your peculiar style and phrases but you’re guided in the entire video process. 5.) Promote your video content Promoting your video content begins with studying the algorithm to note the best posting times, the hashtags that work, and the kind of videos that perform better. Once you’ve tailored your video to meet the organic promotion requirements, the next stage is active promotion like: Sharing your videos on other social media platforms Encouraging your audience to share and save your video Including a Call-to-action (CTA) so that you can achieve the goal of the video There’s also the part of sponsored video content where you promote your videos by paid promotion on the social media platform you use. Now that we’re done, it’s time to get started. Start using the best video automation tools If you’ve gotten to this point, then you must be on your way to making your video content creation easy and efficient. Tools like HappyScribe, Canva, and Animaker are designed to help you do this. Make sure to get these tools, explore their best features, and start making captivating video content for your audience. 0 Comments 0 Shares 0000 About iskra Martins Favour is a creative content writer with over five years of experience writing SEO content for various brands.

They probably don’t know how hard it is to film a video, edit, brand, and make your video content ready. And you have to do that every day to be consistent. Well, the good thing is you can actually do all that easily with video automation tools. That’s why this article is your jackpot. Here, I’ll be showing you the five most useful video automation tools for content creators. But before we go into that proper, what are video automation tools? What are Video Automation tools Video automation tools are tools that make the process of filming, editing, and publishing video content easier and less manual. These tools are powered by advanced technology to simplify the various tasks involved in video content creation. Video automation tools are easy to use, intuitive, and often have free trials or demos where users can understand and try out the software. You can use them for your filming and editing to produce engaging, captivating content for your audience. The importance of video automation tools is increasing with the increasing need for video content. 72% of internet users would rather watch video content rather than read blocks of text. In fact, social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok are primarily populated by video content and other visual forms of content creation. Content creators who are interested in building their personal brands using video content should therefore use video automation tools to make their creation process a breeze. I have rounded up some of the best tools from my personal experience and the opinions of other content creators on Instagram and TikTok. Let’s get into it. Five Most Useful Video Automation Tools for Content Creators The tools mentioned below will help you reach a wider audience with your video content. They will also enhance the quality of your videos and simplify your process. 1.) HappyScribe for captions HappyScribe is an audio-to-text converter that uses AI and the expertise of language professionals to offer subtitles and transcription services. There’s a voice-to-text and video-to-text feature that enhances the functionality. HappyScribe helps you generate captions for your video and repurpose your podcast or audio content into a voiceover for an infographic video. Anthony Hardee of Trustpilot testified to the efficiency of HappyScribe. “Using Happy Scribe is easy and seamless. The accuracy of its transcription engine is quite high, and from the time of submission of an MP3 file to the time of getting back a transcribed Word document is under 10 minutes, which is quick.” HappyScribe makes your video easy to understand and relate to. Accessibility in content creation is a way to reach a larger audience and that’s the aim of every content creator. That’s why you need HappyScribe.

Be inspired by watching sample videos from other brands or creators. Canva also has a magic studio that consists of AI-powered tools.

Source Best practices for Video content creation 1.) Use good tools Using good filming tools makes your video stand out from the very beginning. You should get lights, a sound system and a good camera. However, you don’t have to have all of these before you start. Start out with what you have at the moment and work towards improving your tools. 2.) Research your target audience You should make sure to identify the kind of videos your target audience is more drawn to. Do they want a short video? Do they want a long one? Do they want an entertaining or educational video? You can ask them what kind of videos they want to see from you. You can also look out for the videos where you have the most engagement and try to replicate them. 3.) Plan and schedule your videos To be consistent with posting video content, planning and scheduling are key factors. Create a content plan that includes the subject matter of each video, the intent of the video, the video’s big idea, and the script. When you’re done filming the video, schedule it using social media scheduling tools like Buffer or Later so you can post consistently even on days when you’re busy. 4.) Write a script While it is convenient to just freestyle your videos, sometimes, it is important to write a video script you can follow. A script gives you creative direction and allows you to stay with the important points of your video rather than blabbing about. Writing a script doesn’t mean you must follow the script to the letter. You can still include your peculiar style and phrases but you’re guided in the entire video process. 5.)

If you want my team to just do your marketing for you, click here. Author: Neil Patel | Co Founder of NP Digital & Owner of Ubersuggest Video content creation can be a massive headache. I get it. Even for seasoned marketers, creating compelling content is a challenge. The real uphill battle is trying to create that level of content regularly. That’s why we’re taking a closer look at automated video creation and some of the best tools your brand can use to expand its content strategy. Here’s the thing—automated content doesn’t have to be terrible. When you produce an hour-long, high-quality interview, you’ve also produced several pieces of smaller, high-quality content. All you have to do is repackage those valuable tidbits and present them to your audience. Here’s how. What Is Automated Video Creation? Automated video creation is the act of using video editing software to automatically create short, interesting videos you can use for marketing and promoting your content. Let’s say you recorded a podcast this week and released it to your audience. You received decent engagement, but you quickly noticed a problem. Many of your viewers aren’t watching the entire podcast. Some viewers love to sit and consume two hours of content at once. Others want minute-long highlight clips, and simply aren’t interested in long-form content. By identifying key moments and topics discussed in your podcast, you can create bite-sized clips and videos that are more digestible. Plus, having long-form content that’s well produced arms you with plenty of future clips to use. That’s where automated video creation comes in. Make no mistake, there’s a big difference between linking your podcast in your Instagram Bio and posting a 45-second highlight video with top-notch editing. If you’re making several pieces of long-form content every week (interviews, podcasts, etc.), sifting through hours of content to find highlights and memorable moments can quickly become time-consuming. By automating that process, you can regularly create custom, high-quality videos. As a result, you’ll add variety to your content, while being able to test unique marketing strategies quickly. For example, you can rapidly A/B test different format styles, or try two highlights against each other to see what resonates with your audience. 5 Tips for Automated Video Creation Before we dive into specific automated video creation tools, it’s important to understand how your automated video creation journey should unfold. Savvy marketers always develop a clear plan of attack for marketing initiatives, so we’re walking you through the general checkpoints of the automation process. 1. Determine Your Automated Video Creation Priorities Before you choose a platform, establish your video creation objectives. If you want to test a specific format, find platforms that support that testing. Beyond that, determine what features will serve your team best. If your marketing team has little to no experience with automated video creation, a tool that prioritizes ease of use can make the video creation process easier. Marketing teams with plenty of video creation experience might need automation tools that offer more customization. 2. Decide on a Platform As you narrow down your search, take a closer look at how each platform functions. Some platforms offer limited features aimed at supporting brands with little to no video marketing budget. Other platforms want to support your marketing efforts from start to finish. While many of these platforms sound similar, they focus on different elements that can elevate your content creation. 3. Upload Your Content So, you’ve established your video creation priorities, and you’ve chosen your platform. Now you can actually create your content. Upload your video and let the tool start to work its magic. If you’re focused on automating as much of the experience as possible, you won’t need to do much other than confirming certain edits. On the other hand, choosing a platform with plenty of depth means you’ll be able to customize your content fairly easily. 4. Choose Your Visual Elements When customizing your video content, visual elements like text animation effects can elevate the quality. Other effects like overlays and moving graphics can be implemented without much trouble, as long as you’re using the right automated video creation tool. Make sure your visual elements are consistent with your brand presentation. 5. Publish Your Content Once you’ve customized your content and created a high-quality video, it’s time to send your content live. With some tools, you’ll even be able to publish your content directly after editing. Instead of signing into each of your brand’s social media platforms, automation means you can post on all of them at the same time. 10 Tools for Automated Video Creation Now that you understand the process, it’s time to look at the automated video creation tools available. While many of these tools function similarly, they each have distinct features that make them unique. 1. Moovly Moovly prides itself on being a user-friendly, in-browser automated video creation tool. In addition, they offer a tool that doesn’t demand constant software updates or even any design skills. Looking for support with your footage-based videos? They can help. Want to experiment with cartoon or doodle styles? Moovly can create those videos, too. If you’re looking for a lightweight solution with plenty of customization options, Moovly might be the right tool for your brand. 2. Adobe Adobe’s priority when it comes to video creation is efficiency. Using AI technology, they save users time and effort when editing. Some of the more interesting features include auto reframing, where Adobe automatically reframes the subject of a video shot in widescreen when exporting to social platforms. Their AI also uses color match, changing your content’s color and light values, based on your customized reference point. To be clear, they aren’t just copying a specific color reference point onto your clips. Instead, the AI analyzes every selected clip and tweaks them until they properly match your reference point. 3. Wibbitz Wibbitz is an automated video creation tool that speeds up production by offering a variety of useful templates and one-click solutions. One feature marketers will appreciate is the easy customization options. Wibbitz provides users with access to logo watermarks, video intros and outros, text overlays, and a full-spectrum color palette. This automated video creation platform lets you maximize your reach by converting your best videos into impactful social media videos. 4. Kamua Another browser-based tool, Kamua claims their product will have you working nearly 90 percent faster, without any previous video editing experience. They also feature automatic captioning in over 60 languages, saving you from having to transcribe hours and hours of content. Kamua’s AutoCut feature actually automates video edits, by finding cut points in your content and letting you decide what to keep. Plus, their AutoCrop feature instantly turns your YouTube videos into TikTok videos. 5. Typito If you’re limited by a modest marketing budget, Typito could be a great automated video creation tool. Not only is it free to start with, but each of their pricing plans are designed with reasonable budgets in mind. Of course, it’s worth figuring out exactly what Typito is offering. They provide an easy drag and drop editor and a brand kit, along with 600,000 free images and over 500 free templates. 6. Rocketium Rocketium understands the digital media landscape is constantly shifting. That frequent change demands an approach to marketing that’s as flexible as it is accurate. That’s why Rocketium aims to accomplish two goals. Eliminating repetitive creative work is their first goal, saving brands the hassle of creating completely new content for new campaigns. From there, Rocketium aims to make targeted marketing even easier. They use an AI copywriter to help you craft the right visual for different products and unique target audiences. Teams with demanding content calendars should take a look at this tool. 7. Animaker Developing unique creative content within an automation tool might not sound optimal, but tools like Animaker prove it’s certainly within their power. Armed with their templates, you can make a video in five minutes, according to their official website. 8. OFFEO OFFEO’s appeal can be broken down into four subsections. Their near limitless supply of assets means that users will have access to hundreds of templates. Being easy to use and browser based, OFFEO lets you animate your content, leveraging the skill of their professional designers to provide you with high-quality animation. 9. Magisto As an end-to-end video marketing tool, Magisto aims to support users at every stage of the marketing process. When it comes to creation, you can expect the support of a computerized video editor. Magisto lets you host and distribute video content on your website using their native player. Take those optimized videos and then use engagement analytics to gain clarity about your marketing initiatives. 10. InVideo For the truly budget-conscious, InVideo offers some fantastic automated video creation support, absolutely free.

Absolutely, you can! With the help of AI, you can begin automating your video editing, as much or as little as you’d like. How can I add subtitles to a video automatically? There are plenty of tools that can do this for you, some offering support in over 60 languages. Do I need video editing experience? While it’s certainly a positive, there are several user-friendly platforms that don’t require any previous editing or design experience. Do I have to pay for an automated video creation tool? Not always! Some tools are completely free; the only drawback is they lack some key features. Automated Video Creation Conclusion No matter what industry you’re in, there’s no getting around the fact that audiences want quality content. If your brand doesn’t produce something new and exciting on a regular basis, you run the risk of losing your audience’s attention. Instead of trying to constantly reinvent the wheel, consider using an automated video creation platform to break in-depth content down into digestible clips and share them on social media. It might seem like a simple solution, but it’s a powerful way to offer more consistent content, expand your reach, and potentially create a genuine moment of engagement with your audience.

If you want my team to just do your marketing for you, click here. Author: Neil Patel | Co Founder of NP Digital & Owner of Ubersuggest Video content creation can be a massive headache. I get it. Even for seasoned marketers, creating compelling content is a challenge. The real uphill battle is trying to create that level of content regularly. That’s why we’re taking a closer look at automated video creation and some of the best tools your brand can use to expand its content strategy. Here’s the thing—automated content doesn’t have to be terrible. When you produce an hour-long, high-quality interview, you’ve also produced several pieces of smaller, high-quality content. All you have to do is repackage those valuable tidbits and present them to your audience. Here’s how. What Is Automated Video Creation? Automated video creation is the act of using video editing software to automatically create short, interesting videos you can use for marketing and promoting your content. Let’s say you recorded a podcast this week and released it to your audience. You received decent engagement, but you quickly noticed a problem. Many of your viewers aren’t watching the entire podcast. Some viewers love to sit and consume two hours of content at once. Others want minute-long highlight clips, and simply aren’t interested in long-form content. By identifying key moments and topics discussed in your podcast, you can create bite-sized clips and videos that are more digestible. Plus, having long-form content that’s well produced arms you with plenty of future clips to use. That’s where automated video creation comes in. Make no mistake, there’s a big difference between linking your podcast in your Instagram Bio and posting a 45-second highlight video with top-notch editing. If you’re making several pieces of long-form content every week (interviews, podcasts, etc.), sifting through hours of content to find highlights and memorable moments can quickly become time-consuming. By automating that process, you can regularly create custom, high-quality videos. As a result, you’ll add variety to your content, while being able to test unique marketing strategies quickly. For example, you can rapidly A/B test different format styles, or try two highlights against each other to see what resonates with your audience. 5 Tips for Automated Video Creation Before we dive into specific automated video creation tools, it’s important to understand how your automated video creation journey should unfold. Savvy marketers always develop a clear plan of attack for marketing initiatives, so we’re walking you through the general checkpoints of the automation process. 1. Determine Your Automated Video Creation Priorities Before you choose a platform, establish your video creation objectives. If you want to test a specific format, find platforms that support that testing. Beyond that, determine what features will serve your team best. If your marketing team has little to no experience with automated video creation, a tool that prioritizes ease of use can make the video creation process easier. Marketing teams with plenty of video creation experience might need automation tools that offer more customization. 2. Decide on a Platform As you narrow down your search, take a closer look at how each platform functions. Some platforms offer limited features aimed at supporting brands with little to no video marketing budget. Other platforms want to support your marketing efforts from start to finish. While many of these platforms sound similar, they focus on different elements that can elevate your content creation. 3. Upload Your Content So, you’ve established your video creation priorities, and you’ve chosen your platform. Now you can actually create your content. Upload your video and let the tool start to work its magic. If you’re focused on automating as much of the experience as possible, you won’t need to do much other than confirming certain edits. On the other hand, choosing a platform with plenty of depth means you’ll be able to customize your content fairly easily. 4. Choose Your Visual Elements When customizing your video content, visual elements like text animation effects can elevate the quality. Other effects like overlays and moving graphics can be implemented without much trouble, as long as you’re using the right automated video creation tool. Make sure your visual elements are consistent with your brand presentation. 5. Publish Your Content Once you’ve customized your content and created a high-quality video, it’s time to send your content live. With some tools, you’ll even be able to publish your content directly after editing. Instead of signing into each of your brand’s social media platforms, automation means you can post on all of them at the same time. 10 Tools for Automated Video Creation Now that you understand the process, it’s time to look at the automated video creation tools available. While many of these tools function similarly, they each have distinct features that make them unique. 1. Moovly Moovly prides itself on being a user-friendly, in-browser automated video creation tool. In addition, they offer a tool that doesn’t demand constant software updates or even any design skills. Looking for support with your footage-based videos? They can help. Want to experiment with cartoon or doodle styles? Moovly can create those videos, too. If you’re looking for a lightweight solution with plenty of customization options, Moovly might be the right tool for your brand. 2. Adobe Adobe’s priority when it comes to video creation is efficiency. Using AI technology, they save users time and effort when editing. Some of the more interesting features include auto reframing, where Adobe automatically reframes the subject of a video shot in widescreen when exporting to social platforms. Their AI also uses color match, changing your content’s color and light values, based on your customized reference point. To be clear, they aren’t just copying a specific color reference point onto your clips. Instead, the AI analyzes every selected clip and tweaks them until they properly match your reference point. 3. Wibbitz Wibbitz is an automated video creation tool that speeds up production by offering a variety of useful templates and one-click solutions. One feature marketers will appreciate is the easy customization options. Wibbitz provides users with access to logo watermarks, video intros and outros, text overlays, and a full-spectrum color palette. This automated video creation platform lets you maximize your reach by converting your best videos into impactful social media videos. 4. Kamua Another browser-based tool, Kamua claims their product will have you working nearly 90 percent faster, without any previous video editing experience. They also feature automatic captioning in over 60 languages, saving you from having to transcribe hours and hours of content. Kamua’s AutoCut feature actually automates video edits, by finding cut points in your content and letting you decide what to keep. Plus, their AutoCrop feature instantly turns your YouTube videos into TikTok videos. 5. Typito If you’re limited by a modest marketing budget, Typito could be a great automated video creation tool. Not only is it free to start with, but each of their pricing plans are designed with reasonable budgets in mind. Of course, it’s worth figuring out exactly what Typito is offering. They provide an easy drag and drop editor and a brand kit, along with 600,000 free images and over 500 free templates. 6. Rocketium Rocketium understands the digital media landscape is constantly shifting. That frequent change demands an approach to marketing that’s as flexible as it is accurate. That’s why Rocketium aims to accomplish two goals. Eliminating repetitive creative work is their first goal, saving brands the hassle of creating completely new content for new campaigns. From there, Rocketium aims to make targeted marketing even easier. They use an AI copywriter to help you craft the right visual for different products and unique target audiences. Teams with demanding content calendars should take a look at this tool. 7. Animaker Developing unique creative content within an automation tool might not sound optimal, but tools like Animaker prove it’s certainly within their power. Armed with their templates, you can make a video in five minutes, according to their official website. 8. OFFEO OFFEO’s appeal can be broken down into four subsections. Their near limitless supply of assets means that users will have access to hundreds of templates. Being easy to use and browser based, OFFEO lets you animate your content, leveraging the skill of their professional designers to provide you with high-quality animation. 9. Magisto As an end-to-end video marketing tool, Magisto aims to support users at every stage of the marketing process. When it comes to creation, you can expect the support of a computerized video editor. Magisto lets you host and distribute video content on your website using their native player. Take those optimized videos and then use engagement analytics to gain clarity about your marketing initiatives. 10. InVideo For the truly budget-conscious, InVideo offers some fantastic automated video creation support, absolutely free. While there are certain features locked behind paid subscriptions, there are plenty of tools available to users on the free plan. You can export 60 videos per month, with a maximum duration of 15 minutes. Transcription is automatic, as well as over 4,500 handcrafted templates. You’ll even have access to branding presets, intros, outros, and team sharing. If you’re on the fence about automated video creation tools, feel free to try InVideo out and see how it improves your marketing efforts. Automated Video Creation FAQs Can you automate video editing? Absolutely, you can! With the help of AI, you can begin automating your video editing, as much or as little as you’d like. How can I add subtitles to a video automatically? There are plenty of tools that can do this for you, some offering support in over 60 languages. Do I need video editing experience? While it’s certainly a positive, there are several user-friendly platforms that don’t require any previous editing or design experience. Do I have to pay for an automated video creation tool? Not always! Some tools are completely free; the only drawback is they lack some key features. Automated Video Creation Conclusion No matter what industry you’re in, there’s no getting around the fact that audiences want quality content. If your brand doesn’t produce something new and exciting on a regular basis, you run the risk of losing your audience’s attention. Instead of trying to constantly reinvent the wheel, consider using an automated video creation platform to break in-depth content down into digestible clips and share them on social media. It might seem like a simple solution, but it’s a powerful way to offer more consistent content, expand your reach, and potentially create a genuine moment of engagement with your audience.

Music Addition: The script adds royalty free background music to the video. Final Video Creation: The generated video components are combined into a final video, which is saved as an MP4 file. Of course, I used GPT 4 to help code almost everything. Now I can create decent-ish videos at the click of a button. If you try doing anything like this, make sure to follow the OpenAI content policies https://openai.com/policies/sharing-publication-policy and the policies of any other AI tools you use. Make sure to manually fact check everything you create and post using AI. What do you think we need to do to prepare for the incoming flood AI generated content? It's going to happen soon and it's going to be weird.

invideo ai, invideo v3, invideo v3.0, sora, sora ai, runway ml, ai text to video 77 comments okay guys I just found a YouTube channel that's making $88,000 per month using nothing but AI tools and the craziest part they're doing it with simple educational videos that take less than an hour to make look at these numbers this channel aperture has grown to over 2.39 million subscribers their latest video The Man Who solved Life Hit 115,000 views in just 3 days and videos like brain rot doesn't have to control you are pulling in over 600,000 views if we go ahead and sort their videos by popular we can see an entire Library of videos that are getting Millions upon millions of views I spent 24 hours analyzing their entire Channel and what I discovered is absolutely gamechanging they're using AI Tools in a way I've never seen before and today I'm going to show you exactly how to recreate three of their most viral videos while other creators are spending weeks on research and editing you'll be able to create these videos in minutes I know it sounds impossible but watch this here's a video I made in just 15 minutes that's just as good as apertures viral hits in the vast expanse of the cosmos what defines the IAL of existence imagine a civilization so advanced IT defies our very understanding of life itself in this video I'll show you exactly how to create content like this from finding viral topics to generating professional videos with AI we're going to break down three specific videos that got them millions of views so before we get into creating the first video let me introduce the tool we are going to use to create these videos the tool I've been using is nid AI version 3 to get started open up their website I'll leave a link in the description below and make sure to select version 3.0 in the menu right here instead of version 2.0 once you've got that selected I want you to click on explore all flows right here once you do that you'll see all the possibilities open up and you can see that there's a lot to be done you've got AI shorts 15-second Clips script video screenplay animated ads Tik Tok Shop videos explainer videos anime style videos Minecraft animations now let's just start off simple let me show you how you can create a stoic Style video just like their most popular one so first we need to ensure the right mode is selected for that go to your text command and right below that click on workflows and now I will choose the one called documentary since I think it is the appropriate one for this topic now to keep things simple as we're just starting out I'll select 3 minutes for the duration of our video next up we need to describe our topic this is basically where you tell the AI what type of video you want to make now for this I've actually been using chat GPT basically I asked it to create a prompt for a video about a story that will be made about stoicism I will also mention the fact that I want this video to have dark Vibes as it perfectly fits the stoic Niche if you want to use that prompt structure too I will drop it below anyway I'm going to copy this paste that in right there and that's that now just know you can also just do the prompt yourself just in nid Ai and it will also create a story line and all of that good stuff for you I just prefer to have super accurate inputs and that's why I do this all right now next up you have to choose the style now by default if you came through one of the workflows that style will be selected so we've got clation however you can can obviously click on this drop- down menu here and choose any other style you want and then Additionally you can add all of these other things such as background music language captions and the list goes on whichever one you want to add you want to click on the plus icon so I'm going to click on language and make sure it's set in English if I want to change it to any other language just know that it's possible simply select the one you'd like to go with and that goes for any of the additional features you know what to have precise control over our final product I want to configure the voice over right away so click right here on voice voice actors button now I will set it to be male voice would be the one called heavy Northern English voice and then make sure you have the narrator selected now what is very important is that you click on media preference and then here you want to change only use stock media to only generated media by doing this you'll make sure that they're not taking any footage from their b-roll library but instead they're only going to use generative AI to get your movie done which is exactly what we want to do so I'm going to select that and there we go I'm just going to go with this and see what we get what the AI is now going to do is analyze are prompt as soon as all of that is done it's going to ask us some audience preferences and that looks like this I can now select the type of audience I want to create this video for now complete the remaining settings I will select the following options and now let's move on to see the result imagine for a moment you're standing amidst ancient Greek ruins at dawn the Golden Light washing over crumbling Stone what if I told you that right here over 2,000 years ago a philosophy was born that could change your life today must say that looks really good I mean let's analyze this there's an actual story line the overall aesthetic just looks really good the colors are absolutely amazing in my opinion this turned out just the way it should have however let's say that you're not happy with something that it created for example scene number one the opening in my opinion can be a lot better I want to actually replace this with something else and so what you would do is click on the edit button right there and then you want to select a clip that you would like to replace so I am going to select clip number one just like that I can then then click on generative media on the right hand side then check the duration of this clip which is 3 seconds click on generate media in the top left and then I'm going to describe a scene so just type in a prompt of your new shot and what you want to see once you've given it that prompt you want to click generate a clip just like that and it's then going to adjust the video and there we go so it actually did that and it's quite a cool shot I must say remember to click on replace and then save changes in order to actually apply these changes and just so you know you can customize every scene just like that and the same goes for music if you click on music script if you click on script and you've also got the settings button which is brand new this basically allows you to control anything there is to your video so you've got overlay presets transitions text the volumes everything there is including each voiceovers character it's all in here all right so that was fun we got a stoic video out of the way but let's do some more work let's go back to our model Channel I will scroll down a bit and I really love this video called Butterfly Effect if we click into it we can see that it's just a bunch of abstract B- rolls with with nature and random cinematic shots well this video got over 3 million views and I believe it has to do with its catchy title because obviously the butterfly effect is a famous concept but anyway let's go back to nid and for this topic I want to go with animated video the idea here is to create an educational video for kids that demonstrates the concept of a butterfly effect I want to create a story that vividly teaches that there are consequences to everything and essentially everything you do today will come back to you in the future and with that in mind we simply want to Pivot it into a lesson that teaches kids to be mindful and respectful in general I know it sounds dramatic but that's the point I really just want to get creative here and see what we can really come up with and so with that prompt done it's set to only use generated media I can now click on continue and actually generate the video but before we do it is going to give you these options as you can see so just watch me answering these should be pretty basic and let's click generate and see what we get have you ever heard of the butterfly effect it's the idea that one tiny action can change the whole world meet Lily she's about to learn how powerful her choices can be one morning Lily helps her little brother tie his shoes looks awesome however now I want to add captions and it is actually so simple after your video is generated you can just go in here and write add English captions at the bottom of the screen now click generate and let's see the updated result have you ever heard of the butterfly effect it's the idea that one tiny action can change the whole world all right now all of that was fun but now I actually want to put this AI tool to the test let's go big and see what it can actually do there is this workflow called hyper realistic film now let's again go back to our model Channel and there is a particular video they have which I think is just perfect for this case the video is called the most advanced civilization in the universe so with that in mind let's go back to our workflow and type out our idea then I'm going to choose that it should only use generated media and then I will keep the style as the one that is selected by default and so the language I will set to English the voiceover should be a male with a clear American voice and that is it I'm going to click continue so as you can see when it comes to generating movies and films it offers you whopping 10 minutes as Max duration but I will go with 1 and 1/2 minutes just to get the results faster I will also select science fiction for the audience obviously keep it YouTube and let's [Music] proceed in the vast expanse of the cosmos what defines the Pinnacle of existence imagine a civiliz ation so advanced IT defies our very understanding of life itself they harvest the energy of entire galaxies bending the fabric of SpaceTime to their will Stellar nurseries become their playgrounds black holes their tools their technology indistinguishable from Magic reshapes reality on a whim okay what an amazing video we just watched now let's say you want to enter International markets with your AI generated movies and produce it in multiple languages guess what you can simply type in translate The Voice over to Spanish and add Spanish captions as well now click generate and let's see the applied [Music] changes now let's just talk about pricing really quick you can try nid AI but if you do want to use this new AI generative capability it does have a monthly fee so I actually bought the one that is $96 a month this is the plan that allows you to make these generative AI fully animated videos and if you're already using nid AI for other projects that are not the AI animated ones you can actually just go to the add-on section and get generative seconds here this will save you hundreds of dollars that you would otherwise spend on editing animating and other production costs so go ahead and grab this deal while it's still around with my custom link down below and if you want to see even more ways to use inv video AI I actually made a video last month where I broke down eight different ways to use it in your content creation from crafting cinematic ads to creating clips that look like they're out of a Hollywood Blockbuster just click on the screen now to watch that next",

#vlogmas2024 16 comments [Music] good morning happy day 22 holy cow I can't believe that this is almost over I'm kind of sad I'm also actually I'm feeling really good today cuz I'm getting the sense of things like coming to a close for the year I am looking at doing some planning stuff for next year today I'm finishing up projects today as I'm filming this is a Friday and then I'm heading to the weekend before Christmas I'm planning to take some time off which is really great so things are feeling really nice and like getting wrapped up into a bow I am good morning Kent I am just about to have my morning vlogmas time and I think I'll probably select one of these colors cuz I've got two of this like Bluey green left and then one purple and one pink wild I finished my Square so early yesterday that it almost felt like I didn't even make a square yesterday so I think I'll get that started for the day and then I have a final sakas IG live later and yeah today's going going to be a good [Music] day I have had a very productive morning as far as work goes and also with knitting since we did an Instagram live our last Instagram live for socas today I was knitting the entire time on my sock Miss socks and then I just watched through two different videos and I was also knitting on socks for that I was watching through videos that K had edited so I am now repeating colors I've made it through my 24 that was my 24th stripe and so let's see I started at the top with this really light green into this like bright green and that's exactly where I am down here and then same thing I'm actually a little bit further on this sock here and I am into my third set of 20 rows on my foot I usually do about 60 is rows on my foot it depends on what type of heel I'm doing so with a fish lips kiss heel I usually do like 60 to 65 rows I actually need to look at my patterns because I can't or at my rivalry notes because I can't remember I haven't done a sock like that's kind of vanilla in a little while so I need to look and check but I am getting a lot of progress done I've done at least two stripes today which was my goal so if I don't touch those the rest of the day that's totally fine I think I'll be good to do two stripes today uh done with two stripes today but do two stripes tomorrow about and then do the toes the following day and I'll be done before Christmas and before vlogmas is over which is like yes super super great so I am about to pack up my things and I am going to take myself to a coffee shop and do some planning for next year there I kind of like to do this for like big planning types of things because it just makes it feel a little bit special and I know this is a task that I would maybe continue to put off for a while if I was doing it at home just because it feels kind of big and overwhelming and also like not quite necessary yet because it's not next year yet but I know that if I take the time to do some brainstorming I'm going to be thinking about like what kinds of make aongs I want to do for the next year things I might want to do in the love and stitches membership um events that I want to make sure that I go to for next year and just kind of mapping that out is is going to help me so much more to reach those goals and if I had no plan at all so I'm very much looking forward to this I've been looking forward to it all week

They didn’t get there by managing every little detail themselves. They built a system that lets them focus on the big picture while their channels are run by the best YouTube automation tools. ‍ So, I decided to figure out how to use AI to run my YouTube channel on autopilot. Here’s what you need to do: What is YouTube Automation? In simple terms, YouTube automation is a process where content creators streamline or even outsource parts of their video-making process to save time and boost productivity. In simple terms, it means using tools or services to handle repetitive tasks—like video editing, keyword research, thumbnail creation, or even video scripts—so the creator can focus more on strategy and growth. ‍ Imagine you want to run a YouTube channel without doing everything yourself. ‍ With YouTube automation, you might hire a scriptwriter, use an AI tool to edit videos, or automate your social media posting for each new upload. ‍ Some creators even build whole channels without appearing on camera by using voiceovers and stock footage. ‍ Dave Nick, a YouTuber with 934,000 subscribers, explains: “YouTube automation is taking a business approach to YouTube. ‍ Instead of being the face of the channel, recording videos, and editing them yourself, you create faceless content that earns revenue from ads, sponsorships, and digital products. ‍ You don’t need to be on camera, edit videos, or even be involved in the creation process at all. ‍ To automate a YouTube channel, you have two options Use AI tools to handle everything Outsource the work and simply steer the ship Today, I’m going to guide you through the first option—using AI tools to run a successful YouTube channel without breaking the bank on outsourcing. ‍ Let’s jump right in! Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up YouTube Automation Starting with YouTube automation can feel overwhelming. But you don’t need to overthink it. Just follow the steps below, and you’ll be on your way to a successful YouTube channel. Choose the Right Niche When picking a YouTube niche, don’t just chase ad revenue. You need millions of views to make serious money, unless you’re in a high-traffic niche like MrBeast’s. Relying on YouTube’s algorithm is risky. ‍ Instead, I want control over my channel, so I can cash in whenever I want. If YouTube changes its algorithm, I’m still in charge, leveraging my audience and content for new opportunities. ‍ Take my example: I chose the business and marketing niche because it offers: High CPM: Up to $13.52 per 1,000 views, according to TubeBuddy, by focusing on topics like making money online and digital marketing. Multiple Revenue Streams: Brand sponsorships, freelance opportunities, and even courses on marketing and business. Professional Alignment: It sharpens my professional skills and improves my profile. Not sure about your niche? Ask yourself: Am I passionate about this niche? Can this niche provide multiple income streams beyond ads? Do I have enough knowledge in this niche to create valuable content? If you’re curious about different niches, take a look at the video below! Choosing a niche you enjoy with long-term potential is key to staying motivated. YouTube can take 2-3 years to gain traction, so avoiding burnout is crucial. ‍ MrBeast spent 10 years in his niche before going viral. ‍ Still can’t define yours? ‍ Then… ‍ Start creating, experiment, and you’ll find it. ‍ Did I choose \"marketing and business\" when I first started out? ‍ Nope! ‍ I tried different jobs, created content for other businesses, and managed multiple channels of my own. ‍ I kept planning, testing, and creating until I found the niche that aligned with my passion, what I do well, and what the market pays for. ‍ That’s how I stayed motivated until my channel finally took off. Create Content Ideas Now that you've chosen your niche, most will tell you to start with the channel name, but I suggest a different approach. First, think about the main topics you want to cover. ‍ For example, if your niche is business and marketing like mine, break it down into 5 key topics: How to Make Money Online: Explore side hustles, new business models, and remote jobs. Marketing Strategies: Share tips on marketing and how to monetize those skills. Freelancing Tips: Offer advice on excelling as a freelancer and reaching the top of your field. Investing on a Budget: Teach how to start investing with little money and grow wealth over time. Business Success Stories: Highlight business journeys, including challenges and wins. These topics will provide value, keep you motivated, and help you grow as an expert. ‍ As your channel grows, you can start monetizing early by offering services like YouTube consulting or selling digital products, such as business guides or Notion templates. ‍ The reason I list out 5 topics for my channel is to avoid burnout. Many content creators struggle with whether to niche down or niche up. ‍ For me, it’s all about balance. Niche down for laser focus and growth in the beginning, then niche up within that area to keep learning and creating without losing interest. Craft Content Plan Once you have your core 5 topics, the next step is developing a content plan. Use ChatGPT to brainstorm content ideas, hashtags, and keywords for a month, three months, or even a year. This will give you a roadmap, so you’re never stuck wondering what content to create next. ‍ You can use the following prompt for ChatGPT: ‍ “I need help developing a content strategy for my brand in the [niche]. My main platform is YouTube. I need you to develop content ideas specifically for YouTube. For example, I’m in the business and marketing niche, and I’ve created a video titled, '6 Ways to Earn Money Online for People with No Experience!' That’s the type of content I want. Create [Number] content ideas for YouTube. Generate [necessary information] like titles, outlines, and ideas that stand out in my niche.” ‍ For example: ‍ \"I need help developing a content strategy for my business and marketing brand. I use YouTube as my main platform and need 10 content ideas with video outlines and titles. Make these ideas relevant and competitive.” After ChatGPT generates a list of ideas, do some competitive research. ‍ Look at successful videos in your niche and note their titles. This ensures ChatGPT’s ideas align with content that’s proven to perform well on YouTube. Finding that balance between creativity and what works is key! ‍ Now that you have your niche, strategy, monetization plan, and content roadmap, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and bring your plan to life. Let's move on to the execution phase! Set Up Your Channel Simply create a Google account and pick a name for your YouTube channel. ‍ Then, upload a profile picture and banner that align with your niche and content focus. You can easily customize a template you like using Canva. And just like that, you're ready to roll! ‍ For example, if your channel is about marketing, you might use a name like \"JennyMarketing.\" Pair this with a professional banner and a clear, concise description of what your channel offers. How to create content With your list of content ideas in hand, you're ready to start making videos. ‍ But it's easier said than done. Long-time YouTuber MatPat retired in 2021, citing burnout from over a decade of nonstop content creation. ‍ Many veteran creators feel similar pressures ​(Creator Handbook). ‍ Creating videos means you have to write a script, edit footage, add a voiceover, sprinkle in some sound effects, and find the right music. ‍ It’s a time suck, and if you're not experienced, it can take weeks just to produce one video. ‍ I don’t want that tedious process to crush your dream, so here’s my secret to keeping your motivation sky-high and seeing results within the first few months. ‍ Creating a faceless YouTube video boils down to five key ingredients: Script Voice-over Visuals Music Captions Image source Script Writing a full script isn’t just time-consuming; it’s also tricky if you don’t have much writing experience. But with Zebracat, you just need to drop your content idea into the platform, and Zebracat will generate a script for you. You’ll even get three scripts to choose from, so you can pick the one that fits best, tweak it, or add your own touch. ‍ Influencer List Widget Create videos from text in 1 minute! 85% of your audience craves more video. They don't want to read—they want to watch, feel, and engage. In just 60 seconds, Zebracat transforms your text into fully edited videos that get your audience hooked. No editing skills required! Your browser does not support the video tag. Try Zebracat for Free ‍ If you want to try creating a script with ChatGPT instead, use this prompt: ‍ \"Your task will be to write my short script for my short video on YouTube. First read these scripts I wrote. Tell me how I write and create a style guide to use in the new script. Make the style guide include what kind of words I use, my sentence length, my tone and style and structure.

Optimize Videos for SEO Yay! You’ve made awesome content, but just posting isn’t enough. You need to make it SEO-friendly if you want your video to blow up: Use a title with keywords people search for. You don’t want it lost in the crowd! Add trending hashtags. They help the algorithm know what your video is about. Make a thumbnail that grabs attention and makes people want to click. Use video chapters so viewers can easily follow along. To automate all of this, you can use tools like TubeBuddy or VidIQ. Personally, I use TubeBuddy because it’s super affordable—just $2.50/month, or around $1.80/month with a discount code if you pay yearly. ‍ TubeBuddy helps you save keywords when researching your competitors and keeps track of your content ideas. ‍ When you add their plugin and watch any YouTube video, it shows you metrics like the channel’s SEO score, hashtags, and keywords used in the title and description. ‍ You can also save competitors' hashtags directly to your TubeBuddy account and easily add them to your videos. No more manually checking lists or files—just pick the hashtag file you want, and your content is instantly SEO optimized. Image Source ‍ And if you're unsure what keywords or title to use for your next video, just search in TubeBuddy’s Keyword Explorer. ‍ It ranks keywords from most to least searched and links you to competitor videos. It’s super efficient. You can see which content from your competitors ranks for each keyword and which videos have the most views, all in the dashboard! With all of these tools, you can already automate your YouTube channel right now! But if you’re curious about what other tools can help you grow your YouTube automation channel, check out “Best AI Tools to Create Faceless Videos in 2025.” ‍ Best Practices and Tips for Effective Automation Automated content creation can feel overwhelming if you try to tackle everything at once. It’s tempting to want all the benefits right away, but trust me, taking it step by step will save you from headaches. Start Small and Scale When I first started using automation, I wanted to fix everything at once—scheduling, editing, SEO, all of it. But it felt like trying to clean an entire messy house in one hour. I ended up frustrated and back where I started. ‍ The better way? Tackle one room at a time. Start with the thing that’s draining your energy the most. For me, it was editing. So, I used Zebracat to create videos faster without getting stuck in the tiny details. Once that was under control, I moved on to SEO and started using TubeBuddy for tags and titles. ‍ This way, I could actually see progress. And honestly? Seeing that one part of my process was smoother gave me the motivation to keep going. ‍ You don’t need to automate everything right away. Pick one small thing, make it work, and then build from there. ‍ Take it slow, and you’ll feel the difference. Bit by bit, your channel will run smoother, and you’ll get back the time you thought you’d lost forever. Regularly Check Automated Processes Even the most reliable systems need regular check-ups. ‍ Think of your best YouTube automation tools as a well-tended garden; without consistent care, weeds can overtake the beauty. Regularly reviewing your automated processes ensures they align with your channel's goals and adapt to any changes. ‍ For example, if you've automated video uploads or SEO tasks, periodically assess whether the metadata generated remains relevant. ‍ Trends evolve, and outdated tags or descriptions can negatively impact your visibility. Tools like VidIQ can alert you to shifts in your niche, allowing you to adjust your strategy accordingly. Balance Automation with Human Touch YouTube workflow automation is a powerful tool, but it shouldn't replace your unique voice and creativity. Viewers connect with authentic content. ‍ While platforms like Zebracat can streamline video creation, adding personal elements—such as responding to comments or hosting live Q&A sessions—keeps your audience engaged. ‍ Brands combining automation with human interaction saw higher engagement rates than those relying solely on automation. Use automation to handle repetitive tasks, freeing up time for activities that require your personal touch. ‍ \"Automation is great for the grunt work,\" I often say, \"but the heart of your channel—the connection with your audience—should always come from you.\" Maintain Consistency with Branding Think about your best friend. They’ve got their signature style—maybe it’s a favorite hoodie or those worn-out sneakers they always wear. ‍ Then one day, they show up in a sharp suit and fancy shoes. You’d stop and stare, right? Not because they look bad, but because it doesn’t feel like them. ‍ That’s exactly how your audience feels when your branding suddenly changes. If your thumbnails, fonts, or tone aren’t consistent, it throws them off. It feels like they’ve landed on someone else’s channel, and that trust you’ve built starts to fade. ‍ Automation can help you keep things steady. Tools like Zebracat make it easy to create templates for intros and outros that match your style every time. Use the same colors, fonts, and layout so your audience always knows it’s you. Track and Adjust Based on Analytics Automation without checking your numbers is like driving with your eyes closed—you might be moving, but you have no idea where you’re going. Take time to look at your channel’s performance. Tools like YouTube Studio show you what’s working, like how long people watch your videos or how often they click on your thumbnails. If some videos don’t click with your audience, tweak your approach and create more of what they love. FAQs ‍ How Does Automation Affect YouTube Channel Engagement? Picture this: You’re throwing a party. You’d want everyone to feel welcome, right? Automation can help with stuff like managing the guest list or sending reminders, but if it’s overdone, people might feel like they’re just another name on a list. ‍ Same deal with YouTube—automation can make posting videos and handling comments easier, but too much can make your channel feel... kinda impersonal. People want to feel like there’s a real person behind the screen. If your replies seem automated, viewers might not stick around because they don’t feel valued. What Are the Risks of Automating YouTube Content? Automation’s a time saver, but it’s not perfect. Think of it like a double-edged sword. ‍ On one side, it helps you get things done faster, but on the other, it can mess things up if you’re not careful. For example, you might accidentally post something irrelevant or poorly timed if you’re not watching closely. ‍ Overdoing automation can also make your channel feel robotic—like sending a pre-printed birthday card instead of a handwritten one. It’s just... meh. People come to YouTube for the personal vibe, so don’t lose that! How Can I Automate Responses to Comments on YouTube? Automating responses is like having a helpful friend at your party who greets people and answers basic questions. Tools like YouTube’s moderation features or bots can handle stuff like “Thanks for watching!” or FAQs. ‍ But here’s the thing: not every comment should get an automated reply. Sprinkle in some real responses to—it shows your viewers you’re paying attention and that they matter. A mix of both works best! Is It Possible to Automate Live Streams on YouTube? You can totally automate parts of your live streams!. Tools like OBS Studio or Streamlabs can help schedule streams or set up graphics automatically. But here’s the kicker: live streams are all about interacting with your audience in real time. So, while you can automate the setup, you still need to be there, chatting and connecting with your viewers. That’s what makes live streams awesome. Can I Automate Ad Placement in My YouTube Videos? Yes, you can. You don’t have to do anything—YouTube already places ads automatically on your videos. ‍ However, if you want to control what types of ads appear, how many should show up, where they should appear, and when they should play, you’ll need to set it up yourself or hire a virtual assistant to do it for you. ‍ This process can be quite time-consuming, and so far, there aren’t any tools to automate this. But I’ll keep you updated if anything changes! ‍ But don’t go overboard with ads. Too many can annoy viewers and make them click away. Keep a balance—ads should work with your content, not ruin the vibe. ‍ Conclusion While AI can automate your YouTube channel entirely, I still recommend keeping an eye on it to maintain authenticity. ‍ AI is powerful and has a lot of potential, but it's still in its early stages and can’t fully replace you. Don’t ignore your content completely. The best way to grow long-term is to create a lot of worthwhile videos with Zebracat and keep monitoring your channels to bring your channel to the next level. ‍ Influencer List Widget Create videos from blog post in 1 minute! 85% of your audience craves more video.

They didn’t get there by managing every little detail themselves. They built a system that lets them focus on the big picture while their channels are run by the best YouTube automation tools. ‍ So, I decided to figure out how to use AI to run my YouTube channel on autopilot. Here’s what you need to do: What is YouTube Automation? In simple terms, YouTube automation is a process where content creators streamline or even outsource parts of their video-making process to save time and boost productivity. In simple terms, it means using tools or services to handle repetitive tasks—like video editing, keyword research, thumbnail creation, or even video scripts—so the creator can focus more on strategy and growth. ‍ Imagine you want to run a YouTube channel without doing everything yourself. ‍ With YouTube automation, you might hire a scriptwriter, use an AI tool to edit videos, or automate your social media posting for each new upload. ‍ Some creators even build whole channels without appearing on camera by using voiceovers and stock footage. ‍ Dave Nick, a YouTuber with 934,000 subscribers, explains: “YouTube automation is taking a business approach to YouTube. ‍ Instead of being the face of the channel, recording videos, and editing them yourself, you create faceless content that earns revenue from ads, sponsorships, and digital products. ‍ You don’t need to be on camera, edit videos, or even be involved in the creation process at all. ‍ To automate a YouTube channel, you have two options Use AI tools to handle everything Outsource the work and simply steer the ship Today, I’m going to guide you through the first option—using AI tools to run a successful YouTube channel without breaking the bank on outsourcing. ‍ Let’s jump right in! Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up YouTube Automation Starting with YouTube automation can feel overwhelming. But you don’t need to overthink it. Just follow the steps below, and you’ll be on your way to a successful YouTube channel. Choose the Right Niche When picking a YouTube niche, don’t just chase ad revenue. You need millions of views to make serious money, unless you’re in a high-traffic niche like MrBeast’s. Relying on YouTube’s algorithm is risky. ‍ Instead, I want control over my channel, so I can cash in whenever I want. If YouTube changes its algorithm, I’m still in charge, leveraging my audience and content for new opportunities. ‍ Take my example: I chose the business and marketing niche because it offers: High CPM: Up to $13.52 per 1,000 views, according to TubeBuddy, by focusing on topics like making money online and digital marketing. Multiple Revenue Streams: Brand sponsorships, freelance opportunities, and even courses on marketing and business. Professional Alignment: It sharpens my professional skills and improves my profile. Not sure about your niche? Ask yourself: Am I passionate about this niche? Can this niche provide multiple income streams beyond ads? Do I have enough knowledge in this niche to create valuable content? If you’re curious about different niches, take a look at the video below! Choosing a niche you enjoy with long-term potential is key to staying motivated. YouTube can take 2-3 years to gain traction, so avoiding burnout is crucial. ‍ MrBeast spent 10 years in his niche before going viral. ‍ Still can’t define yours? ‍ Then… ‍ Start creating, experiment, and you’ll find it. ‍ Did I choose \"marketing and business\" when I first started out? ‍ Nope! ‍ I tried different jobs, created content for other businesses, and managed multiple channels of my own. ‍ I kept planning, testing, and creating until I found the niche that aligned with my passion, what I do well, and what the market pays for. ‍ That’s how I stayed motivated until my channel finally took off. Create Content Ideas Now that you've chosen your niche, most will tell you to start with the channel name, but I suggest a different approach. First, think about the main topics you want to cover. ‍ For example, if your niche is business and marketing like mine, break it down into 5 key topics: How to Make Money Online: Explore side hustles, new business models, and remote jobs. Marketing Strategies: Share tips on marketing and how to monetize those skills. Freelancing Tips: Offer advice on excelling as a freelancer and reaching the top of your field. Investing on a Budget: Teach how to start investing with little money and grow wealth over time. Business Success Stories: Highlight business journeys, including challenges and wins. These topics will provide value, keep you motivated, and help you grow as an expert. ‍ As your channel grows, you can start monetizing early by offering services like YouTube consulting or selling digital products, such as business guides or Notion templates. ‍ The reason I list out 5 topics for my channel is to avoid burnout. Many content creators struggle with whether to niche down or niche up. ‍ For me, it’s all about balance. Niche down for laser focus and growth in the beginning, then niche up within that area to keep learning and creating without losing interest. Craft Content Plan Once you have your core 5 topics, the next step is developing a content plan. Use ChatGPT to brainstorm content ideas, hashtags, and keywords for a month, three months, or even a year. This will give you a roadmap, so you’re never stuck wondering what content to create next. ‍ You can use the following prompt for ChatGPT: ‍ “I need help developing a content strategy for my brand in the [niche]. My main platform is YouTube. I need you to develop content ideas specifically for YouTube. For example, I’m in the business and marketing niche, and I’ve created a video titled, '6 Ways to Earn Money Online for People with No Experience!' That’s the type of content I want. Create [Number] content ideas for YouTube. Generate [necessary information] like titles, outlines, and ideas that stand out in my niche.” ‍ For example: ‍ \"I need help developing a content strategy for my business and marketing brand. I use YouTube as my main platform and need 10 content ideas with video outlines and titles. Make these ideas relevant and competitive.” After ChatGPT generates a list of ideas, do some competitive research. ‍ Look at successful videos in your niche and note their titles. This ensures ChatGPT’s ideas align with content that’s proven to perform well on YouTube. Finding that balance between creativity and what works is key! ‍ Now that you have your niche, strategy, monetization plan, and content roadmap, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and bring your plan to life. Let's move on to the execution phase! Set Up Your Channel Simply create a Google account and pick a name for your YouTube channel. ‍ Then, upload a profile picture and banner that align with your niche and content focus. You can easily customize a template you like using Canva. And just like that, you're ready to roll! ‍ For example, if your channel is about marketing, you might use a name like \"JennyMarketing.\" Pair this with a professional banner and a clear, concise description of what your channel offers. How to create content With your list of content ideas in hand, you're ready to start making videos. ‍ But it's easier said than done. Long-time YouTuber MatPat retired in 2021, citing burnout from over a decade of nonstop content creation. ‍ Many veteran creators feel similar pressures ​(Creator Handbook). ‍ Creating videos means you have to write a script, edit footage, add a voiceover, sprinkle in some sound effects, and find the right music. ‍ It’s a time suck, and if you're not experienced, it can take weeks just to produce one video. ‍ I don’t want that tedious process to crush your dream, so here’s my secret to keeping your motivation sky-high and seeing results within the first few months. ‍ Creating a faceless YouTube video boils down to five key ingredients: Script Voice-over Visuals Music Captions Image source Script Writing a full script isn’t just time-consuming; it’s also tricky if you don’t have much writing experience. But with Zebracat, you just need to drop your content idea into the platform, and Zebracat will generate a script for you. You’ll even get three scripts to choose from, so you can pick the one that fits best, tweak it, or add your own touch. ‍ Influencer List Widget Create videos from text in 1 minute! 85% of your audience craves more video.

Try Zebracat for Free ‍ If you want to try creating a script with ChatGPT instead, use this prompt: ‍ \"Your task will be to write my short script for my short video on YouTube. First read these scripts I wrote. Tell me how I write and create a style guide to use in the new script. Make the style guide include what kind of words I use, my sentence length, my tone and style and structure. Include what makes my writing unique [Include example posts]” ‍ After that, chatGPT will give you this result: Once ChatGPT analyzes your style and gives you a guide, you can start feeding it content ideas or drafts. From there, ChatGPT will craft an engaging script that matches the style and tone you’ve provided, making the script feel like your own. ‍ And if you’re curious about the other AI tools I use to create viral scripts that still feel human—without spending hours—check out Best AI Apps for Content Creators in 2025.

They help the algorithm know what your video is about. Make a thumbnail that grabs attention and makes people want to click. Use video chapters so viewers can easily follow along. To automate all of this, you can use tools like TubeBuddy or VidIQ. Personally, I use TubeBuddy because it’s super affordable—just $2.50/month, or around $1.80/month with a discount code if you pay yearly. ‍ TubeBuddy helps you save keywords when researching your competitors and keeps track of your content ideas. ‍ When you add their plugin and watch any YouTube video, it shows you metrics like the channel’s SEO score, hashtags, and keywords used in the title and description. ‍ You can also save competitors' hashtags directly to your TubeBuddy account and easily add them to your videos. No more manually checking lists or files—just pick the hashtag file you want, and your content is instantly SEO optimized. Image Source ‍ And if you're unsure what keywords or title to use for your next video, just search in TubeBuddy’s Keyword Explorer. ‍ It ranks keywords from most to least searched and links you to competitor videos. It’s super efficient. You can see which content from your competitors ranks for each keyword and which videos have the most views, all in the dashboard! With all of these tools, you can already automate your YouTube channel right now!

It’s tempting to want all the benefits right away, but trust me, taking it step by step will save you from headaches. Start Small and Scale When I first started using automation, I wanted to fix everything at once—scheduling, editing, SEO, all of it. But it felt like trying to clean an entire messy house in one hour. I ended up frustrated and back where I started. ‍ The better way? Tackle one room at a time. Start with the thing that’s draining your energy the most. For me, it was editing. So, I used Zebracat to create videos faster without getting stuck in the tiny details. Once that was under control, I moved on to SEO and started using TubeBuddy for tags and titles. ‍ This way, I could actually see progress. And honestly? Seeing that one part of my process was smoother gave me the motivation to keep going. ‍ You don’t need to automate everything right away. Pick one small thing, make it work, and then build from there. ‍ Take it slow, and you’ll feel the difference. Bit by bit, your channel will run smoother, and you’ll get back the time you thought you’d lost forever. Regularly Check Automated Processes Even the most reliable systems need regular check-ups. ‍ Think of your best YouTube automation tools as a well-tended garden; without consistent care, weeds can overtake the beauty. Regularly reviewing your automated processes ensures they align with your channel's goals and adapt to any changes. ‍ For example, if you've automated video uploads or SEO tasks, periodically assess whether the metadata generated remains relevant. ‍ Trends evolve, and outdated tags or descriptions can negatively impact your visibility. Tools like VidIQ can alert you to shifts in your niche, allowing you to adjust your strategy accordingly. Balance Automation with Human Touch YouTube workflow automation is a powerful tool, but it shouldn't replace your unique voice and creativity. Viewers connect with authentic content. ‍ While platforms like Zebracat can streamline video creation, adding personal elements—such as responding to comments or hosting live Q&A sessions—keeps your audience engaged. ‍ Brands combining automation with human interaction saw higher engagement rates than those relying solely on automation. Use automation to handle repetitive tasks, freeing up time for activities that require your personal touch. ‍ \"Automation is great for the grunt work,\" I often say, \"but the heart of your channel—the connection with your audience—should always come from you.\" Maintain Consistency with Branding Think about your best friend. They’ve got their signature style—maybe it’s a favorite hoodie or those worn-out sneakers they always wear. ‍ Then one day, they show up in a sharp suit and fancy shoes. You’d stop and stare, right? Not because they look bad, but because it doesn’t feel like them. ‍ That’s exactly how your audience feels when your branding suddenly changes. If your thumbnails, fonts, or tone aren’t consistent, it throws them off. It feels like they’ve landed on someone else’s channel, and that trust you’ve built starts to fade. ‍ Automation can help you keep things steady. Tools like Zebracat make it easy to create templates for intros and outros that match your style every time. Use the same colors, fonts, and layout so your audience always knows it’s you. Track and Adjust Based on Analytics Automation without checking your numbers is like driving with your eyes closed—you might be moving, but you have no idea where you’re going. Take time to look at your channel’s performance. Tools like YouTube Studio show you what’s working, like how long people watch your videos or how often they click on your thumbnails. If some videos don’t click with your audience, tweak your approach and create more of what they love. FAQs ‍ How Does Automation Affect YouTube Channel Engagement? Picture this: You’re throwing a party. You’d want everyone to feel welcome, right? Automation can help with stuff like managing the guest list or sending reminders, but if it’s overdone, people might feel like they’re just another name on a list. ‍ Same deal with YouTube—automation can make posting videos and handling comments easier, but too much can make your channel feel... kinda impersonal. People want to feel like there’s a real person behind the screen. If your replies seem automated, viewers might not stick around because they don’t feel valued. What Are the Risks of Automating YouTube Content? Automation’s a time saver, but it’s not perfect. Think of it like a double-edged sword. ‍ On one side, it helps you get things done faster, but on the other, it can mess things up if you’re not careful. For example, you might accidentally post something irrelevant or poorly timed if you’re not watching closely. ‍ Overdoing automation can also make your channel feel robotic—like sending a pre-printed birthday card instead of a handwritten one. It’s just... meh. People come to YouTube for the personal vibe, so don’t lose that! How Can I Automate Responses to Comments on YouTube? Automating responses is like having a helpful friend at your party who greets people and answers basic questions. Tools like YouTube’s moderation features or bots can handle stuff like “Thanks for watching!” or FAQs. ‍ But here’s the thing: not every comment should get an automated reply. Sprinkle in some real responses to—it shows your viewers you’re paying attention and that they matter. A mix of both works best! Is It Possible to Automate Live Streams on YouTube? You can totally automate parts of your live streams!. Tools like OBS Studio or Streamlabs can help schedule streams or set up graphics automatically. But here’s the kicker: live streams are all about interacting with your audience in real time. So, while you can automate the setup, you still need to be there, chatting and connecting with your viewers. That’s what makes live streams awesome. Can I Automate Ad Placement in My YouTube Videos? Yes, you can. You don’t have to do anything—YouTube already places ads automatically on your videos. ‍ However, if you want to control what types of ads appear, how many should show up, where they should appear, and when they should play, you’ll need to set it up yourself or hire a virtual assistant to do it for you. ‍ This process can be quite time-consuming, and so far, there aren’t any tools to automate this. But I’ll keep you updated if anything changes! ‍ But don’t go overboard with ads. Too many can annoy viewers and make them click away. Keep a balance—ads should work with your content, not ruin the vibe. ‍ Conclusion While AI can automate your YouTube channel entirely, I still recommend keeping an eye on it to maintain authenticity. ‍ AI is powerful and has a lot of potential, but it's still in its early stages and can’t fully replace you. Don’t ignore your content completely. The best way to grow long-term is to create a lot of worthwhile videos with Zebracat and keep monitoring your channels to bring your channel to the next level. ‍ Influencer List Widget Create videos from blog post in 1 minute! 85% of your audience craves more video.
