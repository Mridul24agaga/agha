Let’s face it – if you landed on this page, it’s highly likely that you already know what dofollow backlinks are… But for the uninitiated, dofollow backlinks may sound like a growth hacking jargon but they are simply the hyperlinks you see all over the web. Hyperlinks link one webpage to another, and they can be: Internal – linking one webpage on the same website to another webpage on the same site. External – linking a webpage to another webpage on a different website. An example of an internal link would be if we linked to our own blogpost about the LinkedIn Shadow Ban for example. If another website links to your website, this constitutes a dofollow backlink. Not only are these dofollow backlinks handy from a user experience point of view, they also have implications for a websites online visibility. This is because the Google-bots and search engine crawlers use them to decide whether the information on your website is important or not… Suddenly, this just got a whole lot more interesting! Why dofollow backlinks matter? The entire purpose of SEO is to improve a website’s ranking on Google for keywords relevant to the company or brand. Your ranking is determined by the Google algorithm, but how does Google decide which websites to put on its first page of results for a specific search phrase? Well, Google uses over 200 ranking factors to determine which pages are shown for any given search. “SEO juice” is the term marketers have affectionately coined to describe any factor that can help a website gain domain authority. And dofollow backlinks are packed full of “SEO juice”! So, to clarify, having a lot of dofollow backlinks will help you rank for competitive keywords. Dofollow backlinks essentially ‘lend’ you authority from external websites. Therefore, if a lot of websites are ‘pointing’ to you, the Google-bots will understand that your content is important and thus should be shown to internet users. As such, dofollow backlinks are crucial for improving search ranking and driving organic traffic from Google! This is especially important for a new business with a small digital footprint and no budget for advertising. Dofollow backlinks also have benefits unrelated to SEO: Referral Traffic: Think of them as word-of-mouth marketing but online. A link to your website from a page with high traffic can provide you with a constant stream of traffic as people click through to your page. Brand Authority: a dofollow backlink means your website is being recognized, implying that your website is trustworthy, thus affecting customer perception. Build Business Relationships: a backlink is an opportunity to connect with another website. If your product offering is complimentary, it may be the beginning of a strong business partnership. Brand Awareness: Seeing your website linked on other websites can introduce your brand to new potential customers, the ultimate goal of digital marketing! How can I get dofollow backlinks? Let’s be clear – building a solid backlink profile is not the easiest task, but their importance cannot be overstated. Perhaps that sounds dramatic, but they are simply THAT important! “Preach” – the Klint Marketing team Don’t worry though, all hope is not lost! However, on the road to building a strong profile of organic backlinks there is an industry standard for what not to do: Use paid backlink services – more often than not these tend to be scammy and may end up negatively affecting your domain rating as Google recognises a cheat in the system. Outreach to big publishers – technically you could email Forbes and ask for a backlink, but in our experience they are rarely willing to just hand out a free dofollow backlinks. Get backlinks from irrelevant sites – the value of a backlink is dependent on the synergy between the websites, (ie. they should serve the same industry). Don’t just target everyone… Hack into sites to inject your backlinks – yep, some people do it. Backlinks are that valuable! But getting caught is a fast pass to losing more than just domain authority. This sounds like a lot, but Google explains that backlink building is supposed to be a time and energy-consuming process – getting too many backlinks at once can also be flagged as scammy behavior by the Google bots. But what if we told you there is an easier way? And it works!

Written By Andy Parker  Uncategorized  June 21, 2021 If you’re hunting for dofollow backlinks, this is the list for you! Growing your domain authority can be a long journey, and collecting dofollow backlinks can be tough, especially if you’re just starting out and still have a low domain rating. Anyone working with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) knows the value of powerful dofollow backlinks. A solid backlink profile is one of the best ways to expediate the process of building domain authority and thus dramatically increasing your site’s organic traffic. Are you an SEO pro? Then skip ahead to our list of DOFOLLOW BACKLINKS THAT WORK! Curious about why they matter? Then continue reading… Table of Contents Toggle What are dofollow backlinks? Why dofollow backlinks matter? How can I get dofollow backlinks? Getting dofollow backlinks made easy Let’s build your powerful backlink profile! Profile Pages with dofollow backlinks Content listing sites that allow dofollow backlinks Image galleries with dofollow backlinks Dofollow backlinks in Startup Directories Product pages with dofollow backlinks Review sites that provide dofollow backlinks Dofollow Backlinks in Local Listings Marketplaces that contain dofollow backlinks Dofollow backlinks on Social Media Platforms Video Sharing SEO backlink list Crowdfunding Dofollow Backlinks SaaS Directories for dofollow backlinks Comment sections that allow dofollow backlinks Dofollow Backlinks on Community Sites Link Listing sites with Dofollow Backlinks Online Portfolios Forums Job exchange platforms Blog Distribution Build a Powerful backlink profile Share your Dofollow Backlinks with us What are dofollow backlinks? Let’s face it – if you landed on this page, it’s highly likely that you already know what dofollow backlinks are… But for the uninitiated, dofollow backlinks may sound like a growth hacking jargon but they are simply the hyperlinks you see all over the web. Hyperlinks link one webpage to another, and they can be: Internal – linking one webpage on the same website to another webpage on the same site. External – linking a webpage to another webpage on a different website. An example of an internal link would be if we linked to our own blogpost about the LinkedIn Shadow Ban for example. If another website links to your website, this constitutes a dofollow backlink. Not only are these dofollow backlinks handy from a user experience point of view, they also have implications for a websites online visibility. This is because the Google-bots and search engine crawlers use them to decide whether the information on your website is important or not… Suddenly, this just got a whole lot more interesting! Why dofollow backlinks matter? The entire purpose of SEO is to improve a website’s ranking on Google for keywords relevant to the company or brand. Your ranking is determined by the Google algorithm, but how does Google decide which websites to put on its first page of results for a specific search phrase? Well, Google uses over 200 ranking factors to determine which pages are shown for any given search. “SEO juice” is the term marketers have affectionately coined to describe any factor that can help a website gain domain authority. And dofollow backlinks are packed full of “SEO juice”! So, to clarify, having a lot of dofollow backlinks will help you rank for competitive keywords. Dofollow backlinks essentially ‘lend’ you authority from external websites. Therefore, if a lot of websites are ‘pointing’ to you, the Google-bots will understand that your content is important and thus should be shown to internet users. As such, dofollow backlinks are crucial for improving search ranking and driving organic traffic from Google! This is especially important for a new business with a small digital footprint and no budget for advertising. Dofollow backlinks also have benefits unrelated to SEO: Referral Traffic: Think of them as word-of-mouth marketing but online. A link to your website from a page with high traffic can provide you with a constant stream of traffic as people click through to your page. Brand Authority: a dofollow backlink means your website is being recognized, implying that your website is trustworthy, thus affecting customer perception. Build Business Relationships: a backlink is an opportunity to connect with another website. If your product offering is complimentary, it may be the beginning of a strong business partnership. Brand Awareness: Seeing your website linked on other websites can introduce your brand to new potential customers, the ultimate goal of digital marketing! How can I get dofollow backlinks? Let’s be clear – building a solid backlink profile is not the easiest task, but their importance cannot be overstated. Perhaps that sounds dramatic, but they are simply THAT important! “Preach” – the Klint Marketing team Don’t worry though, all hope is not lost! However, on the road to building a strong profile of organic backlinks there is an industry standard for what not to do: Use paid backlink services – more often than not these tend to be scammy and may end up negatively affecting your domain rating as Google recognises a cheat in the system. Outreach to big publishers – technically you could email Forbes and ask for a backlink, but in our experience they are rarely willing to just hand out a free dofollow backlinks. Get backlinks from irrelevant sites – the value of a backlink is dependent on the synergy between the websites, (ie. they should serve the same industry). Don’t just target everyone… Hack into sites to inject your backlinks – yep, some people do it. Backlinks are that valuable! But getting caught is a fast pass to losing more than just domain authority. This sounds like a lot, but Google explains that backlink building is supposed to be a time and energy-consuming process – getting too many backlinks at once can also be flagged as scammy behavior by the Google bots. But what if we told you there is an easier way? And it works! Let’s learn more… Getting dofollow backlinks made easy We know how difficult it is to get dofollow backlinks, and that’s why we put together this list of the best sites that provide free organic backlinks!

So, thought I'd write a very timely, 2023 edition on how to do outreach that gets you links these days. The problem: a LOT of the link-building guides are outdated or just impractical.

Everyone and their pet dog do this kinda outreach, and bloggers/site owners just kinda don't care anymore. I've built over 1,000 links in the past year for several client websites and learned a TON in the process. In this post, I'll do a very comprehensive review of link-building in 2023 and explain what really works. Table of contents (yes, this'll be a long way. Grab a coffee.

(If you loved this post, I run a no-bs SEO subreddit, r/seogrowth, check it out!) Should I do link-building in the first place? Starting with the most important question here: do you need link-building at your current stage? You should ONLY do link-building once you have: A solid SEO strategy in place A decent number of blog posts / resources Otherwise, you'll be building links on hard more, and you won't be generating results that are good enough for it to the worth your while. You should also avoid SEO as a marketing channel overall unless you're ready to commit to long-term work. While it IS possible to sometimes get results within 1-3 months of SEO work, those cases are pretty rare. If you need revenue TOMORROW or you go bankrupt, try content marketing, PPC, direct sales, email marketing, or any other channel. Now that we've got that out of the way... The BS There is a TON of outdated info about link-building on the net. Here's what DOESN'T work these days: Forum link-building. Most forums no-follow all outgoing backlinks. Web 2.0 links. People spamming their links on Reddit are 100% wasting their time. Google can tell a user-generated content site apart from all other sites. Hence, links from Reddit, Medium, etc. are devalued big-time. Blog comment links. Most blogs no-follow blog comment links, so that's a waste of time too. PBNs (ish). Well-built PBNs work just fine. The PBNs you bought from some sketchy forum, though, will crash your site big time. And before some of you go: \"But Jigsaw, I build web 2 links and rank just fine!\" Sure you do! But you're most likely not ranking because you've been building web 2/blog comment/whatever links. If you were building REAL backlinks, you'd rank faster. Another common misconception is that paying for links is going to get you penalized or it just doesn't work. The reality: Unless you're buying sketchy links, or you're building links in a sketchy way (e.g. building 20 links to ONE page exclusively in a short timeframe), there's no way for Google to tell a backlink was paid for. A lot of industries are just pay-to-play and nothing else. If you're in CBD, forex, gambling, etc. you'll 100% have to pay for backlinks or your competitors are going to outrank you big-time. So what DOES work? Real links from real, topically related websites. E.g. if you run a fitness site, you'd benefit from getting links from the following sites: Authoritative fitness blog/media Small-time yoga blog Weight loss blog/media/site You get the drift. As long as the site publishes topically related content to yours, then that's a good link prospect. Media backlinks also work even if they're not topically related. E.g. Mashable, Forbes, etc. Some green flags that a backlink is high quality are: Their site is driving 1,000+ traffic from Google Site publishes genuine, high-quality content Site does NOT publish dozens of guest posts per month or sells backlinks en masse Site has NOT been penalized lately (i.e. they didn't lose a big chunk of their traffic) Site does NOT publish backlinks/guest posts from gambling sites They have an \"about us\" page & there's a real person behind the blog/site Link-building is niche-dependant Before we dive into the actual process, thought this was important to cover. How you do link-building SERIOUSLY depends on your niche. #1. If you're blogging about, say, yoga then it'll be much easier than. There are a TON of blogs that are topically related to yours and can link back to your site: - Fitness blogs - Yoga blogs - Weight loss blogs These sites are also a lot more approachable. They're usually run by amateurs and w/ a good personalized email, they'll be happy to link to you. #2. If you're blogging in B2B, on the other hand, things are a bit more give-and-take. Websites will want something from you for a backlink. Usually, that's: - A high-quality guest post - Partnership in some way - Direct or indirect backlink exchange So tl;dr, link-building in B2B is mostly relationship-building. #3. If you're in a competitive niche (CBD, VPN, etc.) then it's pay-to-play. A good outreach game will definitely help, but you'll have to pay a good $ for them to place your backlinks. The link-building process Now let's talk practice! The typical link-building process, from a top-down perspective, looks like this: You come up with a link-building campaign type. At this stage, you decide on what you're pitching / promoting. For your campaign to be more successful, you want to promote a useful resource or blog post. People are hella more likely to link to your resources than your product pages. Also, I wouldn't recommend building links unless you already have some content / SEO strategy in place. VA collects link-building prospects based on certain criteria. E.g. blogs about, say, scrapbooking, tech reviews, whatever. Lots of ways to do this, but I'll cover it in detail below. VA finds the right point of contact for each prospect. They extract their email / contact info using some tool. Copywriter creates a personalized outreach template for the campaign. You DO NOT want to copy-paste something from the internet. Link-building specialist starts the outreach campaign. They keep track of responses and do what they need to do to secure link placements. Let's go through each step of this process one by one: 1. Campaign type ================= The most common types of link-building campaigns are: Link insertions Guest posts Broken link-building Unlinked mention 3 and #4 are very situational and require their own approach, so we'll skip that entirely. Same with guest posts. Those require a bit more manual emailing and pitching, so let's push that off for another time. But tl;dr here is this: you review the website's guest posting policy and get a content writer to create a tailored pitch. In this post, let's stick to link insertions since that's the most scalable tactic. You don't need a fresh guest post written for every backlink you want to build. Now, from there, you want to create a cool resource that people will want to link to. Some good examples: Infographic they can insert into an existing blog. e.g. Top 21 Benefits of Weight-Lifting As Proven by Science Long-form content. E.g. Top 101 Productivity Tips from Top Professionals Fresh research. E.g. We surveyed 1,000 of our users about their dating preferences. Here are our findings. Unique tool. E.g. Free tool to analyze your competitor's backlink profile in a click. Not sure what's a good link magnet for your niche? Run your competitors through Ahrefs and check their Top Pages by Links. You'll see which of their pages are driving the most backlinks. Once you've got your link magnet down, time for step 2: 2. Link prospecting ==================== Your VA collects hundreds of prospects that fit your criteria. So step 1 - you HAVE TO have a VA do this. The process is extremely time-consuming and if you, as a founder, are spending time on this, you won't have much time for anything else. Now as for prospecting, there are a TON of ways to go about this. The tactics: Pick several blog categories that you'd benefit from getting backlinks from. E.g. fitness => yoga, weight loss, dieting niches, and so on. Prospect for such blogs w/ basic Google queries. E.g. \"yoga blog,\" \"diet blog,\" etc. Pick out articles that would benefit from a long to your resource. E.g. if you're promoting, say, a bachelor party checklist infographic, you can look up keywords about organizing bachelor parties and extract those prospects. \"Organize bachelor party,\" \"bachelor party ideas,\" \"bachelor party examples,\" etc. Pro tip - you're more likely to get backlinks from articles ranking on page 2+ VS ones ranking on page 1. Pick out articles that can organically mention your product(s). E.g. find articles about \"top X gifts for year Y anniversary\" Run your competitors through Ahrefs and extract their backlink profile. If someone linked to your competitor, chances are, they might link to you, too (as long as your email copy is good). Run sites that already link to you through Ahrefs/Semrush and extract their backlink profile(s). Small-time bloggers usually link to each other so chances are, these sites will be willing to link to you, too. Most of these can either be done manually by a VA, automated via ScrapeBox or Link Assistant, or by using Pitchbox. 3. Finding the point of contact ================================ This one's pretty simple. Your point of contact depends on the size of the site: Big media => you want to contact the author of the post specifically Company of any size => you want to contact the head of content, editor-in-chief, or head of digital marketing Personal or small-time blog => owner of the blog Teach your VA how to find the right point of contact. From there, they can use Hunter to find the email of the contact. If Hunter does NOT find the email, you can simply find the email format (e.g. [firstname]@[company] dot com) and logically guess the email of a given prospect. Note: if you're reaching out to small blogs, general emails like info @ company dot com can still work. If you're reaching out to a company, though, or a media, general email basically means that no one's going to read your outreach. 4. Creating personalized email copy ==================================== One of the most common mistakes people make with link-building is copy-pasting a template from the internet. They read an article on link-building on some top blog like Ahrefs or Backlinko, find a template, copy-paste, send it to 200 people, and wonder why it didn't work. Here's why: Literally, everyone does the same exact thing. It goes a little something like this: \"Hey [Name], I just stumbled on your blog while looking for articles about [topic]. I (totally for real for real) read your article and it's like, really really cool! But you know what it's lacking? A link to my site, eyyy. Pls link?\" Bloggers/site owners get a TON of these emails. It's SO DAMN GENERIC that even if you're pitching the best resource ever created, you'll get ignored. So what you gotta do is create your own template for any given campaign you're pushing. Here are some tips on how to create great outreach copy: For your subject line: Mention the prospect's name/site name. E.g. [Name], recipes in [site] are mouthwatering! Tailor it to the niche. E.g. [name], I'm stuck in bronze, send help Make it look like a personal email. E.g. Question, [name]? Intro - [name] <> [name], etc. And the rest for your body copy: Give a compliment about their site/content that FEELS like a genuine compliment, but applies to most of your prospect list (sorry not sorry). E.g. \"Your recipes are mouthwatering! I'm planning on giving [latest recipe] a try for dinner with my [wife/husband]\" Mention jokes/references that someone in that niche might find funny or punny. E.g. As a budding green thumb enthusiast, I wanted to take a moment to leaf you a message and hopefully plant a few seeds of inspiration. Make it about something they mentioned in their post. Get a VA to make a custom column and add details from the post. E.g. \"Your post about 10-anniversary gifts really saved me in a clutch! I'm planning on getting my missus a [gift from a listicle]\" Keep it human. No corpo lingo. Your outreach emails should look like something you're sending to your BFF. Finally, (preferably), don't include images or links in your outreach emails. They hurt deliverability. If you have to include a pitch to a resource, you can make an exception (or add a CTA for \"drop me a thumbs up and I'll send you the post\"). Optionally, at the end of the outreach email, you can add an offer of what you can give in exchange for that backlink. Some examples I've seen that work: We'll link back to your site from a future guest post on a third-party site. We'll share your content with our Twitter audience of X people. We're going to literally pay you money for the link. Let's do a backlink exchange. We'll give you free access to our software for X months. We'll give you X free credits to our SaaS tool. 5. And launch! =============== Once you've got your prospects and email copy ready to go, launch your campaign. Some info on the technical stuff re: the outreach process: Use a dedicated outreach domain. DO NOT use your main domain. Some peeps on the internet WILL report you for spam just because they had a bad day. If this happens, your email deliverability for your main domain will suffer. Instead, use a dedicated outreach domain. E.g. if your brand is \"brand dot com\", you can do \"brand PR dot com\" Use either Google Workspace, private email, Office 365, or Zoho to create those private emails. Use a tool to warm up the email. Such tools automatically send/open/reply to emails from new domains to \"warm them up.\" This helps improve the deliverability rates of your fresh emails. Warm up for around 2 weeks per inbox. Don't send more than 60 emails per day per email. Yes, this includes follow-ups. The more you go over this limit, the more likely it is for the inbox to get \"burned\" and your deliverability to tank. Speaking of follow-ups, do NOT do more than 2 follow-ups per email. If the prospect doesn't reply after 2 emails, they're probably not interested at this time. Finally, don't include links in your outreach emails. This helps improve deliverability. If you're pitching a resource, you can make an exception there (or you can add a CTA like, \"just drop me a thumbs-up and I'll send you a link\"). How to build backlinks when you're broke I've had a ton of people ask me about this before so thought I'd cover it in a dedicated section. In a niche where links cost cash AND you're broke? Fortunately, there are options to bypass that backlink sponsorship fee. Some solid tactics: Do value-based guest posting. Most guest posts people pitch are, practically speaking, trash. 500 words, 0 value, and usually AI-generated. Pitch your prospects your experience and expertise and offer a post that they can actually benefit from. Good example is picking out a keyword they want to target and writing a guest post targeting that. That's value! Use HARO, Terkel, or similar platforms. Basically, these are platforms that match journalists with sources. They're a great way to sometimes land very high authority backlinks, or build up some homepage backlinks without too much hassle/outreach. Make friends with other bloggers. For real. Follow them on Twitter or LinkedIn. Engage with their content. Then shoot them a DM and offer a backlink collaboration. E.g. link exchange, ABC link exchange, etc. Friendship is magic. While this approach is time-consuming, it's ideal if you're building a niche site and don't have a lot of existing backlinks. Best tools for building backlinks Now, let's talk tools. You ain't doing all this manually: Semrush/Ahrefs as a general SEO tool. You can use both to extract competitor backlink profiles. You can also use either to evaluate whether a certain site is a good backlink prospect. Outreach tool. If you're just getting started with link-building, Snov is the most value deal there is (comes with email warmup, email finder credits, outreach tool, etc.). If you're looking for the best-in-class tool, that would be Pitchbox. Must-have if you're building links at scale or run an agency. Hunter dot io is great for finding prospect emails. Link Assistant or Scrapebox for help with prospecting. Warmup Inbox for email warmup. MailGenius to check email health. Might've missed a couple, but this is the gist. You can also use ChatGPT to write your email first lines if you're feeling spicy. Think there was a dedicated tool for this too, though. FAQ Got more questions? I foresaw this with my third eye of truth and 3rd coffee of the day. Hence, the FAQ section. How many emails should I send per day? This depends on the niche. Estimate your win rate per 100 emails. Then, work backward from there. If you win 5 links from 100 emails, and you want 20 links a month, you need 400 emails sent per month. How long does it take for backlinks to kick in? Links impact your site 1-3 months after being built (usually). How can I calculate the ROI of my link-building? It's really hard to estimate the dollar value of a given link, so hard to figure out link-building ROI. That said, if links can take you from page 2 to the top 3 rankings for your target keyword, very good chance you'll get good ROI. If you're targeting the right keywords, anyway. This is literally why the catchphrase of SEO is \"well, maybe, yes, but sometimes no, it depends...\" Can I rank without backlinks? This depends on the niche. If there's not much competition, yeah, that's possible. Otherwise, link quality/quantity will determine if you rank top 3, or page 2. Links also determine how fast you'll rank. Will I get penalized for exchanging links? According to a study by Ahrefs, most top websites have reciprocal links. That's just how the internet works. Unless all you have is direct link exchanges with hundreds of sites, you should be good/safe. Google said paying for links is bad, what do? :( Paying for links is extremely common and most link-builders do it. If you're doing it smart, you won't get penalized / affected negatively in any way. How do I get backlinks from big media sites / authority sites? Either through connections or digital PR, but that's a completely different topic VS conventional link-building.

Members Online • DrJigsaw How to build backlinks without the BS - lessons learned from 1,000+ backlinks built Case Study I see a ton of posts here (and other subs) about how link-building is a total pain (which it totally is btw). So, thought I'd write a very timely, 2023 edition on how to do outreach that gets you links these days. The problem: a LOT of the link-building guides are outdated or just impractical. The skyscraper technique (hey, you linked to resource A, I have resource B, pls link to me) doesn't work anymore. Everyone and their pet dog do this kinda outreach, and bloggers/site owners just kinda don't care anymore. I've built over 1,000 links in the past year for several client websites and learned a TON in the process. In this post, I'll do a very comprehensive review of link-building in 2023 and explain what really works. Table of contents (yes, this'll be a long way. Grab a coffee.

Some examples I've seen that work: We'll link back to your site from a future guest post on a third-party site. We'll share your content with our Twitter audience of X people. We're going to literally pay you money for the link. Let's do a backlink exchange. We'll give you free access to our software for X months. We'll give you X free credits to our SaaS tool. 5. And launch! =============== Once you've got your prospects and email copy ready to go, launch your campaign. Some info on the technical stuff re: the outreach process: Use a dedicated outreach domain. DO NOT use your main domain. Some peeps on the internet WILL report you for spam just because they had a bad day. If this happens, your email deliverability for your main domain will suffer. Instead, use a dedicated outreach domain. E.g. if your brand is \"brand dot com\", you can do \"brand PR dot com\" Use either Google Workspace, private email, Office 365, or Zoho to create those private emails. Use a tool to warm up the email. Such tools automatically send/open/reply to emails from new domains to \"warm them up.\" This helps improve the deliverability rates of your fresh emails. Warm up for around 2 weeks per inbox. Don't send more than 60 emails per day per email. Yes, this includes follow-ups. The more you go over this limit, the more likely it is for the inbox to get \"burned\" and your deliverability to tank. Speaking of follow-ups, do NOT do more than 2 follow-ups per email. If the prospect doesn't reply after 2 emails, they're probably not interested at this time. Finally, don't include links in your outreach emails. This helps improve deliverability. If you're pitching a resource, you can make an exception there (or you can add a CTA like, \"just drop me a thumbs-up and I'll send you a link\"). How to build backlinks when you're broke I've had a ton of people ask me about this before so thought I'd cover it in a dedicated section. In a niche where links cost cash AND you're broke? Fortunately, there are options to bypass that backlink sponsorship fee. Some solid tactics: Do value-based guest posting. Most guest posts people pitch are, practically speaking, trash. 500 words, 0 value, and usually AI-generated. Pitch your prospects your experience and expertise and offer a post that they can actually benefit from. Good example is picking out a keyword they want to target and writing a guest post targeting that. That's value! Use HARO, Terkel, or similar platforms. Basically, these are platforms that match journalists with sources. They're a great way to sometimes land very high authority backlinks, or build up some homepage backlinks without too much hassle/outreach. Make friends with other bloggers. For real. Follow them on Twitter or LinkedIn. Engage with their content. Then shoot them a DM and offer a backlink collaboration. E.g. link exchange, ABC link exchange, etc. Friendship is magic. While this approach is time-consuming, it's ideal if you're building a niche site and don't have a lot of existing backlinks. Best tools for building backlinks Now, let's talk tools. You ain't doing all this manually: Semrush/Ahrefs as a general SEO tool. You can use both to extract competitor backlink profiles. You can also use either to evaluate whether a certain site is a good backlink prospect. Outreach tool. If you're just getting started with link-building, Snov is the most value deal there is (comes with email warmup, email finder credits, outreach tool, etc.). If you're looking for the best-in-class tool, that would be Pitchbox. Must-have if you're building links at scale or run an agency. Hunter dot io is great for finding prospect emails. Link Assistant or Scrapebox for help with prospecting. Warmup Inbox for email warmup. MailGenius to check email health. Might've missed a couple, but this is the gist. You can also use ChatGPT to write your email first lines if you're feeling spicy. Think there was a dedicated tool for this too, though. FAQ Got more questions? I foresaw this with my third eye of truth and 3rd coffee of the day. Hence, the FAQ section. How many emails should I send per day? This depends on the niche. Estimate your win rate per 100 emails. Then, work backward from there. If you win 5 links from 100 emails, and you want 20 links a month, you need 400 emails sent per month. How long does it take for backlinks to kick in? Links impact your site 1-3 months after being built (usually). How can I calculate the ROI of my link-building? It's really hard to estimate the dollar value of a given link, so hard to figure out link-building ROI. That said, if links can take you from page 2 to the top 3 rankings for your target keyword, very good chance you'll get good ROI. If you're targeting the right keywords, anyway. This is literally why the catchphrase of SEO is \"well, maybe, yes, but sometimes no, it depends...\" Can I rank without backlinks? This depends on the niche. If there's not much competition, yeah, that's possible. Otherwise, link quality/quantity will determine if you rank top 3, or page 2. Links also determine how fast you'll rank. Will I get penalized for exchanging links? According to a study by Ahrefs, most top websites have reciprocal links. That's just how the internet works. Unless all you have is direct link exchanges with hundreds of sites, you should be good/safe. Google said paying for links is bad, what do? :( Paying for links is extremely common and most link-builders do it. If you're doing it smart, you won't get penalized / affected negatively in any way. How do I get backlinks from big media sites / authority sites? Either through connections or digital PR, but that's a completely different topic VS conventional link-building.

No reason not to use them. 1. Internal Linking Yes, that’s right. Internal linking is something most people overlook, but internal linking is big. First internal links are something you have complete control of. Not only do internal links help you transfer link juice between your pages, they also help Google crawl your site faster. The first thing to do is look at all the relevant internal links to add to your pages right away with a tool like LinkStorm. This will already give a boost to your ranking. Note: Be careful with using targeted keywords in your site-wide links, as Google might treat this as a spam factor. Resources: MOZ’s on Internal links Internal Linking for SEO: Examples and Best practices The Seven Commandments of Internal Linking that Will Improve Content Marketing SEO 2. Friendly Blogrolls Ask your friends, employees, and colleagues to put a link in their “Friends” blogroll section. Note: Blogroll Etiquette It’s an unwritten rule in the blogosphere that if a blogger puts a link to your site in his blogroll, you should add that blog’s link on your own site. 3. Ask for Credit Whether you run an SEO agency, or you’re a freelancer, you should ask for credit from your clients or partners. For example, at WooGuru, we ask our clients if it’s OK to put “WooCommerce support by WooGuru” in the footer of their website. The best time to ask for this link is when a client is at his peak of happiness. Also, make it easy for them. Put the link on their site yourself or provide an embeddable HTML snippet with the link. 4. Ask Your Suppliers and Distributors If you’re buying products or services from someone, ask them to link to your site. Since you’re already paying them (although not for the link itself) your suppliers tend to be much more likely to link back to you, as they want to see you succeed. 5. Create Message Board Signatures Include a link to the site in your forum signature. Although mostly “no-follow”, these links can bring decent traffic to a site, and also, help you keep up with your natural link profile. Directories and Resources 6. Resource Pages Another old-school easy way to get links. Just use Google search parameters like: “keyword” + list, Try this – “keyword” + resources, “keyword” + tips, “keyword” + links, This is great as well – “keyword” + inurl: links. Depending on the vertical of your business, you should find at least a dozen solid link opportunities. More on the topic: How to Build Quality Links from Resources Pages How to: Get Links on Resource Pages 7. Directories Submit your site to niche-specific directories, blogger directories like AllTop or local business directories like GoldenPages. Be very careful with general web directories, as some of them are ridden with low-profile links and you don’t want to associate your site with them. An easy way to track if a directory is fine is by using the Moz Spam Score. Read more: The Ultimate List: 50 Online Local Business Directories 131+ Manually Verified Free Blog Directories To Submit Your Blog 8. Paid Directories Some premium directories that will ask you to pay to list your site on their site. The problem with them is it’s hard to distinguish which ones are worth the money. Resources: What are the best-paid directories today? Matt Cutts Explains How Google Handles Paid Directories [Video] 9. Web Design Galleries This type of directories deserves a place on their own because you can get some pretty serious traffic from them. This tactic works best if you have a unique, innovative design. Use a service like CSS Gallery list to get your site submitted to all web design galleries for 50 bucks. 10. Startup Directories There’s a number of startup-related directories that let you create your company profile. To name a few: Angel List, Crunchbase, and BetaList (if your startup is still in pre-launch stage). Resource: The Ultimate Guide to Getting Your Startup Listed Online Take Advantage of Existing Opportunities There are some hacks to score white hat backlinks that are just waiting to be taken. 11. Claim your Brand Mentions Use a service like Mention or Buzzsumo to track your brand name mentions. Make sure that your brand name links back to your site.

Spy on Competitors and get their Backlinks If your competition is a spot higher on the SERPs than you, they must be doing something right with their link building. You can use Linkody to find all your competitor’s backlinks. All you need to know is their websites and Linkody will do the rest. Find your competitors on Google or with SimilarWeb. Add them to Linkody. Linkody will find all your competitors’ backlinks. Reach out to the webmaster and say your tool would be a great addition to the site’s resources. Read the full guide on how to analyze your competitors’ backlinks and find great link building opportunities. You can also use SemRush as a way to spy on backlinks – it allows you to get inbound link data for any website: the number of backlinks, new & lost links, their type, referring domains, and more. 13. Convert Unhappy Customers Into Avid Brand Proponents Chances are there will be some negative comments, reviews or articles about your brand. Do your best to convert their negative voice into a positive one – offer them an exclusive discount, help them sort their problem, just give a crap. Read more: 5 Ways to Turn Your Unhappy Customer into a Valuable Resource How to Talk to Your Angriest Customers 14. Do a Google Reverse Image Search for Your Images Chances are someone is using your images if you have useful graphics or beautiful photography on your site. We live in the free Internet.. duh! Make sure to take a breath before you go all mad about it and think if you could use that as to claim a link to your site. 15. The Rebranding link opportunity method Most brands often change their names. Brian Dean has a great technique which he calls the Moving Man method to find link opportunities through this. It’s different from the broken link building method in that the links actually exist. They just re-direct to the new URL. However, since the anchor text and the site link points to the old domain, there’s an opportunity. Brian was able to achieve this with outdated BlueGlass links (an SEO agency) that went out of business. He reached out to all the site owners who had a link to BlueGlass with this mail. Image Source In order to discover such opportunities, you can search PR channels and search on Google about re brands. All such news results in your industry can get you links. 16. Incorporate Tweet this in your blogposts Often times we can inspire people to take action by asking them to specifically tweet a portion or nuggets of your post. These tweets can drive more tweets because the words are emotionally charged or contain something very important or interesting. They can drive social shares and mass links. 17. Make Sure Your White Hat Backlinks Point to the Proper Page Use Linkody to track if all your white hat backlinks are properly linking to the right page. If you have a link to 404 page there are 2 ways to approach the case, depending on the situation: Inform the site owner and re-purpose that link to a new page/ask them to correct the mistake in the URL. Use a redirection (301) to another page on your site. Content-based Opportunities These link-building tactics involve creating content to get a link. 18. Participate in Round-ups Thought leaders, experts, and influencers roundups are an excellent way to build credibility in your field and get a link. Of course, you must know a thing or two about your niche to get featured in them. The important thing to note is that once you participate in a few roundups, blog authors will start approaching you instead of you having to go to them. Almost every blogger wants to write a round-up post at some stage in their blog’s life, and the easiest targets are usually the people who are already participating in round-ups. 19. Create Round-ups This tactic works the same way as the previous one, except this time you’re putting together the expert roundup. Reach out to influencers in your field and ask them to contribute. Everybody wants to look good among other well-respected people. Once you put the round-up live, you can simply ask them to share or link to your post. More on the topic: The Ultimate Guide to Creating an Expert Roundup Post That Gets 1000s of Shares Getting 20,231 Views with One EPIC Roundup Post: A Step-by-Step Guide The Champion’s Guide to Outreach Marketing” eBook 20. Create video tutorials and share them on forums Most bloggers share their tutorials on forums either wholly or link to them. Linking doesn’t work that often since moderators remove those. Sharing an entire tutorial gives them little incentive to come back to your site. The thing that I have seen working time and again is sharing video tutorials. Branded with your blog’s name, with an outro slate providing a link back to your blog, these videos work magic in bringing visitors to your site. Video tutorials are often stuck to the relevant categories and send a nice trickle of traffic long after you’ve stopped promoting. The additional advantage is that there is no problem sharing an internal forum thread elsewhere on the forum. You can always prop up the thread if it’s relevant to the discussion. This technique works better and requires more effort than any other forum promotion technique that you might have heard. For the Internet marketing niche, the best forums for this would be Warrior Forum, Black Hat Forum, etc. 21. Guest Blogging Pitch bloggers with an idea for a blog post and ask them if they’re happy to publish it. If you’re just starting out with guest blogging, you will find better luck using one of the guest blogging networks like BloggerLinkUp and MyBlogGuest.com We usually use NinjaOutreach to send out emails and get contacts to sites where we could have a potential guest post opportunity. Resources: The Ultimate Guide to Guest Blogging List of Guest Blogging Sites (180+ best sites) The Definitive Guide to Guest Blogging 22. Offer Content Upgrades These tactics involve offering content upgrades like eBooks, reports, infographics, etc. to other sites. The reason content upgrades work so well is that: you can provide something exclusively for the site you’re pitching it’s much more scalable than guest posting Let’s say you wrote a big article on cats health. You can re-package the whole post as an eBook and offer it as an exclusive resource to a relevant site. Read more: How to Get Backlinks With Guestographics How to get your content featured on any big blog 23. Write Testimonials Nothing makes a person happier than seeing his clients using their products. Endorse the products you use and ask them to share your testimonial on their websites. More on the topic: How to get featured to 750,000 readers (and get your first 250 subscribers) 24. Write Case Studies This tactic is the same as the previous tip, except you go for more details and write a complete case study, describing how you use the product/service. Resources: Gleam Customer Success Stories 8 Tips For Creating a Great Case Study 25. Comment on Blogs With blog comments, you can get some no-follow links, which is perfectly fine but you can also find a decent amount of blogs that allow do-follow comments. Read more: Top Free High PR Dofollow Blog commenting sites list | 2016 A Massive List of 1,000 “Dofollow” CommentLuv Blogs 200+ High PR Dofollow Blog Commenting Sites list | Backlinks 2015 26. Participate in Communities Niche communities are a great place to bring more traffic to your site and get some links (usually no-follow). These could be everything from subreddits to smaller hubs like GrowthHackers.com for online marketing. Check out what you need to know about Reddit and SEO. 27. Answer Questions Answering questions on Quora and Yahoo Answers not only brings traffic to your site but also helps you build credibility as a thought leader in your business vertical. Read more: How to Leverage Q&A Sites to Generate Traffic How We Answer Quora Questions to Drive Traffic to Our Website 28. Inbound Link-building This works in a similar way to the round-up tactic except on a much bigger scale. Great examples are StartupStash and the Glossary of Internet Terms. StartupStash has over 1426 white hat backlinks from 185 domains: 29. Mention Influencers in Your Content This is the classic ego-bait tactic. By appealing to the egos of people, they’ll help you increase the exposure of your content. Egobait still works – just not like it used to, it’s not as effective to simply quote or link to an influencer praising their work; we’ve found that at this point if you want to see results (and leverage influencer marketing) you need to bring them into the conversation before you push publish. – Nick Eubanks, creator SEO Auv 30. Create a Free Tool Build a free plugin or browser extension to your main product or service. A great example is EmailHunter’s Chrome extension: Not only this could potentially attract white hat backlinks to your site, but your customer retention will increase. Here’s a wonderful case study how Hubspot with $6k investment in a Free Email Signature Generator made $64 million. 31. User-Generated Content People want to be the center of attention, and in control of what they’re doing. Create a platform for user-generated content. That could be a simple message board or Spotify’s interactive “year in music” personal music habits review. 32. Surveys Asking people for help could be very beneficial. The way surveys work is: Collect a decent amount of answers to your survey. Thank them for participating Ask them if they’d like to help your research by spreading the word with a link. 33. Funny Products and Games Everybody loves laughing. And everybody loves making other people laugh. This is a great way to generate a white hat backlinks. CSS Puns by Saijo George is a great example: 1288 total white hat backlinks from 259 domains. 34. Seasonable or Timed Content Leverage the power of ego-bait on a massive level: a national celebration or event. A great example is this infographic about the National Liberation Day, which collected over 3.5K shares in just a few days. Give Something If you have something to give away, this is probably one of the easiest ways to build a white hat backlinks. Although, be careful going overboard with the charity. Note: Make sure you comply with Google’s “Best practices for bloggers reviewing free products they receive from companies“ 35. Promotions and Giveaways Offer influencers in your field promotions or giveaways in exchange for a product review or feedback. This works best with products with bigger margins. 36. Contests Encourage engagement and linking by running contests with prizes. Use software like Gleam or KingSumo to launch your contest. Read more: Running Giveaway Competitions for Links Helping People Out Whether you’re helping webmasters by pointing to broken links or you offer your services to someone, there’s a huge opportunity for using reciprocity to build white hat backlinks to your site. 37. Finding broken links On Google, you can find relevant sites (or posts) to yours. Then search for broken links on the site – this app will do it for free. In the end, you offer the site owner to replace the broken links with your post. There are several free tools that would help you identify the broken links on a site. One of the most hassle-free plugins is Check my Links for Chrome. In the example below the link in red is a broken link. Read more: Black Belt Broken Link Building The Broken Link Building Bible 54 Broken Link Building Resource 38. Offer a Pro-bono Service Whatever you’re doing you can exchange your services for a link: web design work web dev work – you could do something as small as changing their style a bit or speeding up their site with a couple of WordPress plugins marketing and SEO 🙂 content creation (help a site upgrade or update their content) grammar checking (scan a couple of articles and pinpoint the mistakes to the site owner) 39. The Poster Boy Method The Poster Boy method involves writing a splendid success story that you had with a tool. Companies are always looking for great testimonials about their own products. Writing about how you achieved success with their tool will immediately make your story the apple of their eye. You can expect the company to share the article and mention it several times across the press releases and blog posts. They may even interview you for insights. More link building techniques 40. Create your own private blog networks If you’re serious about SEO and plan on being in the game for a long time, creating your own blog network is one of the best things you can do for long term success. And I don’t mean one of those networks like Gawker or Envato that advertises itself on every site. Although they can work very well, too. I mean a truly private network of websites that have nothing to do with each other, aside from being owned by you. It’s the best way to go for small websites without massive financial backing. The benefits of a private network are immense: You have multiple independent sites and income streams so you don’t suffer if one or a few of them get penalized or de-indexed (temporarily or permanently); Create backlinks between the sites whenever you need to rank for any keywords or need to get a new site off the ground fast; Get much more control over your SEO, since backlinks become pretty much on-site optimization for you. I’d say that anyone who is going to be doing Internet Marketing for a long time should at least try to build their own network of small niche blogs. For further reading check this article. Note: This is a black hat link building technique and can get your site penalized. 41. Maintain accounts on Reddit Social media accounts are mostly a long term strategy since they’ll rarely get results in the short term. Well, not counting successful submissions to Reddit, Hacker News and the like. These sites are worth it most of the time. I’d recommend you create and maintain (either yourself or through outsourcing/automation) profiles on Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Instagram, Pinterest, Hacker News and most importantly, Reddit. In fact, if you need to choose only one site, I’d recommend Reddit for a few reasons: It’s easy to create several accounts there (it’s not against the terms of service); You can submit stories on almost any topic and they have a real chance of getting to the front page in the appropriate subreddit (which would give you direct traffic and quite possibly white hat backlinks from other sites); And a little known secret – Reddit comments are indexed by Google and Bing. Most importantly any links will have the nofollow tag removed automatically if the comment gets any upvotes. 42. Building links from Wikipedia This isn’t something that a lot of people know about. Create a free account on Wikipedia. Go to WikiGrabber. It’s a free site that shows you missing citations or dead links in Wikipedia entries. Let’s say I have a client in the eCommerce industry who’d be very happy if I get him some quality, high authority links. I head to WikiGrabber and key in “ecommerce”. In return, I get a list of links that need citations or are dead. See the example below: Here’s an example link where Wikipedia is requesting me to add links to the article. Could anything be better than this? Relevant links from a domain that Google loves. 43. Collaboration link-building Joining resources and opportunities with other bloggers and marketers by building links to each other’s sites can really accelerate your link acquisition. The network of your partners will be different from your own network. By partnering together you can benefit from their networks of connections, and them from yours. The method involves researching partners in your industry, reaching out to them, and offering to collaborate on link building. Read the complete guide on collaboration link building.

It’s simple really…you vote for a candidate that you fully support or find most interesting. Similarly, you link to websites (or anything for that matter) that you think gives great value. As an SEO specialist, backlinks are one of the things you strive for in order to outrank your competitors. (Nofollow links don’t give out “link juice” or “link love” which is used by Google for their PageRank system.)

Helvis Smoteks says: September 23, 2018 at 12:24 Thank you for your comment. We discussed this a lot and our argument for including this technique was the fact that there are a lot of webmasters that own more than one website – in some cases, those are 10+ sites. So, what some might classify as “blog network” is not all bad. Occasionally some “blog networks” are high-quality sites, such as neilpatel.com; neilpatel.de, etc. that all link with each other but the content on these sites are outstanding and backlinks very powerful.

No reason not to use them. 1. Internal Linking Yes, that’s right. Internal linking is something most people overlook, but internal linking is big. First internal links are something you have complete control of. Not only do internal links help you transfer link juice between your pages, they also help Google crawl your site faster. The first thing to do is look at all the relevant internal links to add to your pages right away with a tool like LinkStorm. This will already give a boost to your ranking. Note: Be careful with using targeted keywords in your site-wide links, as Google might treat this as a spam factor.

Friendly Blogrolls Ask your friends, employees, and colleagues to put a link in their “Friends” blogroll section. Note: Blogroll Etiquette It’s an unwritten rule in the blogosphere that if a blogger puts a link to your site in his blogroll, you should add that blog’s link on your own site. 3. Ask for Credit Whether you run an SEO agency, or you’re a freelancer, you should ask for credit from your clients or partners. For example, at WooGuru, we ask our clients if it’s OK to put “WooCommerce support by WooGuru” in the footer of their website. The best time to ask for this link is when a client is at his peak of happiness. Also, make it easy for them. Put the link on their site yourself or provide an embeddable HTML snippet with the link. 4. Ask Your Suppliers and Distributors If you’re buying products or services from someone, ask them to link to your site. Since you’re already paying them (although not for the link itself) your suppliers tend to be much more likely to link back to you, as they want to see you succeed. 5. Create Message Board Signatures Include a link to the site in your forum signature. Although mostly “no-follow”, these links can bring decent traffic to a site, and also, help you keep up with your natural link profile. Directories and Resources 6. Resource Pages Another old-school easy way to get links. Just use Google search parameters like: “keyword” + list, Try this – “keyword” + resources, “keyword” + tips, “keyword” + links, This is great as well – “keyword” + inurl: links. Depending on the vertical of your business, you should find at least a dozen solid link opportunities.

Directories Submit your site to niche-specific directories, blogger directories like AllTop or local business directories like GoldenPages. Be very careful with general web directories, as some of them are ridden with low-profile links and you don’t want to associate your site with them. An easy way to track if a directory is fine is by using the Moz Spam Score.

Paid Directories Some premium directories that will ask you to pay to list your site on their site. The problem with them is it’s hard to distinguish which ones are worth the money. Resources: What are the best-paid directories today? Matt Cutts Explains How Google Handles Paid Directories [Video] 9. Web Design Galleries This type of directories deserves a place on their own because you can get some pretty serious traffic from them. This tactic works best if you have a unique, innovative design. Use a service like CSS Gallery list to get your site submitted to all web design galleries for 50 bucks. 10. Startup Directories There’s a number of startup-related directories that let you create your company profile. To name a few: Angel List, Crunchbase, and BetaList (if your startup is still in pre-launch stage). Resource: The Ultimate Guide to Getting Your Startup Listed Online Take Advantage of Existing Opportunities There are some hacks to score white hat backlinks that are just waiting to be taken. 11. Claim your Brand Mentions Use a service like Mention or Buzzsumo to track your brand name mentions. Make sure that your brand name links back to your site.

Spy on Competitors and get their Backlinks If your competition is a spot higher on the SERPs than you, they must be doing something right with their link building. You can use Linkody to find all your competitor’s backlinks. All you need to know is their websites and Linkody will do the rest. Find your competitors on Google or with SimilarWeb. Add them to Linkody. Linkody will find all your competitors’ backlinks. Reach out to the webmaster and say your tool would be a great addition to the site’s resources. Read the full guide on how to analyze your competitors’ backlinks and find great link building opportunities. You can also use SemRush as a way to spy on backlinks – it allows you to get inbound link data for any website: the number of backlinks, new & lost links, their type, referring domains, and more. 13. Convert Unhappy Customers Into Avid Brand Proponents Chances are there will be some negative comments, reviews or articles about your brand. Do your best to convert their negative voice into a positive one – offer them an exclusive discount, help them sort their problem, just give a crap. Read more: 5 Ways to Turn Your Unhappy Customer into a Valuable Resource How to Talk to Your Angriest Customers 14. Do a Google Reverse Image Search for Your Images Chances are someone is using your images if you have useful graphics or beautiful photography on your site. We live in the free Internet.. duh! Make sure to take a breath before you go all mad about it and think if you could use that as to claim a link to your site. 15. The Rebranding link opportunity method Most brands often change their names. Brian Dean has a great technique which he calls the Moving Man method to find link opportunities through this. It’s different from the broken link building method in that the links actually exist. They just re-direct to the new URL. However, since the anchor text and the site link points to the old domain, there’s an opportunity. Brian was able to achieve this with outdated BlueGlass links (an SEO agency) that went out of business. He reached out to all the site owners who had a link to BlueGlass with this mail. Image Source In order to discover such opportunities, you can search PR channels and search on Google about re brands. All such news results in your industry can get you links. 16. Incorporate Tweet this in your blogposts Often times we can inspire people to take action by asking them to specifically tweet a portion or nuggets of your post. These tweets can drive more tweets because the words are emotionally charged or contain something very important or interesting. They can drive social shares and mass links. 17. Make Sure Your White Hat Backlinks Point to the Proper Page Use Linkody to track if all your white hat backlinks are properly linking to the right page. If you have a link to 404 page there are 2 ways to approach the case, depending on the situation: Inform the site owner and re-purpose that link to a new page/ask them to correct the mistake in the URL. Use a redirection (301) to another page on your site. Content-based Opportunities These link-building tactics involve creating content to get a link. 18. Participate in Round-ups Thought leaders, experts, and influencers roundups are an excellent way to build credibility in your field and get a link. Of course, you must know a thing or two about your niche to get featured in them. The important thing to note is that once you participate in a few roundups, blog authors will start approaching you instead of you having to go to them. Almost every blogger wants to write a round-up post at some stage in their blog’s life, and the easiest targets are usually the people who are already participating in round-ups. 19. Create Round-ups This tactic works the same way as the previous one, except this time you’re putting together the expert roundup. Reach out to influencers in your field and ask them to contribute. Everybody wants to look good among other well-respected people. Once you put the round-up live, you can simply ask them to share or link to your post.

Create video tutorials and share them on forums Most bloggers share their tutorials on forums either wholly or link to them. Linking doesn’t work that often since moderators remove those. Sharing an entire tutorial gives them little incentive to come back to your site. The thing that I have seen working time and again is sharing video tutorials. Branded with your blog’s name, with an outro slate providing a link back to your blog, these videos work magic in bringing visitors to your site. Video tutorials are often stuck to the relevant categories and send a nice trickle of traffic long after you’ve stopped promoting. The additional advantage is that there is no problem sharing an internal forum thread elsewhere on the forum. You can always prop up the thread if it’s relevant to the discussion. This technique works better and requires more effort than any other forum promotion technique that you might have heard. For the Internet marketing niche, the best forums for this would be Warrior Forum, Black Hat Forum, etc. 21. Guest Blogging Pitch bloggers with an idea for a blog post and ask them if they’re happy to publish it. If you’re just starting out with guest blogging, you will find better luck using one of the guest blogging networks like BloggerLinkUp and MyBlogGuest.com We usually use NinjaOutreach to send out emails and get contacts to sites where we could have a potential guest post opportunity. Resources: The Ultimate Guide to Guest Blogging List of Guest Blogging Sites (180+ best sites) The Definitive Guide to Guest Blogging 22. Offer Content Upgrades These tactics involve offering content upgrades like eBooks, reports, infographics, etc. to other sites. The reason content upgrades work so well is that: you can provide something exclusively for the site you’re pitching it’s much more scalable than guest posting Let’s say you wrote a big article on cats health. You can re-package the whole post as an eBook and offer it as an exclusive resource to a relevant site.

Write Testimonials Nothing makes a person happier than seeing his clients using their products. Endorse the products you use and ask them to share your testimonial on their websites. More on the topic: How to get featured to 750,000 readers (and get your first 250 subscribers) 24. Write Case Studies This tactic is the same as the previous tip, except you go for more details and write a complete case study, describing how you use the product/service. Resources: Gleam Customer Success Stories 8 Tips For Creating a Great Case Study 25. Comment on Blogs With blog comments, you can get some no-follow links, which is perfectly fine but you can also find a decent amount of blogs that allow do-follow comments.

Participate in Communities Niche communities are a great place to bring more traffic to your site and get some links (usually no-follow). These could be everything from subreddits to smaller hubs like GrowthHackers.com for online marketing. Check out what you need to know about Reddit and SEO. 27. Answer Questions Answering questions on Quora and Yahoo Answers not only brings traffic to your site but also helps you build credibility as a thought leader in your business vertical. Read more: How to Leverage Q&A Sites to Generate Traffic How We Answer Quora Questions to Drive Traffic to Our Website 28. Inbound Link-building This works in a similar way to the round-up tactic except on a much bigger scale. Great examples are StartupStash and the Glossary of Internet Terms. StartupStash has over 1426 white hat backlinks from 185 domains: 29. Mention Influencers in Your Content This is the classic ego-bait tactic. By appealing to the egos of people, they’ll help you increase the exposure of your content. Egobait still works – just not like it used to, it’s not as effective to simply quote or link to an influencer praising their work; we’ve found that at this point if you want to see results (and leverage influencer marketing) you need to bring them into the conversation before you push publish. – Nick Eubanks, creator SEO Auv 30. Create a Free Tool Build a free plugin or browser extension to your main product or service. A great example is EmailHunter’s Chrome extension: Not only this could potentially attract white hat backlinks to your site, but your customer retention will increase. Here’s a wonderful case study how Hubspot with $6k investment in a Free Email Signature Generator made $64 million. 31. User-Generated Content People want to be the center of attention, and in control of what they’re doing. Create a platform for user-generated content. That could be a simple message board or Spotify’s interactive “year in music” personal music habits review. 32. Surveys Asking people for help could be very beneficial. The way surveys work is: Collect a decent amount of answers to your survey. Thank them for participating Ask them if they’d like to help your research by spreading the word with a link. 33. Funny Products and Games Everybody loves laughing. And everybody loves making other people laugh. This is a great way to generate a white hat backlinks. CSS Puns by Saijo George is a great example: 1288 total white hat backlinks from 259 domains. 34. Seasonable or Timed Content Leverage the power of ego-bait on a massive level: a national celebration or event. A great example is this infographic about the National Liberation Day, which collected over 3.5K shares in just a few days. Give Something If you have something to give away, this is probably one of the easiest ways to build a white hat backlinks. Although, be careful going overboard with the charity. Note: Make sure you comply with Google’s “Best practices for bloggers reviewing free products they receive from companies“ 35. Promotions and Giveaways Offer influencers in your field promotions or giveaways in exchange for a product review or feedback. This works best with products with bigger margins. 36. Contests Encourage engagement and linking by running contests with prizes. Use software like Gleam or KingSumo to launch your contest. Read more: Running Giveaway Competitions for Links Helping People Out Whether you’re helping webmasters by pointing to broken links or you offer your services to someone, there’s a huge opportunity for using reciprocity to build white hat backlinks to your site. 37. Finding broken links On Google, you can find relevant sites (or posts) to yours. Then search for broken links on the site – this app will do it for free. In the end, you offer the site owner to replace the broken links with your post. There are several free tools that would help you identify the broken links on a site. One of the most hassle-free plugins is Check my Links for Chrome. In the example below the link in red is a broken link.

Offer a Pro-bono Service Whatever you’re doing you can exchange your services for a link: web design work web dev work – you could do something as small as changing their style a bit or speeding up their site with a couple of WordPress plugins marketing and SEO 🙂 content creation (help a site upgrade or update their content) grammar checking (scan a couple of articles and pinpoint the mistakes to the site owner) 39. The Poster Boy Method The Poster Boy method involves writing a splendid success story that you had with a tool. Companies are always looking for great testimonials about their own products. Writing about how you achieved success with their tool will immediately make your story the apple of their eye. You can expect the company to share the article and mention it several times across the press releases and blog posts. They may even interview you for insights. More link building techniques 40. Create your own private blog networks If you’re serious about SEO and plan on being in the game for a long time, creating your own blog network is one of the best things you can do for long term success. And I don’t mean one of those networks like Gawker or Envato that advertises itself on every site. Although they can work very well, too. I mean a truly private network of websites that have nothing to do with each other, aside from being owned by you. It’s the best way to go for small websites without massive financial backing. The benefits of a private network are immense: You have multiple independent sites and income streams so you don’t suffer if one or a few of them get penalized or de-indexed (temporarily or permanently); Create backlinks between the sites whenever you need to rank for any keywords or need to get a new site off the ground fast; Get much more control over your SEO, since backlinks become pretty much on-site optimization for you. I’d say that anyone who is going to be doing Internet Marketing for a long time should at least try to build their own network of small niche blogs. For further reading check this article. Note: This is a black hat link building technique and can get your site penalized. 41. Maintain accounts on Reddit Social media accounts are mostly a long term strategy since they’ll rarely get results in the short term. Well, not counting successful submissions to Reddit, Hacker News and the like. These sites are worth it most of the time. I’d recommend you create and maintain (either yourself or through outsourcing/automation) profiles on Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Instagram, Pinterest, Hacker News and most importantly, Reddit. In fact, if you need to choose only one site, I’d recommend Reddit for a few reasons: It’s easy to create several accounts there (it’s not against the terms of service); You can submit stories on almost any topic and they have a real chance of getting to the front page in the appropriate subreddit (which would give you direct traffic and quite possibly white hat backlinks from other sites); And a little known secret – Reddit comments are indexed by Google and Bing. Most importantly any links will have the nofollow tag removed automatically if the comment gets any upvotes. 42. Building links from Wikipedia This isn’t something that a lot of people know about. Create a free account on Wikipedia. Go to WikiGrabber. It’s a free site that shows you missing citations or dead links in Wikipedia entries. Let’s say I have a client in the eCommerce industry who’d be very happy if I get him some quality, high authority links. I head to WikiGrabber and key in “ecommerce”. In return, I get a list of links that need citations or are dead. See the example below: Here’s an example link where Wikipedia is requesting me to add links to the article. Could anything be better than this? Relevant links from a domain that Google loves. 43. Collaboration link-building Joining resources and opportunities with other bloggers and marketers by building links to each other’s sites can really accelerate your link acquisition. The network of your partners will be different from your own network. By partnering together you can benefit from their networks of connections, and them from yours. The method involves researching partners in your industry, reaching out to them, and offering to collaborate on link building. Read the complete guide on collaboration link building.

It’s simple really…you vote for a candidate that you fully support or find most interesting. Similarly, you link to websites (or anything for that matter) that you think gives great value. As an SEO specialist, backlinks are one of the things you strive for in order to outrank your competitors. (Nofollow links don’t give out “link juice” or “link love” which is used by Google for their PageRank system.)

Helvis Smoteks says: September 23, 2018 at 12:24 Thank you for your comment. We discussed this a lot and our argument for including this technique was the fact that there are a lot of webmasters that own more than one website – in some cases, those are 10+ sites. So, what some might classify as “blog network” is not all bad. Occasionally some “blog networks” are high-quality sites, such as neilpatel.com; neilpatel.de, etc. that all link with each other but the content on these sites are outstanding and backlinks very powerful. George Kitsos says: October 1, 2018 at 20:42 Broken link building is a great method to help us earn quick backlinks from high-quality pages.

Simply put, a backlink is an incoming hyperlink from another web page into your own website. Google usually sees this as a trust signal whenever another website refers to or mentions your own website on the pages of their website. Usually, website owners try to do their best to get as many websites as possible to mention their website on their own websites and this mentioning is done via hyperlinking your web page URL. But this is where the problem actually is: If another website mentions your website pages wrongly, then Google begins to see red lights on your website, and as you might well be aware, the more red light Google sees on your website, the more it hurts your website in return. At the end of the day, these backlinks end up becoming issues for you and it could even have been good that you never had them in the first instance!

like me to help you fix your website SEO issues and improve your website ranking and traffic then contact me using the contact details in the video description so according to a backlink CO report pages with the highest numbers of total backlinks usually rank best in Google while I want to agree that this is true but you also want to know that there are different kinds of backlinks or link building processes some of them are very good and others yeah very detrimental to your SEO success but before I continue just what exactly is a backlink now simply put a backlink is an incoming hyper link from another web page into your own website Google usually see this as a trust signal whenever another website mentions or refers to your own website on the pages of their own website so usually website owners try to do their best to get as many websites as possible to mention their website on their own website and this mentioning is done via hyperlinking your web page URL but this is where the problem actually is if another website mentions your website in the wrong manner then Google begin to see red light on your website and as you might well be aware of the more red light Google Sees on your website the more it Ur your website in return at the end of the day this backlink end up becoming issues for you and it could even have been good if you never had them on your website in the first instance so now do you want to build backlinks or you already have a ton of them on your website what should you be looking out for to be sure that you are in the good books of Google what you want to do here is to go do some simple backlink audit of your website I'll be using the huba suggest keyword research to here you can use suggest or any of your favorite seo2 for this so here I am on huba suggest to conduct my backlink audit I'll come here to the backlink option and click the drop- down arrow here click the back link overview then come in here and paste your website URL and click search in just a about a few seconds your backlink analysis result will be ready so here is my domain Authority and here we have our referring domain and here you can see how many backlinks this website has got quite a number of them right so here is a graph of how I have been building backlinks on this website over time now there are quite a number of data that we can analyze here but let's just go over to the most important and the straightforward ones here you can see these two column table with the heading anchor test and backlinks let me expand this tab let me not say too much here but what you want to be sure of is that this anchor test here show test that are very much related to your website keywords what that will mean is that the website that are mentioning your website are relevant to your own website topics to illustrate better just imagine that you run a website that talk about soft Ware and here you begin to see test that talk about let's say health supplement as an example if you see anything that is clearly contrasting it's always a red flag that the website linking up to you may be spamming you can't just conclude here though you really have to do your investigation to be sure you might have to look up the website because if such a website has a bad reputation with Google then you will definitely share from the negative impact so that is the first way to determine if a back link on your website is going to work either for you or against your website so I'll go back to my backlink analysis report I'll scroll down and here you can see a more elaborate detail of your website backlink data here in the First Column the explanation is almost the same like we already analyzed earlier on you want to look through these titles to be sure that they have related terms with your website topics anyone that seem to have a sharp contrast you want to to single them out and look through the website in deeper details to be sure you are on the safe side just as I already mentioned earlier on so the first link here is the title of the page that is linking up to you and the second is the actual website URL linking up to your website so just look through and make sure you are safe but if you come right here Uber suggest even make it easier for you with the spam score option here usually you also want to look here and watch out for any score that goes beyond the score of 10 now let's take a look at how the score is determined so here you see that it says that this is a score by MOS that measures the possibility that a domain is spamming so how it works is that the rating is usually between 1% to 100% on Huber suggest the higher this score the more you should suspect such a website linking up to your website so usually I will suspect all of these website that don't have green color they are suspicious website that you really want to manually visit to see if you should do something about them so they don't ought your good SEO effort to rank on Google as you can see here they have quite a high number so it means they are more suspicious and they have more spammy you know activities according to google report now this is another strong reason why you don't want to go around buying backlinks this is because you could be buying junks and spams and not back Lings so if we look at the anchor test here we already touched on that already you want to make sure that your anchor test is having very related keywords to the Anchor test of the website that are linking up to you so the question is what if I discover a spamming website or a website I am not comfortable with linking to me what do I do if you find a website you're not comfortable with you really want to do something about it if you don't it will hurt your SEO Ad work or maybe it's even hurting your website already you can H the website owner to affect any change that you want or ask that they remove your website from their web pages completely but you should only do this after your sh that you don't want your website to be mentioned on such website that is you must have done your investigation very well so how do you contact them it's simple just go to the About Us section of this website and contact the website owners relay your worries to them or ask that they should remove your website from their web pages usually some will attend to your request while a handful of others will not after you must have sent multiple requests if they refuse to attend to your request then there is another solution what you have to do here is to report

letting Google know that you have done your best to get this website to stop linking to your website but they haven't done so so you can say hey Google don't count this against me and doing this will just be enough to keep you safe from Google's penalty so you really want to make sure you do this you clean this up and get relevant back things that are going to help your website Rank and increase your SEO score and not the other way around so as you can see just having a bunch of back Lings is not just all you want you want to make sure that you are in a safe company so that your effort in

pages with the highest numbers of total backlinks usually rank best in Google while I want to agree that this is true but you also want to know that there are different kinds of backlinks or link building processes some of them are very good and others yeah very detrimental to your SEO success but before I continue just what exactly is a backlink now simply put a backlink is an incoming hyper link from another web page into your own website Google usually see this as a trust signal whenever another website mentions or refers to your own website on the pages of their own website so usually website owners try to do their best to get as many websites as possible to mention their website on their own website and this mentioning is done via hyperlinking your web page URL but this is where the problem actually is if another website mentions your website in the wrong manner then Google begin to see red light on your website and as you might well be aware of the more red light Google Sees on your website the more it Ur your website in return at the end of the day this backlink end up becoming issues for you and it could even have been good if you never had them on your website in the first instance so now do you want to build backlinks or you already have a ton of them on your website what should you be looking out for to be sure that you are in the good books of Google what you want to do here is to go do some simple backlink audit of your website I'll be using the huba suggest keyword research to here you can use suggest or any of your favorite seo2 for this so here I am on huba suggest to conduct my backlink audit I'll come here to the backlink option and click the drop- down arrow here click the back link overview then come in here and paste your website URL and click search in just a about a few seconds your backlink analysis result will be ready so here is my domain Authority and here we have our referring domain and here you can see how many backlinks this website has got quite a number of them right so here is a graph of how I have been building backlinks on this website over time now there are quite a number of data that we can analyze here but let's just go over to the most important and the straightforward ones here you can see these two column table with the heading anchor test and backlinks let me expand this tab let me not say too much here but what you want to be sure of is that this anchor test here show test that are very much related to your website keywords what that will mean is that the website that are mentioning your website are relevant to your own website topics to illustrate better just imagine that you run a website that talk about soft Ware and here you begin to see test that talk about let's say health supplement as an example if you see anything that is clearly contrasting it's always a red flag that the website linking up to you may be spamming you can't just conclude here though you really have to do your investigation to be sure you might have to look up the website because if such a website has a bad reputation with Google then you will definitely share from the negative impact so that is the first way to determine if a back link on your website is going to work either for you or against your website so I'll go back to my backlink analysis report I'll scroll down and here you can see a more elaborate detail of your website backlink data here in the First Column the explanation is almost the same like we already analyzed earlier on you want to look through these titles to be sure that they have related terms with your website topics anyone that seem to have a sharp contrast you want to to single them out and look through the website in deeper details to be sure you are on the safe side just as I already mentioned earlier on so the first link here is the title of the page that is linking up to you and the second is the actual website URL linking up to your website so just look through and make sure you are safe but if you come right here Uber suggest even make it easier for you with the spam score option here usually you also want to look here and watch out for any score that goes beyond the score of 10 now let's take a look at how the score is determined so here you see that it says that this is a score by MOS that measures the possibility that a domain is spamming so how it works is that the rating is usually between 1% to 100% on Huber suggest the higher this score the more you should suspect such a website linking up to your website so usually I will suspect all of these website that don't have green color they are suspicious website that you really want to manually visit to see if you should do something about them so they don't ought your good SEO effort to rank on Google as you can see here they have quite a high number so it means they are more suspicious and they have more spammy you know activities according to google report now this is another strong reason why you don't want to go around buying backlinks this is because you could be buying junks and spams and not back Lings so if we look at the anchor test here we already touched on that already you want to make sure that your anchor test is having very related keywords to the Anchor test of the website that are linking up to you so the question is what if I discover a spamming website or a website I am not comfortable with linking to me what do I do if you find a website you're not comfortable with you really want to do something about it if you don't it will hurt

Leverage Testimonials In Your Niche This link building strategy almost seems too easy… Well… That’s because it is! With just a few minutes work you can create powerful homepage links to your website. Let me explain what I mean. By reaching out and offering positive testimonials for services and/or products that you are using… …you can have your testimonial published with a link back to your website. Here is one of my testimonials based on the findings of my Surfer SEO review– Which includes a backlink to my homepage. So let’s take a quick look at how to build a number of external links with testimonials! Step #1 – Generate A List Of Targets To get started with this link building tactic, you need to find the websites for services and products that you could provide a testimonial for. Each site needs to- Be relevant to your niche Have existing testimonials Actually be a product/service that you use So start by writing a list of tools/products/services you are already using in your business. If you’re struggling to come up with any ideas you could cheat a little bit. Look at what other tools and services people in your niche use…. And you’ll quite often find that a free trial will be on offer to test the tool… Step #2 – Find The Right Person To Pitch To Now we need to find the right person to contact. Sometimes you can just ask via the contact form on the website and some will even have dedicated testimonial submission forms. Or you can use one of these handy extensions to help you find email addresses- FindThatLead Hunter Then you can add each email address to your spreadsheet and start to contact everyone on your list with a pitch. Step #3 – Send Your Testimonial Pitch Before spending time creating a testimonial… First pitch them with the idea that they could have a testimonial created by you. Here are some thing’s to keep in mind when putting together your pitch: Introduce yourself Tell them how their tool has helped you Include specific results Ask them if you can put together a testimonial Keep it simple Just keep it short, simple and sweet. Step #4 – Writing The Perfect Testimonial Writing the perfect testimonial is pretty straight forward. You want to write a short piece of text that includes- What you liked most How the tool/service helped you Specific results Your personal recommendation Here are some good example testimonials from my readers- To learn more on testimonial link building, including exactly how to build these links from start to finish, checkout my full guide- This Section In Short Using testimonials as a link building strategy is a fantastic way to build high quality homepage links. Generate a list of target services and products Find the right person to pitch to Send them your pitch Write the testimonial It really is that easy and if you need any more help you can see my full testimonial link building tutorial. 2. Support New Business Growth Crowdfunding is one of the most unknown and underused link building strategy. Someone who is raising money for their business through crowdfunding will often place a link to each person that contributed… See where this is going yet? The donation can be anything from $1 up to thousands of dollars and can be found for all kinds of projects across all niches. Meaning this is a brilliant opportunity to get link back to your website. There are two ways to obtain links. Donor links Package links Donor links are from pages that publish the details of all donors, including a link to the donor’s website: Package links are when links are offered as part of a package you get if you donate a certain amount of money: Sounds easy right? It really is! How To Find Crowdfunding Sites For Link Building There are hundreds of crowdfunding sites out there to search through. But we are gonna take a closer look at Indiegogo. There is a simple way to look for crowdfunding projects without trawling through the site. Simply do a Google search using these keywords: site:[indiegogo.com] inurl:projects +“link to your” site:[indiegogo.com] inurl:projects +”donor page” You need to be prepared to sift through the results… But they will be vastly narrowed down to projects that either add donor’s details to their donor page or projects that offer links in exchange for your donation. You will be able to find a bunch of crowdfunding projects that are affordable and an easy way to get links to your website. You might even benefit from some of their other perks too! This Section In Short Crowdfunding is an underused link building strategy. You can build backlinks from crowdfunding projects by either: Being included on their donation page Receiving a link back as part of a package Make a list of crowdfunding sites to search. Use Google searches to narrow down opportunities: site:[website URL] inurl:projects +“link to your” site:[website URL] inurl:projects +”donor page” And find crowdfunding pages within your niche that allow you to build links and are within your budget. Check out my full crowdfunding link building tutorial to learn more. 3. Sponsor Real World Events Did you know that you can use events as part of your link building strategy? They could be local, national, and international events that you can utilize to build links. There are two ways you can do this… #1 – Hosting An Event You can create your own event and then have it advertised on third-party event sites which then link back to your website. These links are usually extremely relevant and come from high authority sites. #2 – Sponsoring An Event Alternatively, you can sponsor an event being hosted by someone else as most hosts will list (and link to) all their sponsors. This is also a great way to build good relationships with other authorities in your industry. I am going to give you a quick glimpse of how to find events to sponsor. This type of event link building offers all the benefits without actually having to host an event. How To Find Events To Sponsor Firstly you need to figure out what type of events are relevant to your niche. This could be workshops, conferences, lectures, clubs etc… Then you need to make a list of where these events are likely to be hosted online. Depending on the event, local events may be hosted on local sites, but national or international events can usually be found on sites like: Eventful MeetUp Events.org To find events that you can sponsor… You can use these Google searches for each of the hosting sites: site:[website URL] inurl:events +“sponsors” site:[website URL] inurl:events +“link to your” site:[website URL] inurl:registration +“sponsors” site:[website URL] +“sponsors” site:[website URL] + “donation” site:[website URL] + “become a sponsor” And if you want to pull in more specific results, just add a keyword at the end: Search through the results and make a list of any events that are relevant to your niche. Rinse and repeat for each event hosting site using each search term. Once you have exhausted all opportunities and set up your sponsorships for each event, you can set up Google alerts to find any new sponsorship opportunities as they appear. This Section In Short Event link building is a great way to get backlinks that Google approves of. There are two ways of building these links: Hosting An Event: Creating an event where third-party event websites link back Sponsoring An Event: Sponsoring a relevant event & receiving a link as a sponsor Finding events to sponsor is easy to do with these Google searches: site:[website URL] inurl:events +“sponsors” site:[website URL] inurl:events +“link to your” site:[website URL] inurl:registration +“sponsors” site:[website URL] +“sponsors” site:[website URL] + “donation” site:[website URL] + “become a sponsor” Just add the event hosting site (eg. eventful.com/) and if you need to narrow down the search to more relevant events… Simply add another keyword to the search. Rinse and repeat for a range of event hosting sites for each search term or check out my step by step guide to event link building. 4. Show Your Presence On Social Media Social media backlinks are generally considered by a lot of people to be a waste of time. This is because they are nofollow and considered to carry little SEO benefit but still form an important base of links most genuine businesses should have. Healthy link profiles include both follow links and legitimate nofollow. So I am going to show you 5 quick wins from Facebook (accessible for all skill levels) but there are 23 more from other networks listed in my full social media backlinks guide. How To Build Backlinks With Facebook As Facebook is the most popular network I thought we would start there… Let’s dive in: #1 – Your Profile’s ‘Intro’ The best way to connect a new visitor to your website is through your ‘Intro’. Just add your website URL in your basic settings and be sure to have it set to public. #2 – Your ‘About’ Page Description As well as adding your website to your about page contact info, you can also place your website URL in the description: By having your website appear twice on your about me page… You are doubling your chances of sending traffic to your website from there. #3 – Include A Website Link In All Posts For those articles, you are posting that aren’t directing traffic to your site… You can still add a link as a reference. This can easily be worked into all your blog posts. #4 – Page Buttons You can add page buttons underneath your cover photo. These can be optimised to send traffic to your website when clicked: Simply add or edit your page button and input your website’s URL. #5 – Picture Descriptions You can add your website to the description of an image (which most people don’t do). This works best when done for your profile picture and cover photo: Don’t forget to update this each time you change your pictures. To learn more about using social media backlinks on Facebook and other platforms like: Twitter LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Instagram Quora …head over to my full tutorial – 28 Social Media Backlinks To Increase Your Rankings This Section In Short Social media backlinks are more valuable than most people think and there are many ways you can build these links which I cover in my full tutorial. But here’s a snap shot of how you can build social media backlinks on Facebook: Your Profile’s ‘Info’ Tab Your ‘About’ Page Description Include A Website Link In All Posts Page Buttons Picture Descriptions 5. Strategic Guest Blogging Boring right? But guest blogging is one of the most popular, simplest and most effective link building strategy there is… The funny thing is most people label guest posting as a white hat strategy. But Google has given us multiple warnings- And more importantly: John Mueller advised to nofollow guest post links. My point is: ALL FORMS of link building are against Google’s guidelines. And in the end… All Google’s ranking algorithm wants to see is specific metrics. It’s your job to feed it those metrics. And guest posts will always work very well as a marketing function to build a target audience and feed the algorithm the metrics it wants. The idea behind guest blogging is simple: You create a high-quality piece of content You add a few links in the content piece pointing to your site You get the piece published in another site, preferably one with a high DA I won’t lie to you: Guest blogging isn’t what it’s used to be a few years ago. It’s much much harder to earn a genuine link placement in 2025. Most site owners have caught on and often want payments to place your guest posts. Which is nothing more than just a long-winded way to buy links right? And some people are much much more direct- That’s not to say that guest blogging isn’t worth doing and it’s definetly easier if you use one of the recommended guest posting services. Feel free to walk that line however you choose. To get started with guest blogging, there are 5 steps you need to follow: Find your prospects Qualify the right blogs Send outreach emails Create great content Build relationships Step #1 – Find Your Prospects The first step to getting started with guest blogging is to find your prospects. These are the websites where you are going to publish your piece of content. Ideally, you want to publish on sites with high DA (domain authority), page authority and high organic traffic. But how do you find them? Two words – SEO Footprints. Think of SEO Footprints as digital imprints left around the web. You can leverage these footprints by using search operators to find potential sites for guest blogging. Here’s an example: Let’s say you run a site about sustainable living. Go to Google and do a quick search using the following: “proudly powered by WordPress” intitle:sustainability This will bring up a list of WordPress websites about sustainability. The reason this works so well is because lots of websites built on WordPress have blogs. This gives you a whole list of potential guest blogging opportunities on niche-relevant sites. Cool, right? And the best part is there are so many different variations of SEO footprints to try. Here are a few of the top ones: “proudly powered by WordPress” – intitle:niche keyword “proudly powered by WordPress” – “niche keywords” “your keyword” + “comments” “your keyword” + “leave a comment” “your keyword” + inurl:blog “your keyword” + inurl:blog “post a comment” “your keyword”+ site:.edu “forums register” “your keyword” + site:.edu “register i am over 13 years of age forum” “your keyword” + site:.edu “discussion board register” Make sure you check out our complete SEO footprints tutorial to get even more ways to find strategic guest blogging opportunities for link building. Step #2 – Qualify The Blogs With the list, you have created, run each site through Ahrefs (who just so happen to be the best backlink checker) to check their domain authority. Take the first website in your list, and go to the Site Explorer. Once you are there, add the website you want to analyze and click on the orange loop icon. In the menu, take the number that you see in the center of the screen, under the DR sign. Add these numbers to your list and repeat the process until you have the DR of every site. Step #3 – Reaching Out With the list of websites, go to each site and contact the manager to check if they are interested in your pitch. To contact each blog you can use the following template: Subject: Writing for SITE Hi [NAME], I was checking out [SITE] today and found the guest post you published from [GUEST POSTER’S NAME]. I loved that article, I just shared it with my audience. I’d love to be your next guest author. Here are some topics that I think would do really well with [SITE] readers: Topic #1 Topic #2 Topic #3 Do any of these ideas look good? Let me know your thoughts. Best, [YOUR NAME] I highly recommend that you customise that a little bit and also take a peek at any specific guest post guidelines they may have. Step #4 – Creating Incredible Guest Post Content Once you get accepted, start creating the content. It’s important to write with the blog’s target audience in mind! If you need to dig into the site’s audience, read the comments from previous articles and check the blog posts that got the most shares and comments. Don’t hold anything back, write everything you know about the subject- Add quotes Add links to other relevant articles from the site Add images and videos Add anything you can to make it amazing Take a look at this incredible guest post by James Johnson- He teaches everything he knows about becoming a freelance writer. And he holds nothing back! Once you finish writing it, send it their way. Step #5 – Build Relationships A great thing about guest blogging is that it helps you build relationships with the blog managers. Creating a network is important if you ever need help promoting a specific piece of content from your site and you want to publish often in a high-authority site. BONUS TIP: Engage Their Audience One of the most overlooked benefits of guest blogging is the ability to open direct conversation with someone elses audience. What does that mean? Well it means that you should- Respond to all of the comments on your guest post personally Monitor shares on social media then reply to say thanks Setup Google Alerts for the URL to engage anywhere it gets shared If you do those 3 things alongside your guest post, you will accelerate your results. This Section In Short Guest blogging can take some time, and due to the amount of content you have to create, it can get messy. Find your prospects with the help of the Google footprints I previously shared Then, qualify every blog you found to make sure you are pitching to the right place. Reach out to the right people using the template I shared as a basis. Send your guest post and get it published. Engage with their audience as much as possible. It can be a pretty long-winded process, but it is an effective one. It will allow you to find, qualify and reach out to hundreds of blogs in just a few clicks. If you need help with guest posting, check out one of these guest posting services. 6. Help Clean Up The Web Most websites have hundreds, if not thousands, of links. Many of them link internally, while others do it externally. For whatever reason, these links can easily break and stop working. Most site owners don’t realize this when it happens, and it can break their user experience, reputation, and SEO performance. In fact as I am writing this, I just did a quick check on my own blog- And I have broken links from an old a/b experiment where I didn’t redirect the test page! Finding broken links represent a magnificent occasion for you to- Find link building opportunities (especially for niche edits & link inserts) Build a relationship with the website owner Add value to them And most importantly, get a high-quality link All of that makes this one of my favorite types of link building. Broken link building is the tactic Nikolay Stoyanov used to acquire 15 links in 1 day with a 15% conversion rate. It really is one of the most underutilized link building strategies in my opinion. Here is how to do it- Step #1 – Define A Target Website The first step of this link building strategy is to define the website where you want to get a link from. You can pick any website you want, but I’d recommend you be realistic about your expectations. The chances of getting a link from Inc or The New York Times after you find a broken link are slim to none. The best websites where you can get a link from are personal blogs and small companies. The site owners and managers will be grateful for your help, and they will likely thank you with a link. Step #2 – Finding The Broken Links Once you have created the list of the websites you want to get a link from, you need to start searching for the broken links. To do so, you can use seo tool like: Check My Links and Ahrefs. Check My Links is a useful Chrome Extension that finds for links within a specific page. Ahrefs will analyze the site thoroughly and will make a list of all the broken links it has. You see exactly how to find broken links with these tools here. Step #3 – Contacting The Blog Manager Once you finished analyzing all the sites and pages, it’s time to contact the blog owner or manager to let them know about the broken link. Your first goal should be to create a relationship and build some trust . If you have a web page that’s relevant to the page where you find the broken link, then let them know about it. Don’t do it to get a link; do it to help them have a great page for their readers. If you don’t have something relevant to offer, focus on fixing the broken link at hand. It’s likely you will find more opportunities later on to ask for a link. You’ll be amazed at the types of responses you receive from people! This Section In Short The key to broken link building is finding the right sites to pitch. Begin by picking websites that you’d want to get a link from. You can find the sites with the most amount of broken links with the help of a tool like Ahrefs, or you can just check case-by-case with the help of Check My Links.

Harness Internal Link Building Internal link building is one of my favorite link building strategies. Not only do you have complete control over where you place your links… But: It is super easy to implement and carries very little to no risk of penalisation. What Is An Internal Link? An internal link is a link placed on one web page that links to another web page of the same domain. For example- This is an internal link that points to a page on this blog This is an external link that points to a page on a different domain And because they are internal links that we place on our own sites and pages- It means that we have complete control over them and the anchor text that we use.

Replicate Your Competitors Best Links This is one of my favourite white hat link building strategies! Your competitors spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours developing their link building strategies to acquire high-quality links. If you have a small budget, why would you try to compete with those companies? You’d most likely fail to get the same quality of links your competitors get. Instead of hitting your head against your wall in anger and deciding to work harder, you should work smarter. The idea I’m suggesting is simple: Spy on your competitors and steal their best backlinks. You are basically drafting with your competitors; they work hard to get links, you follow them and get the same ones. This is also one of our most effective ecommerce link building strategies in terms of win rate and overall time invested per earned link- Let’s take a quick look at the process: Step #1 – Make A List Of Your Competitors Start by making a list of 5x competitor that ranks for a keyword you want to rank for. It doesn’t matter if they are bigger or smaller than you. They will all teach you some valuable lessons. Step #2 – Analyse Their Backlinks Once you have your list of competitors, you will need to analyse their backlinks profile. You can download my intelligent spreadsheets that make this a really easy process. As you already know, my favorite tool for this is Ahrefs but my spreadsheets also work with SEMRush and SEO Powersuite. If for any reason you don’t want to use my intelligent sheets, you can do it manually… The analysis is simple: go to Ahrefs’ Site Explorer, add the link from one of your competitors, and click the orange loop button. In the left-side menu, click on the link that says Backlinks. In here you can see all the inbound links my competitor (in this case, a paleo blog) got. To make your analysis more interesting, click on the little arrow next to “Nofollow” button in the bar above the results. Here you can organize the links by those that are “Dofollow”, “Nonfollow”, “UGC” and “Sponsored”. This Section In Short Reverse engineering is simple, yet it takes some creativity from your end. You want to know why your competitor got its links; your analysis will try to uncover just that. Start by making a list of your competitors in the top 5 search results. Then analyse the backlinks with the help of my awesome spreadsheets. Or do it manually with Ahrefs, go to the Site Explorer, add your competitor, and once you have the results, click on the link that says Backlinks. There, click on the Link type button, and export the whole list of URLs you get. With this list, you want to open each link and figure out how and why they got the link. Ask yourself, is it because of the quality of their content? Is it because they offer something unique and valuable? You want to know the why behind the link. Learn more about this strategy with my full competitorbacklink analysis tutorial. 9. Get Listed In Link Roundups Link Roundups are blog posts that “round up” links to awesome content. This is usually done daily weekly or monthly and often includes a short write up. Take a look at this blog post example from Matt Diggity’s Blog: You can find these types of blog posts in nearly every niche. All you need to do is- Find websites that regularly post roundups Pitch your content for the next roundup It doesn’t get much easier than that! Step #1 – How To Find Link Roundup Sites Use Google to do the following searches… keyword +link roundup keyword +monthly roundup keyword +roundup keyword +weekly roundup …and then go through the results and add any suitable roundup sites to a spreadsheet. For example: If I wanted to build links to my Ecommerce SEO guide… My Google search would look like this- In a matter of seconds, I have a bunch of relevant search results to add to my list- https://www.semrush.com/blog/ecommerce-link-building/ https://outreachmonks.com/link-roundups/ https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-build-links-and-traffic-from-link-roundups/ Repeat the search for each suggestion mentioned above. And once you have a list ready… Step #2 – Pitching Your Awesome Content Find the contact email address for each site by following my email address lookup guide or using a tool like FindThatLead. Or if you’ve got time search their site for an email address or contact form. The problem with this kind of pitch though… Is that the bloggers that publish these kind of roundup posts get emails like this every day- So if you want to get featured… …you need to do something a little bit different. I suggest that you use a 2 pronged approach- Send the initial outreach email (that doesn’t ask for anything) Then pivot to the pitch You could send something that looks like this at first- Hey, I am a frequent reader of #INSERTROUNDUPNAME# – thanks for putting it together every #WEEK/MONTH/YEAR#. When you featured #INSERTURL# it really helped me to #INSERTRESULT# Looking forward to the next roundup! Thanks again for putting it together all the time! – Your Name Once they reply, then pivot with your link pitch. And that’s it! Link Roundup Link Building is so simple and easy to carry out. All you need is- Some hight quality content A bit of elbow grease to find roundups Not only will you get a link, but you’ll likely receive targeted traffic as well! This Section In Short There are loads of blogs out there who regularly publish link roundup posts which you can take advantage of. Identify blogs in your niche who publish link roundups Find contact information Pitch your content Be sure that any content you pitch is top quality & adds value to their roundup. 10. Get Listed On Resource Pages Most websites have a resource page where they list all the tools, guides and articles that they use or have found useful. I have a few of them across the blog- The Best Free SEO Tools To Super Charge Your Search Rankings 42x SEO Tutorials That Will Take You To The Next Level 24x SEO Tools That Will Fast Track Your Success And it’s not just me. Take a look at this resource page from the Goinswriter team– This is in essence just a list of links with some added commentary. I’m sure you have figured out where this is going right? The concept is pretty simple- Find resource pages in your niche Reach out to them asking for a link Voila! Step #1 – How To Find Resource Pages Jump over to Google and search these terms- Keyword +inurl:links Keyword +useful resources Keyword +helpful resources Keyword +inurl:useful links Keyword +useful links If I wanted to build links to a meditation blog, it would look like this- Just look through the results and pick any that fit your content. Add those to a spreadsheet and you’re ready for the next step. Step #2 – Pitching Your Content The next step is to reach out to the website and pitch them your content to add to the resource page. This is easier said than done. But just like we did earlier, it’s better to take a 2 pronged approach to get the link placed- Send the first outreach email Then pivot to the link placement It really is as easy as that! The more people you ask, the more links you will get. Simples! This Section In Short A simple, yet effective link building strategy is Resource Link Building. Find resource pages that relate to your article, tool, product or service and pitch to the website owner to feature your content. Give them useful evergreen content and earn a valuable backlink in return. Want to learn more about how to do this? Check out my full guide to resource page link building. 11. Create Data Driven Content Creating content that drives attention has become harder and harder as time goes by. To create relevant and useful content, it needs to stand out. Using unique data to develop and enrich your content can help it stand out, command the attention it deserves, and attract the link your website needs. Take a look at this post- I built 12 tests sites across 12 of the most popular hosts to try and find out who really offers the fastest WordPress hosting. Then I published the results (data)- Now, this took quite a lot of time, effort, and money to do. But it answered a common question with data and attracted a bunch of links- I also shared data with my case studies and my monthly income reports for the same reason. To get started, here are a few ideas you can implement to make your content more data-driven: Do an in-depth research on your industry Create tests of tools/services in your niche Find unique data and use it on your content Survey your email list subscribers, industry peers, or customers Create attractive and unique graphics from your own or someone else’s data There is no step-by-step plan for this. Rather, it’s a process you need to follow. Before you hit the “Publish” button, ask yourself- Does this article has any unique data? If not, try to add some so you give it more substance. This Section In Short You can make this as simple or as complicated as you want. Find a common question in your niche Then compile data to answer that question That might mean running your own tests or aggregating the data of others. You could even take someone else’s data and do a better job of presenting it with graphics/infographics/interactive charts/tables. This approach also works well with the NewsJacking strategy above because it’s often easy to compile quick reference data/infographics when a story breaks. 12. Listen To The Web If you have a respected brand in your industry or location, people likely write about you. When someone mentions you online, an opportunity to get a link appears. Unfortunately, many times people forget to link to your site when they mention you but fixing that is easy! Step #1 – Look For Your Company Online In a moment I am going to show you an easy way to automate this but for now, I want you to understand the process. First, search your site on Google- “searchlogistics.com” -inurl:searchlogistics.com This returns a list of results that mention my domain name but excludes all the pages from my own blog. Be creative with your keywords; people may misspell your company’s name more often than you think. Step #2 – Find Your Mentions Make a list of all the sites you find where you have gotten a mention. Check for- mentions without a link with broken links or with incorrect links that lead to a 404 Step #3 – Outreach Once you have created the list of websites, find the person who’s responsible for managing it. If you are in doubt, use the “Contact” page, but it’s better to go straight to the person who can actually fix the mention. Once you have the email addresses you can just use this template- But don’t forget to customize it first! Hey [NAME], I’ve seen you mentioned us on [PAGE]. Thanks a lot! By the way, I’ve seen you haven’t linked to our site. It’d be of great use for your readers if you added a link, so they can learn more about us. Here’s the link you can use: [URL]. Thanks a lot, [YOUR NAME] And of course: Don’t forget to send those follow-ups- Or you’ll be leaving a bunch of links on the table! Step #4 – Setting Up Automatic Alerts Many people won’t answer you because it’s been a long time since they published the page where they mentioned you. That’s why it’s so important to respond fast whenever you get a mention without a link. To do this, you should learn how to setup Google Alerts so you’re always ready. But in essence – every time you see you get a new mention alert, make sure to check there’s a link. Otherwise, contact the writer or editor of the website and ask for the link, using the template shown before. This way, you’ll be able to bring high-quality links to your site with no effort from your end. This Section In Short Link reclamation is one of the easiest link building techniques there is. You are basically getting links from people who already like you, so your pitching will be more effective than usual. To get started, look for mentions your company or site has gotten via Google. Whenever you find a mention without a link, contact the site owner asking for a link with my template. Finally, set up alerts with the help of Google Alerts to make sure never to miss any future mentions. This is one of the more quick win link building strategies that nearly anyone can apply instantly! 13. Recycle Old Domain Names One of my favourite link building hacks is to recycle expired domains. Why? Because some aged domains– Have great backlink profiles Have high levels of authority Are highly relevant to your niche Have valuable backlinks from places like Wikipedia, BBC, New York Times etc Regardless of which side of the stupid white hat/black hat argument you subscribe to- You should be wielding their power for your business. And if you’re are super smart about it… You can buy them for the same price as new domains! (more about that later) What To Do With Expired Domains You have a few choices when you buy an expired domain- Build a new site on the expired domain with instant authority Use the expired domains to link to your site Redirect the expired domain to pass on link juice to your site We used one to build out a new site in November which has already taken 15 number 1 positions and featured snippets- This is why so many people use them because if you build out a site on a highly authoritative and relevant expired domain it can give you a serious head start. But the trick is finding RELEVANT expired domains that have authority in the first place. How To Find Expired Domains Finding expired domains can be as hard or as easy as you want it to be. I have used every tool under the sun over the years and for me the best tools by far are Domain Hunter Gatherer and Spamzilla. They will help you to find expired domains and pull in key metrics for you. What you do with an expired domain once you have found it is up to you. This Section In Short Expired domains that have great backlink profiles are worth their weight in gold! Buying these domains and either building your websites on them or using them to create links is an intelligent strategy. Learn more about expired domains and how to recycle them. PRO TIPS: Selling expired domain names is a great way to make extra income. Learn how to sell a domain name. 14. Hijack News Events One of the key elements of any effective link building campaign is creating great website content that stands out and commands attention. Creating content that has a higher likelihood of going viral, however, isn’t easy. Instead of wasting time trying to figure out what people may like, you can take what people are already talking about and use that as inspiration for your next piece of content. This tactic is known as “newsjacking” because you are taking advantage of a popular topic from the news and using it to create and promote your own content. A classic case of newsjacking is what Oreo did in the Superbowl 2013. After the energy shut down in the stadium, they tweeted the following: This Oreo tweet got more than 15,880 retweets and 6,200 favourites in just a few hours. They also got a lot of press (and the links that come with it), including mentions in The Huffington Post, Wired, and CNET. You can use this same press to get links to your site. Here’s how you do it: Step #1 – Find Popular Topics Research what people talk about with the help of Google Trends. You can put your own ideas in the top search bar and see their popularity, or write down the list of topics that show up on the homepage. The young royals, for example, represent a great idea for many articles, especially if you are in the design, beauty, and fashion industry. Go broad with your list of ideas; later you will analyse them in more detail. Step #2 – Brainstorm content ideas With your initial list of popular topics, brainstorm a list of content articles. You want both to have some relationship with one another. For example, if you have a blog that talks about leadership, you could write something related to Tim Cook’s leadership style- 5 Things Sales Managers Can Learn From Tim Cook How Tim Cook’s Leadership Style Will Accelerate Your Success The 3 Leadership Mistakes Tim Cook Made That You Must Avoid At All Costs Step #3 – Define And Create The Content With your list of content ideas, define one that suits you best, and start creating the content fast. Time is your friend in here. The popularity of some topics lasts only a few weeks, if not days. Make sure to have the article done no longer than a week after you found it. Step #4 – Publish And Promote Talking about a popular topic makes promotion easier, but it’s not a fool-proof way of creating viral content. As it always happens with content, focus on the promotion. Don’t promote it on social media alone; use it as a way to get the attention of people both within and outside your industry. Reach outside your industry. Using the previous example, you may want to reach blogs that talk about technology, business, Apple, and Uber. This Section In Short Newsworthy content always attract attention (and link opportunities). It’s really easy to do and there are new opportunities every single week! To find newsjacking opportunities, get to know what people are searching for with Google Trends. You can go deeper with the help of the categories section. With the results, brainstorm potential ideas that tie your expertise with the news. Create the content fast, and aggressively promote it. Remember, people like sharing content that’s new and unique; newsjacking can help you achieve just that. 15. Massage Influencers Ego’s Dale Carnegie said once “You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.” Similarly, if you play on people’s ego, the chances of getting links from high-authority sites increase significantly. First, you build relationships with people that manage high-traffic, high authority blogs/sites. As you know, relationships are one of the key ways to get anything in life, including links. If you get influencers interested in your article, they will feel invested. Once you publish it, they will feel “pushed” to share and link to it, even if you don’t tell them. This is the basis of influencer marketing. Creating ego bait list posts (ELP for short) has helped get 2000 views to a blog that wasn’t even getting 50 visits per month. In the image above you can see the sessions went up 482%, while the pageviews increased 1382% and the users 624%. If you want to get started with ego bait, follow these steps: Step #1 – Pick Your Headline As I recommend on the ego bait list article, start with the headline, which sums up the idea of the article. You can use the following structure: Number + (industry) blogs/experts + promise/keyword Pick a list of influencers from your industry, and define the promise that your article will fulfil. You can pick as little or as many as you want, depending on how much in-depth you want to go with each influencer. For example you might want to ask what everyone’s favorite link building tools are. That makes it easy for the influencers to know exactly what they are expected to write about. The audience will also appreciate a specific piece of advice they can use on their own. Step #2 – Define the Question Even though you have already specified the main promise of the article, you want to define the question you will ask the influencers. Be specific and focus on one question only. Influencers are busy people, that’s why you want them to answer your question with the greatest level of detail possible. When defining the question, remember what people would want to read about. Pick a unique angle for the question. For example, if I were to do another SEO ego bait article like the one I showed you before, I’d focus on something like the best local SEO strategy or favourite 30 minutes SEO quick win. It still focuses on SEO but has a new angle that brings a good answer to people’s problems. Step #3 – The Experts Create a list of all the experts you want to contact. You can brainstorm the experts or search on Google for other expert roundups in your niche & with similar target markets- Make sure to define experts that have sites with high domain authority & page authority as well as social following. This will make the sharing as well as the linking more powerful. After you define the list of experts, find their contact information. Look in their personal websites, use LinkedIn, or simply ask them on Twitter. Step #4 – Outreach Finally, send the influencers an email with your question. If they don’t answer right away, wait a few days. Follow up two times more, and if they don’t answer, ask a different influencer. Don’t be a pushy link builder. You should get a response rate of around 10-25%, maybe more if you already have a relationship with some of the influencers or if you are one yourself. This Section In Short Creating egobait articles is simple. The key to success is to structure your article for success and be organized with the pitching. Start by defining your headline. It must convey the value right away so people want to click on it. You can use the structure I recommend which is: Number + (industry) blogs/experts + promise/keyword Then, define the question (or questions) you want to ask to the influencers. Make sure to make it super concise and actionable. Then, define the experts you want to contact. Finally, contact the experts with the question you previously defined. Once you publish your content, make sure you contact the experts so they help you promote it. Also, remember it’s all about the relationships; once an expert knows about your site, it will be easier for them to link to your site in the future (assuming they like your site). BONUS EGO BAIT STRATEGY: Take a look at this awesome link building tutorial that you can use to ego bait people in a different way. 16. Outsource Your Link Building I won’t lie to you… Even with the best link building strategies – link building is still hard work and takes time.

LinksThatRank also offers a quick and easy buying process that’s entirely hands-off. All you have to do is choose the links you need and tell them which keyword you are targeting – they take care of the rest. How Many Backlinks Do I Need? The truth is that there is no blanket answer to this question. Every single keyword, niche and search result is different. The good news is that it’s possible to calculate how many backlinks you need to rank for a target keyword. Just follow this simple 3-step process. Step #1 – Determine Which Pages You Need To Build Backlinks To Don’t build links to every page on your site. Why? Because not every page is worth it. Link building costs time and money. You should only build links to pages that include keywords that generate real leads and sales for your business. So, the first thing you need to do is work out which pages they are. Here’s how we do it: Look at pages where you currently rank in spots 2 to 30 for your target keyword Find the top pages that make you the most money (not traffic) Create a shortlist of those pages and take note of them You can do all of this for free using Google Search Console. Need some more help? Watch the video below for more information. Step #2 – Calculate The “Link Gap” Now that you have your shortlist of target keywords, you can calculate the “link gap”. The link gap is simply the minimum number of links you need to rank in the top 3 positions on Google for your target keyword. For this, you will need a premium tool like Ahrefs or Semrush. Here’s how the process works: Type your target keywords into your chosen tool (I prefer Ahrefs) Look at the links above DR20 pointing to the first three ranking URLs Write down the number of links for each ranking URL The video below outlines this entire process in more detail. Now you are ready for the last step… Step #3 – Build The Links You Need Link building is the trickiest part for many SEOs. Some people feel comfortable enough to do it themselves with any of the above link-building strategies. Others prefer to outsource it to a service link LinksThatRank. You decide which method is right for your business. Either way… You now know which pages to build links to and how many links you need to build. The last step is simply to build them. How To Get Your Links Indexed? Getting your newly built links indexed is essential. Why? They will only help your rankings if Google knows they exist.

Leverage Testimonials In Your Niche This link building strategy almost seems too easy… Well… That’s because it is! With just a few minutes work you can create powerful homepage links to your website. Let me explain what I mean. By reaching out and offering positive testimonials for services and/or products that you are using… …you can have your testimonial published with a link back to your website. Here is one of my testimonials based on the findings of my Surfer SEO review– Which includes a backlink to my homepage. So let’s take a quick look at how to build a number of external links with testimonials! Step #1 – Generate A List Of Targets To get started with this link building tactic, you need to find the websites for services and products that you could provide a testimonial for. Each site needs to- Be relevant to your niche Have existing testimonials Actually be a product/service that you use So start by writing a list of tools/products/services you are already using in your business. If you’re struggling to come up with any ideas you could cheat a little bit. Look at what other tools and services people in your niche use…. And you’ll quite often find that a free trial will be on offer to test the tool… Step #2 – Find The Right Person To Pitch To Now we need to find the right person to contact. Sometimes you can just ask via the contact form on the website and some will even have dedicated testimonial submission forms. Or you can use one of these handy extensions to help you find email addresses- FindThatLead Hunter Then you can add each email address to your spreadsheet and start to contact everyone on your list with a pitch. Step #3 – Send Your Testimonial Pitch Before spending time creating a testimonial… First pitch them with the idea that they could have a testimonial created by you. Here are some thing’s to keep in mind when putting together your pitch: Introduce yourself Tell them how their tool has helped you Include specific results Ask them if you can put together a testimonial Keep it simple Just keep it short, simple and sweet. Step #4 – Writing The Perfect Testimonial Writing the perfect testimonial is pretty straight forward. You want to write a short piece of text that includes- What you liked most How the tool/service helped you Specific results Your personal recommendation Here are some good example testimonials from my readers- To learn more on testimonial link building, including exactly how to build these links from start to finish, checkout my full guide- This Section In Short Using testimonials as a link building strategy is a fantastic way to build high quality homepage links. Generate a list of target services and products Find the right person to pitch to Send them your pitch Write the testimonial It really is that easy and if you need any more help you can see my full testimonial link building tutorial. 2. Support New Business Growth Crowdfunding is one of the most unknown and underused link building strategy. Someone who is raising money for their business through crowdfunding will often place a link to each person that contributed… See where this is going yet? The donation can be anything from $1 up to thousands of dollars and can be found for all kinds of projects across all niches. Meaning this is a brilliant opportunity to get link back to your website. There are two ways to obtain links. Donor links Package links Donor links are from pages that publish the details of all donors, including a link to the donor’s website: Package links are when links are offered as part of a package you get if you donate a certain amount of money: Sounds easy right? It really is! How To Find Crowdfunding Sites For Link Building There are hundreds of crowdfunding sites out there to search through. But we are gonna take a closer look at Indiegogo. There is a simple way to look for crowdfunding projects without trawling through the site. Simply do a Google search using these keywords: site:[indiegogo.com] inurl:projects +“link to your” site:[indiegogo.com] inurl:projects +”donor page” You need to be prepared to sift through the results… But they will be vastly narrowed down to projects that either add donor’s details to their donor page or projects that offer links in exchange for your donation. You will be able to find a bunch of crowdfunding projects that are affordable and an easy way to get links to your website. You might even benefit from some of their other perks too! This Section In Short Crowdfunding is an underused link building strategy. You can build backlinks from crowdfunding projects by either: Being included on their donation page Receiving a link back as part of a package Make a list of crowdfunding sites to search. Use Google searches to narrow down opportunities: site:[website URL] inurl:projects +“link to your” site:[website URL] inurl:projects +”donor page” And find crowdfunding pages within your niche that allow you to build links and are within your budget. Check out my full crowdfunding link building tutorial to learn more. 3. Sponsor Real World Events Did you know that you can use events as part of your link building strategy? They could be local, national, and international events that you can utilize to build links. There are two ways you can do this… #1 – Hosting An Event You can create your own event and then have it advertised on third-party event sites which then link back to your website. These links are usually extremely relevant and come from high authority sites. #2 – Sponsoring An Event Alternatively, you can sponsor an event being hosted by someone else as most hosts will list (and link to) all their sponsors. This is also a great way to build good relationships with other authorities in your industry. I am going to give you a quick glimpse of how to find events to sponsor. This type of event link building offers all the benefits without actually having to host an event. How To Find Events To Sponsor Firstly you need to figure out what type of events are relevant to your niche. This could be workshops, conferences, lectures, clubs etc… Then you need to make a list of where these events are likely to be hosted online. Depending on the event, local events may be hosted on local sites, but national or international events can usually be found on sites like: Eventful MeetUp Events.org To find events that you can sponsor… You can use these Google searches for each of the hosting sites: site:[website URL] inurl:events +“sponsors” site:[website URL] inurl:events +“link to your” site:[website URL] inurl:registration +“sponsors” site:[website URL] +“sponsors” site:[website URL] + “donation” site:[website URL] + “become a sponsor” And if you want to pull in more specific results, just add a keyword at the end: Search through the results and make a list of any events that are relevant to your niche. Rinse and repeat for each event hosting site using each search term. Once you have exhausted all opportunities and set up your sponsorships for each event, you can set up Google alerts to find any new sponsorship opportunities as they appear. This Section In Short Event link building is a great way to get backlinks that Google approves of. There are two ways of building these links: Hosting An Event: Creating an event where third-party event websites link back Sponsoring An Event: Sponsoring a relevant event & receiving a link as a sponsor Finding events to sponsor is easy to do with these Google searches: site:[website URL] inurl:events +“sponsors” site:[website URL] inurl:events +“link to your” site:[website URL] inurl:registration +“sponsors” site:[website URL] +“sponsors” site:[website URL] + “donation” site:[website URL] + “become a sponsor” Just add the event hosting site (eg. eventful.com/) and if you need to narrow down the search to more relevant events… Simply add another keyword to the search. Rinse and repeat for a range of event hosting sites for each search term or check out my step by step guide to event link building. 4. Show Your Presence On Social Media Social media backlinks are generally considered by a lot of people to be a waste of time. This is because they are nofollow and considered to carry little SEO benefit but still form an important base of links most genuine businesses should have. Healthy link profiles include both follow links and legitimate nofollow. So I am going to show you 5 quick wins from Facebook (accessible for all skill levels) but there are 23 more from other networks listed in my full social media backlinks guide. How To Build Backlinks With Facebook As Facebook is the most popular network I thought we would start there… Let’s dive in: #1 – Your Profile’s ‘Intro’ The best way to connect a new visitor to your website is through your ‘Intro’. Just add your website URL in your basic settings and be sure to have it set to public. #2 – Your ‘About’ Page Description As well as adding your website to your about page contact info, you can also place your website URL in the description: By having your website appear twice on your about me page… You are doubling your chances of sending traffic to your website from there. #3 – Include A Website Link In All Posts For those articles, you are posting that aren’t directing traffic to your site… You can still add a link as a reference. This can easily be worked into all your blog posts. #4 – Page Buttons You can add page buttons underneath your cover photo. These can be optimised to send traffic to your website when clicked: Simply add or edit your page button and input your website’s URL. #5 – Picture Descriptions You can add your website to the description of an image (which most people don’t do). This works best when done for your profile picture and cover photo: Don’t forget to update this each time you change your pictures. To learn more about using social media backlinks on Facebook and other platforms like: Twitter LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Instagram Quora …head over to my full tutorial – 28 Social Media Backlinks To Increase Your Rankings This Section In Short Social media backlinks are more valuable than most people think and there are many ways you can build these links which I cover in my full tutorial. But here’s a snap shot of how you can build social media backlinks on Facebook: Your Profile’s ‘Info’ Tab Your ‘About’ Page Description Include A Website Link In All Posts Page Buttons Picture Descriptions 5. Strategic Guest Blogging Boring right? But guest blogging is one of the most popular, simplest and most effective link building strategy there is… The funny thing is most people label guest posting as a white hat strategy. But Google has given us multiple warnings- And more importantly: John Mueller advised to nofollow guest post links. My point is: ALL FORMS of link building are against Google’s guidelines. And in the end… All Google’s ranking algorithm wants to see is specific metrics. It’s your job to feed it those metrics. And guest posts will always work very well as a marketing function to build a target audience and feed the algorithm the metrics it wants. The idea behind guest blogging is simple: You create a high-quality piece of content You add a few links in the content piece pointing to your site You get the piece published in another site, preferably one with a high DA I won’t lie to you: Guest blogging isn’t what it’s used to be a few years ago. It’s much much harder to earn a genuine link placement in 2025. Most site owners have caught on and often want payments to place your guest posts. Which is nothing more than just a long-winded way to buy links right? And some people are much much more direct- That’s not to say that guest blogging isn’t worth doing and it’s definetly easier if you use one of the recommended guest posting services. Feel free to walk that line however you choose. To get started with guest blogging, there are 5 steps you need to follow: Find your prospects Qualify the right blogs Send outreach emails Create great content Build relationships Step #1 – Find Your Prospects The first step to getting started with guest blogging is to find your prospects. These are the websites where you are going to publish your piece of content. Ideally, you want to publish on sites with high DA (domain authority), page authority and high organic traffic. But how do you find them? Two words – SEO Footprints. Think of SEO Footprints as digital imprints left around the web. You can leverage these footprints by using search operators to find potential sites for guest blogging. Here’s an example: Let’s say you run a site about sustainable living. Go to Google and do a quick search using the following: “proudly powered by WordPress” intitle:sustainability This will bring up a list of WordPress websites about sustainability. The reason this works so well is because lots of websites built on WordPress have blogs. This gives you a whole list of potential guest blogging opportunities on niche-relevant sites. Cool, right? And the best part is there are so many different variations of SEO footprints to try. Here are a few of the top ones: “proudly powered by WordPress” – intitle:niche keyword “proudly powered by WordPress” – “niche keywords” “your keyword” + “comments” “your keyword” + “leave a comment” “your keyword” + inurl:blog “your keyword” + inurl:blog “post a comment” “your keyword”+ site:.edu “forums register” “your keyword” + site:.edu “register i am over 13 years of age forum” “your keyword” + site:.edu “discussion board register” Make sure you check out our complete SEO footprints tutorial to get even more ways to find strategic guest blogging opportunities for link building. Step #2 – Qualify The Blogs With the list, you have created, run each site through Ahrefs (who just so happen to be the best backlink checker) to check their domain authority. Take the first website in your list, and go to the Site Explorer. Once you are there, add the website you want to analyze and click on the orange loop icon. In the menu, take the number that you see in the center of the screen, under the DR sign. Add these numbers to your list and repeat the process until you have the DR of every site. Step #3 – Reaching Out With the list of websites, go to each site and contact the manager to check if they are interested in your pitch. To contact each blog you can use the following template: Subject: Writing for SITE Hi [NAME], I was checking out [SITE] today and found the guest post you published from [GUEST POSTER’S NAME]. I loved that article, I just shared it with my audience. I’d love to be your next guest author. Here are some topics that I think would do really well with [SITE] readers: Topic #1 Topic #2 Topic #3 Do any of these ideas look good? Let me know your thoughts. Best, [YOUR NAME] I highly recommend that you customise that a little bit and also take a peek at any specific guest post guidelines they may have. Step #4 – Creating Incredible Guest Post Content Once you get accepted, start creating the content. It’s important to write with the blog’s target audience in mind! If you need to dig into the site’s audience, read the comments from previous articles and check the blog posts that got the most shares and comments. Don’t hold anything back, write everything you know about the subject- Add quotes Add links to other relevant articles from the site Add images and videos Add anything you can to make it amazing Take a look at this incredible guest post by James Johnson- He teaches everything he knows about becoming a freelance writer. And he holds nothing back! Once you finish writing it, send it their way. Step #5 – Build Relationships A great thing about guest blogging is that it helps you build relationships with the blog managers. Creating a network is important if you ever need help promoting a specific piece of content from your site and you want to publish often in a high-authority site. BONUS TIP: Engage Their Audience One of the most overlooked benefits of guest blogging is the ability to open direct conversation with someone elses audience. What does that mean? Well it means that you should- Respond to all of the comments on your guest post personally Monitor shares on social media then reply to say thanks Setup Google Alerts for the URL to engage anywhere it gets shared If you do those 3 things alongside your guest post, you will accelerate your results. This Section In Short Guest blogging can take some time, and due to the amount of content you have to create, it can get messy. Find your prospects with the help of the Google footprints I previously shared Then, qualify every blog you found to make sure you are pitching to the right place. Reach out to the right people using the template I shared as a basis. Send your guest post and get it published. Engage with their audience as much as possible. It can be a pretty long-winded process, but it is an effective one. It will allow you to find, qualify and reach out to hundreds of blogs in just a few clicks. If you need help with guest posting, check out one of these guest posting services. 6. Help Clean Up The Web Most websites have hundreds, if not thousands, of links. Many of them link internally, while others do it externally. For whatever reason, these links can easily break and stop working. Most site owners don’t realize this when it happens, and it can break their user experience, reputation, and SEO performance. In fact as I am writing this, I just did a quick check on my own blog- And I have broken links from an old a/b experiment where I didn’t redirect the test page! Finding broken links represent a magnificent occasion for you to- Find link building opportunities (especially for niche edits & link inserts) Build a relationship with the website owner Add value to them And most importantly, get a high-quality link All of that makes this one of my favorite types of link building. Broken link building is the tactic Nikolay Stoyanov used to acquire 15 links in 1 day with a 15% conversion rate. It really is one of the most underutilized link building strategies in my opinion. Here is how to do it- Step #1 – Define A Target Website The first step of this link building strategy is to define the website where you want to get a link from. You can pick any website you want, but I’d recommend you be realistic about your expectations. The chances of getting a link from Inc or The New York Times after you find a broken link are slim to none. The best websites where you can get a link from are personal blogs and small companies. The site owners and managers will be grateful for your help, and they will likely thank you with a link. Step #2 – Finding The Broken Links Once you have created the list of the websites you want to get a link from, you need to start searching for the broken links. To do so, you can use seo tool like: Check My Links and Ahrefs. Check My Links is a useful Chrome Extension that finds for links within a specific page. Ahrefs will analyze the site thoroughly and will make a list of all the broken links it has. You see exactly how to find broken links with these tools here. Step #3 – Contacting The Blog Manager Once you finished analyzing all the sites and pages, it’s time to contact the blog owner or manager to let them know about the broken link. Your first goal should be to create a relationship and build some trust . If you have a web page that’s relevant to the page where you find the broken link, then let them know about it. Don’t do it to get a link; do it to help them have a great page for their readers. If you don’t have something relevant to offer, focus on fixing the broken link at hand. It’s likely you will find more opportunities later on to ask for a link. You’ll be amazed at the types of responses you receive from people! This Section In Short The key to broken link building is finding the right sites to pitch. Begin by picking websites that you’d want to get a link from. You can find the sites with the most amount of broken links with the help of a tool like Ahrefs, or you can just check case-by-case with the help of Check My Links.

Harness Internal Link Building Internal link building is one of my favorite link building strategies. Not only do you have complete control over where you place your links… But: It is super easy to implement and carries very little to no risk of penalisation. What Is An Internal Link? An internal link is a link placed on one web page that links to another web page of the same domain. For example- This is an internal link that points to a page on this blog This is an external link that points to a page on a different domain And because they are internal links that we place on our own sites and pages- It means that we have complete control over them and the anchor text that we use.

Replicate Your Competitors Best Links This is one of my favourite white hat link building strategies! Your competitors spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours developing their link building strategies to acquire high-quality links. If you have a small budget, why would you try to compete with those companies? You’d most likely fail to get the same quality of links your competitors get. Instead of hitting your head against your wall in anger and deciding to work harder, you should work smarter. The idea I’m suggesting is simple: Spy on your competitors and steal their best backlinks. You are basically drafting with your competitors; they work hard to get links, you follow them and get the same ones. This is also one of our most effective ecommerce link building strategies in terms of win rate and overall time invested per earned link- Let’s take a quick look at the process: Step #1 – Make A List Of Your Competitors Start by making a list of 5x competitor that ranks for a keyword you want to rank for. It doesn’t matter if they are bigger or smaller than you. They will all teach you some valuable lessons. Step #2 – Analyse Their Backlinks Once you have your list of competitors, you will need to analyse their backlinks profile. You can download my intelligent spreadsheets that make this a really easy process. As you already know, my favorite tool for this is Ahrefs but my spreadsheets also work with SEMRush and SEO Powersuite. If for any reason you don’t want to use my intelligent sheets, you can do it manually… The analysis is simple: go to Ahrefs’ Site Explorer, add the link from one of your competitors, and click the orange loop button. In the left-side menu, click on the link that says Backlinks. In here you can see all the inbound links my competitor (in this case, a paleo blog) got. To make your analysis more interesting, click on the little arrow next to “Nofollow” button in the bar above the results. Here you can organize the links by those that are “Dofollow”, “Nonfollow”, “UGC” and “Sponsored”. This Section In Short Reverse engineering is simple, yet it takes some creativity from your end. You want to know why your competitor got its links; your analysis will try to uncover just that. Start by making a list of your competitors in the top 5 search results. Then analyse the backlinks with the help of my awesome spreadsheets. Or do it manually with Ahrefs, go to the Site Explorer, add your competitor, and once you have the results, click on the link that says Backlinks. There, click on the Link type button, and export the whole list of URLs you get. With this list, you want to open each link and figure out how and why they got the link. Ask yourself, is it because of the quality of their content? Is it because they offer something unique and valuable? You want to know the why behind the link. Learn more about this strategy with my full competitorbacklink analysis tutorial. 9. Get Listed In Link Roundups Link Roundups are blog posts that “round up” links to awesome content. This is usually done daily weekly or monthly and often includes a short write up. Take a look at this blog post example from Matt Diggity’s Blog: You can find these types of blog posts in nearly every niche. All you need to do is- Find websites that regularly post roundups Pitch your content for the next roundup It doesn’t get much easier than that! Step #1 – How To Find Link Roundup Sites Use Google to do the following searches… keyword +link roundup keyword +monthly roundup keyword +roundup keyword +weekly roundup …and then go through the results and add any suitable roundup sites to a spreadsheet. For example: If I wanted to build links to my Ecommerce SEO guide… My Google search would look like this- In a matter of seconds, I have a bunch of relevant search results to add to my list- https://www.semrush.com/blog/ecommerce-link-building/ https://outreachmonks.com/link-roundups/ https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-build-links-and-traffic-from-link-roundups/ Repeat the search for each suggestion mentioned above. And once you have a list ready… Step #2 – Pitching Your Awesome Content Find the contact email address for each site by following my email address lookup guide or using a tool like FindThatLead. Or if you’ve got time search their site for an email address or contact form. The problem with this kind of pitch though… Is that the bloggers that publish these kind of roundup posts get emails like this every day- So if you want to get featured… …you need to do something a little bit different. I suggest that you use a 2 pronged approach- Send the initial outreach email (that doesn’t ask for anything) Then pivot to the pitch You could send something that looks like this at first- Hey, I am a frequent reader of #INSERTROUNDUPNAME# – thanks for putting it together every #WEEK/MONTH/YEAR#. When you featured #INSERTURL# it really helped me to #INSERTRESULT# Looking forward to the next roundup! Thanks again for putting it together all the time! – Your Name Once they reply, then pivot with your link pitch. And that’s it! Link Roundup Link Building is so simple and easy to carry out. All you need is- Some hight quality content A bit of elbow grease to find roundups Not only will you get a link, but you’ll likely receive targeted traffic as well! This Section In Short There are loads of blogs out there who regularly publish link roundup posts which you can take advantage of. Identify blogs in your niche who publish link roundups Find contact information Pitch your content Be sure that any content you pitch is top quality & adds value to their roundup. 10. Get Listed On Resource Pages Most websites have a resource page where they list all the tools, guides and articles that they use or have found useful. I have a few of them across the blog- The Best Free SEO Tools To Super Charge Your Search Rankings 42x SEO Tutorials That Will Take You To The Next Level 24x SEO Tools That Will Fast Track Your Success And it’s not just me. Take a look at this resource page from the Goinswriter team– This is in essence just a list of links with some added commentary. I’m sure you have figured out where this is going right? The concept is pretty simple- Find resource pages in your niche Reach out to them asking for a link Voila! Step #1 – How To Find Resource Pages Jump over to Google and search these terms- Keyword +inurl:links Keyword +useful resources Keyword +helpful resources Keyword +inurl:useful links Keyword +useful links If I wanted to build links to a meditation blog, it would look like this- Just look through the results and pick any that fit your content. Add those to a spreadsheet and you’re ready for the next step. Step #2 – Pitching Your Content The next step is to reach out to the website and pitch them your content to add to the resource page. This is easier said than done. But just like we did earlier, it’s better to take a 2 pronged approach to get the link placed- Send the first outreach email Then pivot to the link placement It really is as easy as that! The more people you ask, the more links you will get. Simples! This Section In Short A simple, yet effective link building strategy is Resource Link Building. Find resource pages that relate to your article, tool, product or service and pitch to the website owner to feature your content. Give them useful evergreen content and earn a valuable backlink in return. Want to learn more about how to do this? Check out my full guide to resource page link building. 11. Create Data Driven Content Creating content that drives attention has become harder and harder as time goes by. To create relevant and useful content, it needs to stand out. Using unique data to develop and enrich your content can help it stand out, command the attention it deserves, and attract the link your website needs. Take a look at this post- I built 12 tests sites across 12 of the most popular hosts to try and find out who really offers the fastest WordPress hosting. Then I published the results (data)- Now, this took quite a lot of time, effort, and money to do. But it answered a common question with data and attracted a bunch of links- I also shared data with my case studies and my monthly income reports for the same reason. To get started, here are a few ideas you can implement to make your content more data-driven: Do an in-depth research on your industry Create tests of tools/services in your niche Find unique data and use it on your content Survey your email list subscribers, industry peers, or customers Create attractive and unique graphics from your own or someone else’s data There is no step-by-step plan for this. Rather, it’s a process you need to follow. Before you hit the “Publish” button, ask yourself- Does this article has any unique data? If not, try to add some so you give it more substance. This Section In Short You can make this as simple or as complicated as you want. Find a common question in your niche Then compile data to answer that question That might mean running your own tests or aggregating the data of others. You could even take someone else’s data and do a better job of presenting it with graphics/infographics/interactive charts/tables. This approach also works well with the NewsJacking strategy above because it’s often easy to compile quick reference data/infographics when a story breaks. 12. Listen To The Web If you have a respected brand in your industry or location, people likely write about you. When someone mentions you online, an opportunity to get a link appears. Unfortunately, many times people forget to link to your site when they mention you but fixing that is easy! Step #1 – Look For Your Company Online In a moment I am going to show you an easy way to automate this but for now, I want you to understand the process. First, search your site on Google- “searchlogistics.com” -inurl:searchlogistics.com This returns a list of results that mention my domain name but excludes all the pages from my own blog. Be creative with your keywords; people may misspell your company’s name more often than you think. Step #2 – Find Your Mentions Make a list of all the sites you find where you have gotten a mention. Check for- mentions without a link with broken links or with incorrect links that lead to a 404 Step #3 – Outreach Once you have created the list of websites, find the person who’s responsible for managing it. If you are in doubt, use the “Contact” page, but it’s better to go straight to the person who can actually fix the mention. Once you have the email addresses you can just use this template- But don’t forget to customize it first! Hey [NAME], I’ve seen you mentioned us on [PAGE]. Thanks a lot! By the way, I’ve seen you haven’t linked to our site. It’d be of great use for your readers if you added a link, so they can learn more about us. Here’s the link you can use: [URL]. Thanks a lot, [YOUR NAME] And of course: Don’t forget to send those follow-ups- Or you’ll be leaving a bunch of links on the table! Step #4 – Setting Up Automatic Alerts Many people won’t answer you because it’s been a long time since they published the page where they mentioned you. That’s why it’s so important to respond fast whenever you get a mention without a link. To do this, you should learn how to setup Google Alerts so you’re always ready. But in essence – every time you see you get a new mention alert, make sure to check there’s a link. Otherwise, contact the writer or editor of the website and ask for the link, using the template shown before. This way, you’ll be able to bring high-quality links to your site with no effort from your end. This Section In Short Link reclamation is one of the easiest link building techniques there is. You are basically getting links from people who already like you, so your pitching will be more effective than usual. To get started, look for mentions your company or site has gotten via Google. Whenever you find a mention without a link, contact the site owner asking for a link with my template. Finally, set up alerts with the help of Google Alerts to make sure never to miss any future mentions. This is one of the more quick win link building strategies that nearly anyone can apply instantly! 13. Recycle Old Domain Names One of my favourite link building hacks is to recycle expired domains. Why? Because some aged domains– Have great backlink profiles Have high levels of authority Are highly relevant to your niche Have valuable backlinks from places like Wikipedia, BBC, New York Times etc Regardless of which side of the stupid white hat/black hat argument you subscribe to- You should be wielding their power for your business. And if you’re are super smart about it… You can buy them for the same price as new domains! (more about that later) What To Do With Expired Domains You have a few choices when you buy an expired domain- Build a new site on the expired domain with instant authority Use the expired domains to link to your site Redirect the expired domain to pass on link juice to your site We used one to build out a new site in November which has already taken 15 number 1 positions and featured snippets- This is why so many people use them because if you build out a site on a highly authoritative and relevant expired domain it can give you a serious head start. But the trick is finding RELEVANT expired domains that have authority in the first place. How To Find Expired Domains Finding expired domains can be as hard or as easy as you want it to be. I have used every tool under the sun over the years and for me the best tools by far are Domain Hunter Gatherer and Spamzilla. They will help you to find expired domains and pull in key metrics for you. What you do with an expired domain once you have found it is up to you. This Section In Short Expired domains that have great backlink profiles are worth their weight in gold! Buying these domains and either building your websites on them or using them to create links is an intelligent strategy. Learn more about expired domains and how to recycle them. PRO TIPS: Selling expired domain names is a great way to make extra income. Learn how to sell a domain name. 14. Hijack News Events One of the key elements of any effective link building campaign is creating great website content that stands out and commands attention. Creating content that has a higher likelihood of going viral, however, isn’t easy. Instead of wasting time trying to figure out what people may like, you can take what people are already talking about and use that as inspiration for your next piece of content. This tactic is known as “newsjacking” because you are taking advantage of a popular topic from the news and using it to create and promote your own content. A classic case of newsjacking is what Oreo did in the Superbowl 2013. After the energy shut down in the stadium, they tweeted the following: This Oreo tweet got more than 15,880 retweets and 6,200 favourites in just a few hours. They also got a lot of press (and the links that come with it), including mentions in The Huffington Post, Wired, and CNET. You can use this same press to get links to your site. Here’s how you do it: Step #1 – Find Popular Topics Research what people talk about with the help of Google Trends. You can put your own ideas in the top search bar and see their popularity, or write down the list of topics that show up on the homepage. The young royals, for example, represent a great idea for many articles, especially if you are in the design, beauty, and fashion industry. Go broad with your list of ideas; later you will analyse them in more detail. Step #2 – Brainstorm content ideas With your initial list of popular topics, brainstorm a list of content articles. You want both to have some relationship with one another. For example, if you have a blog that talks about leadership, you could write something related to Tim Cook’s leadership style- 5 Things Sales Managers Can Learn From Tim Cook How Tim Cook’s Leadership Style Will Accelerate Your Success The 3 Leadership Mistakes Tim Cook Made That You Must Avoid At All Costs Step #3 – Define And Create The Content With your list of content ideas, define one that suits you best, and start creating the content fast. Time is your friend in here. The popularity of some topics lasts only a few weeks, if not days. Make sure to have the article done no longer than a week after you found it. Step #4 – Publish And Promote Talking about a popular topic makes promotion easier, but it’s not a fool-proof way of creating viral content. As it always happens with content, focus on the promotion. Don’t promote it on social media alone; use it as a way to get the attention of people both within and outside your industry. Reach outside your industry. Using the previous example, you may want to reach blogs that talk about technology, business, Apple, and Uber. This Section In Short Newsworthy content always attract attention (and link opportunities). It’s really easy to do and there are new opportunities every single week! To find newsjacking opportunities, get to know what people are searching for with Google Trends. You can go deeper with the help of the categories section. With the results, brainstorm potential ideas that tie your expertise with the news. Create the content fast, and aggressively promote it. Remember, people like sharing content that’s new and unique; newsjacking can help you achieve just that. 15. Massage Influencers Ego’s Dale Carnegie said once “You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.” Similarly, if you play on people’s ego, the chances of getting links from high-authority sites increase significantly. First, you build relationships with people that manage high-traffic, high authority blogs/sites. As you know, relationships are one of the key ways to get anything in life, including links. If you get influencers interested in your article, they will feel invested. Once you publish it, they will feel “pushed” to share and link to it, even if you don’t tell them. This is the basis of influencer marketing. Creating ego bait list posts (ELP for short) has helped get 2000 views to a blog that wasn’t even getting 50 visits per month. In the image above you can see the sessions went up 482%, while the pageviews increased 1382% and the users 624%. If you want to get started with ego bait, follow these steps: Step #1 – Pick Your Headline As I recommend on the ego bait list article, start with the headline, which sums up the idea of the article. You can use the following structure: Number + (industry) blogs/experts + promise/keyword Pick a list of influencers from your industry, and define the promise that your article will fulfil. You can pick as little or as many as you want, depending on how much in-depth you want to go with each influencer. For example you might want to ask what everyone’s favorite link building tools are. That makes it easy for the influencers to know exactly what they are expected to write about. The audience will also appreciate a specific piece of advice they can use on their own. Step #2 – Define the Question Even though you have already specified the main promise of the article, you want to define the question you will ask the influencers. Be specific and focus on one question only. Influencers are busy people, that’s why you want them to answer your question with the greatest level of detail possible. When defining the question, remember what people would want to read about. Pick a unique angle for the question. For example, if I were to do another SEO ego bait article like the one I showed you before, I’d focus on something like the best local SEO strategy or favourite 30 minutes SEO quick win. It still focuses on SEO but has a new angle that brings a good answer to people’s problems. Step #3 – The Experts Create a list of all the experts you want to contact. You can brainstorm the experts or search on Google for other expert roundups in your niche & with similar target markets- Make sure to define experts that have sites with high domain authority & page authority as well as social following. This will make the sharing as well as the linking more powerful. After you define the list of experts, find their contact information. Look in their personal websites, use LinkedIn, or simply ask them on Twitter. Step #4 – Outreach Finally, send the influencers an email with your question. If they don’t answer right away, wait a few days. Follow up two times more, and if they don’t answer, ask a different influencer. Don’t be a pushy link builder. You should get a response rate of around 10-25%, maybe more if you already have a relationship with some of the influencers or if you are one yourself. This Section In Short Creating egobait articles is simple. The key to success is to structure your article for success and be organized with the pitching. Start by defining your headline. It must convey the value right away so people want to click on it. You can use the structure I recommend which is: Number + (industry) blogs/experts + promise/keyword Then, define the question (or questions) you want to ask to the influencers. Make sure to make it super concise and actionable. Then, define the experts you want to contact. Finally, contact the experts with the question you previously defined. Once you publish your content, make sure you contact the experts so they help you promote it. Also, remember it’s all about the relationships; once an expert knows about your site, it will be easier for them to link to your site in the future (assuming they like your site). BONUS EGO BAIT STRATEGY: Take a look at this awesome link building tutorial that you can use to ego bait people in a different way. 16. Outsource Your Link Building I won’t lie to you… Even with the best link building strategies – link building is still hard work and takes time.

Our Favourite Link Building Service LinksThatRank is the best link building service we can recommend.

LinksThatRank also offers a quick and easy buying process that’s entirely hands-off. All you have to do is choose the links you need and tell them which keyword you are targeting – they take care of the rest. How Many Backlinks Do I Need? The truth is that there is no blanket answer to this question. Every single keyword, niche and search result is different. The good news is that it’s possible to calculate how many backlinks you need to rank for a target keyword. Just follow this simple 3-step process. Step #1 – Determine Which Pages You Need To Build Backlinks To Don’t build links to every page on your site. Why? Because not every page is worth it. Link building costs time and money. You should only build links to pages that include keywords that generate real leads and sales for your business. So, the first thing you need to do is work out which pages they are. Here’s how we do it: Look at pages where you currently rank in spots 2 to 30 for your target keyword Find the top pages that make you the most money (not traffic) Create a shortlist of those pages and take note of them You can do all of this for free using Google Search Console. Need some more help? Watch the video below for more information. Step #2 – Calculate The “Link Gap” Now that you have your shortlist of target keywords, you can calculate the “link gap”. The link gap is simply the minimum number of links you need to rank in the top 3 positions on Google for your target keyword. For this, you will need a premium tool like Ahrefs or Semrush. Here’s how the process works: Type your target keywords into your chosen tool (I prefer Ahrefs) Look at the links above DR20 pointing to the first three ranking URLs Write down the number of links for each ranking URL The video below outlines this entire process in more detail. Now you are ready for the last step… Step #3 – Build The Links You Need Link building is the trickiest part for many SEOs. Some people feel comfortable enough to do it themselves with any of the above link-building strategies. Others prefer to outsource it to a service link LinksThatRank. You decide which method is right for your business. Either way… You now know which pages to build links to and how many links you need to build. The last step is simply to build them. How To Get Your Links Indexed? Getting your newly built links indexed is essential. Why? They will only help your rankings if Google knows they exist.

Let’s face it, backlink building is work, but there are tricks I have learned that can be replicated to help achieve higher rankings without having to reach out to prospective website owners in hopes of gaining a backlink. Build Backlinks rel=nofollow The golden age of easy backlink juice seems to be coming to an end. Websites such as Forbes, Huffington Post, and others are implemented a strategy of applying nofollow tags to all links from contributor articles. So if I wanted to write an article for Forbes or Huffington Posts, the links aren’t going to pass any value because they are now coded as nofollow. Now, to be honest, nofollow backlinks still have a value from a CTR perspective, but it will not raise the page ranking since no link juice is pushed through. Building Backlinks Do Follow For the last part of 2017 into 2018 I set out to rank Hang Ten SEO for the keyword “Austin SEO Expert” and along the way, I found some really good ways to build backlinks that work and are do follow. Google Docs | Building 2019 Backlinks Did you know that Google Docs is a really easy way to gain backlinks? The key ingredient is making sure you set the document SHARE property to PUBLIC. Google gives priority or at least seems to give priority to it’s own products in searches, so by creating a Google Document with links to your articles and website pages will generate backlinks from a very high Domain Authority site, namely Google. It really doesn’t get any higher and since it’s a Google document, you can put as much or as little content as you feel necessary. In general you will want to have at least 300 words, but the more specific you can get pertaining to the keyword or keyword phrase you are trying to rank for the better. In the Google Docs, below I added 2 links, including a link to the Contact Us page and a link to an article on Austin SEO Expert. Once the document was created I submitted the document’s URL to Google and Bing. (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sTP5xL5moyhy-qCZL7jfzw_hOjqjtf6ere3cxnCldXQ) Are there any downsides to using Google Docs as a backlink method? The biggest downside will be the link juice coming from the Google Docs will not be worth much unless the document has it’s own backlinks. While the Domain Authority is really high, the Page Authority is basically 1, meaning it doesn’t have a lot of weight. The second downside is the URL structure isn’t optimal for SEO. When you create Google document, as far as I know you don’t have control over customizing the URL to make it more SEO compliant, so it ends up being a mixture of letters and numbers. You can use services like Bitly (https://bitly.com/) or Google Shortener (https://goo.gl/) to shorten the URL, but again the backlink URL structure still isn’t optimal. http://bit.ly/2ybxF29 https://goo.gl/ghyzej Lastly you don’t have SEO control over things such as titles, meta description and URL structure, all of which would help the document rank higher and gain more link juice. Google Docs Backlink Tips Set the document’s SHARE property to Public Add roughly 300 or more words Submit the URL to Google and Bing Google Sites | Building 2019 Backlinks Another Google Product that has a bit more punch than Google Documents is Google Sites. With Google Sites you have the ability to create a website under the Google brand name, like Google Docs. I wrote an article that goes into great detail about using Google Sites (Google Sites SEO Google Listing Trick) as a backlink strategy. Where Google Docs fall short with respect to naming the URL, Google Sites allows for customization. For example my Google Sites targeting the keyword phrase “Austin SEO Expert” is https://sites.google.com/view/austinseoexpert. I have found Google Sites tend to rank better than Google Docs and in markets that aren’t too competitive can rank in the top 20 without much effort. This potentially means you could have multiple listings in the top 20 based on a specific keyword or phrase. Obviously Ranking on page 2 really isn’t helpful for click thru rate (CTR), but it still can help boost your money site or the main site or article you are trying to rank for. The other advantage to Google Sites over Google Docs is a full blown website, rather than just a document. Are there any downsides to using Google Sites as a backlink method? The main downside to Google Sites is the fact that it is another website, which means it will take a bit of time to build. To take full advantage of it, you will want to start a backlink campaign to boost it’s website ranking, which in turn will boost it’s link juice capability to your money site. Google Sites Backlink Tips Focus on a single Keyword phrase Add roughly 300 or more words to each page Submit the URL to Google and Bing LinkedIn | Building 2019 Backlinks Right now there is a little known trick in LinkedIn (LinkedIn Google Listing Trick) that allows you to create a company name targeting your keyword phrase. When you signup for a LinkedIn account, you have the ability to create company pages. As far as I know this functionality is unlimited, meaning you can create as many LinkedIn company pages as you want. When designing the page the goal is to set it up in such a way that it targets your keyword or keyword phrase. I usually set the Company Website URL to the article I want the backlink for. When setting up the LinkedIn Company Page I will use the Targeted Keyword Phrase, so for example the Austin SEO Expert LinkedIn company page would be called Austin SEO Expert. Unfortunately someone took that, so I opted for Austin SEO Expert Hang Ten SEO (https://www.linkedin.com/company/austinseoexperthangtenseo). From my experience LinkedIn pages in general rank really well. When you perform a search on “Hang Ten SEO”, the LinkedIn pages are ranked 3 and 4. Once the LinkedIn company page is setup, LinkedIn allows you to post updates to the page creating backlinks to articles you post. These backlinks appear to be follow links, which can boost the backlinked article’s performance in rankings.

Many Backlink strategies don’t work like they used to and things that work now might not work in the future. One really good approach I use is to write product reviews and then get backlinks directly from the manufactures. Those links are usually high quality links.

Google Sites Backlink Tips Focus on a single Keyword phrase Add roughly 300 or more words to each page Submit the URL to Google and Bing LinkedIn | Building 2019 Backlinks Right now there is a little known trick in LinkedIn (LinkedIn Google Listing Trick) that allows you to create a company name targeting your keyword phrase. When you signup for a LinkedIn account, you have the ability to create company pages. As far as I know this functionality is unlimited, meaning you can create as many LinkedIn company pages as you want. When designing the page the goal is to set it up in such a way that it targets your keyword or keyword phrase. I usually set the Company Website URL to the article I want the backlink for. When setting up the LinkedIn Company Page I will use the Targeted Keyword Phrase, so for example the Austin SEO Expert LinkedIn company page would be called Austin SEO Expert. Unfortunately someone took that, so I opted for Austin SEO Expert Hang Ten SEO (https://www.linkedin.com/company/austinseoexperthangtenseo). From my experience LinkedIn pages in general rank really well. When you perform a search on “Hang Ten SEO”, the LinkedIn pages are ranked 3 and 4. Once the LinkedIn company page is setup, LinkedIn allows you to post updates to the page creating backlinks to articles you post. These backlinks appear to be follow links, which can boost the backlinked article’s performance in rankings.

Thanks so much Reply Tom Crandall on February 12, 2018 at 8:43 am Hi Denlyn, Yeah that Trello trick seems to have stuck. My main page seems to bounce around a lot, but it still stays says somewhere on page 1. Reply Akshat on February 15, 2018 at 11:29 pm Nice ideas to build some high quality backlinks to your new site. Thanks for discussing these ! Reply Tom Crandall on February 16, 2018 at 5:50 am Hi Akshat, Thanks. I am always on the hunt for ways to rank sites that work. Many Backlink strategies don’t work like they used to and things that work now might not work in the future. One really good approach I use is to write product reviews and then get backlinks directly from the manufactures. Those links are usually high quality links.

You got it? The world of backlinks is wild, my friend. Picture me sitting in a dimly lit diner, channeling all my energy into this rant. Buckle up because we’re hitting this topic from both ends.Listen, backlinks are like oxygen for your website. Without them, you’re gasping for air, stuck in the depths of page two (or worse) of search results. It’s not just about climbing that SEO ladder; it’s about building a reputation, establishing your presence, and doing it all ethically. We’re ripping past the fluff and getting into the raw shit about creating content that genuinely offers value—not just jargon-filled pages chasing the latest SEO trend.This isn’t a game of manipulation or shortcuts. Trust me, I've been there and done that, and it blew up in my face harder than my cousin Tony’s epic paint mishap! That dude thought he was some kind of Picasso and trashed his whole setup with paint everywhere when he tried to DIY. I’d swear, I didn’t think it was possible to mess up so badly. Paint on the ceiling? Yeah, that happened.But Tony’s moment of chaos taught me something vital. If you don’t take the time to lay down a solid foundation, the entire structure can come crashing down in a colorful frenzy of regret. Same goes for your website; if you’re not building those backlinks ethically, you’ll be cleaning up a mess you didn’t even see coming.Now, let’s strap in because it’s a rollercoaster—here’s the full damn ride…Why Quick Fixes Aren’t EnoughLet’s hit the ground running. Quick fixes are like a sugar rush; they feel great for a hot minute but leave you crashing hard. Picture my buddy Tony again, who started that eco-friendly paint company. Dude went viral",
