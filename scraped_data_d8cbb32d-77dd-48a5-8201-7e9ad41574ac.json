  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, so let’s talk about this Moody Tunes site. Just from the URL, it’s giving off some serious music vibes, right? I mean, “moody” kind of hints at something atmospheric, like they’re diving deep into the feels with tunes that really set a mood. Think of those late-night jams or soundtracks that just hit different based on your vibe at the moment. Now, “tunes” is a pretty classic term for music, so I’m guessing they’re not just throwing random playlists your way. They might have thoughtfully curated collections that cater to different states of mind—like chill beats for when you’re winding down after a long day, or maybe some more upbeat tracks for getting hyped up. Maybe they even have a section for those emo moments when you just want to dive into your feelings! Given the whole “io” at the end of the URL, there’s a good chance it’s techy or maybe even a bit trendy. A lot of modern music sites are all about that sleek, digital experience. So, I wouldn’t be surprised if they have some nifty features—like custom playlists or smart algorithms that know what you need to hear based on your listening history. You know, the kind of stuff that makes you wonder if they can read your mind! Also, let’s not forget about community vibes! I mean, if they’re really tapping into the emotional aspects of music, they might have forums or a space where listeners can share their thoughts on tracks. Imagine a place where you can find your tribe over a shared love for melancholic melodies or those sick beats that just make everything feel alright. And hey, maybe they even have a blog or articles that explore different genres or artists. Like, they could dig into why certain songs resonate with us on a spiritual level or even highlight new artists that might fly under the radar. You know, shining a light on those hidden gems that you’ll want to put on your playlists as soon as you hear them. In short, I’m picturing Moody Tunes as a cozy spot on the internet where music lovers can chill, discover new sounds, and connect over their shared love for tunes that evoke all kinds of emotions. It sounds like a place where you can find that perfect soundtrack for whatever moment you’re living in. So yeah, here’s to hoping they’re nailing that vibe! Cheers!",

Whether you’re feeling happy, sad, or just lazy on a Sunday morning, there’s always a perfect song waiting to be played. Spotify, with its endless library of songs, is like a treasure chest of music. But it’s not just about playing random tracks—it’s about creating playlists that match your vibe.(spotify playlist ideas) Think about it: wouldn’t a romantic playlist set the mood for a dinner date? Or an energetic playlist pump you up during workouts? That’s the magic of Spotify playlists—they turn ordinary moments into extraordinary experiences. And guess what? You can easily create playlists to fit every mood and occasion. So, let’s dive into some exciting Spotify playlist ideas that you can use (or create yourself). Trust us, these playlists will make your day a whole lot better! 1. Relaxing Spotify Playlist for Calm Vibes Ever had one of those days when you just need to sit back and chill? A relaxing playlist can work wonders. These playlists are filled with mellow tunes that calm your mind and make you feel at peace. Songs to Include: “Rivers and Roads” by The Head and the Heart “Sweater Weather” by The Neighbourhood “Let Her Go” by Passenger When to Use: After a long day at work During a rainy afternoon with a cup of tea While reading your favorite book Pro Tip: Add some instrumental or lo-fi tracks for an extra soothing effect. Lo-fi beats are amazing when you just want to zone out. 2. High-Energy Workout Playlist Let’s be honest, workouts can sometimes feel like a chore. But when you’ve got the right beats in your ears, it’s like you’re unstoppable! A good workout playlist is packed with songs that make you want to move, jump, and keep going. Songs to Include: “Eye of the Tiger” by Survivor (a classic!) “Don’t Stop the Music” by Rihanna “Believer” by Imagine Dragons When to Use: Running on the treadmill Doing yoga or pilates Sweating it out in a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session Pro Tip: Throw in some upbeat remixes or EDM tracks—they can supercharge your motivation! 3. Road Trip Playlist What’s a road trip without the perfect playlist? It’s like a movie without a soundtrack. A road trip playlist should include a mix of sing-along hits, happy tunes, and even a little nostalgia. Songs to Include: “Sweet Caroline” by Neil Diamond “Take Me Home, Country Roads” by John Denver “Shut Up and Dance” by Walk the Moon When to Use: Long drives with friends or family Exploring scenic routes Watching the sunrise while cruising Pro Tip: Add some local songs or regional hits if you’re traveling through specific areas. It’s a fun way to connect with the place you’re visiting. 4. Party Playlist for Dance Lovers Hosting a party? Your playlist needs to get everyone on the dance floor. A party playlist is all about fun, energetic tracks that make people want to let loose. Songs to Include: “Levitating” by Dua Lipa “Uptown Funk” by Bruno Mars “Cheap Thrills” by Sia When to Use: House parties Birthdays and celebrations Friday nights with your besties Pro Tip: Mix old-school hits with the latest chartbusters to keep everyone entertained. 5.

Songs to Include: “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen “Wannabe” by Spice Girls “Smells Like Teen Spirit” by Nirvana When to Use: While catching up with old friends During a themed party When reminiscing about the good old days Pro Tip: Create separate playlists for each decade—’80s, ’90s, and 2000s—for ultimate nostalgia. 6. Study or Focus Playlist Need to concentrate on work or studies? A focus playlist can help you block out distractions and stay productive. These playlists are typically soft, instrumental, and easy on the ears. Songs to Include: “Weightless” by Marconi Union (scientifically proven to reduce stress!) “Clair de Lune” by Debussy “Lofi Hip Hop Radio” on YouTube When to Use: While studying for exams Working on creative projects Meditating or journaling Pro Tip: Keep the volume low so the music doesn’t overpower your thoughts. 7. Seasonal Playlists Music can also reflect the time of year. Imagine warm, sunny tunes for summer or cozy tracks for winter. Seasonal playlists are a great way to enjoy every moment of the year. For Summer: “Surfin’ USA” by The Beach Boys “Walking on Sunshine” by Katrina and the Waves For Winter: “Winter Wonderland” by Bing Crosby “Cold December Night” by Michael Bublé Pro Tip: Update your playlist every year to include fresh tracks! 8.

And Any Other Writing Project Under The Sun) - Abbie Emmons ­ Cookie Policy This website uses cookies to help me do what I do better, but you can disable them if you don't like it. Learn more Refuse CookiesAllow Home About Books Videos Home About Books Videos Writing Tips 17 PLAYLISTS For Every WRITING MOOD (To Help You Survive NaNoWriMo… And Any Other Writing Project Under The Sun) Apart from writing, music is my life. When I’m not creating music, I’m listening to music; and when I’m not listening to music, I’m thinking about music. And when I’m writing a book, I NEED MUSIC TO INSPIRE ME – whether I’m writing a long conversation to a mellow soundtrack or plotting in the car to epic trailer music. I NEED MUSIC. And maybe you do, too. To celebrate our perilous journey through NaNoWriMo, I made a bunch of playlists, filled with the very best writing music, just for you!! SO THAT’S WHAT’S HAPPENING TODAY. I have a playlist for every writing mood* according to genre, scenes, emotions happening in the scenes, etc. I PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO THIS, OKAY? (Also I’m a bit obsessive when it comes to making playlists shhhh don’t tell.) But when I was making these playlists I wasn’t sure what to use: only instrumentals or songs with lyrics, too? So I did a Twitter poll to figure it out and IT ENDED UP BEING ROUGHLY 50/50. My solution: make a set of playlists each! One collection without words, one collection with words. THAT’S HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU GUYS. There are 17 playlists in total – all of them are over 1 hour long, and they cover a wide range of moods, from Epic Fantasy Battles to Kickbutt Spy Missions to Teenage Rom-Coms to EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. Music inspires my writing more than I can even describe. Sometimes I can listen to music while I write, and other times I need silence – EVERY WRITER IS DIFFERENT and sometimes it just depends on your current mood. That’s why I’ve created all these playlists. THERE’S SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE, so I’m pretty sure I’ve got you covered. Let’s talk music, shall we? *Hopefully. Maybe not?? MAYBE THERE ARE OTHER MOODS I DON’T KNOW ABOUT. But these are all the ones I could think of. THE PLAYLISTS: WITHOUT WORDS EPIC FANTASY BATTLE ORCHESTRAL, INTENSE, CLASSIC. Mood: Armies in armor with swords and horses (or dragons.) A battle-cry. Arrows and cannons and the smell of victory. Also, blood. What would an epic fantasy battle be without blood? I LOVE YOU ROMANTIC, SWEEPING, BEAUTIFUL. Mood: A heart pounding with unspoken words. Running through a rainstorm to get to someone to tell them that you love them. Or any other stereotyped love profession scene, really. MAGICAL NEW WORLD EPIC, FANTASTICAL, DISCOVERY. Mood: Stumbling though a portal into a whole new world. Sunlight filtering through trees and young, fascinated eyes beholding things they never dreamed of. Chills, magic, and new possibilities. KICKBUTT SPY MISSION MYSTERY, THRILLER, SUSPENSE. Mood: Top-secret missions. Kids wearing leather jackets and sunglasses. Car chases and guns firing. Jumping over fences and cracking secret codes and running for your life and fighting for justice. LOSING HOPE SAD, LONELY, DEPRESSED. Mood: The feeling you have when you have no idea what you feel. All hope is lost. The best character probably just died and now the other characters don’t know what to do with themselves except cry. BACKGROUND MUSIC CHILL, QUIET, CONVERSATIONAL. Mood: Not a lot going on. Something for the author to listen to (instead of the wall clock ticking) while writing a mellow scene. This one also doubles as a good studying playlist, so… bonus! SOMETHING IS UP CURIOUS, SLEUTHY, DETECTIVE. Mood: Not everything is as it seems. Investigating mysterious things. Figuring out the puzzles. Cutting up newspaper articles and pinning them to a giant corkboard on your wall – red string and all. SCARY HAUNTED HOUSE CREEPY, DARK, JUMP SCENE. Mood: The feeling of being watched by someone – or something. Shadows that move. Whispers in the dark. Flickering lights. Abandoned places. That general feeling of unease right before a ghost jumps out of the wall, or something. SENTIMENTAL CRYBABY REMINISCENT, MELLOW, WEEPY. Mood: Looking through old Polaroids, remembering all the good things you miss. Stargazing with someone you love. Reminiscing childhood summers and golden hour and a first kiss. Smiling because good things have happened to you. THE PLAYLISTS: WITH WORDS EPIC TRAILER MUSIC DYSTOPIAN, WAR, DARK FANTASY. Mood: ASDFGHJKL. Epic trailer music turns me on. I don’t know how else to describe it!!!! This is my collection of favorites. HAPPY ADVENTURE CAREFREE, FOLKSY, ROADTRIP. Mood: Jumping into a car with your best friends and driving across the country. Living free and enjoying every second of your delicious life on planet earth. Open windows and new places and beautiful, smiling faces. GHOST STORY HAUNTING, DARK, ETHEREAL. Mood: Songs that remind me of abandoned houses after dark and whispering in the shadows. Haunting vocals, with some southern gothic flair. (And Ruelle. Lots of Ruelle.) TEENAGE ROM-COM CONTEMPORARY, FUN, PUNK ROCK. Mood: Bad puns and bubblegum. First kisses and high school drama and avoiding eye contact. Passing notes in class. Falling in love for the first time. Making a fool of yourself, because that’s what teenagers do. WILD CHILD PARTY GRITTY, REBELLIOUS, CAR RACE. Mood: Songs for the characters who run away from home. Racing cars through the desert and getting in trouble for stupid things. Rebel kids with wide eyes and loud music and ridiculous motives. BRB CRYING SAD, LONELY, HEARTBREAK. Mood: All my favorite sad songs that make you (or your characters) want to just cry their eyes out. Heartbreak, tragedy, disappointment. Whatever you like to use to break your characters into tiny little pieces. HARDCORE SPIES GRITTY, COOL, ESPIONAGE. Mood: Superheroes! Or just normal kids who think they’re superheroes. Top-secret missions, running from the bad guys, just being awesome spies in general. SPY MUSIC, OKAY? SPIESSS. I LOVE YOU ROMANTIC, SWEEPING, BEAUTIFUL. Mood: The most beautiful love songs I know and use to aggressively ship my OTP until I want to scream happily into a pillow. TALK, BRO Do you listen to music while you write? What kind? What are some of your TOP FAVORITE songs that you plot your book to/ship your characters to/imagine your book-turned-movie to??? I know that made zero grammatical sense I’m 100% done with grammar at this point.

For A Relaxing Summer Above Photo: Pexels Photo: Pexels 1 / 1 Prepare an ice-cold drink, grab a book, and sit under the shade or under the sun. This season's the perfect time to bask in the sunshine while listening to piano music.

For Your Daily Meditation Above Photo: Pexels Photo: Pexels 1 / 1 You may try a sound bath, where you lie down in a bath to release your mind and body from all sorts of stress through music. Although a sound bath is normally used as a treatment, it won't hurt to try listening to this playlist for meditation or sleep purposes. The music usually plays soft and calming instruments such as crystal bowls, Tibetan bells, and gongs. Listen to the Spotify playlist here. 3. For Your Romantic Dinner Dates Above Photo: Pexels Photo: Pexels 1 / 1 Keep your dinner date fun and light with a good jazz playlist by Tatler.

For When You're Driving At Night Above Photo: Pexels Photo: Pexels 1 / 1 Driving around the city at night should become a ritual for those who desire a peaceful and relaxing time away from home amidst a pandemic.

For Your Morning Strolls Above Photo: Pexels Photo: Pexels 1 / 1 It's still and quiet in the morning, and a long stroll to start the day would be nice. Ditch your home treadmill for the day and walk around the neighbourhood. It's a great way to explore the outdoors in peace, with light music in the background to help you get enough cardio.

From the smaller things to the bigger ones, it’s pretty reasonable to say that I can be a mess! Almost always, I won’t split the Uber fare with you; I won’t answer texts until three days later; and I will never ever be able to keep track of where I left the key to my room. In high school, I was the queen of not having it together. Ask anyone! To know Gabbi Meltzer meant not getting a text back when I’ve most likely been 20 minutes late to our dinner plans. While having this identity is not necessarily one that I should have prided myself in, I played into it for a really long time. I felt as if not having my life together was something that made me approachable and completed my bubbly and easygoing personality. I found my place as being the funny, hot mess of a friend and figured that if I wanted to fill these shoes, I should let loose. If I am supposed to not have a grip on things, so be it. As it turns out, being a mess all the time is DRAINING. By the end of my senior year, I was sick of acting disheveled and stressed when I knew that I had the potential to be poised and confident. I was uncomfortable with my established reputation. It was time to abandon my innocent, yet reckless tendencies. It was time to grow up. Similar to most incoming college freshmen who seem to know everything there is to know about life at the age of 18, I figured my transformation would automatically switch once I arrived at Tulane. Whenever I envisioned any future scenarios or endeavors, I always imagined everything to be perfect. Somehow one day, I would wake up and my relationship with myself and with those around me would be amazing. No effort or failure required. This mantra failed me again and again. As I went off to college, I was unwilling to let it go. I truly believed that once I was on my own, I would be a newly improved version of myself. No effort or failure required. Did this happen? Absolutely not. For most of my life unfortunately, I have lived according to what is supposed to be the college life. We are supposed to sleep through classes and party too hard. We are supposed to gain the freshman 15 and we are supposed to keep our rooms messy. We are supposed to make tons of best friends within weeks and we are expected to be totally happy. I remember so vividly looking at pictures of my older friends during their freshman years and noticing how happy they all looked; the craziness of partying was enticing and the freedom seemed liberating. I went into my freshman year holding all of these expectations. I knowingly made bad choices and ended up fostering an incredibly unhealthy relationship with myself. Even as I began to notice that countless frat parties and eating way too many late-night City Diner meals weren’t making me happy, I kept going. I kept going, because I was supposed to be living like this. Right? Without getting too much into detail, I fell flat on my face. I kept falling flat on my face, knowing exactly why, again and again. Sticking to the “supposed” status quo of how college should be was ruining me. I lost touch with myself and with what made me happy. The future was finally here and not only was it nothing I had imagined, but I was more of a mess than ever before. When I think about why these expectations are set in place, I can’t help but to blame social media and the fact that failure is seldom embraced. In an age where we have so many resources and tools for self-improvement, it is odd that the opposite so commonly occurs. Failure to make it seem as if we are having the time of our lives 24/7 makes us weak, and admitting that we are lonely or that we are struggling makes us even weaker. With all of this, I have come to realize that there is no blueprint for how we are supposed to live. We live the life that we choose and it’s up to us to make it a great one. Why dedicate our days to trying to impress others? When we are alone and crying at 3 o’clock in the morning, who is going to be there for us other than ourselves? It is time to stop saying yes to things that don’t add to our well-being and to tune out what everyone else is doing. This is how you’re supposed to live. Now, as I think about the future, I see things through a different lens. For the first time, not only am I anticipating failure, but I am truly excited by the good that will come out of my mistakes one day. I am done trying to live the picture-perfect life that I thought college would be. I am ready to do what makes me happy. This is me getting my life together.
