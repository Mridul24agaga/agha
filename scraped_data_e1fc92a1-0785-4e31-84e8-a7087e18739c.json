These backlinks act as virtual endorsements, a “thumbs up” that your website is indeed a source of great content and reputable information. Can’t get more relevant than this! But why is it so important to hire a reputable link building service agency? These professionals have forged their skills in the neverending turmoil of algorithm changes, by identifying valuable linking opportunities, conducting outreach campaigns, and crafting persuasive content that encourages other websites to link back to their clients’ content. By leveraging their expertise, you can save precious time and effort while reaping the benefits of increased organic traffic and improved search engine rankings. A skilled link building service provider will assess your website’s current standing, identify areas for improvement, conduct competitor analysis, and develop a custom strategy tailored to your specific goals. So whether you’re running a small business, a top SaaS brand, or managing a large-scale e-commerce site, a reputable link-building expert can provide immense value by amplifying your online presence and driving traffic to your website.

Link building: All the horrors that are lurking in the background Link building is like that famous trope from the movies. You enter an antique shop full of magical items that give you special powers—but each item is cursed and comes with a hidden price. The same goes with link juice (link juice is the value of one website transferred to another via backlinks). With links, you get what you pay for. Although they might seem intangible, links do have value—just like any other product. An untrained eye might miss subtle details and serious red flags. For instance, there are many penalized websites lurking around disguised as “premium link building services.” We know many examples of “experts” taking the short route and offering personalized blogger outreach services, while in reality they’re working on the dark side and using private blog networks (PBNs). So, you need to know exactly what you’re paying for. In the best case scenario, you get what you pay for. In the worst case… you also get what you pay for. We know it’s complicated, so here are some useful tips when hiring link building services. Breaking down link value Getting a genuine link placement that appears organic takes time and resources. Genuine link building service providers will make sure your links fit like a glove, whether through guest posting or link insertion. Link-building costs often look like this: When you do the math, you’ll soon realize that a high-quality link that brings tangible value to your website will cost between $400 and $750 per placement. Maybe this seems costly and ten $200 links sound like a better deal, but remember that the quality of links always beats quantity. Please don’t “write for us” The SEO world is a confusing place, because if you want to contribute to other people’s websites, the most logical thing is to search for the term “write for us.” Right? Well, no. That was a thing when SEO was much younger and more naive. These days, websites with “write for us,” “contribute,” or “submit article” are considered spammy. The road to hell starts with good intentions; all these websites originally wanted to help people get the exposure they desperately needed. But in only a few years, these sites became notorious in link building circles because people used them in ways we never thought possible. Here’s why you should avoid these sites at all costs: So if your link building service provider shows you links with “write for us,” you should probably skip “work with us.” These guest posting people are “really eager to share these website lists with you” One of the most important things to remember about link building services: if they’re from Fiverr, they’ll give your website a fever. Digital dengue fever, probably. Website owners are often overwhelmed by the number of link building offers they receive daily, and some will be naive enough to hit the reply button. We all suffer from a chronically full inbox, and I bet 90% are guest posting requests. Or random outreachers who send you long spreadsheets without consent, giving you so many options to choose from… isn’t that great? No. These links are a shortcut to the Penalization Hall of Fame. Let’s see a spammy inbox example first-hand. This inbox is like an online Met Gala that’s merged with the world of Ice and Fire. Is guest posting now some kind of Hollywood MLM scheme? As you can see, all subject lines are straightforward about their guest post intentions. And they’re not even creative with their fake names anymore: This one takes the cake… Can I call you “Randy?” When I said “get familiar with the website owner” this is not something I had in mind: Reverse uno card? Now you’re asking me to send you fresh guest post platforms? Highly authoritative websites that are household names in their niche will offer pricey options, often with promotion on social media included. But this gets tricky — spammy websites are sometimes disguised as decent websites and ask for a similar amount of money. An untrained eye may easily miss some red flags. Their traffic is booming? Yes, but from where? What are their top pages? Are there any suspicious keywords or anchors lurking in the background? Is there a shiny “write for us” button, or have you noticed that the website has a few clones with generic content? If so, they’re definitely not worth your attention. Rather, you need someone who recognizes the true value of your prospects. Of course, sometimes you can’t avoid getting a price list in your replies, but try to be diplomatic and offer a different kind of value than monetary. You’re crafting a business relationship, not just a business transaction. Zero traffic, zero value Imagine this scenario: you just found a website that looks really good. The design is fantastic, you can see that topics are in line with your content for link building, and you reach out to them to arrange a link. But nothing happens. Why is that the case? Zero traffic is the problem. Maybe the website is still brand new in the market, or and they want to be part of an exclusive “cool kids club” with their link building partnerships. Maybe resellers decided to build a few websites from scratch and sell them for a lower price. Motivations vary, but the conclusion is the same: to transfer value, the website first has to have some value in Google’s eyes. Always double-check the traffic metrics in Ahrefs or Semrush, looking for a minimum of 500+ visits per month. Metrics for success and quality control DA, DR, PBN… so many new terms, but which ones actually matter for a link building campaign? Check out this cheat sheet. Two metrics you’ll often see mentioned in SEO circles are domain rating (DR) and domain authority (DA). Domain authority, developed by Moz, is a score ranging from 1 to 100 that predicts how well a website is likely to rank on search engine result pages. Domain rating, on the other hand, is a metric by Ahrefs that evaluates the strength of a website’s backlink profile. It is also measured on a scale from 0 to 100 and considers the quantity and quality of backlinks to determine the authority of a domain. Unpopular opinion: These are relevant, but they’re also vanity metrics. Someone had to say it. These are easy to manipulate, so spammy websites can, undeservedly, rank higher on Google. But Google will work their mysterious (ranking) ways and take care of this. Instead of just looking at numbers on Ahrefs, websites should be valued a bit differently. Here’s where you should look: If a high-authority website simply isn’t a good fit when it comes to our client’s goals, we have no problem taking them off the outreach list. It’s all a part of the customizable outreach service we provide. Link building service providers worth your time and money We’ve shown you what you don’t need in your link building strategy.

LinksThatRank Once a PBN ends up blacklisted by link building agency LinksThatRank, it might as well have the same sign as the entrance to hell in Dante’s Divine Comedy — “Abandon all hope, ye who enter.” There is no redemption or mercy for PBN and spammy websites, as you can always review their block list in detail. You would be amazed at how many of the links you consider “good” actually end up there. LinksThatRank are very transparent about their services. Besides a strict blacklist policy they also: Be good and behave yourself online, or you will end up on their blacklist! Quality link building services you can trust Our team builds links at scale for B2B SaaS brands, driving profitable results FAQ How much should I pay for link building? Here’s the most SEO answer ever — it depends. Determining how much you should pay for link building requires careful consideration of your budget, goals, and desired outcomes. Of course, it’s important to be realistic about your niche as well. If you are running an e-commerce business that sells cat products or you are an owner of crypto wallet software, your needs (and pricing) will vary. It’s always a good idea to do thorough research, learn the basics of link building, and consult with professionals who can provide tailored guidance based on your specific needs. Is link building still effective? Link building is still an integral part of any comprehensive SEO strategy. SEO is not dead and you still need links to rank. It may require more effort and time compared to a few years ago, but investing in high-quality links will pay off by boosting your website’s authority and driving organic traffic. What does a link builder do? Link builders are like a Jack of all trades. They do research and craft new strategies and approaches to ensure that your links are (a)live and well. In addition to securing new backlinks, a link builder regularly monitors your existing ones. They analyze metrics such as domain authority and anchor text distribution to assess the overall health of the link profile. Link building is not for the fainthearted, as it requires creativity, strategic thinking, strong communication skills, and deep knowledge of SEO best practices. Their efforts improve organic visibility and drive targeted traffic to websites. The best link builders see a window of opportunity where others see only obstacles. How much do backlinks cost? When it comes to backlinks, the cost can vary greatly depending on several factors. We broke down all link costs and arrived at a price between $400 and $750 per placement, including writing and negotiation costs. It’s important to remember that while purchasing backlinks may seem like an easy way to boost your website’s rankings, it is not without risks. Google and other search engines have strict guidelines against buying or selling links, to avoid clear manipulation of Google’s algorithm. Focus on building natural and organic backlinks by creating valuable content that others will want to share and link to. Create content that acts as a link magnet — and that webmasters will accept to have on their website. The true value of a backlink lies not just in its cost, but also in its relevance and authority within your niche. So rather than focusing solely on how much they cost, prioritize high-quality links that will benefit your website’s SEO efforts in the long run. Do backlinks improve SEO? Many articles will try their best to convince you otherwise, but the truth is that backlinks will be relevant and integral to Google’s algorithm for a long long time. They are the best signals for ranking and are synonymous with a website’s authority. As long as you are on the right track and build them while respecting ethical practices, you’ll see tangible results. Where can I buy backlinks? While buying backlinks may seem like a quick-fix solution, it’s far better—both ethically and practically—to invest time and effort into white hat SEO techniques that emphasize creating quality content and engaging genuinely with the online community.

Can I Automate Outreach With Blogger Outreach Tools? Is Blogger Outreach Spam? What Are the Best Practices for Blogger Outreach? Over 70 million new blog posts are published each month — and that’s just WordPress alone. With so much content getting produced, it’s easier than ever to find relevant blogs and bloggers open to sharing your content. However, in the ten years I’ve been doing blogger outreach in various industries, I’ve found one common theme: blog outreach can be time-consuming for the underprepared. That’s why building a tool kit is essential. Without the right tools, you’ll waste time on menial tasks and diving down research rabbit holes. I tested almost every AI PR, SEO extension, digital PR, link building, and content marketing tool available. Here are my go-to blogger outreach tools and some tips on how to use them effectively. Best All-in-One Blogger Outreach Tool I’ve worked at agencies, worked with agencies, worked in-house, and hired freelancers for blog outreach help.

Sending Emails – with a Chrome Extension Once you have your list of prospects and contact information, you can set up email sequences with follow-ups based on fully customizable email outreach templates. You can email prospects from the Dashboard, but I like using the Chrome extension Buzzmarker. Using the Buzzmarker allows you to craft emails without leaving the blog page, so you can easily reference any information from the target blog post within your email. Tracking Relationships and Results – within the app Remember, real people are receiving these emails on the other end. BuzzStream gives you complete visibility into the emails sent to websites so that you can maintain relationships and, more importantly, avoid spamming the same bloggers with multiple campaigns at one time (this is especially helpful at larger agencies or large teams). The app will also tell you when you’ve received coverage by looking for backlinks to your target posts. Pricing: Free trial. $29/mo for the Starter plan. Prospecting and Blog Discovery Tools The first step to blogger outreach is finding blogs to pitch. There are a variety of tools available. 2. Ahrefs’ Content Explorer – Finding Top Linked Blog Content Ahrefs’ Content Explorer feature is a must-have tool for content marketing and blog discovery. Enter a keyword, and Content Explorer displays top posts along with information like Domain Rating (DR), number of backlinks, organic traffic, traffic value, and other helpful metrics for determining if the site is valuable as a link building target. Then, there are a handful of helpful filters to hone in on the content types that best fit your content strategy. For instance, you can filter by Publication Date to find the most recent content and active blogs for outreach. Or, you can filter by author if you want to identify specific content by an author to reference in your pitch. Pricing: $99/mo for Lite Version 3. BuzzSumo’s Content Analyzer – Identifying Top Shared Content BuzzSumo can find top-linked content, but its natural strengths are its social metrics. Like Ahrefs, BuzzSumo’s Content Analyzer allows you to search based on a keyword to identify top-linked content across the web. But BuzzSumo also displays social sharing data from X, Facebook, Pinterest, and Reddit. You can then drill down into each shared post to identify users who have shared content. With this list, cross-check to find bloggers that have shared on social media but have yet to link to it from their blog. Pricing: $199/mo 4. SparkToro – Identifying Influencers SparkToro was co-created by former Moz Co-Founder Rand Fiskin and can be used in your blogger outreach campaigns to identify influencers. Rand and the team learned from their experience with Moz that to truly expand your reach, you should look at what your users are talking about, not what they search for on Google. So Sparktoro uses data from social networks like X, LinkedIn, or Facebook to help you identify what topics your audience follows and interacts with on social. Taking this unique perspective, you can pinpoint key influencers to collaborate with for blogger outreach, content promotion, guest blogging, or other partnership opportunities in a way that other tools can’t. Pricing: Free, $38/mo Personal plan 5. Google w/ advanced search operators – Uncovering Guest Post Opportunities By using specific search queries, such as “topic + write for us” or “topic + guest post,” you can discover sites actively seeking guest contributors. But you can further level your game with Google search operators like inurl: and intitle: operators. The Inurl: search operator finds you URLs with your search operator, and intitle: operator finds pages whose title includes your search operator. In each case, you can more definitively uncover blog posts related to the topic of your choice. Tip: Use Google search operators when building your Research lists in BuzzStream. Our tool de-duplicates all pages, collects contact info, and provides metrics. Pricing: Free Blog Validation Tools As you build your outreach list, shaving down your target list is critical to generating responses from bloggers. These are some tools that make the validation process quicker and more efficient. 6. Moz – Measuring Site Authority Moz’s Domain Authority (DA) is a widely used industry metric built to help SEOs understand a site’s ability to rank. It isn’t the same as how Google ranks pages, but it has shown to be very directionally accurate. DA is one way to assess a website’s perceived strength and credibility for a blogger outreach campaign. Simply enter the target site into the Link Explorer or Domain Analysis tools. Moz’s Link Explorer tool can also help assess the quality and relevance of a blog’s backlink profile. If you see a high Spam Score, consider not trying to build a link from the site. Tip: BuzzStream integrates Moz metrics directly into the platform. You can see Domain Authority, the number of inbound links, and the number of links passing value for every prospect you add to a project. Pricing: Moz Pro has a 30-Day Free Trial, then $99/mo Standard tier 7. Semrush – Measuring a Site’s Traffic Semrush, another powerful SEO tool with a similar feature set to Ahrefs, can help estimate the traffic to a particular page or site. Semrush’s Traffic Analytics compiles metrics like Visits, Pages/Visit, Avg using clickstream data. Visit Duration, all of which can help determine whether or not a site is worth investing your time in pitching. Or, enter the target blog into their Domain Overview tool to see information like Organic Search Traffic and number of backlinks. Pricing: $129/mo for Pro tier 8. Siege Media Chrome Extension – Validating a Target Site Siege Media’s Chrome Extension provides a quick and efficient way to evaluate potential outreach targets using on-page signals. Content marketing agency Siege Media built the tool based on the insights of years of blogger outreach from the agency, and it is indeed extremely accurate. The scorecard assesses the quality of a website or blog directly from the browser, considering factors such as words with intent to collaborate, number of nofollow links, etc. It still takes a keen eye to manually quality and validates a site for outreach, but this tool gives an excellent head start. Pricing: Free Content Ideation Even if you have the right person to email, you still need a solid, shareable idea to get a response. Here are two tools to help you brainstorm content ideas with backlink potential. 9. Ahrefs’ Content Explorer – Identifying Linkable Content Ideas In addition to the prospecting capabilities, Ahrefs’ Content Explorer can help you identify content ideas that will likely get links. Enter a topic or competitor site to see top-linked content over time. You can easily click on the backlink profile to determine whether the content drives valuable links. Analyzing these successful pieces gives insights into content that resonates with audiences and will likely earn links. Then, you can replicate and expand on the content to pitch to target bloggers. Pricing: $99/mo for Lite Version 10. Exploding Topics – Finding Trending Topics Exploding Topics, co-founded by Brian Dean from Backlinko, helps with the blog ideation process by identifying emerging trends and topics that might not yet be mainstream. This tool analyzes data across various platforms to spot these growing trends and allows you to ideate content around these trending topics. You can search trends by topic or, with a paid plan, search for your keywords and topics. Pricing: Free with limited features, $39/mo for Pro tier Blog Content Creation Tools Creating compelling blog content for outreach is as crucial as the outreach itself. Below are some of the best tools to ensure high-quality, engaging content supports your outreach efforts. 11. ChatGPT – Guest Post Outlining For the most part, OpenAI’s ChatGPT powers most AI-driven copywriting tools, so it’s best to learn how to use it. ChatGPT shouldn’t be used to replace writing altogether, but it can be a valuable tool for guest posting by assisting in writing initial drafts or outlines for guest posts. You can prompt ChatGPT with existing content to help build a brand voice for your guest blogs, ensuring they align with the target blog’s style. Or ask it to rewrite your content based on the new voice. Furthermore, ChatGPT can assist in researching topics and generating ideas for blog posts. However, remember it doesn’t use keyword or backlink data to drive its ideas. Pricing: Free version, ChatGPT Plus is $20/mo 12. Canva – Image Creation Visual content is more shareable. And, if you are concerned about Google’s Generative Search taking over your content, create something that Generative Search cannot replicate: visual content. Canva is a super simple yet powerful tool that helps create visually appealing content like infographics, diagrams, and other post images to take your content to the next level. These visuals can enhance your blog posts, making them more engaging and shareable when pitched. Pricing: Free version, $19.99/mo for Canva Pro 13. Pixlr – Photo Editing Only some types of bloggers prefer images. Some bloggers and industries (like travel or beauty) prefer photography as their visual medium. That’s where Pixlr comes in. Pixlr is an online photo editing platform that functions like a more accessible, free Photoshop. It operates directly in your web browser, so you don’t need to download any software. Pixlr provides various editing tools, including filters, overlays, and text options, that you’d find in Photoshop but has a user-friendly interface, making it more accessible for amateur graphic designers out there. Pricing: Free, with Premium upgrades Email Discovery and Validation Tools Once you have a list of prospects, finding accurate email addresses ensures the highest deliverability rates for your outreach campaigns. 14. Hunter – Finding Email Addresses Hunter.io is a tool designed to help discover and verify contact information. If you are having trouble finding your blogger’s email address, it will search for emails associated with the domain and verify the validity of the contact info. The piece I like the best is that it also presents you with the format of the email addresses on the site, so if Hunter cannot find the specific email, you can at least give an educated guess. Tip: Hunter.io’s integration with BuzzStream further streamlines this workflow. By syncing your Hunter account with BuzzStream, you can use your credits towards revealing contacts within BuzzStream outreach campaigns. Pricing: Free for 25 monthly searches, $34/mo starter tier 15. NeverBounce – Validating Email Addresses An accurate, clean email list is the most effective way to ensure your blogger outreach gets seen. NeverBounce is an email validation software that cleans and verifies your email list, significantly reducing the chances of email bounces. This focus on better emails protects your email sender’s reputation and prevents your emails from going right to spam. Pricing: Varies based on number of emails. See pricing page for details What Features Should I Look For in a Blogger Outreach Tool? Blogger outreach tools should help with some or all of the following tasks: blogger discovery tools (based on keywords, niche, and metrics), email campaign management, template personalization, reporting and link tracking, and CRM functionalities. Buzzstream does all of the above. In this post, we’ve also added content creation and ideation, as both are integral to the blogger outreach process, but you can use separate tools for those. Can I Automate Outreach With Blogger Outreach Tools? Using email scheduling, bulk sending, and follow-up sequences, you can automate outreach with blogger outreach tools like Buzzstream. But, personalized emails are still the best approach to successful blogger outreach. Is Blogger Outreach Spam? Blogger outreach itself is not spam when done correctly (and ethically). The correct way to reach out to bloggers is through personalized, relevant information that offers value to the recipient. What Are the Best Practices for Blogger Outreach? The best practices for blogger outreach are similar to those you would follow when receiving an email yourself. Here are the top three tips that we recommend for all outreach campaigns. Personalize: Don’t waste time on generic pitches. Find out what bloggers write about and ensure your pitch is related to their industry. Be specific. Offer Something of Value: Don’t just ask for something with nothing in return. Offer content, insights, or collaboration opportunities to benefit the blogger. Keep it Short and Sweet: Don’t over-complicate your outreach email. Simply tell the prospect why you are reaching out and what you want.

Can I Automate Outreach With Blogger Outreach Tools? Is Blogger Outreach Spam? What Are the Best Practices for Blogger Outreach? Over 70 million new blog posts are published each month — and that’s just WordPress alone. With so much content getting produced, it’s easier than ever to find relevant blogs and bloggers open to sharing your content. However, in the ten years I’ve been doing blogger outreach in various industries, I’ve found one common theme: blog outreach can be time-consuming for the underprepared. That’s why building a tool kit is essential. Without the right tools, you’ll waste time on menial tasks and diving down research rabbit holes. I tested almost every AI PR, SEO extension, digital PR, link building, and content marketing tool available. Here are my go-to blogger outreach tools and some tips on how to use them effectively. Best All-in-One Blogger Outreach Tool I’ve worked at agencies, worked with agencies, worked in-house, and hired freelancers for blog outreach help. I eventually took a job with BuzzStream because BuzzStream has been my go-to blogger outreach and link building tool. Built for 1. BuzzStream – Prospecting, Emailing, Relationship Building, and Reporting BuzzStream is the best all-in-one blogger outreach tool for agencies, in-house teams, and freelancers. The tool has features that help with every step of the email outreach process, from prospecting to emailing to reporting. Here is what stands out to me as the features that help blogger outreach teams the most: Prospecting and Blog Discovery – integrates with Moz, Ahrefs With Buzzstream, you can upload your prospects or use their helpful research tool to discover blogs and blog posts that fit your target audience. You can vet the sites using integration with Moz and Ahrefs for information like Domain Authority, number of external links, or blog publish frequency. Contact Information Discovery – integrates with Hunter Once you have your blog list, Buzzstream can find email addresses and social accounts based on what is available on the site. You can even sync up your Hunter.io account to help find even more contact info.

Why is Link Building Important for SEO? How to Build Links? How to Analyze a Site? Link Building Strategies That Work Tools that Help in Link Building Link Building: A Case Study From Stan Ventures Link Building Tactics You Should Avoid Backlinks are a must-have to improve your online visibility, drive more web traffic and position your website at the top of search engine results. In short, backlinks come in handy when you want to increase the authority of your website in the eyes of search engine giants like Google. Search engines discover new content via links and also leverage them as a parameter to determine the content quality. So, how does that work? Google considers a high-quality contextual backlink as a vote of confidence that testifies how worthy the content is. That said, it isn’t a surprise that link building remains one of the crucial search engine ranking factors. A targeted strategy often makes things easier and link building is no exception. Yes, it doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or a pro, you need a definitive link building strategy in place to achieve significant results. If not, your link-building efforts may end up a disaster. Worry not! If you understand the what, why, how, dos and don’ts of link building, it isn’t tough to crack the hard nut. Let me walk you through link building and its aspects one step at a time. What is Link Building? Professional link building is the practice of gaining links from one or more websites to your own. These links help users navigate from one web page to the other to access more information relevant to their search on the internet. As for search engines, links make way for the bots to crawl, index, and rank web pages. Why is Link Building Important for SEO? Link building is one of the most powerful ways to get high-authority, niche-specific websites to vouch for your site. With an effective link acquisition strategy, you can build a bold and illustrative backlink profile. Based on the robustness of the link profile you create, your website can enamor Google’s algorithm and achieve higher rankings. Link building, despite all the rumor-mongering happening, is something you cannot overlook when optimizing your website for SEO. Spoiler Alert: Building a healthy link profile doesn’t happen overnight. White hat link building for SEO takes time, but it is always worth it. When you put in targeted and genuine efforts toward link building, it gets paid off with long-lasting results. That’s the gist of it. The concept of links is cardinal to how Google search works. Its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin came up with the beautiful concept of PageRank. PageRank algorithm helps Google identify new pages and rank them based on quality signals. So, what this means is that Google’s core algorithm weighs backlinks as one of the top-ranking factors, and ignoring it could bring a website’s growth to a standstill. How to Build Links? Now that you know how link building can complement your website’s SEO, it’s time to learn how to build links. So, let’s delve into it. Broadly speaking, link building happens in three ways: 1. Requesting for Links Do you want to link back to your website from a specific website? The best thing to do is request the website owner for a backlink. However, you need to make sure that linking back to the website fetches you benefits in terms of web traffic and authority. Here’s what you need to remember. The website has to be related to your industry/niche. The website should be credible and exhibit great performance. Craft a genuinely compelling email pitch to convenience the website owner to accept a backlink placement to your website. 2. Earning Links Earning links is when other website owners link back to your website without you contacting them regarding backlinks. This often happens when you feature high-quality, user-engaging content on your website that your target audience and industry experts find useful. As per Google Webmaster Guidelines, “Creating good content pays off: Links are usually editorial votes given by choice, and the more useful content you have, the greater the chances someone else will find that content valuable to their readers and link to it.” Earning backlinks to your website is the biggest reward and a clear sign that your link-building efforts are actually working. 3. Buying Links Buying links is yet another way to secure link placements in top-performing sites. When it comes to buying backlinks, you need to be quite choosy about the sites you pick as you are investing some money to make more of it. Make sure you follow a metric-specific approach to narrow down top sites from your niche to build backlinks. Once that’s done, get in touch with the website owner with a well-crafted email to gain backlink placements on a commercial basis. If you find the process time-consuming, you can avail the assistance of a trusted link-building service provider to purchase links from relevant sites on your behalf. Key Elements to Evaluate Link Prospects Before thinking about how to find backlink placements, you need to narrow down sites that suit your link building needs. That’s why you should consider the following elements related to host sites when you invest in link building for SEO. Content: Written and visual content for blogs, web pages, etc. Admin: Do they have advertising policies in place? Link Profile: What do the links pointing to the site look like? Reputation: Does the author have any reputation? Authorship: Who is responsible for the website content? Technical: How do users find and engage with the site? In addition to these metrics, you need to conduct your own manual research and backlink quality analysis to get an even deeper understanding of your link-building prospects. Metric Vs. Quality Understanding metrics and quality can help you set up link-building success. Certain metrics from top SEO tools can help evaluate a site for link-building prospects much easier. They are: Ahrefs Domain Rating. Moz Page Authority. Moz Domain Authority. Moz Page Authority. Majestic Trust Flow. Majestic Citation Flow. Majestic Trust Flow. SEMrushAuthority Score. Verve Link Score. In addition to these metrics, you need to conduct your own manual research to get an even deeper understanding of your link-building prospects. Quality The search quality raters guidelines by Google have dedicated a section for Overall Page Quality Rating that you can follow as well. It can help you cover the purpose of the content, the depth of the content, and find out credible sources for the content. How to Analyze a Site? As you go through the evaluation process, there are two important things to keep in mind: Weight Each Element Some aspects of the site are more important than others. Examine multiple elements that decide the site quality Here are the key elements to consider during the assessment: Content Commercial links: Check if there are links to money pages. Find whether links are not tagged with no follow or sponsor Navigation: Is it too generic for the site? Restricted Keywords: Check if the site uses gambling, payday loan, or pornographic keywords Infrequency: Does the website post infrequently, or are the old posts rarely updated? Admin About Us: Find if the links point to money pages Admin Pages: Find pages that directly advertise dofollow links in guest posts and avoid them at all costs Info: Phone number, address, and email Link Profile Excess links: See if too many links are pointing to a single page Low Authority: Find the site’s Domain Authority and Domain Rating using SEO tools Non-relevant links: Discover if there are links that don’t make sense for the page Authorship Byline: Is the byline set to the site name or the admin? Author Page Info: Is the information about the author incomplete? Nationality: Is the author from your target country or not? If you are dealing with YMYL pages, you have to be more stringent about the author’s reputation. Reputation Online presence: Does the website has a good social media presence Followers: What type of accounts are following the brand Engagement: Does the page have enough engagement? Technical Indexed: Does the website exist in Google’s index with more than just the home page? Geo: What is the focus of the audience’s country? Page Engagement: Does the site have ads and links within pages? Link Building Strategies That Work The strategy you devise is the major driving factor behind your link-building outcomes. So, here is a look at the top white hat link building strategies you can harness to achieve desired results. 1. Ultimate Guides Ultimate Guides usually cover in-depth information about a specific topic and comprise several subheadings, illustrations, and super-long content. Since Ultimate Guides provide users access to massive information in one place, they can be a go-to choice to earn backlinks. 2. Listicles Listicles or list posts are posts that feature a numbered list of facts, techniques, tips, reasons and so much more. Packed in chunks, these posts contain information that delivers value to the users. After analyzing 1 million pieces of content, BuzzSumo has arrived at the conclusion that list posts generate far more backlinks than other forms of content, including infographics, quizzes, and more. 3. Resource Page Link Building So, what are Resource Pages? Resource Pages are pages that contain a curated list of resources that solely link back to informative content from multiple websites. The more the number of backlinks on a page, the more authoritative it is. Resource page link building is a practice where you link back to your website from a resource page. Your chances of gaining link placements in resource pages depend heavily on the quality of your content. You can find resource pages easily by using the following Google search strings. “Keyword” + inurl:links “Keyword” + “helpful resources” “Keyword” + “useful resources” “Keyword” + “useful links” Let’s say your niche is medicine. You can use medicine in the keyword field followed by one of the above Google search strings. Once you have the resource pages, you need to find out if a particular resource page is suitable for your link-building purposes. Not everyone has the same link-building needs. You can use metrics such as page authority, domain authority, the web traffic of the page/domain to decide if a given resource page is the right fit for you. This will give you the ideal site for your resource page link-building process. Look for content that is worth linking back to from the resource page. Finally, draft an email stating how your content can be a valuable addition to the resource page and ask the website owner to link back to your site. 4. Broken Link Building Broken link building is a unique link building strategy. While other link building strategies are about asking people for backlinks, broken link building makes way for you to help add value to somebody’s website. So, how to get backlinks using this strategy? The first step is to identify broken links in a website. Install either Check My Links or LinkMiner chrome extension. Not sure which website to check for broken links? Pick a page with more links. If there are many links, it’s likely that one or more of them are broken. That’s the idea. A resource page from your niche should be the best fit. After all, it is fully loaded with links. You can use the Chrome extension to weed out broken links in the page easily. Finally, send the website owner a mail highlighting the broken links that you identified and suggest replacing the link with yours. 5. Guest Blogging Guest blogging is never out of trend. It is, of course, one of the classic link building methods. Use a search string such as “write for us” + keyword to find blogs and websites that currently accept guest posts in your niche. Run through the search results and shortlist the ones that are right for you. Use the contact form or email address to initiate a formal conversation asking for a guest post opportunity with backlink placement. Unfortunately, guest post opportunities aren’t available just for you but also for your competitors. Make sure you stand out from the crowd every step of the way. Getting professional assistance from a trusted guest blogging service provider can take the burden off your shoulders and help you achieve desired results to outperform the other players in your industry. 6. Blogger Outreach Blogger outreach is one of the best strategies to build your backlink profile. You would have received outreach emails too. Doubt that? Check the spam folder of your mailbox. You will likely find at least a few outreach emails in there, only that they failed to grab your attention. If you’re wondering why these emails are dropped straight into the spam box, it’s because they may not be relevant to you. Suppose you run a website that specializes in e-commerce. An email targeting finance experts and investors is certainly not your cup of tea. That’s why your outreach campaigns should be targeting the right people. Your link success depends on it as well. In fact, outreach emails witness a response rate of only 10%, while the other 90% of them go unanswered. Having said that, if you want your outreach emails answered, you need to keep yourself updated about the latest outreach techniques and master them. Are you still using standard/traditional email templates for your outreach purposes? If your answer is yes, then it’s high time to break away. Let me tell you how to switch to non-conventional email outreach. Draft 100% personalized and original emails. Leverage your unique brand voice. Apart from increasing the response rate for your outreach campaigns, these emails also help you create a positive outlook toward your brand. So, who do you start with? Trustworthiness is the lifeline of blogger outreach. Start with people who trust you and are already aware of your business. They may include Your industry partners. People who have subscribed to your newsletter. People who have mentioned your links or brand name in their content. Bloggers/influencers who are connected with you on social media. Who else do you reach out to? Look for people who share something in common with you. For instance, you can reach out to bloggers who share a similar customer base. Link placement in niche-specific blogs can drive qualified leads and help you achieve more tractions for your business. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and others are also ideal to find people whose interests are similar to yours. Do you think outreach is eating up too much of your time? That’s why Stan Ventures shortlists sites based on 25+ link building metrics and offers a genuine blogger outreach service to help you earn high-quality backlinks seamlessly. 7. Unlinked Brand Mentions Every business gets its brand mentioned somewhere on the internet. These brand mentions need not necessarily be linked back to the corresponding website. Why not use your unlinked brand mentions to your link-building advantage? Yes, you can translate unlinked brand mentions to gain backlink placements across websites with minimal effort in the right direction. Use a brand monitoring tool like Semrush to keep track of your brand mentions across the internet. Once you find people who have mentioned your brand name in their web space, reach out to them and ask for backlink placements. However, you need to ensure that these links add value to the visitors of the corresponding domain. That way, the link juice is rightly passed on, having a positive impact on your website’s authority. 8. Podcast Links Links are everywhere. You just need to have a keen eye for them. What if I told you you could get backlinks without writing content or initiating outreach campaigns? It’s definitely possible. All it takes is one word: Podcasts. You just have to show up and talk about things you know and you get a link just like that. A podcast can be about anything, as long as it adds value to the listeners. Talk about something your target audience wants to learn and you get the job done without lifting your finger. 9. HARO Links HARO or Help A Reporter Out is an ideal place for you to connect with big shots from high authority, trusted websites. Once you sign up, you start receiving emails on a daily basis. Set a time frame, say, 30 to 45 minutes every day and look for queries within your expertise and respond to them. If your answer gets featured, you get a link placement on a high-authority website. It isn’t a sure-shot that your answers will be cited, but when it happens, the impact will be high. That’s how HARO links bolster your SEO efforts. 10. Infographic & Image Link Building Visual assets such as infographics, images, and diagrams make way for seamless link building. They present huge chunks of information in a comprehensive way. Users are fond of visual assets as well. So, how do infographics and images simplify link building? Let’s say you include a graph or chart on one of your web pages. Every time someone shares the graph, you automatically get a link from their website to your own. From this standpoint, visual assets hold greater good for link building than text-based content. 11. Getting competitor’s links using tools like AHREFs Link Intersect feature Did you know your competitors can help you strengthen your backlink profile? Here’s how: If a website links back to one or more of your competitors, chances are they can link back to your site. So, how do you find these sites that link back to your competitors? Ahrefs Link Intersect tool can simplify the process for you. Enter a few of your major competitors in the tool. Choose “all of the below targets” -> Show link opportunities. You will see a list of websites that all of them link back to. Check them out to find the best fit for building links. Make sure you pick sites where your potential prospects are likely to hang out. That’s precisely where you should establish your presence. Is that it? Not yet. I’ll tell you another way to refine your search for domains that link back to your competitors. Link Intersect -> Enter domains -> Click “any of the below targets” -> Show link opportunities. Now, you will get more results based on the number of intersects. Shortlist the websites you are going to contact for link-building opportunities. 12. Content Promotion Creating link-worthy content is important. However, you cannot stop there, especially if your aim is to create a great link profile. People should be able to discover your web pages in order to link back to them. That’s exactly why content promotion is mandatory. So, how do you promote your content? Advertising Outreach Communities/ Forums Advertising Invest in platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and others to improve the visibility of your content. The more the visibility, the greater the chances of someone showing interest to link back to your content. Well-written content can fetch you multiple backlinks in the long run. Investing a small sum of money to advertise your content isn’t a problem when it can fetch you more links and grow your business, right? Outreach Advertising is, of course, a good way to promote your content. Even so, reaching out to people with an email pitch makes the process sound more formal. Also, when it comes to content promotion via outreach, you add more value to the recipients of your mail and their target audience (who are your prospects too). If you can convince the website owners that linking back to your content fetches mutual benefits, it is a win-win scenario. Communities/ Forums You have niche-specific forum sites where you can promote your content among your target audience. Social media groups and communities are also good places for content promotion. However, it isn’t as easy as joining a forum and dropping your content links just like that. You need to become an active member and take part in discussions that happen there. Once you have built a reputation for yourself among the forum members, you can post your content in the community. If the audiences find the content good enough, they will link back to it. Remember, you must not post links in the group every time you publish new content. Doing it frequently can annoy people and they might not check out your content at all. Make your moves wisely when promoting your content across communities. 13. Reverse Image Search Is someone using your visual asset without your knowledge? Don’t worry. I look at it as an opportunity rather than a problem. What if you can use the scenario to build a backlink while fixing the copyright breach? Reverse image search is the key. Reverse image search refers to the practice of searching for all indexed URLs across the internet containing the same or similar image. You can perform a reverse image search using Google Images or Bing Images. Alternatively, you can do it directly from Chrome. So, how do you harness reverse image search to build backlinks? Most website owners do not want to remove copied images because it delivers value to their users. That said, it is a cakewalk to secure a backlink from their website through the image. All you have to do is send them a friendly email asking for a backlink in return. 14. Skyscraper Technique Have you ever thought about creating something better than the top-performing content in your niche? That’s the root of the skyscraper technique. This technique emphasizes improvising on the top-performing content with a great number of backlinks. You do that to steal your competitor’s backlinks so that you can drive more traffic to your website and skyrocket your search engine ranking, all by creating a more enhanced version of the existing content. The first step is to identify the best-performing content loaded with backlinks. Perform a Google search with a broad keyword for top-ranked content and analyze it for backlinks using tools like Ahrefs. The next thing is to create an improved version of the content. Here’s what you should do. Increase the length of the content Add updated information and relevant images Implement a simple and appealing design Provide in-depth information about the topic Once you have created your version of the content, it’s time for email outreach. Now, let’s do some smart work. Instead of reaching out to random bloggers, contact people who have already linked to the content. As they’ve linked to similar content, the chances of them linking to your content are high. That’s the idea. 15. Internal Linking Strategy Link building isn’t just about linking from or to other sites. It is also about linking pages within your website. So, why is internal link building crucial? Your visitors are your top priority. A bad user experience can drive them away as soon as they come in. This includes increased bounce rate and a higher bounce rate, which are a threat to your website’s SEO. The smoother the user experience, the longer the time they spend on your website. With channelized internal link building, you help your visitors navigate across your web pages seamlessly while offering a promising user experience. Your users aren’t the only ones navigating across your site. Search engine spiders do the same and when you link internal pages, you make way for them to understand the context better and rank pages higher. The more the internal links directing to a particular web page, the more important the page is in the eyes of the search engine bots. Tools that Help in Link Building As you know, link building is a time-consuming process. However, the results are long-lasting if done right. Your link-building toolkit is your magic wand.

Link Building: A Case Study From Stan Ventures Actions speak better than words. Let me give you a practical example of how we helped one of our clients rank #1 in SERPs in just 2 weeks. Kitchenroom, a UK-based website offering fitted kitchen services, found it difficult to generate organic traffic despite having a great website with unique content and being in business since 2017. Jason, the founder of Kitchenroom, wanted more prospects across Oxfordshire to contact him and also needed to rank on top of the search. Our SEOs rolled up their sleeves to figure out the challenges we will meet going forward. The major challenge we faced was that some of the client’s competitors had a robust online presence with 10x more referring domains compared to Kitchenroom. On the other hand, Kitchenroom was lagging behind in terms of authority due to fewer backlinks. After a thorough competitor analysis, we found that even though the competitors leveraged backlinks to stay at the top of the search, those links lacked authority. And that was our trump card. We figured out that building high-quality backlinks through genuine blogger outreach will help the client’s website rank higher. Proceeding further, our outreach experts started contacting niche-specific bloggers to ensure link placements for Kitchenroom on relevant sites. Once the sites were narrowed down and approved by Jason, our native content writers produced content with the anchor text placed naturally. We shared the content with the bloggers and received the live link shortly. Within two weeks, Jason started receiving more calls while the original traffic was going up. The keywords we wanted Kitchenroom to rank for were in the top 3 positions and the overall traffic of the site increased by 79%. Here’s a look at the numbers. Traffic – 387 +40% Keywords – 111 +107% Traffic Value – $739 +3X Link Building Tactics You Should Avoid It isn’t always about knowing the dos. You also need to know the don’ts so that you dodge or unlearn them in time. This holds true for link building as well. Let me pinpoint some black hat practices you should avoid in the course of your link-building journey. Paying for Links Paid link building manipulates search engine algorithms and is clearly a violation of Google’s webmaster guidelines. So, you may end up with a penalty and that’s very risky. A majority of paid links come from sites with a lot of outbound links and are naturally of low quality. Again, low-quality links can negatively impact your SEO. If you purchase paid links to outdo your competitors, remember they can buy links too. In that case, your investment may bear no fruit. However, if paid marketing isn’t the chief focus for your SEO strategy or if you want to buy links just to boost your brand authority, you can opt for paid links. Remember to include rel=“nofollow” or rel=“sponsored” attributes to your paid links so that they don’t affect your website’s SEO. If you leverage paid links purely to boost your search engine rankings, it is, of course, a red flag. Unnatural Links Are you placing links just because you want to increase your backlink count and rank higher on searches? Don’t do that. The tactic can backfire on you. Low-quality, unnatural backlinks are enlisted as spammy links and you may face a penalty for the same. That said, your backlink has to add value to the users and the website. It should either drive users to a relevant source of information or allow search engine crawlers to comprehend the context better. Want to dig deeper? Check out our extensive blog post covering how to check backlink quality in detail PBN Links Private blog networks (PBN) intend to create lots of links from a cluster of websites (often with no authority) to a money-making website. This is done to pass link juice to the money-making site and improve its ranking unethically. Google hates PBN as it tricks the search engine algorithm into ranking a site higher using unfair means. If you use a PBN to get your site ranked better, the whole strategy will collapse when Google finds and imposes a penalty upon it. Wrapping Up Link building is a consistent process and you can never expect to arrive at a dead-end. While it may seem like demanding more effort than any other SEO strategy, the reward is huge and lasts in the long run. Once you achieve success in link building for SEO, your site will already be generating considerable organic traffic. Then, you may not be required to put in as much effort as you did initially. After all, you don’t have to start from scratch every time. All you need to do is maintain your website’s standard while featuring user-focused content and keeping a constant eye on search engine algorithm updates. Link building is an ocean and I have touched upon all possible aspects of it to give you a 360-degree view of it. Hopefully, all your link building questions have been answered. Stay tuned for more.

In short, backlinks come in handy when you want to increase the authority of your website in the eyes of search engine giants like Google. Search engines discover new content via links and also leverage them as a parameter to determine the content quality. So, how does that work? Google considers a high-quality contextual backlink as a vote of confidence that testifies how worthy the content is. That said, it isn’t a surprise that link building remains one of the crucial search engine ranking factors. A targeted strategy often makes things easier and link building is no exception. Yes, it doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or a pro, you need a definitive link building strategy in place to achieve significant results. If not, your link-building efforts may end up a disaster. Worry not! If you understand the what, why, how, dos and don’ts of link building, it isn’t tough to crack the hard nut. Let me walk you through link building and its aspects one step at a time. What is Link Building? Professional link building is the practice of gaining links from one or more websites to your own. These links help users navigate from one web page to the other to access more information relevant to their search on the internet. As for search engines, links make way for the bots to crawl, index, and rank web pages. Why is Link Building Important for SEO? Link building is one of the most powerful ways to get high-authority, niche-specific websites to vouch for your site. With an effective link acquisition strategy, you can build a bold and illustrative backlink profile. Based on the robustness of the link profile you create, your website can enamor Google’s algorithm and achieve higher rankings. Link building, despite all the rumor-mongering happening, is something you cannot overlook when optimizing your website for SEO. Spoiler Alert: Building a healthy link profile doesn’t happen overnight. White hat link building for SEO takes time, but it is always worth it. When you put in targeted and genuine efforts toward link building, it gets paid off with long-lasting results. That’s the gist of it. The concept of links is cardinal to how Google search works. Its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin came up with the beautiful concept of PageRank. PageRank algorithm helps Google identify new pages and rank them based on quality signals. So, what this means is that Google’s core algorithm weighs backlinks as one of the top-ranking factors, and ignoring it could bring a website’s growth to a standstill. How to Build Links? Now that you know how link building can complement your website’s SEO, it’s time to learn how to build links. So, let’s delve into it. Broadly speaking, link building happens in three ways: 1. Requesting for Links Do you want to link back to your website from a specific website? The best thing to do is request the website owner for a backlink. However, you need to make sure that linking back to the website fetches you benefits in terms of web traffic and authority. Here’s what you need to remember. The website has to be related to your industry/niche. The website should be credible and exhibit great performance. Craft a genuinely compelling email pitch to convenience the website owner to accept a backlink placement to your website. 2. Earning Links Earning links is when other website owners link back to your website without you contacting them regarding backlinks. This often happens when you feature high-quality, user-engaging content on your website that your target audience and industry experts find useful. As per Google Webmaster Guidelines, “Creating good content pays off: Links are usually editorial votes given by choice, and the more useful content you have, the greater the chances someone else will find that content valuable to their readers and link to it.” Earning backlinks to your website is the biggest reward and a clear sign that your link-building efforts are actually working. 3. Buying Links Buying links is yet another way to secure link placements in top-performing sites. When it comes to buying backlinks, you need to be quite choosy about the sites you pick as you are investing some money to make more of it. Make sure you follow a metric-specific approach to narrow down top sites from your niche to build backlinks. Once that’s done, get in touch with the website owner with a well-crafted email to gain backlink placements on a commercial basis. If you find the process time-consuming, you can avail the assistance of a trusted link-building service provider to purchase links from relevant sites on your behalf. Key Elements to Evaluate Link Prospects Before thinking about how to find backlink placements, you need to narrow down sites that suit your link building needs. That’s why you should consider the following elements related to host sites when you invest in link building for SEO. Content: Written and visual content for blogs, web pages, etc. Admin: Do they have advertising policies in place? Link Profile: What do the links pointing to the site look like? Reputation: Does the author have any reputation? Authorship: Who is responsible for the website content? Technical: How do users find and engage with the site? In addition to these metrics, you need to conduct your own manual research and backlink quality analysis to get an even deeper understanding of your link-building prospects. Metric Vs. Quality Understanding metrics and quality can help you set up link-building success. Certain metrics from top SEO tools can help evaluate a site for link-building prospects much easier. They are: Ahrefs Domain Rating. Moz Page Authority. Moz Domain Authority. Moz Page Authority. Majestic Trust Flow. Majestic Citation Flow. Majestic Trust Flow. SEMrushAuthority Score. Verve Link Score. In addition to these metrics, you need to conduct your own manual research to get an even deeper understanding of your link-building prospects. Quality The search quality raters guidelines by Google have dedicated a section for Overall Page Quality Rating that you can follow as well. It can help you cover the purpose of the content, the depth of the content, and find out credible sources for the content. How to Analyze a Site? As you go through the evaluation process, there are two important things to keep in mind: Weight Each Element Some aspects of the site are more important than others. Examine multiple elements that decide the site quality Here are the key elements to consider during the assessment: Content Commercial links: Check if there are links to money pages. Find whether links are not tagged with no follow or sponsor Navigation: Is it too generic for the site? Restricted Keywords: Check if the site uses gambling, payday loan, or pornographic keywords Infrequency: Does the website post infrequently, or are the old posts rarely updated? Admin About Us: Find if the links point to money pages Admin Pages: Find pages that directly advertise dofollow links in guest posts and avoid them at all costs Info: Phone number, address, and email Link Profile Excess links: See if too many links are pointing to a single page Low Authority: Find the site’s Domain Authority and Domain Rating using SEO tools Non-relevant links: Discover if there are links that don’t make sense for the page Authorship Byline: Is the byline set to the site name or the admin? Author Page Info: Is the information about the author incomplete? Nationality: Is the author from your target country or not? If you are dealing with YMYL pages, you have to be more stringent about the author’s reputation. Reputation Online presence: Does the website has a good social media presence Followers: What type of accounts are following the brand Engagement: Does the page have enough engagement? Technical Indexed: Does the website exist in Google’s index with more than just the home page? Geo: What is the focus of the audience’s country? Page Engagement: Does the site have ads and links within pages? Link Building Strategies That Work The strategy you devise is the major driving factor behind your link-building outcomes. So, here is a look at the top white hat link building strategies you can harness to achieve desired results. 1. Ultimate Guides Ultimate Guides usually cover in-depth information about a specific topic and comprise several subheadings, illustrations, and super-long content. Since Ultimate Guides provide users access to massive information in one place, they can be a go-to choice to earn backlinks. 2. Listicles Listicles or list posts are posts that feature a numbered list of facts, techniques, tips, reasons and so much more. Packed in chunks, these posts contain information that delivers value to the users. After analyzing 1 million pieces of content, BuzzSumo has arrived at the conclusion that list posts generate far more backlinks than other forms of content, including infographics, quizzes, and more. 3. Resource Page Link Building So, what are Resource Pages? Resource Pages are pages that contain a curated list of resources that solely link back to informative content from multiple websites. The more the number of backlinks on a page, the more authoritative it is. Resource page link building is a practice where you link back to your website from a resource page. Your chances of gaining link placements in resource pages depend heavily on the quality of your content. You can find resource pages easily by using the following Google search strings. “Keyword” + inurl:links “Keyword” + “helpful resources” “Keyword” + “useful resources” “Keyword” + “useful links” Let’s say your niche is medicine. You can use medicine in the keyword field followed by one of the above Google search strings. Once you have the resource pages, you need to find out if a particular resource page is suitable for your link-building purposes. Not everyone has the same link-building needs. You can use metrics such as page authority, domain authority, the web traffic of the page/domain to decide if a given resource page is the right fit for you. This will give you the ideal site for your resource page link-building process. Look for content that is worth linking back to from the resource page. Finally, draft an email stating how your content can be a valuable addition to the resource page and ask the website owner to link back to your site. 4. Broken Link Building Broken link building is a unique link building strategy. While other link building strategies are about asking people for backlinks, broken link building makes way for you to help add value to somebody’s website. So, how to get backlinks using this strategy? The first step is to identify broken links in a website. Install either Check My Links or LinkMiner chrome extension. Not sure which website to check for broken links? Pick a page with more links. If there are many links, it’s likely that one or more of them are broken. That’s the idea. A resource page from your niche should be the best fit. After all, it is fully loaded with links. You can use the Chrome extension to weed out broken links in the page easily. Finally, send the website owner a mail highlighting the broken links that you identified and suggest replacing the link with yours. 5. Guest Blogging Guest blogging is never out of trend. It is, of course, one of the classic link building methods. Use a search string such as “write for us” + keyword to find blogs and websites that currently accept guest posts in your niche. Run through the search results and shortlist the ones that are right for you. Use the contact form or email address to initiate a formal conversation asking for a guest post opportunity with backlink placement. Unfortunately, guest post opportunities aren’t available just for you but also for your competitors. Make sure you stand out from the crowd every step of the way. Getting professional assistance from a trusted guest blogging service provider can take the burden off your shoulders and help you achieve desired results to outperform the other players in your industry. 6. Blogger Outreach Blogger outreach is one of the best strategies to build your backlink profile. You would have received outreach emails too. Doubt that? Check the spam folder of your mailbox. You will likely find at least a few outreach emails in there, only that they failed to grab your attention. If you’re wondering why these emails are dropped straight into the spam box, it’s because they may not be relevant to you. Suppose you run a website that specializes in e-commerce. An email targeting finance experts and investors is certainly not your cup of tea. That’s why your outreach campaigns should be targeting the right people. Your link success depends on it as well. In fact, outreach emails witness a response rate of only 10%, while the other 90% of them go unanswered. Having said that, if you want your outreach emails answered, you need to keep yourself updated about the latest outreach techniques and master them. Are you still using standard/traditional email templates for your outreach purposes? If your answer is yes, then it’s high time to break away. Let me tell you how to switch to non-conventional email outreach. Draft 100% personalized and original emails. Leverage your unique brand voice. Apart from increasing the response rate for your outreach campaigns, these emails also help you create a positive outlook toward your brand. So, who do you start with? Trustworthiness is the lifeline of blogger outreach. Start with people who trust you and are already aware of your business. They may include Your industry partners. People who have subscribed to your newsletter. People who have mentioned your links or brand name in their content. Bloggers/influencers who are connected with you on social media. Who else do you reach out to? Look for people who share something in common with you. For instance, you can reach out to bloggers who share a similar customer base. Link placement in niche-specific blogs can drive qualified leads and help you achieve more tractions for your business. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and others are also ideal to find people whose interests are similar to yours. Do you think outreach is eating up too much of your time? That’s why Stan Ventures shortlists sites based on 25+ link building metrics and offers a genuine blogger outreach service to help you earn high-quality backlinks seamlessly. 7. Unlinked Brand Mentions Every business gets its brand mentioned somewhere on the internet. These brand mentions need not necessarily be linked back to the corresponding website. Why not use your unlinked brand mentions to your link-building advantage? Yes, you can translate unlinked brand mentions to gain backlink placements across websites with minimal effort in the right direction. Use a brand monitoring tool like Semrush to keep track of your brand mentions across the internet. Once you find people who have mentioned your brand name in their web space, reach out to them and ask for backlink placements. However, you need to ensure that these links add value to the visitors of the corresponding domain. That way, the link juice is rightly passed on, having a positive impact on your website’s authority. 8. Podcast Links Links are everywhere. You just need to have a keen eye for them. What if I told you you could get backlinks without writing content or initiating outreach campaigns? It’s definitely possible. All it takes is one word: Podcasts. You just have to show up and talk about things you know and you get a link just like that. A podcast can be about anything, as long as it adds value to the listeners. Talk about something your target audience wants to learn and you get the job done without lifting your finger. 9. HARO Links HARO or Help A Reporter Out is an ideal place for you to connect with big shots from high authority, trusted websites. Once you sign up, you start receiving emails on a daily basis. Set a time frame, say, 30 to 45 minutes every day and look for queries within your expertise and respond to them. If your answer gets featured, you get a link placement on a high-authority website. It isn’t a sure-shot that your answers will be cited, but when it happens, the impact will be high. That’s how HARO links bolster your SEO efforts. 10. Infographic & Image Link Building Visual assets such as infographics, images, and diagrams make way for seamless link building. They present huge chunks of information in a comprehensive way. Users are fond of visual assets as well. So, how do infographics and images simplify link building? Let’s say you include a graph or chart on one of your web pages. Every time someone shares the graph, you automatically get a link from their website to your own. From this standpoint, visual assets hold greater good for link building than text-based content. 11. Getting competitor’s links using tools like AHREFs Link Intersect feature Did you know your competitors can help you strengthen your backlink profile? Here’s how: If a website links back to one or more of your competitors, chances are they can link back to your site. So, how do you find these sites that link back to your competitors? Ahrefs Link Intersect tool can simplify the process for you. Enter a few of your major competitors in the tool. Choose “all of the below targets” -> Show link opportunities. You will see a list of websites that all of them link back to. Check them out to find the best fit for building links. Make sure you pick sites where your potential prospects are likely to hang out. That’s precisely where you should establish your presence. Is that it? Not yet. I’ll tell you another way to refine your search for domains that link back to your competitors. Link Intersect -> Enter domains -> Click “any of the below targets” -> Show link opportunities. Now, you will get more results based on the number of intersects. Shortlist the websites you are going to contact for link-building opportunities. 12. Content Promotion Creating link-worthy content is important. However, you cannot stop there, especially if your aim is to create a great link profile. People should be able to discover your web pages in order to link back to them. That’s exactly why content promotion is mandatory. So, how do you promote your content? Advertising Outreach Communities/ Forums Advertising Invest in platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and others to improve the visibility of your content. The more the visibility, the greater the chances of someone showing interest to link back to your content. Well-written content can fetch you multiple backlinks in the long run. Investing a small sum of money to advertise your content isn’t a problem when it can fetch you more links and grow your business, right? Outreach Advertising is, of course, a good way to promote your content. Even so, reaching out to people with an email pitch makes the process sound more formal. Also, when it comes to content promotion via outreach, you add more value to the recipients of your mail and their target audience (who are your prospects too). If you can convince the website owners that linking back to your content fetches mutual benefits, it is a win-win scenario. Communities/ Forums You have niche-specific forum sites where you can promote your content among your target audience. Social media groups and communities are also good places for content promotion. However, it isn’t as easy as joining a forum and dropping your content links just like that. You need to become an active member and take part in discussions that happen there. Once you have built a reputation for yourself among the forum members, you can post your content in the community. If the audiences find the content good enough, they will link back to it. Remember, you must not post links in the group every time you publish new content. Doing it frequently can annoy people and they might not check out your content at all. Make your moves wisely when promoting your content across communities. 13. Reverse Image Search Is someone using your visual asset without your knowledge? Don’t worry. I look at it as an opportunity rather than a problem. What if you can use the scenario to build a backlink while fixing the copyright breach? Reverse image search is the key. Reverse image search refers to the practice of searching for all indexed URLs across the internet containing the same or similar image. You can perform a reverse image search using Google Images or Bing Images. Alternatively, you can do it directly from Chrome. So, how do you harness reverse image search to build backlinks? Most website owners do not want to remove copied images because it delivers value to their users. That said, it is a cakewalk to secure a backlink from their website through the image. All you have to do is send them a friendly email asking for a backlink in return. 14. Skyscraper Technique Have you ever thought about creating something better than the top-performing content in your niche? That’s the root of the skyscraper technique. This technique emphasizes improvising on the top-performing content with a great number of backlinks. You do that to steal your competitor’s backlinks so that you can drive more traffic to your website and skyrocket your search engine ranking, all by creating a more enhanced version of the existing content. The first step is to identify the best-performing content loaded with backlinks. Perform a Google search with a broad keyword for top-ranked content and analyze it for backlinks using tools like Ahrefs. The next thing is to create an improved version of the content. Here’s what you should do. Increase the length of the content Add updated information and relevant images Implement a simple and appealing design Provide in-depth information about the topic Once you have created your version of the content, it’s time for email outreach. Now, let’s do some smart work. Instead of reaching out to random bloggers, contact people who have already linked to the content. As they’ve linked to similar content, the chances of them linking to your content are high. That’s the idea. 15. Internal Linking Strategy Link building isn’t just about linking from or to other sites. It is also about linking pages within your website. So, why is internal link building crucial? Your visitors are your top priority. A bad user experience can drive them away as soon as they come in. This includes increased bounce rate and a higher bounce rate, which are a threat to your website’s SEO. The smoother the user experience, the longer the time they spend on your website. With channelized internal link building, you help your visitors navigate across your web pages seamlessly while offering a promising user experience. Your users aren’t the only ones navigating across your site. Search engine spiders do the same and when you link internal pages, you make way for them to understand the context better and rank pages higher. The more the internal links directing to a particular web page, the more important the page is in the eyes of the search engine bots. Tools that Help in Link Building As you know, link building is a time-consuming process. However, the results are long-lasting if done right. Your link-building toolkit is your magic wand.

Link Building: A Case Study From Stan Ventures Actions speak better than words. Let me give you a practical example of how we helped one of our clients rank #1 in SERPs in just 2 weeks. Kitchenroom, a UK-based website offering fitted kitchen services, found it difficult to generate organic traffic despite having a great website with unique content and being in business since 2017. Jason, the founder of Kitchenroom, wanted more prospects across Oxfordshire to contact him and also needed to rank on top of the search. Our SEOs rolled up their sleeves to figure out the challenges we will meet going forward. The major challenge we faced was that some of the client’s competitors had a robust online presence with 10x more referring domains compared to Kitchenroom. On the other hand, Kitchenroom was lagging behind in terms of authority due to fewer backlinks. After a thorough competitor analysis, we found that even though the competitors leveraged backlinks to stay at the top of the search, those links lacked authority. And that was our trump card. We figured out that building high-quality backlinks through genuine blogger outreach will help the client’s website rank higher. Proceeding further, our outreach experts started contacting niche-specific bloggers to ensure link placements for Kitchenroom on relevant sites. Once the sites were narrowed down and approved by Jason, our native content writers produced content with the anchor text placed naturally. We shared the content with the bloggers and received the live link shortly. Within two weeks, Jason started receiving more calls while the original traffic was going up. The keywords we wanted Kitchenroom to rank for were in the top 3 positions and the overall traffic of the site increased by 79%. Here’s a look at the numbers. Traffic – 387 +40% Keywords – 111 +107% Traffic Value – $739 +3X Link Building Tactics You Should Avoid It isn’t always about knowing the dos. You also need to know the don’ts so that you dodge or unlearn them in time. This holds true for link building as well. Let me pinpoint some black hat practices you should avoid in the course of your link-building journey. Paying for Links Paid link building manipulates search engine algorithms and is clearly a violation of Google’s webmaster guidelines. So, you may end up with a penalty and that’s very risky. A majority of paid links come from sites with a lot of outbound links and are naturally of low quality. Again, low-quality links can negatively impact your SEO. If you purchase paid links to outdo your competitors, remember they can buy links too. In that case, your investment may bear no fruit. However, if paid marketing isn’t the chief focus for your SEO strategy or if you want to buy links just to boost your brand authority, you can opt for paid links. Remember to include rel=“nofollow” or rel=“sponsored” attributes to your paid links so that they don’t affect your website’s SEO. If you leverage paid links purely to boost your search engine rankings, it is, of course, a red flag. Unnatural Links Are you placing links just because you want to increase your backlink count and rank higher on searches? Don’t do that. The tactic can backfire on you. Low-quality, unnatural backlinks are enlisted as spammy links and you may face a penalty for the same. That said, your backlink has to add value to the users and the website. It should either drive users to a relevant source of information or allow search engine crawlers to comprehend the context better. Want to dig deeper? Check out our extensive blog post covering how to check backlink quality in detail PBN Links Private blog networks (PBN) intend to create lots of links from a cluster of websites (often with no authority) to a money-making website. This is done to pass link juice to the money-making site and improve its ranking unethically. Google hates PBN as it tricks the search engine algorithm into ranking a site higher using unfair means. If you use a PBN to get your site ranked better, the whole strategy will collapse when Google finds and imposes a penalty upon it. Wrapping Up Link building is a consistent process and you can never expect to arrive at a dead-end. While it may seem like demanding more effort than any other SEO strategy, the reward is huge and lasts in the long run. Once you achieve success in link building for SEO, your site will already be generating considerable organic traffic. Then, you may not be required to put in as much effort as you did initially. After all, you don’t have to start from scratch every time. All you need to do is maintain your website’s standard while featuring user-focused content and keeping a constant eye on search engine algorithm updates. Link building is an ocean and I have touched upon all possible aspects of it to give you a 360-degree view of it. Hopefully, all your link building questions have been answered. Stay tuned for more.

It’s integrated with Google’s search engine for streamlined prospecting, and pulls metrics like Domain Rating and Ahrefs Rank directly from Ahrefs. An easy-to-use email finder is also included, making it extremely easy to find the right person’s contact information without having to rely on any other tools. Respona’s intuitive interface guides you through every step of creating and launching your outreach campaigns, keeps track of your performance, and also the status of your conversations with each prospect. The tool will be especially useful to link builders, as it was initially used to help Visme scale their link building outreach efforts, helping the website gain over 2 million organic visitors a month. Automated email outreach Great for prospecting and finding contact information Deep personalization Built-in analytics and reporting 2) SE Ranking If you need an all-in-one tool with a powerful backlink analysis feature, SE Ranking will enable you to learn about the quality of your backlink profile or that of a competitor's. Just insert the domain you want to research, and you will see its Domain and Page Trust – proprietary metrics of the company that predict whether the domain is eligible for a high ranking. Besides, you can check the dynamics of new and lost backlinks and referring domains, as well as the dofollow/nofollow ratio for all the links the algorithm finds for the page. Furthermore, the tool allows you to track the regions where your pages are referred to the most. Anchor text distribution data is also available and conveniently visualized. When it comes to competitor research, the Backlink Gap Analyzer by SE Ranking will compare your domain with up to 5 competitors. You can see where they have backlinks, and you don’t, and plan your future outreach strategy accordingly. In addition, it’s worth mentioning the attractive SE Ranking tool pricing. This all-in-one SEO helper costs only $39 per month, and you can save 20% by paying annually. 3) Ahrefs: Our Favorite Tool for Finding New Opportunities Ahrefs is an incredible all-round SEO tool with a ton of great features for finding link building opportunities. Here are three that stand out: You can see which pages on a competitor’s website attract the most links. Use this information to create the type of content people love linking to. You can view backlinks by page or domain to see which sites are linking to your competitors. This can show good outreach opportunities. The Link Intersect tool shows which websites are linking to multiple competitors but not you. This is another way to highlight potential outreach opportunities. The image below shows some of the most linked-to pages on Neil Patel’s website. A marketing-focused website could consider creating similar content to attract backlinks. You can even use Ahrefs to see which websites are linking to certain pieces of content. Approaching these sites could be a good way to get backlinks. The image below shows some of the sites linking to the SEO Made Simple 2020 guide. The main disadvantage of Ahrefs is that its price, starting at $99, puts it out of reach for some SEO beginners (although there is a $7 free trial that gives full use of the software for seven days). For everyone else, it is a worthwhile investment. 4) Hunter.io: Best for Finding Emails Once you have a list of backlink opportunities from Ahrefs, you need to contact people at the publications. This could be done manually, but if you have a long list of targets you’ll want to automate the process. This is where Hunter.io comes in. This tool automatically scrapes the web for the contact details of websites or professionals in seconds. Just upload a list of sites and you’re ready to go. While you won’t get email addresses for every website, the tool has a high success rate because it uses multiple sources. Hunter.io comes into its own due to the email verifier feature. This confirms that the email address pulled by the software is accurate. The site also highlights the sources it uses to find email addresses so that you can perform your own checks. Once you have a list, export them in CSV format to use it with other tools. Hunter.io has a free plan that gives you 50 searches per month. This may be enough for smaller outreach campaigns and is a great way to try out the software. Larger companies that perform a lot of outreach will have to pay for plans — these range from $49 per month to $399. 5) Pitchbox: Best Link Building Tool for Outreach Once you have email addresses for contacts at websites, it’s time to connect. If you just have a handful of targets, you could do this manually without much bother. For larger-scale campaigns, automating the process will save you a lot of time. It’s perfect for Skyscraper 2.0, guest posting, and link building campaigns. We use Pitchbox to automate outreach. This link building tool lets you find targets and then create large-scale personalised campaigns from template emails. There are several reasons why we recommend Pitchbox: The UX makes it easy to create and send campaigns. You can schedule follow up emails at predefined intervals. You can easily see SEO metrics associated with websites in your list (see image below). You can respond to opportunities from within Pitchbox. The opportunity pipeline is an excellent way to get an overview of your outreach campaign. All this makes Pitchbox an effective and easy-to-use tool for link building outreach. Additionally, Pitchbox provides every single search metric under the sun, pulling them in from all of the other major software providers (Ahrefs, Moz, Majestic etc.) The major downside is that the service isn’t cheap. You have to contact the company for pricing via its website. If you want to find out more about our complete link prospecting process, including how we use Pitchbox, check out this blogpost. 6) Majestic SEO: Best for Alternative Data Where Ahrefs is an all-round SEO powerhouse, Majestic is more focused on backlinks. While it doesn’t have the sheer quantity of features that Ahrefs does, it provides some useful link building metrics that Ahrefs doesn’t. Here are three of the most useful ones: Trust Flow is a number out of 100 that represents the quality of the links pointing to a website. Citation Flow measures the number of links. Using these scores together is a great way to spot spammy websites that you may want to avoid getting a link from. Topical Trust Flow shows a website’s rank across different categories. This is a useful metric to use when searching for relevant link building opportunities. Perhaps the best thing about Majestic SEO is its price. A base subscription is just $49, which is half the price of the cheapest Ahrefs plan. 7) Mailshake Mailshake simplifies outreach campaigns by helping users send mass personalized emails. You can then send follow-up sequences based on interaction. This can save a ton of time. Trust us, as a link building service, we know the efficiency benefits of automated campaigns. One way Mailshake stands out is by offering pre-made templates for use in different types of link building campaigns. There are optimized emails available for: Broken link building. Guest posting. Link requests. PR pitches. Content promotion. And more. Mailshake has plenty of uses beyond link building. Features such as the virtual phone dialer make it great for sales outreach. If you also deal with sales at your company, trying Mailshake is a no-brainer. The software will also analyze your email copy to help improve engagement and deliverability. You can try this out via the free tool on the Mailshake website. Mailshake is also simple to get to grips with. The interface is user-friendly and you can easily upload all your contacts from a spreadsheet. The tool starts at $59 per user per month, which is affordable if you do a lot of link building outreach. However, you’ll have to pay more for some of the advanced features like the phone dialer. 8) Buzzstream Buzzstream is link building software that helps with outreach. It's similar to Pitchbox, but not quite as expensive (or powerful). The first thing it does is help you find email addresses. You can search from within the platform to find contact details for relevant sites. Or you can upload a CSV file with a list of websites in your niche — like the one produced by our tool above — and the software will automatically find contact information. You then send email campaigns from within the dashboard and there are templates you can use to help. You can also schedule automatic follow-ups to improve your campaign’s efficiency. We especially like Buzzstream’s in-depth reporting features. The tool uses data from around the web to provide information such as: The Domain Authority (DA) of the websites you are contacting. The number of followers a site has. Whether the site has promoted your website in the past. Whether your team has had previous contact with anyone at the site. This allows you to create high priority segments of outreach targets based on metrics such as the quality of the website or the likeliness of them giving you a link. This ensures you don’t waste time on contacts that are unlikely to result in a link. Just choose the most relevant metrics. For example: Segment one: Websites with a DA of over 60 that someone on your team has had previous contact with. Segment two: Websites with a DA of 50 plus that have previously placed one of your posts. Pricing is another benefit of Buzzstream. The most basic plan starts at just $24 per month, making it an affordable option for small businesses. Plans go up to $299 per month for six users. 9) HARO HARO is a platform that connects journalists with sources. It is an essential part of any link building campaign because you typically get a backlink when a writer chooses you as a source. Journalists from many DR 80+ websites use HARO, which makes it a great way to attract high authority links — if you have a good strategy. To start building links with HARO, head to the website, sign up as a source, and choose your areas of expertise. HARO will then send you daily emails with relevant requests. Just search through the emails to find requests you are well-positioned to answer. Each request contains a summary of the story and further instructions. You can see an example in the screenshot below. The downside to HARO is that website owners know it is a great way to get links, which means competition can be intense. That’s why you must know the key to a good response. This includes: Replying fast: Journalists are typically in a hurry; you want to be one of the first responses they read. Keep responses concise: Only include the most essential details. Be quotable. You need to write in a way that makes it easy for the journalist to add your response to their article. A great thing about HARO is that it’s free to sign up as a source. As long as you have the time to craft quality responses, it’s a great way to get links. If you don’t have the time, you could always try out our HARO link building service. Several other platforms offer similar services to HARO: ResponseSource is a UK based media requests platform. SourceBottle is another similar service that helps sources connect with journalists. Businesses can create an expert profile for $25 per month which SourceBottle will promote to journalists looking for sources. Qwoted provides experts and PR professionals with access to journalists and source requests. It includes more advanced features than HARO, such as in-app messaging and the ability to see how many responses a request has. 10) MOZ MOZ is a tool with features that cover many aspects of SEO — from keyword research to competitor analysis, and more. The most useful tool for link building is its Link Explorer. This shows you which sites link to a domain or URL. You also get access to other important metrics such as keywords and Domain Authority. Use this information to reverse engineer your competitor’s backlink profile. Consider reaching out to the sites that link to your competitors to see if they will also link to you. Another cool feature is the Spam Score. If you’re worried about your own site’s backlink profile, put your URL into the Link Explorer to see whether you have too many low-quality links. If you do, consider telling Google to ignore the links to reduce your chances of being penalized by the algorithm. We go into further detail about how to do this in the section below. Moz also has a ton of other cool SEO features, including a Link Intersect tool similar to the one offered by Ahrefs. This lets you see which domains link to competitors but not your site. Pricing starts at $99 per month, making it premium link building software. You can use limited versions of many of the tools for free if you sign up, and Moz also offers a generous 30-day trial so you can test out the software. 11) Google Disavow Links Tool Your link building strategy should include an element of link management. This is to ensure that your site isn’t attracting too many spammy links. There are many reasons why your site may have spammy links. For example: If you built your site on a domain that was previously used for another website it may still have low-quality links pointing to it. A competitor may have directed spammy links to your site to trick Google into giving you a penalty. You may have used a poor quality link building agency and now you want to remove the links they built. If you previously dabbled in black hat link building but have decided to clean up your link profile. Whatever your reason, you may benefit from telling Google to ignore these links. Doing so is easy. Just upload a CSV file with a list of domains you want to ignore to the disavow links tool. Google will typically process your link removal request within a few weeks. To do this, you’ll need to find out which sites are linking to you. Get this information by heading to Google Search Console, clicking “Links,” then “External links.” From here, you can see a file with all the domains that link to your site. Choose the domains you want to disavow, and then create a CSV document with these URLs. An easier option is to use a tool such as SEM Rush (more on that below) to analyze your link profile and spot low-quality links. The tool will then help you create a CSV file that you can upload to Google. Be aware that disavowing links is an advanced SEO practice. If Google’s algorithm hasn’t yet flagged the links as spammy, you may even see a reduction in your rankings by doing it. You should only use this tactic if you are sure the links are likely to affect your site negatively. 12) SEMrush SEMrush is an all-inclusive SEO tool with features similar to Ahrefs and Moz, as well as plenty of unique tools. These include advanced features relevant to building links, such as: Backlink Analytics: This lets you compare your backlink profile to your competitors to spot new outreach targets. Link Building Tool: This collects link building opportunities for your website. You can then create templates and send emails from within the software. Backlink Audit: This tool analyzes your backlink profile and alerts you to links that may harm your site. You can then send emails to site owners asking them to remove the links from within the tool, or create a disavow file to send to Google. We like how SEMrush has an integrated email outreach tool. This is especially useful if you don’t have access to dedicated software like Mailshake or Pitchbox. SEMrush also has strong keyword research capabilities that can help with SEO and paid ads. Pricing starts at $99.95 per month and goes up to $399 for the all-inclusive plan. You can grab a free seven-day trial to test out the service’s functionality. 13) Google Alerts Google Alerts is a super useful tool for a very specific type of link building: namely, unlinked mentions. This is a strategy whereby you find websites that have written about your brand but not provided a link. If you spot when this happens, you can reach out to the website owner and ask them to link to your site. They will often be willing to do so. It’s a simple form of link prospecting. The hard part is finding a way to discover unlinked mentions quickly. This is where Google Alerts comes in. Just head to the page and set up an alert for your brand name. Whenever someone mentions your company, Google will send you an email. You can then check the webpage to see if it links to your site. If it doesn’t, just reach out to the editor asking for a link. You can also set up alerts for your competitors or even your product category. Setting up alerts for competitors can help you spot sites that may also be willing to link to you, while product alerts can highlight websites that cover your niche. This is especially useful if you work in a relatively small industry and you want to build relationships with those who cover it. Creating Google Alerts is free and easy to do. You can even customize the alerts based on language, region, and how often you want to receive emails. If your brand is well known and receives a lot of mentions, you can tell Google to show you only the best results. Ahrefs’ premium plan has a similar alerts feature. If you are a subscriber, you can use it either alongside or instead of Google’s tool. 14) Check My Links Check My Links is one of the best link building tools to help you find broken links. This involves searching for broken links on relevant domains and asking the site owner to replace the dead link with one to a similar page on your site. You can use this strategy to build links to any type of page. Although, we find it works best with resources such as tools or statistics pages. Site owners typically link to tools when they are useful to readers and so broken links can negatively affect the experience of using the site. Meanwhile, statistics pages are often referenced to give an article authority. If the link is broken, people may be less likely to trust the statistic. While the strategy is simple, actually finding a link that’s broken isn’t. That’s where Check My Links comes in handy. The tool is a browser add on for Chrome. Just head to the Chrome Store page to install it. Once you add Check My Links to your browser, head to the page you want to check and click on the icon. The tool will then start checking all the links on a page. It will highlight broken links in red and good links in green. To be honest, it doesn’t have much use beyond finding broken links on a page, but it does a great job at it. It’s also completely free and very easy to use. If you want to use a broken link building campaign in your strategy, then give Check My Links a look. 15) Linkody All the link building tools we’ve featured so far help you improve your backlink profile. But you also need a way to track your efforts. Linkody is a great way to do that, and it's one of the leading backlink monitoring tools. The software provides transparency over the results of your link building campaign. It keeps track of crucial metrics such as: DA. Spam score. Link anchor text. Page authority. You can create reports showing each of these details. The benefit of this is that you can check what is working and make adjustments to the things that aren’t. You can also ensure that your link building efforts appear natural and aren’t increasing your spam score. The tool also has plenty of regular link building features. For example, you can easily discover which domains are linking to a website. Use this to check out competing sites. You can even set up alerts that will tell you as soon as the software notices a competitor has a new link. Linkody will also help you create a disavow file that you can upload to Google to avoid penalties due to spammy links. Perhaps the biggest reason to get Linkody is its price. The cheapest plan starts at just $14.90 per month ($11.20 if you sign up for a year) and it allows you to monitor two domains. This price is much cheaper than the likes of Ahrefs and Moz, meaning the tool is a great option if your budget won’t stretch to these premium link building tools. You can even sign up to a generous 30-day free trial to test out the software. 16) Monitor Backlinks Monitor Backlinks is a software suite that does exactly what it says on the tin: it monitors your website’s (and your competitors’) backlinks. This means it shares many features of other link building tools on the list. For example, you can see who is linking to you and your competitors and disavow spammy links. One feature we particularly like is the lost link checker. This alerts you as soon as a site removes a link to your website. You can use this to ensure that you keep all links you pay for. Or, in the case of organic links, you could contact the webmaster to see if there was a reason they stopped pointing to your site. The tool also tracks your keyword rankings to help you measure your campaign. While Monitor Backlinks doesn’t have as many link building features as the likes of Moz and Ahrefs, it is much cheaper, and some people may prefer its simplicity. Pricing starts at $25 per month to monitor your domain and two of your competitors. Link Building Software Makes Your Campaign More Efficient Link building tools are exceptionally useful when it comes to creating effective campaigns.

Of course, with access to the best link building software, you still need to put a lot of effort into your campaign.

A base subscription is just $49, which is half the price of the cheapest Ahrefs plan. 7) Mailshake Mailshake simplifies outreach campaigns by helping users send mass personalized emails. You can then send follow-up sequences based on interaction. This can save a ton of time. Trust us, as a link building service, we know the efficiency benefits of automated campaigns. One way Mailshake stands out is by offering pre-made templates for use in different types of link building campaigns. There are optimized emails available for: Broken link building. Guest posting. Link requests. PR pitches. Content promotion. And more. Mailshake has plenty of uses beyond link building. Features such as the virtual phone dialer make it great for sales outreach. If you also deal with sales at your company, trying Mailshake is a no-brainer. The software will also analyze your email copy to help improve engagement and deliverability. You can try this out via the free tool on the Mailshake website. Mailshake is also simple to get to grips with. The interface is user-friendly and you can easily upload all your contacts from a spreadsheet. The tool starts at $59 per user per month, which is affordable if you do a lot of link building outreach. However, you’ll have to pay more for some of the advanced features like the phone dialer. 8) Buzzstream Buzzstream is link building software that helps with outreach. It's similar to Pitchbox, but not quite as expensive (or powerful). The first thing it does is help you find email addresses. You can search from within the platform to find contact details for relevant sites. Or you can upload a CSV file with a list of websites in your niche — like the one produced by our tool above — and the software will automatically find contact information. You then send email campaigns from within the dashboard and there are templates you can use to help. You can also schedule automatic follow-ups to improve your campaign’s efficiency. We especially like Buzzstream’s in-depth reporting features. The tool uses data from around the web to provide information such as: The Domain Authority (DA) of the websites you are contacting. The number of followers a site has. Whether the site has promoted your website in the past. Whether your team has had previous contact with anyone at the site. This allows you to create high priority segments of outreach targets based on metrics such as the quality of the website or the likeliness of them giving you a link. This ensures you don’t waste time on contacts that are unlikely to result in a link. Just choose the most relevant metrics. For example: Segment one: Websites with a DA of over 60 that someone on your team has had previous contact with. Segment two: Websites with a DA of 50 plus that have previously placed one of your posts. Pricing is another benefit of Buzzstream. The most basic plan starts at just $24 per month, making it an affordable option for small businesses. Plans go up to $299 per month for six users. 9) HARO HARO is a platform that connects journalists with sources. It is an essential part of any link building campaign because you typically get a backlink when a writer chooses you as a source. Journalists from many DR 80+ websites use HARO, which makes it a great way to attract high authority links — if you have a good strategy. To start building links with HARO, head to the website, sign up as a source, and choose your areas of expertise. HARO will then send you daily emails with relevant requests. Just search through the emails to find requests you are well-positioned to answer. Each request contains a summary of the story and further instructions. You can see an example in the screenshot below. The downside to HARO is that website owners know it is a great way to get links, which means competition can be intense. That’s why you must know the key to a good response. This includes: Replying fast: Journalists are typically in a hurry; you want to be one of the first responses they read. Keep responses concise: Only include the most essential details. Be quotable. You need to write in a way that makes it easy for the journalist to add your response to their article. A great thing about HARO is that it’s free to sign up as a source. As long as you have the time to craft quality responses, it’s a great way to get links. If you don’t have the time, you could always try out our HARO link building service. Several other platforms offer similar services to HARO: ResponseSource is a UK based media requests platform. SourceBottle is another similar service that helps sources connect with journalists. Businesses can create an expert profile for $25 per month which SourceBottle will promote to journalists looking for sources. Qwoted provides experts and PR professionals with access to journalists and source requests. It includes more advanced features than HARO, such as in-app messaging and the ability to see how many responses a request has. 10) MOZ MOZ is a tool with features that cover many aspects of SEO — from keyword research to competitor analysis, and more. The most useful tool for link building is its Link Explorer. This shows you which sites link to a domain or URL. You also get access to other important metrics such as keywords and Domain Authority. Use this information to reverse engineer your competitor’s backlink profile. Consider reaching out to the sites that link to your competitors to see if they will also link to you. Another cool feature is the Spam Score. If you’re worried about your own site’s backlink profile, put your URL into the Link Explorer to see whether you have too many low-quality links. If you do, consider telling Google to ignore the links to reduce your chances of being penalized by the algorithm. We go into further detail about how to do this in the section below. Moz also has a ton of other cool SEO features, including a Link Intersect tool similar to the one offered by Ahrefs. This lets you see which domains link to competitors but not your site. Pricing starts at $99 per month, making it premium link building software. You can use limited versions of many of the tools for free if you sign up, and Moz also offers a generous 30-day trial so you can test out the software. 11) Google Disavow Links Tool Your link building strategy should include an element of link management. This is to ensure that your site isn’t attracting too many spammy links. There are many reasons why your site may have spammy links. For example: If you built your site on a domain that was previously used for another website it may still have low-quality links pointing to it. A competitor may have directed spammy links to your site to trick Google into giving you a penalty. You may have used a poor quality link building agency and now you want to remove the links they built. If you previously dabbled in black hat link building but have decided to clean up your link profile. Whatever your reason, you may benefit from telling Google to ignore these links. Doing so is easy. Just upload a CSV file with a list of domains you want to ignore to the disavow links tool. Google will typically process your link removal request within a few weeks. To do this, you’ll need to find out which sites are linking to you. Get this information by heading to Google Search Console, clicking “Links,” then “External links.” From here, you can see a file with all the domains that link to your site. Choose the domains you want to disavow, and then create a CSV document with these URLs. An easier option is to use a tool such as SEM Rush (more on that below) to analyze your link profile and spot low-quality links. The tool will then help you create a CSV file that you can upload to Google. Be aware that disavowing links is an advanced SEO practice. If Google’s algorithm hasn’t yet flagged the links as spammy, you may even see a reduction in your rankings by doing it. You should only use this tactic if you are sure the links are likely to affect your site negatively. 12) SEMrush SEMrush is an all-inclusive SEO tool with features similar to Ahrefs and Moz, as well as plenty of unique tools. These include advanced features relevant to building links, such as: Backlink Analytics: This lets you compare your backlink profile to your competitors to spot new outreach targets. Link Building Tool: This collects link building opportunities for your website. You can then create templates and send emails from within the software. Backlink Audit: This tool analyzes your backlink profile and alerts you to links that may harm your site. You can then send emails to site owners asking them to remove the links from within the tool, or create a disavow file to send to Google. We like how SEMrush has an integrated email outreach tool. This is especially useful if you don’t have access to dedicated software like Mailshake or Pitchbox. SEMrush also has strong keyword research capabilities that can help with SEO and paid ads. Pricing starts at $99.95 per month and goes up to $399 for the all-inclusive plan. You can grab a free seven-day trial to test out the service’s functionality. 13) Google Alerts Google Alerts is a super useful tool for a very specific type of link building: namely, unlinked mentions. This is a strategy whereby you find websites that have written about your brand but not provided a link. If you spot when this happens, you can reach out to the website owner and ask them to link to your site. They will often be willing to do so. It’s a simple form of link prospecting. The hard part is finding a way to discover unlinked mentions quickly. This is where Google Alerts comes in. Just head to the page and set up an alert for your brand name. Whenever someone mentions your company, Google will send you an email. You can then check the webpage to see if it links to your site. If it doesn’t, just reach out to the editor asking for a link. You can also set up alerts for your competitors or even your product category. Setting up alerts for competitors can help you spot sites that may also be willing to link to you, while product alerts can highlight websites that cover your niche. This is especially useful if you work in a relatively small industry and you want to build relationships with those who cover it. Creating Google Alerts is free and easy to do. You can even customize the alerts based on language, region, and how often you want to receive emails. If your brand is well known and receives a lot of mentions, you can tell Google to show you only the best results. Ahrefs’ premium plan has a similar alerts feature. If you are a subscriber, you can use it either alongside or instead of Google’s tool. 14) Check My Links Check My Links is one of the best link building tools to help you find broken links. This involves searching for broken links on relevant domains and asking the site owner to replace the dead link with one to a similar page on your site. You can use this strategy to build links to any type of page. Although, we find it works best with resources such as tools or statistics pages. Site owners typically link to tools when they are useful to readers and so broken links can negatively affect the experience of using the site. Meanwhile, statistics pages are often referenced to give an article authority. If the link is broken, people may be less likely to trust the statistic. While the strategy is simple, actually finding a link that’s broken isn’t. That’s where Check My Links comes in handy. The tool is a browser add on for Chrome. Just head to the Chrome Store page to install it. Once you add Check My Links to your browser, head to the page you want to check and click on the icon. The tool will then start checking all the links on a page. It will highlight broken links in red and good links in green. To be honest, it doesn’t have much use beyond finding broken links on a page, but it does a great job at it. It’s also completely free and very easy to use. If you want to use a broken link building campaign in your strategy, then give Check My Links a look. 15) Linkody All the link building tools we’ve featured so far help you improve your backlink profile. But you also need a way to track your efforts. Linkody is a great way to do that, and it's one of the leading backlink monitoring tools. The software provides transparency over the results of your link building campaign. It keeps track of crucial metrics such as: DA. Spam score. Link anchor text. Page authority. You can create reports showing each of these details. The benefit of this is that you can check what is working and make adjustments to the things that aren’t. You can also ensure that your link building efforts appear natural and aren’t increasing your spam score. The tool also has plenty of regular link building features. For example, you can easily discover which domains are linking to a website. Use this to check out competing sites. You can even set up alerts that will tell you as soon as the software notices a competitor has a new link. Linkody will also help you create a disavow file that you can upload to Google to avoid penalties due to spammy links. Perhaps the biggest reason to get Linkody is its price. The cheapest plan starts at just $14.90 per month ($11.20 if you sign up for a year) and it allows you to monitor two domains. This price is much cheaper than the likes of Ahrefs and Moz, meaning the tool is a great option if your budget won’t stretch to these premium link building tools. You can even sign up to a generous 30-day free trial to test out the software. 16) Monitor Backlinks Monitor Backlinks is a software suite that does exactly what it says on the tin: it monitors your website’s (and your competitors’) backlinks. This means it shares many features of other link building tools on the list. For example, you can see who is linking to you and your competitors and disavow spammy links. One feature we particularly like is the lost link checker. This alerts you as soon as a site removes a link to your website. You can use this to ensure that you keep all links you pay for. Or, in the case of organic links, you could contact the webmaster to see if there was a reason they stopped pointing to your site. The tool also tracks your keyword rankings to help you measure your campaign. While Monitor Backlinks doesn’t have as many link building features as the likes of Moz and Ahrefs, it is much cheaper, and some people may prefer its simplicity. Pricing starts at $25 per month to monitor your domain and two of your competitors. Link Building Software Makes Your Campaign More Efficient Link building tools are exceptionally useful when it comes to creating effective campaigns. At Linkbuilder we use many of these tools day-to-day as part of an effective link building machine. Of course, with access to the best link building software, you still need to put a lot of effort into your campaign. Think of them more as a way to work effectively, rather than a way to not have to work. If you’d rather a more hands-off approach, then you’ll need a link building agency. At Linkbuilder we provide a variety of link building services that get you links you need to build your site.

In fact, I’ve used these exact tools to get backlinks from sites like Entrepreneur.com: And even Forbes: With that, it’s time to reveal my favorite link-building and outreach tools. 1. Semrush World’s fastest backlink discovery platform. Semrush is my go-to tool for all things SEO. Including link building. What makes Semrush unique is the quality of its backlinks data. Apart from links, Semrush also has a TON of other features like: A solid Keyword research tool On-page SEO checker Position tracking Content optimization tool Their interface is clean and easy to navigate through all their tools. Pricing: $139.95-$499.95 per month My favorite feature: Link Building Tool Semrush comes with a built-in outreach tool. You can find prospects, prepare your outreach sequence, and track your campaigns in minutes. It also keeps a tab on your backlinks and notifies you if they’re removed. If you want to learn more about other features of Semrush, check out my Semrush guide. The bottom line If you can only invest in one link building tool, it should be Semrush. Find all of your backlinks Explore the largest, fastest, and freshest backlink management tool. Analyze 2. Pitchbox Use workflows that walk you through the outreach process. Pitchbox is an outreach platform built for advanced link builders. Once you start a campaign, it walks you through all the steps to find prospects and grab contact info. What’s neat about Pitchbox is that several people can participate in the same campaign. For example, you can delegate specific team members to ONLY compose emails and others – ONLY to personalize them. Pricing: $550-$1500 per month (annual commitment) My Favorite Feature: Metrics Filters This feature helps filter your results by specific quality metrics. You can filter by Majestic Citation Flow & Trust Flow, and Moz metrics (Page Authority and Domain Authority). The Bottom line Pitchbox combines “easy to use” and “powerful features” into a single piece of link building software. It is not the cheapest tool out there, but I highly recommend it if you have a large outreach team. Read More: 9 Best SEO Software Tools (Trusted by 7-Figure Agencies) 3. Respona Full-suite link building outreach platform. Respona is a powerful link building outreach platform. There are LOTS of pre-built campaigns to choose from. A few of my favorites are: Skyscraper Technique – you input competitor articles, they give you a list of URLs linking to them. Product Review – you input competitor domains, they give you a list of blogs that recently reviewed them. Guest Post – you input topics, they give you a list of websites accepting guest posts. Podcast Outreach – you input a person in your industry, they give you all the podcasts they’ve been featured on. Resource pages – you input keywords, they give you top resource listicles on those topics. Once you choose a template, it walks you through the entire process – from finding high-quality opportunities and getting contact info to sending personalized emails. Pricing: $99-$399 per month My favorite feature: Automated contact finder Respona automatically finds the right person for each website – including their verified email and Linkedin profile. No more reaching out to support emails. The bottom line Respona is a powerful link building platform for agencies and in-house teams. Its automation features save a ton of time while running outreach campaigns at scale. 4. Buzzstream Keep track of your relationships. BuzzStream is an outreach CRM that helps you stay organized with link building. Instead of spreadsheets and random Gmail inboxes, you can use BuzzStream to track conversations and manage campaigns across multiple projects. Arguably the best feature of the entire platform is the Buzzmarker Chrome extension. It automatically scans the site you’re on for any email address or contact page. Pricing: $24-$999 per month My Favorite Feature: Custom Fields I view custom fields as the bread and butter of BuzzStream. They let you organize and customize campaigns in any way you want. My favorite custom field is the Relationship Stage. It means: “what is our current status with that person?” BuzzStream has many other cool features I didn’t have room to cover here. But if you want to learn more, I recommend reading my BuzzStream review. The bottom line BuzzStream is one of my favorite link building CRMs. If you do a lot of outreach or work with a team of link builders, it can help you keep track of your outreach. 5. Hunter Find accurate email addresses in seconds. After trying over 25 different tools for finding contact info, I can confidently say that Hunter.io is one of the best. It’s lightning-fast, and the contact info you get from it is insanely accurate. That’s because Hunter doesn’t just scrape a single website for email addresses. Instead, it pulls data from several different sources. Pricing: Free-$399 per month My Favorite Feature: Email Verification Hunter automatically verifies each email that it gives you: That way, you know the inbox is still active BEFORE you hit “send.” (You can also bulk upload email addresses for verification.) The bottom line When it comes to finding email addresses for outreach, it’s hard to beat Hunter’s accuracy. 6. HARO (Help A Reporter Out) Get featured in upcoming news articles. HARO is the PR industry’s version of Tinder. You can connect with bloggers and journalists who need sources while getting links and exposure for yourself. How does it work? Once you register as a source, HARO sends you daily emails with dozens of questions from writers needing expert insights. For example: I saw a question from a writer asking: “What’s the difference between graphic design and web design?” So I responded with this pitch: A few days later, I got this link from an education site (76 authority score). Not too bad. Pricing: Free – $149/month. My favorite feature: Head Start Time is of the essence when responding to HARO questions. Your pitch is much more likely to be seen if you’re among the first respondents. “Head Start” (paid feature) notifies you of press opportunities before everyone else. The bottom line HARO is one of the best ways to build high-authority backlinks at scale. 7. Buzzsumo Discover influential bloggers in your niche. Even though BuzzSumo is designed for content marketing, many SEO pros use it too. Here’s how: First, BuzzSumo makes it easy to create content that people WANT to link to. Second, you can use BuzzSumo to find influencers in your niche that recently shared your competitor’s content: (Which means they’re likely to share your stuff… and link to it.) Pricing: $119-$999 per month. My Favorite Feature: Brand Mentions Think of Buzzsumo’s “Brand Mentions” as Google Alerts on steroids. You can create a brand alert for you and your competitors. And it’ll show you new blogs and news articles that mention your brand. You can also filter mentions without links: Easy peasy. Buzzsumo offers a ton of other features than what I covered here. If you’re looking to learn more, I suggest reading my guide to Buzzsumo. The bottom line Sure, BuzzSumo isn’t designed for link building. But as you just saw, you can still use it to get white-hat links to your site. Recommended. 8. Ahrefs Backlink data is powered by one of the world’s most active crawlers. Ahrefs is a link building software designed for SEO pros. Much like Semrush, it also has a lot of features that have nothing to do with link building, like: Keyword research tool Content Explorer (similar to BuzzSumo) Rank tracking Technical SEO site audit If you’re having a hard time deciding between Ahrefs and Semrush, check out my detailed comparison guide. Pricing: $99-$999 per month My Favorite Feature: Content Explorer Ahrefs content explorer is a mini search engine for link builders. For example, here’s a search I run every month to find mentions of Backlinko: Then I use the “highlight unlinked mentions” to filter the sites that have never linked to me: Here’s an example: In my experience, a friendly “can you please link to us?” email can turn those unlinked brand mentions into legit backlinks: The bottom line Ahrefs is the go-to SEO tool for pros. It’s a solid alternative to Semrush if you don’t mind the more complicated interface. 9. Moz Link Explorer Reverse engineer your competitor’s backlinks. Moz Link Explorer is the flagship feature of Moz Pro. Let me show you how it works. First, you pop a competitor’s domain (or specific URL) into it: And you can see all of their backlinks: You also get link metrics, like the site’s Domain Authority: Pricing: $99-$599 per month My Favorite Feature: Anchor Text Analysis Quickly see the most common anchor text in a site’s backlink profile: Why is this helpful? Well, if you see lots of exact-match anchor text, that’s usually a sign of black hat link building. The bottom line Moz Link Explorer is the third-best link analysis tool on the market. That said, a Moz subscription comes with several other tools (like an on-page grader) that can make the investment worthwhile. 10. Majestic Link analysis on a budget. Majestic is yet another backlink analysis tool. It has the features you’d expect… like the number of backlinks, referring domains, and anchor text analysis. Pricing: $49-$399 per month My Favorite Feature: Topical Trust Flow This metric measures how many links a site has from a set of highly-trusted “seed” websites. (It’s basically Majestic’s version of TrustRank.) I recommend checking out my Majestic review if you want an in-depth overview. The bottom line Majestic SEO has a massive link database. But the UX is ancient and hard to use. That said, you definitely get your money’s worth at $50/month. Bonus: Google Find link building prospects for free. Okay, this one isn’t a tool in the same sense as other items on this list. But good ‘ol Google has the world’s largest index of websites – making it a gold mine of link-building opportunities. Pricing: Free My Favorite Feature: advanced search operators Google search operators give superpowers to your searches. Here are the most useful operators for link building: “inurl:” – only returns results with specific words/phrases in the URL. “intext:” – specifies keywords or phrases mentioned in the content. “intitle:” – same as intext, but only applies to the results’ titles. For example: SEO inurl:resources It returns resource pages about SEO, where you can pitch your content to be included. Like this one: Very cool. The bottom line Google search operators are the easiest way to find link building opportunities. Any Tools That I Missed? Those are my top 10 link building tools. The question is: How do you choose the best one for you? Here’s a quick checklist to help you decide: “What budget do I have to work with?” – If you’re so shoestring that you can’t afford shoestrings, Google searches are always free. That said, outreach tools usually make the process faster and more efficient. “How many people need to use the tool?” – If you’re the only one who builds links, then you don’t need to worry about user accounts and features designed for teams. But if you do outreach with a team, tools like Semrush or Respona are a must. “How many links can I see?” – Backlink analysis tools like Semrush, Moz, and Ahrefs give you the most competitor link data. Others might be cheaper… but you get what you pay for. “How important is reporting?” – Are you reporting to clients? If so, detailed (and nice-looking) reporting features can be massively helpful.

In fact, I’ve used these exact tools to get backlinks from sites like Entrepreneur.com: And even Forbes: With that, it’s time to reveal my favorite link-building and outreach tools. 1. Semrush World’s fastest backlink discovery platform. Semrush is my go-to tool for all things SEO. Including link building. What makes Semrush unique is the quality of its backlinks data. Apart from links, Semrush also has a TON of other features like: A solid Keyword research tool On-page SEO checker Position tracking Content optimization tool Their interface is clean and easy to navigate through all their tools. Pricing: $139.95-$499.95 per month My favorite feature: Link Building Tool Semrush comes with a built-in outreach tool. You can find prospects, prepare your outreach sequence, and track your campaigns in minutes. It also keeps a tab on your backlinks and notifies you if they’re removed. If you want to learn more about other features of Semrush, check out my Semrush guide. The bottom line If you can only invest in one link building tool, it should be Semrush. Find all of your backlinks Explore the largest, fastest, and freshest backlink management tool. Analyze 2. Pitchbox Use workflows that walk you through the outreach process. Pitchbox is an outreach platform built for advanced link builders. Once you start a campaign, it walks you through all the steps to find prospects and grab contact info. What’s neat about Pitchbox is that several people can participate in the same campaign. For example, you can delegate specific team members to ONLY compose emails and others – ONLY to personalize them. Pricing: $550-$1500 per month (annual commitment) My Favorite Feature: Metrics Filters This feature helps filter your results by specific quality metrics. You can filter by Majestic Citation Flow & Trust Flow, and Moz metrics (Page Authority and Domain Authority). The Bottom line Pitchbox combines “easy to use” and “powerful features” into a single piece of link building software. It is not the cheapest tool out there, but I highly recommend it if you have a large outreach team. Read More: 9 Best SEO Software Tools (Trusted by 7-Figure Agencies) 3. Respona Full-suite link building outreach platform. Respona is a powerful link building outreach platform. There are LOTS of pre-built campaigns to choose from. A few of my favorites are: Skyscraper Technique – you input competitor articles, they give you a list of URLs linking to them. Product Review – you input competitor domains, they give you a list of blogs that recently reviewed them. Guest Post – you input topics, they give you a list of websites accepting guest posts. Podcast Outreach – you input a person in your industry, they give you all the podcasts they’ve been featured on. Resource pages – you input keywords, they give you top resource listicles on those topics. Once you choose a template, it walks you through the entire process – from finding high-quality opportunities and getting contact info to sending personalized emails. Pricing: $99-$399 per month My favorite feature: Automated contact finder Respona automatically finds the right person for each website – including their verified email and Linkedin profile. No more reaching out to support emails. The bottom line Respona is a powerful link building platform for agencies and in-house teams. Its automation features save a ton of time while running outreach campaigns at scale. 4. Buzzstream Keep track of your relationships. BuzzStream is an outreach CRM that helps you stay organized with link building. Instead of spreadsheets and random Gmail inboxes, you can use BuzzStream to track conversations and manage campaigns across multiple projects. Arguably the best feature of the entire platform is the Buzzmarker Chrome extension. It automatically scans the site you’re on for any email address or contact page. Pricing: $24-$999 per month My Favorite Feature: Custom Fields I view custom fields as the bread and butter of BuzzStream. They let you organize and customize campaigns in any way you want. My favorite custom field is the Relationship Stage. It means: “what is our current status with that person?” BuzzStream has many other cool features I didn’t have room to cover here. But if you want to learn more, I recommend reading my BuzzStream review. The bottom line BuzzStream is one of my favorite link building CRMs. If you do a lot of outreach or work with a team of link builders, it can help you keep track of your outreach. 5. Hunter Find accurate email addresses in seconds. After trying over 25 different tools for finding contact info, I can confidently say that Hunter.io is one of the best. It’s lightning-fast, and the contact info you get from it is insanely accurate. That’s because Hunter doesn’t just scrape a single website for email addresses. Instead, it pulls data from several different sources. Pricing: Free-$399 per month My Favorite Feature: Email Verification Hunter automatically verifies each email that it gives you: That way, you know the inbox is still active BEFORE you hit “send.” (You can also bulk upload email addresses for verification.) The bottom line When it comes to finding email addresses for outreach, it’s hard to beat Hunter’s accuracy. 6. HARO (Help A Reporter Out) Get featured in upcoming news articles. HARO is the PR industry’s version of Tinder. You can connect with bloggers and journalists who need sources while getting links and exposure for yourself. How does it work? Once you register as a source, HARO sends you daily emails with dozens of questions from writers needing expert insights. For example: I saw a question from a writer asking: “What’s the difference between graphic design and web design?” So I responded with this pitch: A few days later, I got this link from an education site (76 authority score). Not too bad. Pricing: Free – $149/month. My favorite feature: Head Start Time is of the essence when responding to HARO questions. Your pitch is much more likely to be seen if you’re among the first respondents. “Head Start” (paid feature) notifies you of press opportunities before everyone else. The bottom line HARO is one of the best ways to build high-authority backlinks at scale. 7. Buzzsumo Discover influential bloggers in your niche. Even though BuzzSumo is designed for content marketing, many SEO pros use it too. Here’s how: First, BuzzSumo makes it easy to create content that people WANT to link to. Second, you can use BuzzSumo to find influencers in your niche that recently shared your competitor’s content: (Which means they’re likely to share your stuff… and link to it.) Pricing: $119-$999 per month. My Favorite Feature: Brand Mentions Think of Buzzsumo’s “Brand Mentions” as Google Alerts on steroids. You can create a brand alert for you and your competitors. And it’ll show you new blogs and news articles that mention your brand. You can also filter mentions without links: Easy peasy. Buzzsumo offers a ton of other features than what I covered here. If you’re looking to learn more, I suggest reading my guide to Buzzsumo. The bottom line Sure, BuzzSumo isn’t designed for link building. But as you just saw, you can still use it to get white-hat links to your site. Recommended. 8. Ahrefs Backlink data is powered by one of the world’s most active crawlers. Ahrefs is a link building software designed for SEO pros. Much like Semrush, it also has a lot of features that have nothing to do with link building, like: Keyword research tool Content Explorer (similar to BuzzSumo) Rank tracking Technical SEO site audit If you’re having a hard time deciding between Ahrefs and Semrush, check out my detailed comparison guide. Pricing: $99-$999 per month My Favorite Feature: Content Explorer Ahrefs content explorer is a mini search engine for link builders. For example, here’s a search I run every month to find mentions of Backlinko: Then I use the “highlight unlinked mentions” to filter the sites that have never linked to me: Here’s an example: In my experience, a friendly “can you please link to us?” email can turn those unlinked brand mentions into legit backlinks: The bottom line Ahrefs is the go-to SEO tool for pros. It’s a solid alternative to Semrush if you don’t mind the more complicated interface. 9. Moz Link Explorer Reverse engineer your competitor’s backlinks. Moz Link Explorer is the flagship feature of Moz Pro. Let me show you how it works. First, you pop a competitor’s domain (or specific URL) into it: And you can see all of their backlinks: You also get link metrics, like the site’s Domain Authority: Pricing: $99-$599 per month My Favorite Feature: Anchor Text Analysis Quickly see the most common anchor text in a site’s backlink profile: Why is this helpful? Well, if you see lots of exact-match anchor text, that’s usually a sign of black hat link building. The bottom line Moz Link Explorer is the third-best link analysis tool on the market. That said, a Moz subscription comes with several other tools (like an on-page grader) that can make the investment worthwhile. 10. Majestic Link analysis on a budget. Majestic is yet another backlink analysis tool. It has the features you’d expect… like the number of backlinks, referring domains, and anchor text analysis. Pricing: $49-$399 per month My Favorite Feature: Topical Trust Flow This metric measures how many links a site has from a set of highly-trusted “seed” websites. (It’s basically Majestic’s version of TrustRank.) I recommend checking out my Majestic review if you want an in-depth overview. The bottom line Majestic SEO has a massive link database. But the UX is ancient and hard to use. That said, you definitely get your money’s worth at $50/month. Bonus: Google Find link building prospects for free. Okay, this one isn’t a tool in the same sense as other items on this list. But good ‘ol Google has the world’s largest index of websites – making it a gold mine of link-building opportunities.

Others might be cheaper… but you get what you pay for. “How important is reporting?” – Are you reporting to clients? If so, detailed (and nice-looking) reporting features can be massively helpful.

Take the time to learn about the person you’re contacting and their website. Use their name, mention a specific article or section that caught your eye, and show them why your content is a perfect match. Here’s an example: “Hey [Name]! I couldn’t help but notice your awesome post about CBD benefits. It’s like a match made in heaven with the article we just published on CBD oil’s health perks.

Building Strong Relationships Link outreach isn’t a one-and-done deal. It’s about building genuine connections that last. Before sending that outreach email, take some time to interact with potential link partners on social media. Leave thoughtful comments on their posts, share their content, and show them you’re a real person who appreciates their work. It’s like laying the groundwork for a beautiful friendship. Focus on creating valuable content for your target audience and irresistible to potential partners. Offer to write guest posts that their readers will love. Be on the lookout for opportunities to exchange links or collaborate with the big players in your industry.

You ever heard about it? It’s the kind of thing that makes your head spin faster than a bar stool after a couple of drinks.

I mean, sure, you can use a tool like GetMoreBacklinks and watch the backlinks roll in, but it’s not all rainbows and butterflies. You gotta know the ins and outs, or you might end up knee-deep in a mess of low-quality links. Ever tried this? You might want to think twice if you haven’t. # The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly When it comes to automated link building, let’s break it down into three categories: the good, the bad, and the downright ugly. First, the good: Automated link building can save you a ton of time. Imagine this—you’re out enjoying a night out or, heck, even sleeping, and your automated tool is out there hustling for those coveted backlinks. With platforms like GetMoreBacklinks, you can obtain backlinks quickly and with minimal effort. However, the level of quality can vary significantly, and it’s essential to do your due diligence. Now, onto the bad: Not all backlinks are created equal, my friend. You could end up with links from sites that are about as reputable as that one friend who always borrows money but never pays it back. If you're relying solely on automation, you could inadvertently harm your SEO instead of helping it. Think of it like ordering a pizza and getting a salad—you’re not gonna be satisfied. And then there’s the ugly: Ever heard of Google’s algorithms? They’re like that bouncer at the bar who decides who gets in and who gets",
