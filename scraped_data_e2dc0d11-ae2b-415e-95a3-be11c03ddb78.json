The idea being crosslisting is to increase your exposure and target a niche audience when you might not otherwise have access to it. But there are some pitfalls, so here’s what you need to know before trying this approach for yourself. What exactly is crosslisting? Crosslisting (also known as crossposting) refers to selling the same products through different channels or venues to reach more potential customers who may not be able to find out about your business any other way. You can do this by copying all your listings from one marketplace over to another or using a tool like Crosslister that automatically lists to several marketplaces, including Depop, Etsy, and eBay OR You can do this manually. You’ll see many sellers in the e-Commerce space turn to crosslisting tools when they first start out because it’s easier than listing from scratch. In many cases, all you have to do is enter your product title and description into a template copy-paste images from one site onto another. Why should you crosslist/crosspost? Selling on multiple platforms is almost always a good idea. If your sales from one platform decrease, you can rely more heavily on revenue made through other outlets to make up for it. So here are 5 really good reasons why you should crosslist on various marketplaces to maximize your exposure. These are common questions raised when beginning a discussion about crossposting – how does it benefit me, should I do it? 1. Crosslisting can introduce you to new audiences Sellers who use only one platform might not be tapping into all the potential buyers there are. By crossposting your listings to multiple platforms, you can reach a wider audience than would otherwise be difficult. 2. Crosslisting presents the opportunity for more targeted selling! Let’s say you have different products or services in each marketplace that cater to different markets. Listing to different marketplaces allows you to put the right item in front of the right people, which leads to more sales in the long term. Each reselling app is different, and buyers on different apps want and expect different things. You can read our comparison on some reselling apps: Etsy vs Depop Poshmark vs Depop Vinted vs Depop 3. Crosslisting can increase your SEO performance & Brand Recognition Each marketplace has its own search algorithm, for example the etsy algorithm is quite different from the depop algorithm. How ever there is one unifying search engine! We’re sure you’ve heard of it’s a small startup that rhymes with poodle 😉 GOOGLE! Crossposting across multiple platforms helps create many listings available to be indexed by the search engines. The more listings you have being indexed by google the higher the chances are that someone will search for something on google (or bing, duckduckgo etc.) will end up on one of your listings. Using a well-designed crosslisting strategy will help you rank on the first page for popular keywords and phrases that are used by potential customers while searching the Internet. Additionally, when someone searches up your brand name instead of the search results being a ghost town you have lots of search results that are relevant to your business, this helps a customer trust that they are dealing with a genuine business! 4. Crosslisting can make your reseller life easier in the long term If you want to ensure success for your business, building a strong reputation is essential. By crossposting on multiple marketplaces, you will have increased exposure while helping to improve the overall perception of your brand. A strong reputation can lead to higher conversions and more positive reviews. Crosslisting allows you to have more peace of mind, knowing that slow sales on one marketplace will not kill 100% your income is a great feeling. 5. Crosslisting is free This means you have nothing to lose except for your time, which could help you build a solid foundation to grow your reselling business. Which platform should you crosslist to? The first thing to ask yourself is which platforms you want to be on. There are many different options available, and they’re all going to have different potential audiences. You can decide based on what type of product you’re selling. If it’s a fashion item, you might want to target Depop or Poshmark, but if it focuses on handmade or vintage items and craft supplies, you may want to look into Etsy. Figuring out the audience your product will most appeal to can make choosing the best platform much more effortless. Depop Depop is an app that allows users to buy and sell their goods – like discount designer clothing, jewelry, vintage – through curated photo feeds similar to Instagram’s feed of posts by people you follow. Shoppers can find anything from discounted designer clothes to cute handmade trinkets on Depop. Users post photos and descriptions of what they’re selling, along with a price. You might come across some hidden treasures in your search for the perfect birthday gift or unique decor items. Poshmark Poshmark is a go-to app for buying and selling all fashion needs. Users can buy, sell, or just give a second life to their clothes with Poshmark’s social commerce marketplace in three countries: the US, Canada, and Australia. Get a dose of Poshmark tips for your business here. Etsy Etsy is an eCommerce company that allows you to sell handmade or vintage items as well as craft supplies and tools from their online website. On Etsy, people can find a wide array of products such as jewelry, bags, clothing, home décor, and furniture toys art, among other things! If you’re already on Etsy, discover how to increase your Etsy traffic (and sales). eBay eBay is one of the oldest and most successful e-commerce websites on the Internet and king of second-hand goods. It doesn’t sell any items but instead allows users to list their own used goods for sale in online auctions, which other bidders can bid against them until one of them wins with a better offer than anyone else’s first price. Vinted One of the newest ways to make a buck is by selling your unworn clothes. Vinted enables people from all over the world, and in every walk of life, an easy platform to sell (or resell) clothing items with others. Vinted is geared towards people selling their own clothes, large businesses running commercial operations may have a hard time as vinted opposes commercial selling. Mercari Mercari is an app that lets you quickly sell your clothes, electronics, and other items. Sellers can create a listing with photos of the item in question, along with its description and price. Other factors should be considered when deciding which platforms to crosslist on, such as: The type of site/service you want to use – Some sites only accept listings based on certain criteria, so it’s important that you understand how each one operates before deciding where to send your product. Who owns the site/service – Sometimes, it can be more beneficial to crosslink with sites owned by larger companies, making them more likely to send traffic your way. How much traffic the site gets – Knowing how many visitors a platform has can give you an idea of whether or not it will be worthwhile to crosslink there, and if so, for how long. For example, ebay.com is one of the most popular sites on the Internet, with thousands of people visiting every day. However, smaller platforms may not be quite there yet when it comes to traffic. The platform’s reputation – Some sites have good reputations, but others have less than favourable ones!. If you’re unsure about how reputable a site is, then it’s best to steer clear. Even large marketplaces have had and can have lapses in communication with their sellers. There are countless examples of sites having false positives when it comes to moderating content on their platform, leading to lots of sellers being locked out/pushed away Recommendations before crosslisting Before you get started with crosslisting, it’s important to make sure that your product is set up properly so that you can submit it to various platforms. Here are some things you should look at: Your sales page If possible, you should have an optimized sales page in place before sending your product to another marketplace. This will make it much easier to rank for various keywords and get more views in the long run. Your item title Make sure that the item title correctly describes your product and doesn’t contain any extra information such as your business name or website address, which can confuse customers and lead them astray. Your product pictures It’s also a good idea to have multiple high-quality photos of your product so that people can see what they’re buying, along with images on your sales page that show off its features and benefits. Your specifications If you have any details about the weight or dimensions of the item, then it’s best to note them on your sales page. This can be useful for customers looking for more specific details about a product before purchasing. Your prices When putting up the price of your item, it must be as accurate as possible, and you should avoid listing any incorrect information such as discounts or coupons that can confuse your customers. Your shipping times If you’re going to be crosslisting on multiple sites, then it’s best to have awareness about the shipping times in place for all of them so that people are not left hanging if they order something from a particular marketplace. It takes longer than expected to arrive. How do you crosslist to other marketplaces? All right, we already know that crosslisting is a way to increase your visibility, reach, and sales on other marketplaces. There are different ways to do this. If you were to try and copy-paste all of the information from your current marketplace listings into another one, it could take several minutes per listing. If you want to list on Etsy, Mercari, or similar platforms, that would add up at least a half-hour for each listing. The problem with manually copying items to different marketplaces is that you always miss steps and have to correct them later in the process. The quickest way to crosslist on multiple marketplaces is by using a crossposting tool. Simplify your workflow and eliminate work hours each day by crosslisting your items into multiple marketplaces in seconds with the SellerAider Crosslister.

For starters, make sure you are registered on the sites you want to crosslist and have a decent presence on those sites with good ratings, reviews, and more. A bigger audience doesn’t always mean better. You should also keep in mind the target audience of each site and make sure your product or service meets their needs. If it does, then you’re set. There are other things you should keep in mind when crosslisting as well. First, read the information on each site and make sure they allow crosslisting your products. Another thing you should do is not compromise on the quality of other sites just to get more sales, make sure your shop looks well put together! Always remember that crosslisting is about making money as well as giving your potential customers a good experience. If you don’t match buyers’ expectations, they will go elsewhere and leave negative reviews instead of returning.

As the sector continues to grow, one thing has become abundantly clear: in order to successfully sell anything online, you need to sell it on more than one sales channel. While that sounds simple and straightforward in theory, it becomes increasingly more apparent how challenging cross listing can be the deeper your dive into the practical details. How do you avoid selling the same unit twice? How can you ensure that each product listing is perfectly compliant and optimized for every selling channel? How do you decide which items to cross-list and which to list only on certain channels? These challenges only multiply with each item you add to your selection and every sales channel you include in your selling repertoire, making it practically impossible to sell on multiple channels without the help of a good crosslisting app. But choosing the best cross listing app for your selling needs can be challenging, especially when there are just so many crosslisting apps on the market touting themselves as the best app for crosslisting to certain channels or the best crosslisting app for resellers. The truth is that finding the best crosslisting app for your business will depend heavily on your specific crosslisting needs, both now and in the future. In this guide, we'll teach you how to find the best crosslisting app for your unique ecommerce business by helping you understand what to look for in a cross listing app. Keep reading to learn what ecommerce cross listing is, what its benefits are, and how to determine which crosslisting app is the best choice for your selling needs. ‍ What is eCommerce Cross Listing? In ecommerce, the term \"cross listing\" or \"crosslisting\" refers to listing an item on more than one selling channel. The idea behind crosslisting is simple: reach more buyers on more platforms, and raise your chances of a successful sale. Crosslisting is used by virtually all successful ecommerce sellers, no matter on which sales channels they started their online selling journey or what they're selling. The reason for this is that crosslisting works – it's the single simplest way to instantly multiply your pool of potential buyers, raise your brand awareness, and drive sales. ‍ What are the Benefits of Cross Listing? Crosslisting is an incredibly powerful approach to online commerce, with a multitude of benefits that range from better reach to a more robust and resilient ecommerce business. The main benefits of crosslisting include: Increased Visibility and Reach: Crosslisting to new channels allows you to instantly increase the visibility of your listings by getting them in front of new buyers who would never have seen them on their original sales channel. Saved Time and Effort: When done with a crosslisting app, the experience of multichannel selling is closer to running one large store rather than a selection of smaller ones in terms of product data and listing management. That's because crosslisting a product to a new channel is far faster and easier than creating a new product listing from scratch, making for a more efficient listing experience. Diversified Sales Channels: Crosslisting gives you the ability to diversify your sales channels and make your ecommerce business more robust in the face of challenges like account suspensions. If one of your marketplace stores is suspended for review, for example, you don't have to worry about losing your sole revenue stream. ‍ Essential Features to Look for in a Cross-Listing App While the concept of crosslisting is simple, its application is far from, which is why getting the implementation right is essential to successful multichannel cross selling. In other words, choosing the best crosslisting app for your needs will be a defining factor for how successful your crosslisting endeavors will be. To help you get it right, we'll go over the five essential features to look for when choosing a crosslisting app for your ecommerce business, and explain the significance of each one in day-to-day multichannel selling. Multi-Channel Integrations Not all crosslisting apps are created equal, and that is most evident by the number of channel integrations each one offers. As a general rule, better crosslisting apps will offer a wider selection of multichannel integrations. That said, quantity does not equal quality, and it's important to go over the actual sales channel integrations offered to see if they're relevant to your selling needs. If you sell car parts, for example, an Etsy integration will be of no use to you, but an eBay integration will be non-negotiable. Furthermore, it's wise to choose a crosslisting app that constantly has new integrations in the works, so you don't find yourself lacking integration for a key sales channel a few years down the line. Inventory Management A key component of successful multichannel selling is the ability to manage inventory across channels. If you update an item's attributes on your primary sales channel, you'll want your crosslisting app to update that item's corresponding listings on all your other sales channels too. Likewise, if you make changes to an item's quantity or delist it, your crosslisting app needs to reflect those changes in every channel where that item is crosslisted. Automated Syncing and Listing One of the biggest challenges of multichannel selling is ensuring that all your sales channels are on the same page in terms of listing and item synchronization. As such, the ability to automatically sync products and listings across channels is an essential part of any crosslisting app. In practice, this means that if a unit sells on one channel, your crosslisting app needs to be able to update all your other sales channels and delist it, so you don't end up selling an item you no longer have in stock. Furthermore, any changes you make to inventory, such as adding new products or adjusting stock levels, must be updated on all your selling channels. Listing Optimization Another major challenge of selling on multiple channels is ensuring that each listing is optimized for every sales channel it's crosslisted to. This means not only ensuring platform-specific compliance, but also sales-channel-specific search engine optimization, image optimization, and more. If your crosslisting app doesn't give you the tools you need to tweak and optimize product listings for each sales channel, it's not going to give you the results you need – that is, sales – when you use it to cross list products to new channels. In other words, a crosslisting app should offer you more than just copy-and-paste for your listings; it needs to have customizable and automatable optimizations that can be applied to your products when they're crosslisted to new channels. Order Management Multichannel selling means multichannel orders, and those can quickly get overwhelming without a good way to view and manage them, so a good crosslisting app should enable you to do just that. Make sure that the crosslisting app you choose doesn't just allow you to cross list products to new channels, but also gives you a way to manage the resulting multichannel orders in a single integrated interface, so you won't have to log into each channel multiple times a day to check if a new order has come in. ‍ Top 9 Cross Listing Apps for eCommerce Sellers Now that we gone over crosslisting is and understood the essential features of a good cross listing app, we'll use these criteria to take a look at 9 of the leading cross listing apps for online sellers. We'll go over the key features of each one, understand what kind of ecommerce seller they'd be most suitable for, take a look at their pricing structure, and review some of the main pros and cons of each one. ‍ 1. ExportYourStore ExportYourStore is a crosslisting app that boasts an impressive array of integrations, for both mainstream and niche sales channels. It's accessible in terms of pricing, offers widely customizable automations, and has an integrated order management platform for simple multichannel order management. Its unique approach to multichannel integration enables sellers to largely maintain their current workflows by allowing them to designate a \"source store,\" which acts as the source of truth store for everything from new items to product data edits. In addition to this unique approach, ExportYourStore offers sellers a wide variety of customizable rules and automations, in-depth analytics via a centralized dashboard, built-in FBA automation for seamless and hands-off multichannel fulfillment, bulk listing capabilities, automatic inventory synchronization, and an interface for creating custom product data feeds that can be used for anything from PPC advertising to product optimization. Key Features: ExportYourStore Best for: ExportYourStore is ideal for ecommerce sellers who want to try out multichannel selling without having to commit to learning the ins and outs of each new platform. It's perfect for sellers of all sizes, and comes with attractively-priced plans that can scale with your business as you grow and expand to new channels. Pricing: Pricing starts at just $23 per month, making ExportYourStore accessible to sellers at every stage of their ecommerce journey. Even on the Starter plan you'll be able to link an unlimited number of sales channels to your source store and manage an unlimited number of orders. Plus, you can also try out all of ExportYourStore's features with a free 7-day trial. Pros: ExportYourStore ExportYourStore is a unique crosslisting and multichannel selling tool that allows sellers to set up new sales channels by linking them to their main ecommerce store. This means sellers can continue managing their ecommerce business in the way they're used to, from their current ecommerce store, while still reaping the benefits of multichannel selling. ExportYourStore's unique approach to cross-listing and multichannel selling means that sellers no longer need to commit to learning exactly how to create and publish a listing on every new channel and platform they wish to sell on just to get started, making it a great choice for sellers who want to start selling on new channels but don't have the time to study each one in depth beforehand. ExportYourStore enables sellers to export their listings to a wide variety of online marketplaces, shopping cart platforms, and social media channels, including eBay, Amazon, Walmart, Shopify, WooCommerce, Mercari, Depop, Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram. It allows for seamless multichannel integration, and provides a way for sellers to expand their reach by crosslisting products with channel-specific optimizations for titles, descriptions, images, and even pricing. ExportYourStore also simplifies the process of multichannel selling with features like automatic cross-channel inventory synchronization, auto delisting, custom and automatable listing optimizations, bulk actions, an integrated multichannel order management interface, and even fully automatable Amazon MCF using FBA inventory for all selling channels. ‍ 2. Sellbrite Sellbrite is a multichannel selling app designed to help online retailers manage and sell their products across multiple sales channels, including eBay, Amazon, Walmart, and Shopify. Sellbrite works via a centralized dashboard that requires users to upload their products in order to list and manage inventory and orders on multiple marketplaces. Sellbrite separates its plans into plans for Shopify sellers and all other sellers. Sellers who wish to use FBA, whether for Amazon fulfillment or for multichannel fulfillment, will need to purchase additional expansions on top of Sellbrite's standard subscription packages. Key Features: Sellbrite Best for: Sellbrite is a good choice for sellers who have predictable and relatively limited order volumes, since each subscription tier places a limit on how many monthly orders you can have across channels. It's also a good choice for sellers who only want to expand their business to marketplaces and shopping carts. Pricing: Sellbrite's first paid subscription tier starts at $29 per month, and allows for up to 100 monthly orders. FBA integration costs an additional $19 per month. For sellers who sell on Shopify or Shopify Plus and need Shopify integration, the first paid subscription tier costs $19 per month. Pros: Sellbrite Along with multichannel listing capabilities, Sellbrite's features include bulk listing tools, inventory synchronization, order management, and reporting capabilities. Furthermore, Sellbrite has integrations for some third-party tools, including research tools like Algopix and fulfillment tools like Flexport. Sellbrite also offers a free plan for very small sellers, whose multichannel sales do not exceed 30 order per month, although this plan cannot support FBA integration. Cons: Sellbrite Sellbrite's subscription tiers are relatively convoluted, and it can be difficult for sellers to understand what subscription will work for their selling needs. Furthermore, Sellbrite effectively caps your earnings by limiting the number of orders you can have based on your subscription tier. On top of that, FBA integration, a backbone of many successful multichannel ecommerce operations, carries an additional cost every month. Sellbrite's channel integrations are also relatively limited, with only a handful of marketplaces available, and no integrations available at all for lucrative social commerce channels like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. ‍ 3. Rithum Rithum is a business management and automation tool designed to help ecommerce sellers consolidate their multichannel operations, manage inventory, and optimize their listings across various sales channels. It offers features such as bulk product uploading, inventory synchronization, order management, and reporting. Rithum supports integration with an unbeatably wide array of ecommerce platforms from all over the world, enabling enterprise-level businesses to manage, scale, and expand their operations more efficiently. Key Features: Rithum Best for: Rithum is best suited for sellers who have very large sales volumes, who require an extensive selection of third-party integrations, and who wish to expand to many multinational sales channels. It's aimed at enterprise-level sellers, with its pricing and toolset reflecting the needs of its target audience. ‍Pricing: Unlike ExportYourStore and Sellbrite above, Rithum does not have tiered subscription plans. Instead, Rithum's pricing works on a commission-based model, in which Rithum agrees on a price with each individual seller. Pricing is subject to change over time as the agreement with Rithum is renewed. Pros: Rithum Rithum is not just a cross-listing app; it's a massive and multifaceted ecommerce tool that offers solutions for a variety of ecommerce needs. It offers practically every ecommerce solution under the sun, and aims to fulfill every one of its clients' ecommerce needs, in the present and in the future. Cons: Rithum While Rithum can be used by small and midsize sellers, it's aimed primarily at enterprise level commerce, so its features – and pricing – reflect that. The latter is not transparent, and is tailored to each client with a unique contract. Rithum also has a huge ecosystem of ecommerce tools, so even if you only use some of them, it's very difficult to understand what tools you actually need for your current and projected selling needs, especially if you're just starting out with multichannel selling. ‍ 4. Listing Mirror Listing Mirror is a multichannel ecommerce listing and inventory management tool designed to help online sellers manage their product listings across multiple marketplaces, such as eBay, Amazon, Walmart, and Shopify, from a single platform. It offers features like bulk listing creation, inventory synchronization, and order management. The platform is aimed at simplifying the process of selling on multiple marketplaces, allowing businesses to expand their reach by crosslisting to new sales channels. Key Features: Listing Mirror Best for: Since a significant part of Listing Mirror's functionalities are additional paid addons, it's best suited for sellers who need very basic functionality from their crosslisting app, or those who don't mind paying a monthly fee for features such as Amazon MCF (FBA) integration. Pricing: Listing Mirror's pricing is tailored to each customer and works on a volume basis. Its base plan, List & Launch, is priced based on how many SKUs you manage with the app. Its first addon, Inventory Connect, which manages and syncs multichannel inventory, is priced based on the number of orders imported into the app. The second optional addon, Smart Stock, which creates stock forecasts and auto-generates supplier purchase orders, is priced per client on an onboarding call. Pros: Listing Mirror Listing Mirror is primarily geared towards Amazon sellers who want to take their ecommerce business beyond Amazon, and with the addition of paid addons, it can be a great tool for that type of seller. Its inventory forecasting, available via the Smart Stock addon subscription package, can be a great tool for sellers who need help managing their inventory and don't currently outsource their logistics to Amazon FBA, since much of this addon's functionality is available within Amazon. Cons: Listing Mirror Listing Mirror can be a handy tool for certain Amazon sellers looking to expand to new sales channels, but its obscure pricing and the fact that it requires three different complementary plans in order to achieve full crosslisting functionality are more trouble than they're worth for many sellers. Furthermore, since pricing is directly tied to order volume, high-volume sellers or those who wish to expand to a significant number of sales channels find that, due to its cost, it simply doesn't make sense for them as a crosslisting solution. ‍ 5. Vendoo Vendoo is a multichannel listing and inventory management software aimed primarily at secondhand fashion sellers. It's designed to help these sellers cross-list their products to various online marketplaces, including eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, Depop, and others. Vendoo's features include bulk listing creation, inventory tracking, and automatic cross-posting. Vendoo also offers tools for order management, sales tracking, and analytics to help sellers grow their businesses and maintain accurate stock levels across platforms. Key Features: Vendoo Best for: Vendoo is the first crosslisting app on our list that's aimed specifically at resellers who sell secondhand goods. Its integrations include slightly more niche secondhand luxury fashion marketplaces like Vestiaire Collective and Grailed, making it ideal for sellers who wish to list on these marketplaces. Pricing: Of all the apps listed here, Vendoo's pricing is by far the most complex. Its most basic plan starts at $199 per year. This plan allows you to list up to 25 products every month, and remove the background from a product image up to 25 times each month. To get actual crosslisting functionality, however, you'll need to purchase a monthly subscription of the \"Importing\" addon, which costs $4.99 per month. If you want to take advantage of that crosslisting functionality on more than 3 marketplaces (i.e. crosslist to and integrate with more than three sales channels) you'll need to purchase the \"All Marketplaces\" subscription package, priced at $4.99 per month. Finally, in order to bulk actions, you'll need to purchase the \"Bulk Delist & Relist\" package, which costs an additional $4.99 per month. These three subscription packs can also be purchased together at a discounted rate of $11.99 per month. Pros: Vendoo As an app aimed at secondhand fashion resellers, Vendoo's strengths lie in tools for fashion reselling on niche marketplaces. For starters, Vendoo makes its bulk offers feature available in every plan, which helps sellers send out offers to interested shoppers more easily. Furthermore, Vendoo has a mobile app, making it easy to check in on your secondhand item listings on the go. Cons: Vendoo Once you manage to make sense of its convoluted pricing, it becomes abundantly clear that Vendoo is pretty expensive, especially for the target seller audience it aims to attract. To get actual crosslisting done with Vendoo, you'll need to purchase a monthly subscription addon to your plan; to get integration for more than 3 sales channels, you'll need to purchase another subscription; and to enjoy basic bulk actions, you'll have to purchase yet another one. Vendoo is also extremely lacking in the realm of multichannel integration. Its inventory sync available for just five of its 11 possible sales channel integrations, putting you at risk of overselling, which has the potential to significantly harm your selling accounts due to seller-initiated cancellations and the inevitable negative feedback that will result. ‍ 6. OneShop OneShop is a platform for creating listings and them on secondhand-oriented ecommerce marketplaces. It has integrations for eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, and Depop. It offers a way to create listings and publish them to these marketplaces, and includes automatic delisting for products that have been sold. Its main selling point is its automatable relisting feature, which automatically takes down and relists items to make them appear new on marketplaces, which can help with listing visibility in some cases. It also has automations for listing promotion features, like sending offers, listing bumping, and sharing listings. Key Features: OneShop Best for: As is evident by its features and marketplace integrations, OneShop is a solution aimed at secondhand sellers, primarily those who sell secondhand fashion. As such, OneShop is best for sellers who exclusively sell secondhand fashion, and who only need to integrate with eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, and Depop. Pricing: OneShop's pricing is simple and straightforward: $45 per month, no matter how much – or how little – you list and sell. Pros: OneShop As an app focused on secondhand selling, its main strengths lie in features for secondhand sellers. For starters, OneShop offers a mobile app for both iPhone and Android phones, making it easy for sellers to manage things on the go. Additionally, aside from offering a listing and order management platform, OneShop's app also has a built-in forum that connects all of its sellers, where they can communicate with each other to ask for tips, advice, and help. Finally, OneShop can automatically delist and relist items, allowing sellers to automatically refresh stale listings. Cons: OneShop OneShop is a platform aimed at secondhand resellers, which makes the lack of Etsy integration all the more problematic. Etsy is a major marketplace with a thriving vintage community, and sellers who use OneShop simply won't be able to list on Etsy. Furthermore, OneShop doesn't actually have any crosslisting functionality – you will need to create listings in OneShop in order to list to your integrated channels, and won't have the option of cross listing from one sales channel to another. For the limited integrations it offers, OneShop is also one of the more expensive options on our list. With a flat subscription rate of $45 per month, OneShop's pricing simply doesn't make sense for a large chunk of ecommerce sellers, especially those who sell primarily secondhand fashion. Finally, relisting and delisting is a risky SEO approach, which can very easily backfire. Allowing an app to manage this entirely automatically without very extensive customization is dangerous, and can even result in the suspension of your selling accounts if something goes wrong. ‍ 7. List Perfectly List Perfectly is a cross-listing tool that helps online sellers manage their product listings across select shopping carts and primary secondhand-focused marketplaces. Its sales channel integrations include eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, Etsy, and Shopify, among others. It allows users to import and post listings in bulk, cross-post to various platforms, and delist items once sold. It is intended for resellers who want to sell on multiple channels and manage listings in a more consolidated manner. Key Features: List Perfectly Best for: Like our previous app, List Perfectly is designed primarily for secondhand resellers, and its integrations reflect that. It offers a single shopping cart integration – Shopify – and multiple marketplace integrations for used- and secondhand-oriented selling: eBay, Grailed, Mercari, Vestiaire, Poshmark, Facebook Marketplace, Etsy, the now-defunct Kidizen, and their own closed seller community/potential sales channel called Listing Party. Pricing: List Perfectly offers plans starting at $29 per month, although this tier doesn't offer crossposting to several key sales channels, like Instagram and Shopify. Each subscription tier offers more functionalities and unlocks more product attributes you can include in your product listings. This means that, in order to reach the most basic functionality and attributes you need as a secondhand seller (i.e. include item condition in your listing, crosslist to major sales channels, and bulk actions), you'll need to purchase the Pro subscription, which costs $69 per month. Pros: List Perfectly List Perfectly has a unique seller community and closed marketplace known as Listing Party. It borrows elements from many secondhand selling marketplaces to create a seller community, with live events hosted by and for sellers, and a 24-hour seller chat. Cons: List Perfectly List Perfectly is a niche crosslisting app aimed at resellers, which makes the limited product attribute support on the basic tiers all the more problematic. Resellers simply can't list secondhand or vintage items without a product attribute for their condition. Furthermore, making bulk actions unavailable except on more expensive tiers makes it practically impossible to list on multiple marketplaces. List Perfectly limits many functions, making it far more expensive in practice than it initially seems. ‍ 8. Crosslisting Crosslisting is a tool designed to help online sellers crosslist and manage their product listings on ecommerce platforms such as eBay, Poshmark, and Mercari. Crosslisting offers features like inventory synchronization and bulk listing management, and is aimed primarily at resellers who want to crosslist on secondhand-oriented sales channels. Key Features: Crosslisting Best for: Crosslisting is a cross-listing app aimed specifically at resellers, and that's who it would work best for. Its integrations cover secondhand selling marketplaces, and its plans are tiered in such a way that resellers of all levels can find a plan that works for them. Pricing: Crosslisting works on a monthly subscription model, and offers many pricing tiers. Its first tier, Lite, costs $9.99 per month, and allows for up to 50 cross posts. Realistically, since a cross post is effectively a listing on a given sales channel, most sellers will need to use the Standard tier, which costs $29.99 per month and allows for up to 150 cross posts. Pros: Crosslisting One of the main features of Crosslisting is that it allows sellers to relist products to boost their visibility. This feature is great for resellers in particular, since it's most effective on reselling sites like Depop and Mercari. Another handy feature that Crosslisting has is a mobile app, which makes it easy to manage listings on the go. Cons: Crosslisting Although Crosslisting aims to provide a solution for resellers, even in this realm its integrations are limited. It only has integration for six marketplaces: Poshmark, Depop, eBay, Grailed, Vinted and Mercari, not counting the integration for the now-defunct Kidizen, which is still listed on its site. Etsy, a major marketplace for vintage items, is missing, as is Facebook Marketplace and ThreadUp, to name a few. Additionally, one of its main selling points, relisting, is not included in any of its crosslisting subscription tiers. Instead, it must be purchased monthly as an addon in packages of 10, 15, or 20 relists. Finally, true crosslisting functionality – that is, cross listing from one marketplace to another – is hindered by the 20-listing limit on bulk listing imports across all plans. This, makes Crosslisting a less than ideal choice for sellers who actually want an app to crosslist their existing listings to new marketplaces. ‍ 9. PrimeLister PrimeLister is an app for managing and listing products across secondhand selling marketplaces, including eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, and Etsy, as well as on Shopify, which is a shopping cart platform for creating standalone webstores. It provides features for bulk listing, inventory management, and automatic delisting for cross-platform inventory synchronization. PrimeLister aims to help sellers save time by centralizing the process of listing and managing inventory on multiple sales channels. Key Features: PrimeLister Best for: While PrimeLister bills itself as a crosslisting app, its crosslisting functionality is limited, and its multichannel integration functionality is sub-par. As such, it's best for resellers who only need to relist items (i.e. take down listings in order to republish them) on marketplaces like Mercari or Depop every once in a while to keep them fresh. Pricing: PrimeLister offers two subscription plans: Basic and Pro. The former costs $29.99 per month, but offers no crosslisting functionality at all. The latter costs $49.99 per month and includes crosslisting functionality, as well as inventory management and \"tags & groups,\" a backend organization feature. Pros: PrimeLister PrimeLister offers a steep 30% discount for subscribers who are willing to commit for a year, which is more than the commonly offered discount of 15-20%. Cons: PrimeLister PrimeLister has many drawbacks – a lack of integrations, a pricey subscription, and limited features – but its biggest drawback is its complete lack of automatic delisting. As of writing, this feature is not available on either one of the plans, which means that even if you shell out almost $50 per month just to get basic crosslisting functionality, you will still very likely find yourself with orders cancelled due to overselling items you no longer have. ‍ How to Choose the Right Cross Listing App for Your Online Store Now that we've gone over nine popular crosslisting apps, you might be feeling a little overwhelmed. There are so many features and functionalities beyond simply cross-listing from one sales channel to another, that it's not always easy to decipher what makes a good crosslisting app and what just sounds useful in theory. In this section, we'll go over how you can analyze the crosslisting apps available on the market and see how well they meet your needs, so you can choose the best crosslisting app for your ecommerce business and expand to new sales channels easily. Identify Your Needs and Goals While it may sound obvious, it's not always the first thing that goes through a seller's mind when selecting a crosslisting app. But just like not all crosslisting apps are created equal, not all crosslisting apps are designed for the same type of ecommerce seller. Some are best for resellers, while others appeal to a broader range of sellers with a wide array of sales channel integrations; some have built-in crosslisting functionality, while others offer it only as an extra addon feature. With so many options, it's important to take a moment to assess exactly what it is you need from a cross-listing app before beginning your search. Do you sell primarily mid-range secondhand fashion, or is luxury vintage fashion something you need to be able to sell too? Do you not sell secondhand goods at all, and only need integration for handmade-oriented marketplaces like Etsy and Amazon Handmade? How many products will you realistically want to cross-list, today and as your business grows? Do you hold inventory, or are you a dropshipper? These are just some of the questions you need to ask yourself before you start looking for an app, so you know right off the bat which ones are irrelevant to your needs. If you don't plan on selling secondhand fashion, several of the crosslisting apps on our list are already crossed out! Consider Your Budget Just like any business expense, the cost of your cross listing app of choice is a major consideration that cannot be overlooked. Ideally, your crosslisting app should offer a selection of plans that can grow with your business, ones that make sense for your bottom line at every step of the way. Some apps do this better than others, but the most important thing is to be honest with yourself about how much you can justifiably spend on a crosslisting app with the funds you have available to you now, not what you could potentially make in the future. Read Reviews and Ask for Recommendations Analyzing an app's features on paper is all well and good, but nothing beats the experience of sellers like you. It's only when you start working with a crosslisting app do you truly understand how it helps – or even harms – your ecommerce business. Does it delist items to prevent overselling in time? Does it integrate your inventory across all your selling channels? Can you optimize your cross-listed products for each marketplace and platform? All these are just a handful of things are truly important to multichannel sellers, and they'll be sure to come up in reviews if one of them is lacking. ‍ Final Thoughts: The Importance of Cross Listing for eCommerce Sellers Cross listing is the single best thing ecommerce sellers to can do to increase their reach and maximize their earning potential. Listing to new sales channels not only multiplies your pool of potential buyers instantly, it also establishes your credibility through better visibility across platforms. Just like anything worth doing, crosslisting must be done right to reap its benefits; done wrong, the damage to your business can be irreparable. With every new sales channel you cross list to, you'll have the responsibility of not only integrating your inventory responsibly and delisting items when they're sold, but also optimizing for both compliance and visibility. It's never enough to just copy and paste your listings from one channel to another, and it all boils down to choosing the best crosslisting app for your ecommerce business' unique selling needs. Make sure to choose the app that works for your selling needs, and make the most of the features it offers to not only list on more channels, but to successfully sell on them, too.

As the sector continues to grow, one thing has become abundantly clear: in order to successfully sell anything online, you need to sell it on more than one sales channel. While that sounds simple and straightforward in theory, it becomes increasingly more apparent how challenging cross listing can be the deeper your dive into the practical details. How do you avoid selling the same unit twice? How can you ensure that each product listing is perfectly compliant and optimized for every selling channel? How do you decide which items to cross-list and which to list only on certain channels? These challenges only multiply with each item you add to your selection and every sales channel you include in your selling repertoire, making it practically impossible to sell on multiple channels without the help of a good crosslisting app. But choosing the best cross listing app for your selling needs can be challenging, especially when there are just so many crosslisting apps on the market touting themselves as the best app for crosslisting to certain channels or the best crosslisting app for resellers. The truth is that finding the best crosslisting app for your business will depend heavily on your specific crosslisting needs, both now and in the future. In this guide, we'll teach you how to find the best crosslisting app for your unique ecommerce business by helping you understand what to look for in a cross listing app. Keep reading to learn what ecommerce cross listing is, what its benefits are, and how to determine which crosslisting app is the best choice for your selling needs. ‍ What is eCommerce Cross Listing? In ecommerce, the term \"cross listing\" or \"crosslisting\" refers to listing an item on more than one selling channel. The idea behind crosslisting is simple: reach more buyers on more platforms, and raise your chances of a successful sale. Crosslisting is used by virtually all successful ecommerce sellers, no matter on which sales channels they started their online selling journey or what they're selling. The reason for this is that crosslisting works – it's the single simplest way to instantly multiply your pool of potential buyers, raise your brand awareness, and drive sales. ‍ What are the Benefits of Cross Listing? Crosslisting is an incredibly powerful approach to online commerce, with a multitude of benefits that range from better reach to a more robust and resilient ecommerce business. The main benefits of crosslisting include: Increased Visibility and Reach: Crosslisting to new channels allows you to instantly increase the visibility of your listings by getting them in front of new buyers who would never have seen them on their original sales channel. Saved Time and Effort: When done with a crosslisting app, the experience of multichannel selling is closer to running one large store rather than a selection of smaller ones in terms of product data and listing management. That's because crosslisting a product to a new channel is far faster and easier than creating a new product listing from scratch, making for a more efficient listing experience. Diversified Sales Channels: Crosslisting gives you the ability to diversify your sales channels and make your ecommerce business more robust in the face of challenges like account suspensions. If one of your marketplace stores is suspended for review, for example, you don't have to worry about losing your sole revenue stream. ‍ Essential Features to Look for in a Cross-Listing App While the concept of crosslisting is simple, its application is far from, which is why getting the implementation right is essential to successful multichannel cross selling. In other words, choosing the best crosslisting app for your needs will be a defining factor for how successful your crosslisting endeavors will be. To help you get it right, we'll go over the five essential features to look for when choosing a crosslisting app for your ecommerce business, and explain the significance of each one in day-to-day multichannel selling. Multi-Channel Integrations Not all crosslisting apps are created equal, and that is most evident by the number of channel integrations each one offers. As a general rule, better crosslisting apps will offer a wider selection of multichannel integrations. That said, quantity does not equal quality, and it's important to go over the actual sales channel integrations offered to see if they're relevant to your selling needs. If you sell car parts, for example, an Etsy integration will be of no use to you, but an eBay integration will be non-negotiable. Furthermore, it's wise to choose a crosslisting app that constantly has new integrations in the works, so you don't find yourself lacking integration for a key sales channel a few years down the line. Inventory Management A key component of successful multichannel selling is the ability to manage inventory across channels. If you update an item's attributes on your primary sales channel, you'll want your crosslisting app to update that item's corresponding listings on all your other sales channels too. Likewise, if you make changes to an item's quantity or delist it, your crosslisting app needs to reflect those changes in every channel where that item is crosslisted. Automated Syncing and Listing One of the biggest challenges of multichannel selling is ensuring that all your sales channels are on the same page in terms of listing and item synchronization. As such, the ability to automatically sync products and listings across channels is an essential part of any crosslisting app. In practice, this means that if a unit sells on one channel, your crosslisting app needs to be able to update all your other sales channels and delist it, so you don't end up selling an item you no longer have in stock. Furthermore, any changes you make to inventory, such as adding new products or adjusting stock levels, must be updated on all your selling channels. Listing Optimization Another major challenge of selling on multiple channels is ensuring that each listing is optimized for every sales channel it's crosslisted to. This means not only ensuring platform-specific compliance, but also sales-channel-specific search engine optimization, image optimization, and more. If your crosslisting app doesn't give you the tools you need to tweak and optimize product listings for each sales channel, it's not going to give you the results you need – that is, sales – when you use it to cross list products to new channels. In other words, a crosslisting app should offer you more than just copy-and-paste for your listings; it needs to have customizable and automatable optimizations that can be applied to your products when they're crosslisted to new channels. Order Management Multichannel selling means multichannel orders, and those can quickly get overwhelming without a good way to view and manage them, so a good crosslisting app should enable you to do just that. Make sure that the crosslisting app you choose doesn't just allow you to cross list products to new channels, but also gives you a way to manage the resulting multichannel orders in a single integrated interface, so you won't have to log into each channel multiple times a day to check if a new order has come in. ‍ Top 9 Cross Listing Apps for eCommerce Sellers Now that we gone over crosslisting is and understood the essential features of a good cross listing app, we'll use these criteria to take a look at 9 of the leading cross listing apps for online sellers. We'll go over the key features of each one, understand what kind of ecommerce seller they'd be most suitable for, take a look at their pricing structure, and review some of the main pros and cons of each one. ‍ 1. ExportYourStore ExportYourStore is a crosslisting app that boasts an impressive array of integrations, for both mainstream and niche sales channels. It's accessible in terms of pricing, offers widely customizable automations, and has an integrated order management platform for simple multichannel order management. Its unique approach to multichannel integration enables sellers to largely maintain their current workflows by allowing them to designate a \"source store,\" which acts as the source of truth store for everything from new items to product data edits. In addition to this unique approach, ExportYourStore offers sellers a wide variety of customizable rules and automations, in-depth analytics via a centralized dashboard, built-in FBA automation for seamless and hands-off multichannel fulfillment, bulk listing capabilities, automatic inventory synchronization, and an interface for creating custom product data feeds that can be used for anything from PPC advertising to product optimization. Key Features: ExportYourStore Best for: ExportYourStore is ideal for ecommerce sellers who want to try out multichannel selling without having to commit to learning the ins and outs of each new platform. It's perfect for sellers of all sizes, and comes with attractively-priced plans that can scale with your business as you grow and expand to new channels. Pricing: Pricing starts at just $23 per month, making ExportYourStore accessible to sellers at every stage of their ecommerce journey. Even on the Starter plan you'll be able to link an unlimited number of sales channels to your source store and manage an unlimited number of orders. Plus, you can also try out all of ExportYourStore's features with a free 7-day trial. Pros: ExportYourStore ExportYourStore is a unique crosslisting and multichannel selling tool that allows sellers to set up new sales channels by linking them to their main ecommerce store. This means sellers can continue managing their ecommerce business in the way they're used to, from their current ecommerce store, while still reaping the benefits of multichannel selling. ExportYourStore's unique approach to cross-listing and multichannel selling means that sellers no longer need to commit to learning exactly how to create and publish a listing on every new channel and platform they wish to sell on just to get started, making it a great choice for sellers who want to start selling on new channels but don't have the time to study each one in depth beforehand. ExportYourStore enables sellers to export their listings to a wide variety of online marketplaces, shopping cart platforms, and social media channels, including eBay, Amazon, Walmart, Shopify, WooCommerce, Mercari, Depop, Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram. It allows for seamless multichannel integration, and provides a way for sellers to expand their reach by crosslisting products with channel-specific optimizations for titles, descriptions, images, and even pricing. ExportYourStore also simplifies the process of multichannel selling with features like automatic cross-channel inventory synchronization, auto delisting, custom and automatable listing optimizations, bulk actions, an integrated multichannel order management interface, and even fully automatable Amazon MCF using FBA inventory for all selling channels. ‍ 2. Sellbrite Sellbrite is a multichannel selling app designed to help online retailers manage and sell their products across multiple sales channels, including eBay, Amazon, Walmart, and Shopify. Sellbrite works via a centralized dashboard that requires users to upload their products in order to list and manage inventory and orders on multiple marketplaces. Sellbrite separates its plans into plans for Shopify sellers and all other sellers. Sellers who wish to use FBA, whether for Amazon fulfillment or for multichannel fulfillment, will need to purchase additional expansions on top of Sellbrite's standard subscription packages. Key Features: Sellbrite Best for: Sellbrite is a good choice for sellers who have predictable and relatively limited order volumes, since each subscription tier places a limit on how many monthly orders you can have across channels. It's also a good choice for sellers who only want to expand their business to marketplaces and shopping carts. Pricing: Sellbrite's first paid subscription tier starts at $29 per month, and allows for up to 100 monthly orders. FBA integration costs an additional $19 per month. For sellers who sell on Shopify or Shopify Plus and need Shopify integration, the first paid subscription tier costs $19 per month. Pros: Sellbrite Along with multichannel listing capabilities, Sellbrite's features include bulk listing tools, inventory synchronization, order management, and reporting capabilities. Furthermore, Sellbrite has integrations for some third-party tools, including research tools like Algopix and fulfillment tools like Flexport. Sellbrite also offers a free plan for very small sellers, whose multichannel sales do not exceed 30 order per month, although this plan cannot support FBA integration. Cons: Sellbrite Sellbrite's subscription tiers are relatively convoluted, and it can be difficult for sellers to understand what subscription will work for their selling needs. Furthermore, Sellbrite effectively caps your earnings by limiting the number of orders you can have based on your subscription tier. On top of that, FBA integration, a backbone of many successful multichannel ecommerce operations, carries an additional cost every month. Sellbrite's channel integrations are also relatively limited, with only a handful of marketplaces available, and no integrations available at all for lucrative social commerce channels like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. ‍ 3. Rithum Rithum is a business management and automation tool designed to help ecommerce sellers consolidate their multichannel operations, manage inventory, and optimize their listings across various sales channels. It offers features such as bulk product uploading, inventory synchronization, order management, and reporting. Rithum supports integration with an unbeatably wide array of ecommerce platforms from all over the world, enabling enterprise-level businesses to manage, scale, and expand their operations more efficiently. Key Features: Rithum Best for: Rithum is best suited for sellers who have very large sales volumes, who require an extensive selection of third-party integrations, and who wish to expand to many multinational sales channels. It's aimed at enterprise-level sellers, with its pricing and toolset reflecting the needs of its target audience. ‍Pricing: Unlike ExportYourStore and Sellbrite above, Rithum does not have tiered subscription plans. Instead, Rithum's pricing works on a commission-based model, in which Rithum agrees on a price with each individual seller. Pricing is subject to change over time as the agreement with Rithum is renewed. Pros: Rithum Rithum is not just a cross-listing app; it's a massive and multifaceted ecommerce tool that offers solutions for a variety of ecommerce needs. It offers practically every ecommerce solution under the sun, and aims to fulfill every one of its clients' ecommerce needs, in the present and in the future. Cons: Rithum While Rithum can be used by small and midsize sellers, it's aimed primarily at enterprise level commerce, so its features – and pricing – reflect that. The latter is not transparent, and is tailored to each client with a unique contract. Rithum also has a huge ecosystem of ecommerce tools, so even if you only use some of them, it's very difficult to understand what tools you actually need for your current and projected selling needs, especially if you're just starting out with multichannel selling. ‍ 4. Listing Mirror Listing Mirror is a multichannel ecommerce listing and inventory management tool designed to help online sellers manage their product listings across multiple marketplaces, such as eBay, Amazon, Walmart, and Shopify, from a single platform. It offers features like bulk listing creation, inventory synchronization, and order management. The platform is aimed at simplifying the process of selling on multiple marketplaces, allowing businesses to expand their reach by crosslisting to new sales channels. Key Features: Listing Mirror Best for: Since a significant part of Listing Mirror's functionalities are additional paid addons, it's best suited for sellers who need very basic functionality from their crosslisting app, or those who don't mind paying a monthly fee for features such as Amazon MCF (FBA) integration. Pricing: Listing Mirror's pricing is tailored to each customer and works on a volume basis. Its base plan, List & Launch, is priced based on how many SKUs you manage with the app. Its first addon, Inventory Connect, which manages and syncs multichannel inventory, is priced based on the number of orders imported into the app. The second optional addon, Smart Stock, which creates stock forecasts and auto-generates supplier purchase orders, is priced per client on an onboarding call. Pros: Listing Mirror Listing Mirror is primarily geared towards Amazon sellers who want to take their ecommerce business beyond Amazon, and with the addition of paid addons, it can be a great tool for that type of seller. Its inventory forecasting, available via the Smart Stock addon subscription package, can be a great tool for sellers who need help managing their inventory and don't currently outsource their logistics to Amazon FBA, since much of this addon's functionality is available within Amazon. Cons: Listing Mirror Listing Mirror can be a handy tool for certain Amazon sellers looking to expand to new sales channels, but its obscure pricing and the fact that it requires three different complementary plans in order to achieve full crosslisting functionality are more trouble than they're worth for many sellers. Furthermore, since pricing is directly tied to order volume, high-volume sellers or those who wish to expand to a significant number of sales channels find that, due to its cost, it simply doesn't make sense for them as a crosslisting solution. ‍ 5. Vendoo Vendoo is a multichannel listing and inventory management software aimed primarily at secondhand fashion sellers. It's designed to help these sellers cross-list their products to various online marketplaces, including eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, Depop, and others. Vendoo's features include bulk listing creation, inventory tracking, and automatic cross-posting. Vendoo also offers tools for order management, sales tracking, and analytics to help sellers grow their businesses and maintain accurate stock levels across platforms. Key Features: Vendoo Best for: Vendoo is the first crosslisting app on our list that's aimed specifically at resellers who sell secondhand goods. Its integrations include slightly more niche secondhand luxury fashion marketplaces like Vestiaire Collective and Grailed, making it ideal for sellers who wish to list on these marketplaces. Pricing: Of all the apps listed here, Vendoo's pricing is by far the most complex. Its most basic plan starts at $199 per year. This plan allows you to list up to 25 products every month, and remove the background from a product image up to 25 times each month. To get actual crosslisting functionality, however, you'll need to purchase a monthly subscription of the \"Importing\" addon, which costs $4.99 per month. If you want to take advantage of that crosslisting functionality on more than 3 marketplaces (i.e. crosslist to and integrate with more than three sales channels) you'll need to purchase the \"All Marketplaces\" subscription package, priced at $4.99 per month. Finally, in order to bulk actions, you'll need to purchase the \"Bulk Delist & Relist\" package, which costs an additional $4.99 per month. These three subscription packs can also be purchased together at a discounted rate of $11.99 per month. Pros: Vendoo As an app aimed at secondhand fashion resellers, Vendoo's strengths lie in tools for fashion reselling on niche marketplaces. For starters, Vendoo makes its bulk offers feature available in every plan, which helps sellers send out offers to interested shoppers more easily. Furthermore, Vendoo has a mobile app, making it easy to check in on your secondhand item listings on the go. Cons: Vendoo Once you manage to make sense of its convoluted pricing, it becomes abundantly clear that Vendoo is pretty expensive, especially for the target seller audience it aims to attract. To get actual crosslisting done with Vendoo, you'll need to purchase a monthly subscription addon to your plan; to get integration for more than 3 sales channels, you'll need to purchase another subscription; and to enjoy basic bulk actions, you'll have to purchase yet another one. Vendoo is also extremely lacking in the realm of multichannel integration. Its inventory sync available for just five of its 11 possible sales channel integrations, putting you at risk of overselling, which has the potential to significantly harm your selling accounts due to seller-initiated cancellations and the inevitable negative feedback that will result. ‍ 6. OneShop OneShop is a platform for creating listings and them on secondhand-oriented ecommerce marketplaces. It has integrations for eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, and Depop. It offers a way to create listings and publish them to these marketplaces, and includes automatic delisting for products that have been sold. Its main selling point is its automatable relisting feature, which automatically takes down and relists items to make them appear new on marketplaces, which can help with listing visibility in some cases. It also has automations for listing promotion features, like sending offers, listing bumping, and sharing listings. Key Features: OneShop Best for: As is evident by its features and marketplace integrations, OneShop is a solution aimed at secondhand sellers, primarily those who sell secondhand fashion. As such, OneShop is best for sellers who exclusively sell secondhand fashion, and who only need to integrate with eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, and Depop. Pricing: OneShop's pricing is simple and straightforward: $45 per month, no matter how much – or how little – you list and sell. Pros: OneShop As an app focused on secondhand selling, its main strengths lie in features for secondhand sellers. For starters, OneShop offers a mobile app for both iPhone and Android phones, making it easy for sellers to manage things on the go. Additionally, aside from offering a listing and order management platform, OneShop's app also has a built-in forum that connects all of its sellers, where they can communicate with each other to ask for tips, advice, and help. Finally, OneShop can automatically delist and relist items, allowing sellers to automatically refresh stale listings. Cons: OneShop OneShop is a platform aimed at secondhand resellers, which makes the lack of Etsy integration all the more problematic. Etsy is a major marketplace with a thriving vintage community, and sellers who use OneShop simply won't be able to list on Etsy. Furthermore, OneShop doesn't actually have any crosslisting functionality – you will need to create listings in OneShop in order to list to your integrated channels, and won't have the option of cross listing from one sales channel to another. For the limited integrations it offers, OneShop is also one of the more expensive options on our list. With a flat subscription rate of $45 per month, OneShop's pricing simply doesn't make sense for a large chunk of ecommerce sellers, especially those who sell primarily secondhand fashion. Finally, relisting and delisting is a risky SEO approach, which can very easily backfire. Allowing an app to manage this entirely automatically without very extensive customization is dangerous, and can even result in the suspension of your selling accounts if something goes wrong. ‍ 7. List Perfectly List Perfectly is a cross-listing tool that helps online sellers manage their product listings across select shopping carts and primary secondhand-focused marketplaces. Its sales channel integrations include eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, Etsy, and Shopify, among others. It allows users to import and post listings in bulk, cross-post to various platforms, and delist items once sold. It is intended for resellers who want to sell on multiple channels and manage listings in a more consolidated manner. Key Features: List Perfectly Best for: Like our previous app, List Perfectly is designed primarily for secondhand resellers, and its integrations reflect that. It offers a single shopping cart integration – Shopify – and multiple marketplace integrations for used- and secondhand-oriented selling: eBay, Grailed, Mercari, Vestiaire, Poshmark, Facebook Marketplace, Etsy, the now-defunct Kidizen, and their own closed seller community/potential sales channel called Listing Party. Pricing: List Perfectly offers plans starting at $29 per month, although this tier doesn't offer crossposting to several key sales channels, like Instagram and Shopify. Each subscription tier offers more functionalities and unlocks more product attributes you can include in your product listings. This means that, in order to reach the most basic functionality and attributes you need as a secondhand seller (i.e. include item condition in your listing, crosslist to major sales channels, and bulk actions), you'll need to purchase the Pro subscription, which costs $69 per month. Pros: List Perfectly List Perfectly has a unique seller community and closed marketplace known as Listing Party. It borrows elements from many secondhand selling marketplaces to create a seller community, with live events hosted by and for sellers, and a 24-hour seller chat. Cons: List Perfectly List Perfectly is a niche crosslisting app aimed at resellers, which makes the limited product attribute support on the basic tiers all the more problematic. Resellers simply can't list secondhand or vintage items without a product attribute for their condition. Furthermore, making bulk actions unavailable except on more expensive tiers makes it practically impossible to list on multiple marketplaces. List Perfectly limits many functions, making it far more expensive in practice than it initially seems. ‍ 8. Crosslisting Crosslisting is a tool designed to help online sellers crosslist and manage their product listings on ecommerce platforms such as eBay, Poshmark, and Mercari. Crosslisting offers features like inventory synchronization and bulk listing management, and is aimed primarily at resellers who want to crosslist on secondhand-oriented sales channels. Key Features: Crosslisting Best for: Crosslisting is a cross-listing app aimed specifically at resellers, and that's who it would work best for. Its integrations cover secondhand selling marketplaces, and its plans are tiered in such a way that resellers of all levels can find a plan that works for them. Pricing: Crosslisting works on a monthly subscription model, and offers many pricing tiers. Its first tier, Lite, costs $9.99 per month, and allows for up to 50 cross posts. Realistically, since a cross post is effectively a listing on a given sales channel, most sellers will need to use the Standard tier, which costs $29.99 per month and allows for up to 150 cross posts. Pros: Crosslisting One of the main features of Crosslisting is that it allows sellers to relist products to boost their visibility. This feature is great for resellers in particular, since it's most effective on reselling sites like Depop and Mercari. Another handy feature that Crosslisting has is a mobile app, which makes it easy to manage listings on the go. Cons: Crosslisting Although Crosslisting aims to provide a solution for resellers, even in this realm its integrations are limited. It only has integration for six marketplaces: Poshmark, Depop, eBay, Grailed, Vinted and Mercari, not counting the integration for the now-defunct Kidizen, which is still listed on its site. Etsy, a major marketplace for vintage items, is missing, as is Facebook Marketplace and ThreadUp, to name a few. Additionally, one of its main selling points, relisting, is not included in any of its crosslisting subscription tiers. Instead, it must be purchased monthly as an addon in packages of 10, 15, or 20 relists. Finally, true crosslisting functionality – that is, cross listing from one marketplace to another – is hindered by the 20-listing limit on bulk listing imports across all plans. This, makes Crosslisting a less than ideal choice for sellers who actually want an app to crosslist their existing listings to new marketplaces. ‍ 9. PrimeLister PrimeLister is an app for managing and listing products across secondhand selling marketplaces, including eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, and Etsy, as well as on Shopify, which is a shopping cart platform for creating standalone webstores. It provides features for bulk listing, inventory management, and automatic delisting for cross-platform inventory synchronization. PrimeLister aims to help sellers save time by centralizing the process of listing and managing inventory on multiple sales channels. Key Features: PrimeLister Best for: While PrimeLister bills itself as a crosslisting app, its crosslisting functionality is limited, and its multichannel integration functionality is sub-par. As such, it's best for resellers who only need to relist items (i.e. take down listings in order to republish them) on marketplaces like Mercari or Depop every once in a while to keep them fresh. Pricing: PrimeLister offers two subscription plans: Basic and Pro. The former costs $29.99 per month, but offers no crosslisting functionality at all. The latter costs $49.99 per month and includes crosslisting functionality, as well as inventory management and \"tags & groups,\" a backend organization feature. Pros: PrimeLister PrimeLister offers a steep 30% discount for subscribers who are willing to commit for a year, which is more than the commonly offered discount of 15-20%. Cons: PrimeLister PrimeLister has many drawbacks – a lack of integrations, a pricey subscription, and limited features – but its biggest drawback is its complete lack of automatic delisting. As of writing, this feature is not available on either one of the plans, which means that even if you shell out almost $50 per month just to get basic crosslisting functionality, you will still very likely find yourself with orders cancelled due to overselling items you no longer have. ‍ How to Choose the Right Cross Listing App for Your Online Store Now that we've gone over nine popular crosslisting apps, you might be feeling a little overwhelmed. There are so many features and functionalities beyond simply cross-listing from one sales channel to another, that it's not always easy to decipher what makes a good crosslisting app and what just sounds useful in theory. In this section, we'll go over how you can analyze the crosslisting apps available on the market and see how well they meet your needs, so you can choose the best crosslisting app for your ecommerce business and expand to new sales channels easily. Identify Your Needs and Goals While it may sound obvious, it's not always the first thing that goes through a seller's mind when selecting a crosslisting app. But just like not all crosslisting apps are created equal, not all crosslisting apps are designed for the same type of ecommerce seller. Some are best for resellers, while others appeal to a broader range of sellers with a wide array of sales channel integrations; some have built-in crosslisting functionality, while others offer it only as an extra addon feature. With so many options, it's important to take a moment to assess exactly what it is you need from a cross-listing app before beginning your search. Do you sell primarily mid-range secondhand fashion, or is luxury vintage fashion something you need to be able to sell too? Do you not sell secondhand goods at all, and only need integration for handmade-oriented marketplaces like Etsy and Amazon Handmade? How many products will you realistically want to cross-list, today and as your business grows? Do you hold inventory, or are you a dropshipper? These are just some of the questions you need to ask yourself before you start looking for an app, so you know right off the bat which ones are irrelevant to your needs. If you don't plan on selling secondhand fashion, several of the crosslisting apps on our list are already crossed out! Consider Your Budget Just like any business expense, the cost of your cross listing app of choice is a major consideration that cannot be overlooked. Ideally, your crosslisting app should offer a selection of plans that can grow with your business, ones that make sense for your bottom line at every step of the way. Some apps do this better than others, but the most important thing is to be honest with yourself about how much you can justifiably spend on a crosslisting app with the funds you have available to you now, not what you could potentially make in the future. Read Reviews and Ask for Recommendations Analyzing an app's features on paper is all well and good, but nothing beats the experience of sellers like you. It's only when you start working with a crosslisting app do you truly understand how it helps – or even harms – your ecommerce business. Does it delist items to prevent overselling in time? Does it integrate your inventory across all your selling channels? Can you optimize your cross-listed products for each marketplace and platform? All these are just a handful of things are truly important to multichannel sellers, and they'll be sure to come up in reviews if one of them is lacking. ‍ Final Thoughts: The Importance of Cross Listing for eCommerce Sellers Cross listing is the single best thing ecommerce sellers to can do to increase their reach and maximize their earning potential. Listing to new sales channels not only multiplies your pool of potential buyers instantly, it also establishes your credibility through better visibility across platforms. Just like anything worth doing, crosslisting must be done right to reap its benefits; done wrong, the damage to your business can be irreparable. With every new sales channel you cross list to, you'll have the responsibility of not only integrating your inventory responsibly and delisting items when they're sold, but also optimizing for both compliance and visibility. It's never enough to just copy and paste your listings from one channel to another, and it all boils down to choosing the best crosslisting app for your ecommerce business' unique selling needs. Make sure to choose the app that works for your selling needs, and make the most of the features it offers to not only list on more channels, but to successfully sell on them, too.

Sales vs. Marketing: Understanding the Key Differences Table of Contents Sales and Marketing are like two seemingly inseparable twins – forever entwined in the world of business, similar, yet with their own distinct personalities. While they are just like two peas in a pod, working harmoniously towards a common goal – generating revenue, their approaches are as different as chalk and cheese. Understanding these differences is important not only for the effective operation of a company but also for unlocking its full potential. It’s as if you had a bike instead of a business. There are two wheels of the same size but different functions, and it is better to leave them like that. If they are treated as the same thing, or one is ignored, the bicycle loses its balance, making it difficult to ride smoothly and efficiently. Of course, there are statistics to back it up. In 2020 LinkedIn conducted a study and found that a whopping 87% of Sales and Marketing experts believe that teamwork between their departments helps businesses grow. Not only that, but 85% of them also think that getting Sales and Marketing on the same page is the golden ticket to boosting their overall business performance. Sales vs. Marketing By definition, the sales process is about selling products or services, and there is no money without it. Sometimes, “sales” can also refer to the money made or the quantity of items sold. It’s a crucial part of any company’s success, in both action and measurement, but we will be talking about the former. Marketing, on the other hand, is all about getting the word out about your products or services. It includes things like doing research to understand what customers want and using this information to grab people’s attention. So, it’s the fun, creative side of the business that helps people learn about and fall in love with what you’re selling. Purpose of Sales and Marketing In a big short: sales is all about closing the deal. It turns prospects into paying customers using numerous interpersonal techniques. A good salesperson is the one who can sweet-talk their way into getting a free dessert at a restaurant. They are the faces of the company who make sure that the right product or service finds a loving home in the arms of customers. Marketing, on the other hand, is the BFF of sales. It’s the wingman that sets the stage for sales to do its thing. The brand awareness lures potential customers into the sales funnel by creating interest, trust, and a bit of pizzazz. From catchy slogans to eye-popping visuals, marketing makes sure people know about your product and why they need it in their lives. The Difference Between Sales and Marketing Focus In the discussion on sales vs. marketing, their focus is the first element worth considering. The sales team’s main concern is the people. They’re the social butterflies of the business world, always eager to chat with potential customers, get to know them, and figure out what they need. They piece together clues to find the perfect solution for each individual prospect. They are passionate about building relationships as well as creating positive experiences that turn potential buyers into happy customers. They’re the ones who dream up and execute everything from attention-grabbing ads to engaging social media posts that capture the hearts and minds of potential customers. Beyond that, they’re constantly analyzing market trends and consumer behavior to ensure that their strategies remain relevant and effective. It is all about creating a buzz and generating leads, setting the stage for the sales team. Delivery: Storytelling vs. Asking Questions A good salesperson has to be like a curious child, specifically when it comes to asking questions (a lot of them). Asking by itself is not enough, though, people from the sales department listen carefully, offer helpful advice, and work hard to find the perfect solution for each person. Their inquisitive nature helps them dig much deeper than any market analysis would ever allow. Marketing is all about spinning a good yarn, it’s more general as it has to apply to a larger group of people. And what do people like? – a good story. Marketers are the storytellers of the business world, creating emotional and engaging connections between the brand and its audience. They paint vivid pictures of how amazing life could be with their products or services, making potential customers feel like they’re witnessing a thrilling narrative part that they can purchase. Tactics Sales is all about getting up close and personal with prospects and customers. It’s about being a friend who’s always there to lend an ear and help you find what you need. Whether it’s a phone call, face-to-face meeting, or video conference, they’re great at answering questions, addressing concerns, as well as offering special deals to make sure people feel confident in their purchase and that they get the right product. In a party full of people, marketing is its life, using all sorts of creative tactics to be noticed and remembered. Marketers not just talking to one person; they want to spread the word far and wide, no matter if people need what they have to offer. They use a mix of traditional and digital channels to connect with as many people as possible, spark their interest, and turn them into fans of your brand. From eye-catching billboards to viral videos, marketing teams consistently innovate to ensure your brand stays top of mind. Skill Sets What’s worth considering is that a good marketing person won’t necessarily make a good salesperson. The latter requires a combination of a soul-of-the-party logician and a therapist – someone who can listen while identifying and understanding customer needs and preferences as well as various patterns. Add to that a good dose of resilience and persistence (because, let’s face it, rejection is part and parcel of the sales world) and a keen sense of timing followed by the ability to close deals, and you get yourself a successful salesperson. Marketing needs an artist with a hint of a mathematician in them – a creative thinker and storyteller, weaving engaging narratives that draw people in and don’t let go, but also data-driven and analytical at the same time. They have to be able to interpret metrics and make informed decisions to optimize campaigns while looking at the bigger picture and developing long-term plans to boost brand visibility and reach. Metrics Sales just love numbers – specifically, the money numbers. When it comes to measuring success, sales teams look at revenue, which means how much cash they’ve brought in from all those deals they’ve closed. They also track key performance indicators (KPIs) like conversion rates and average deal sizes. Although it sounds complicated, it’s rather straightforward: more sales equals more success (and commission). With marketing, the measurement game is a bit more complex. They can look at a bunch of different factors, like how many people are visiting their website, how many new leads they’re bringing in, and how engaged people are with their content. They also track metrics like brand awareness and customer sentiment. Regardless of different factors that may be taken into account, it’s sometimes hard to say if the campaign is even working. For marketing, it’s not just about the money; it’s about how well they’re connecting with their audience and whether they’re making a positive impact on the brand, and that’s something that’s extremely hard to put a tag on. Timeframe The sale process is quick, like a sprint. Wins are short-term and immediate. All in all, it doesn’t take long to close a deal and get the customer on board, or at least it shouldn’t – targets and deadlines are always pushing to hit the right numbers and make sales happen right now. Sales reps often juggle multiple prospects at once, ensuring that they maintain momentum and keep their schedules full. Marketing isn’t like that, it is more like a marathon, focused on the long game. Marketers are all about building a strong brand and forging lasting relationships with customers. It takes time to create a loyal fan base, and the efforts might not pay off immediately. It’s for this reason that it is often neglected, but the patience it requires is undoubtedly worth it. The investment is in marketing strategies that will grow the brand over time and keep customers coming back for more. Marketing teams are constantly fine-tuning their approach, adjusting campaigns, and analyzing results to ensure they’re on track to achieve long-term success. Patience and perseverance are key for marketing professionals as they work to create a solid foundation for the brand’s future growth. Similarities Between Sales and Marketing Shared Goal The most obvious thing that comes to mind when we talk about similarities is that sales goals and marketing ones are pretty much the same. Ultimately, it’s about growing the business. They might have different methods and focuses, but it’s all about making the company more successful. Customer-Centric Approach At the heart of both sales and marketing strategy is the customer. Both of them need to understand their customers and be able to tell what are their needs, preferences, pain points, and what floats their boat in general. All of that is crucial to tailor the messaging and strategies accordingly. Adaptability and flexibility The business world is like a roller coaster, full of twists, turns, and unexpected surprises. To stay ahead, both teams need to be as flexible as a yoga master. They must respond quickly to market changes, customer feedback, and new opportunities, always ready to refine their strategies and tactics to remain competitive and drive growth. Both of these worlds are those of constant development and keeping up to date. Slowing down for a while can mean losing ground to competitors and missing out on potential sales or leads. Collaboration and communication To achieve the best results, sales and marketing teams need to communicate effectively and collaborate closely. Sharing information and working together can create a seamless customer journey that changes random passersby into loyal customers. This teamwork involves sharing customer insights, aligning messaging, and coordinating strategies. The more these two departments can work together, the more successful their efforts will be. Conclusion Sales and marketing might seem like two sides of the same business coin, but they have their own unique ways of making things happen. While sales are all about connecting with people and sealing the deal, marketing is the mastermind behind creating interest and building the brand. Each team has its own focus, techniques, and skill sets, but they share the common goal of driving business growth. Thus, in the end, sales vs. marketing is just about pointing out the small differences that make each other special, but which together are a super-power for every business. It’s important to remember that a company’s success doesn’t come down to choosing one over the other. Instead, it’s about embracing their differences and ensuring they work together like a well-oiled machine. Understanding how each team operates, communicating effectively, and collaborating on strategies can create a customer experience that keeps people coming back for more. So, at the end of the day, it’s not about picking a winner in the sales vs. marketing debate. It’s about recognizing the value both bring to the table and harnessing their unique strengths to create a powerful, unstoppable force that drives your business forward.

Sales vs. Marketing: Understanding the Key Differences Table of Contents Sales and Marketing are like two seemingly inseparable twins – forever entwined in the world of business, similar, yet with their own distinct personalities. While they are just like two peas in a pod, working harmoniously towards a common goal – generating revenue, their approaches are as different as chalk and cheese. Understanding these differences is important not only for the effective operation of a company but also for unlocking its full potential. It’s as if you had a bike instead of a business. There are two wheels of the same size but different functions, and it is better to leave them like that. If they are treated as the same thing, or one is ignored, the bicycle loses its balance, making it difficult to ride smoothly and efficiently. Of course, there are statistics to back it up. In 2020 LinkedIn conducted a study and found that a whopping 87% of Sales and Marketing experts believe that teamwork between their departments helps businesses grow. Not only that, but 85% of them also think that getting Sales and Marketing on the same page is the golden ticket to boosting their overall business performance. Sales vs. Marketing By definition, the sales process is about selling products or services, and there is no money without it. Sometimes, “sales” can also refer to the money made or the quantity of items sold. It’s a crucial part of any company’s success, in both action and measurement, but we will be talking about the former. Marketing, on the other hand, is all about getting the word out about your products or services. It includes things like doing research to understand what customers want and using this information to grab people’s attention. So, it’s the fun, creative side of the business that helps people learn about and fall in love with what you’re selling. Purpose of Sales and Marketing In a big short: sales is all about closing the deal. It turns prospects into paying customers using numerous interpersonal techniques. A good salesperson is the one who can sweet-talk their way into getting a free dessert at a restaurant. They are the faces of the company who make sure that the right product or service finds a loving home in the arms of customers. Marketing, on the other hand, is the BFF of sales. It’s the wingman that sets the stage for sales to do its thing. The brand awareness lures potential customers into the sales funnel by creating interest, trust, and a bit of pizzazz. From catchy slogans to eye-popping visuals, marketing makes sure people know about your product and why they need it in their lives. The Difference Between Sales and Marketing Focus In the discussion on sales vs. marketing, their focus is the first element worth considering. The sales team’s main concern is the people. They’re the social butterflies of the business world, always eager to chat with potential customers, get to know them, and figure out what they need. They piece together clues to find the perfect solution for each individual prospect. They are passionate about building relationships as well as creating positive experiences that turn potential buyers into happy customers. They’re the ones who dream up and execute everything from attention-grabbing ads to engaging social media posts that capture the hearts and minds of potential customers. Beyond that, they’re constantly analyzing market trends and consumer behavior to ensure that their strategies remain relevant and effective.

The right motivation driven by a growth mindset is the key to learning and putting those ideas into action. Knowledge of the subject is of course the primary source that fuels growth. Ecommerce is a field that has seen tremendous growth in the last decade or so and it literally erupted after the pandemic. Global B2C ecommerce revenue is set to touch $5.5 trillion by 2027. This is a tremendous CAGR of 14.4%. Ecommerce is still a highly-evolving field where you stand a big chance to make it at the top.

Online courses provide a structured learning experience that is highly specific to ecommerce. Some of the best platforms are Udemy, Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, Google, Shopify Academy, SkillShare, etc. Pursuing an online course, whether short-term or long-term, in the field of ecommerce, means you have to put in a lot of effort. This requires time. For a busy ecommerce wannabe entrepreneur, sparing time is not an easy task, especially if you are still pursuing a course from a college or a university. There are assignments to be submitted on time and there are exams for which you need to prepare continuously. In these tricky situations, you might think ‘Can I pay someone to do my assignment?’ Yes, you can do that. There are assistive online education tools and sites that help you in continuing your learning without any hassles. While you progress in your ecommerce venture, expert academic writers do the papers for you. Industry blogs and podcasts Industry blogs and podcasts are the best way to acquire knowledge in ecommerce. Along with prolific bloggers like Brian Dean of Backlinko, Neil Patel, Mark Webster of Authority Hacker, and some others, they are champions in their fields. They form a great resource for digital marketing knowledge. With other specific blogs like Shopify, BigCommerce, Social Media Today, and Social Media Examiner, you can keep a hold on your business as much as you want. They’re free and some like Authority Hacker even offer podcasts. Books and eBooks The good old books to learn something – it can never go out of fashion.

The Card Collector’s Conundrum Pricing Blog Help Center FAQ Docs Contact Login Sign Up Tips, Tricks and Guides Your Go-To Guide On How To List And Sell Items On Multiple Platforms UpdatedOctober 2, 2023 Reading Time: 12 minutes According to Global Ecommerce Forecast conducted by Insider Intelligence, global e-commerce retail sales will pass $7 trillion by 2025. If you are in the reselling business this is the time to seize the opportunity and make a profit by reselling on various online marketplaces. Reselling platforms like Poshmark, Mercari, Depop, and others are broadening the playing field to compete with eBay’s market dominance. As a reseller, you can choose one platform for your business – but truly successful retailers are selling their items on various online marketplaces. This can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, so experienced resellers are using Crosslist’s multi-channel listing software to save time cross listing on the world’s largest online marketplaces. Keep reading and find all the information you need to take advantage of modern cross listing software and stay ahead of the reselling game. Do you need software to list on multiple platforms? Cross listing means posting the same item on various online selling platforms. A solid cross listing tool will allow you to concentrate on your online business while managing the inventory specifics of the multi-channel sales behind the scenes. With quality multi channel listing software, sellers can seamlessly list across different platforms. Moreover, they can track products effortlessly, establish credibility with cross-channel reviews, increase listing visibility and engagement, and save time. Ultimately, a good cross listing app will help you sell more items in less time. 5 reasons to use a cross listing app to sell items on multiple sites With many new marketplaces emerging, it is impossible to maintain a presence on multiple platforms without a cross listing app. Here are five compelling reasons why you should use cross listing software to level up your reselling business: 1. Helps build credibility Cross listing apps ensure that your products are seen by many customers. A bigger number of eyes on your merchandise might lead to more sales for your online company. Also, you can grow brand awareness if you cross post on multiple platforms. Of course, you have to describe your items using long tail and relevant keywords – so the search engines can recognize your listings. The more search queries your brand shows up – the more potential customers will get to know about your brand. If you manage to keep then you are on the right track. Research says that it costs between six to seven times more to get a new customer vs. keep the existing customers. Sellers and buyers are asked to review each other on several marketplaces. As you continue acquiring and selling, you can establish more credibility for your company based on honest consumer feedback. This could imply that you are: Top rated eBay seller Poshmark ambassador Mercari pro seller These certifications will demonstrate to potential consumers that you are a trustworthy seller. The easiest way to cross list on the world’s largest online marketplaces is by using cross listing software. Direct cross listing allows you to cross list a listing between marketplaces with just one mouse click. 2. Saves precious time Listing may appear to be a time-consuming operation, but it is far quicker than you think if you use a cross listing app. With Crosslist you can quickly list on marketplaces such as eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, Depop, and others. Crosslist is a web application that is accessible from any device. You just need to register an account to get started. Then select the marketplaces on which you want to list your product. This will dynamically generate the required product information relevant to those marketplaces. You can even use your mobile phone to take pictures of your products directly! Keep in mind that posting only works on your computer using Google Chrome with Crosslist extension installed and mobile devices can only be used to create listings. Crosslist will then automatically complete the required product information on these marketplaces, saving you precious time. Crossposting apps allow you to import existing listings from multiple marketplaces, and you can quickly crosspost your inventory to other marketplaces. Crosslist allows you to cross list your inventory between marketplaces using three different approaches: Direct cross listing Import in bulk Import one by one Direct cross listing Direct cross listing allows you to cross list multiple listings between marketplaces with just one mouse click. This is especially useful for when you want to copy your listings to other marketplaces without making any modifications to your listings. To direct cross listing, you simply need to navigate to a specific or your listing overview. From the listing overview, simply select the listings you want to cross list and click the Cross list button to begin the copying process to other marketplaces! Import in bulk When you import in bulk, first you have to import your listings into Crosslist. This can be useful if you want to make some modifications to your listings before cross listing them. After selecting the marketplace from which you want to import your listings, you will be redirected to a page that will automatically fetch all currently published listings that you previously posted on that marketplace. Here, you can select up to 10 listings to import at the same time. Crosslist will automatically sort the listings by date. For eBay, the limit has been increased to 20. One by one One by one listing is useful in case you have a very large inventory and only wish to make modifications to a few listings before cross listing them. In that case, it may be easier to navigate to the product detail page directly rather than searching for your listing in bulk import tool. 3. Helps small-to-medium resellers to diversify and go niche Selling your items on multiple channels means that you are not putting all of your eggs in one basket. That can cut the risks of not selling your items. If you don’t sell them on one marketplace – there is a good chance you will on another! Bear in mind that approximately 35% of consumers shop on niche marketplaces! This is why you need to research which items you can sell on specific marketplaces and familiarize yourself with the whole process. Learn what sells best in each marketplace and use cross listing software to list best-selling products. Here are some examples of top-selling items on eBay: Automotive: parts and accessories, air and fuel delivery, starters, alternators, ECUs and wiring, lighting and bulbs, motorcycle parts Clothing, shoes, and accessories Collectibles: military equipment, decorative collectibles, matchboxes… … You can check Poshmark trend reports to check trending categories, brands, and items. Usually, the best-selling items are clothes and accessories. Depop is a platform for selling unique fashion items, while Kidizen is a marketplace for secondhand children’s apparel. While some of the niche marketplaces have a smaller audience, they are often specifically geared to what you’re selling! 4. Allows you to have live customer support Cross listing apps are usually coming with great customer support. Crosslist prides itself on excellent customer support and if you check reviews on Trustpilot that seems to add up. Really happy with my experience so far. Makes cross listing to other platforms easy. Still some bugs in it but they are easy to overcome. Customer service is 2nd to none, I requested a feature and they implemented it within 24 hours!! Looking forward to using it with Etsy when that is integrated.”, is said in the last review. 5. Can help you to improve ROI Cross listing apps like Crosslist assist you in keeping track of all the available and sold products, the price they sold for, the platforms they sold on, and the date they get sold. By using this feature you will be sure you won’t sell one product twice. This will save your precious time with inventory management and ou will be able to focus on exclusively on the growth of your reselling business. Before cross listing, make sure you set up your products right! Before you begin cross listing, make sure you configure products properly so they may be submitted across multiple platforms. Here are some things to consider: 1. Optimizing item titles Although each marketplace’s requirements for item titles may differ slightly, such as the character count threshold, best practices are consistent across all marketplaces. Most marketplaces recommend including the brand, make, and model, and any relevant size, color, and material information, in the title. Your product titles must be compatible and also provide helpful information in a non-spammy manner. Including product nouns that customers frequently inquire about can be beneficial. For shoppers searching for “Nike Air Precision III basketball shoe,” for example, “Nike Air Precision III basketball shoe” may be a more relevant search title than “Nike Air Precision III.” 2. Optimizing product pages Your product pages must be optimized for better SEO rankings. Here are a few tips for optimization: Incorporate long-tail keywords into item titles and listing descriptions due to their specificity and higher click-through rates Pay attention to details when describing items. Include all necessary information and be specific. Optimize images for quick loading and alt-text containing your target keywords. Moreover, you can add video product descriptions and customer reviews. 3. Uploading multiple higher-quality images Product images have a significant impact on purchase decisions when it comes to shopping online. According to Justuno, visual appearance is a key factor for 93% of consumers when buying online. Make sure you include images of sufficient quality to capture the attention of your potential customers. To ensure you can list products, familiarize yourself with the marketplace’s image requirements. Most marketplaces require a high-resolution primary product image on a white background. Larger images offer greater detail, which can increase conversions leading to more sales. The Crosslist application helps you enhance images using their built-in photo editing tool. So, you can add captions or filters to pictures. 4. Setting fair prices Your price rates should be exact and accurate to avoid any misunderstanding. Price is a crucial factor influencing 74% of consumers, as per Shopify’s 2022 Future of Commerce Report. Behind every purchasing decision is a behavioral pattern. Customers are bound by internalized reference prices from previous experiences. When determining the fairness of a price, they compare it to the internal reference pricing points. Perception of price fairness is influenced by the customer-business relationship. This relationship is influenced by four factors: Transparency in pricing your products Conforming to competitive industry standards Being able to provide an explanation for price differences Maintaining price consistency while making price changes 5. Staying organized Organizing your inventory across several channels can save you time and money. Inventory management is an essential component of every reselling business, regardless of how much stock you have. If a company is not organized, it will not be scalable. Resellers manage their physical inventory in a variety of ways. Many people use garment hanging racks, sometimes organized by size or color. Other merchants employ shelf units, with some mechanism of determining what goes where. Most resellers use an [SKU system](https://fitsmallbusiness.com/sku-numbers/#:~:text=A%20stock%20keeping%20unit%20(SKU,%2Dsale%20(POS)%20software.) with corresponding bins. It goes without saying that assigning Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) to the products is vital. SKUs are one-of-a-kind identifiers assigned to each product to streamline the fulfillment and shipping processes. SKUs can be set in any way you see fit. However, they are typically classified based on the product line, brand, etc. Building an effective inventory management technique entails maintaining an orderly and straightforward structure. Organizing and streamlining inventory management can assist sellers in keeping track of inventory, avoiding overselling, and controlling product performance. 6. Managing shipping fees and times Keep any additional fees in mind when deciding which marketplaces to cross list on. Listing charges and transaction fees vary by platform, so bear that in mind while listing your items. Shipping fees are frequently included when listing items online. Be transparent on the shipping costs and who has to pay for it – the seller or the buyer. Prepare for additional costs by researching and adjusting the listing price to ensure a profit. Local pickup is now available as a delivery option on more reselling platforms, including OfferUp and Facebook Marketplace. Mercari Local offers a convenient way to buy and sell items locally without the meetup. This saves both buyers as well as resellers money on shipping fees. Always be cautious and adhere to the platform’s safety protocols when conducting in-person transactions. Your shipment times should be explicit and easily available to customers. It helps to minimize dissatisfaction with perceptions of late delivery. Pro tip: Always use one central platform and cross post to have all products in one place. It will make it much easier to automatically duplicate your product listings across multiple marketplaces. Using too many platforms without cross posting software will only cause headaches and a long line of dissatisfied customers. To avoid this, each reseller should have a single central platform where all inventory is listed first and then cross list to other places. Cross listing FAQ Making decisions regarding cross-listing may get confusing. So, here we list answers to some key questions to give insights suitable to your reselling business. 1. How to post items to sell on multiple sites at once? With Crosslist, you can quickly post items on multiple sites for selling all at once. Bulk import allows you to import 20 listings simultaneously in a few seconds. Or, you can directly cross list from one platform to another. Here are 4 simple steps for a seamless cross listing experience: Register a Crosslist account with a 3-day money-back guarantee Create new listings after selecting the marketplaces of your choice You can also import existing listings from various marketplaces to rapidly cross list your inventory on other platforms List your product on several marketplaces all at once Crosslist supports bulk posting, and direct and imported cross listing to the following marketplaces: eBay Poshmark Mercari Kidizen Tradesy Facebook (only direct cross listing, bulk posting, and single import supported) Depop Grailed Vinted 2. How often should I cross post? Knowing how many visits a platform receives might help you determine whether it is worthwhile to crosslink to, and if so, for how long. EBay.com, for example, is the second most popular website only behind Amazon, with a 13.43% share of visits and 1.7 billion monthly visits. Smaller platforms may not be quite there yet in terms of traffic, but they have a very engaged niche audience. Every online platform has its unique posting frequency. Let’s take the example of Poshmark. Most top sellers advise listing at least three items per day – or more. But the main secret for success on all marketplaces is fast crossposting.

Is cross listing safe? Yes, it is fully secure. Simply read the instructions on each site and ensure that they accept cross listing your products. Most cross-reference tools are compatible with accessibility software. They function similarly to your browser’s auto-completion feature. The software is not intended to be used to spam and disrupt any marketplace. Ensure that the selected tool does not request any of your marketplace login details. Crosslist, for example, will never ask for your password but simply control your browser through its browser extension! 4. What is the best cross listing app? Crosslist is the top pick for the modern seller who is always on the go, with features that outperform the older applications in many ways. Crosslist takes great pride in its elegant design and user-friendly interface. It also makes every effort to be as mobile-friendly as possible.

Your product titles must be compatible and also provide helpful information in a non-spammy manner. Including product nouns that customers frequently inquire about can be beneficial. For shoppers searching for “Nike Air Precision III basketball shoe,” for example, “Nike Air Precision III basketball shoe” may be a more relevant search title than “Nike Air Precision III.” 2. Optimizing product pages Your product pages must be optimized for better SEO rankings. Here are a few tips for optimization: Incorporate long-tail keywords into item titles and listing descriptions due to their specificity and higher click-through rates Pay attention to details when describing items. Include all necessary information and be specific. Optimize images for quick loading and alt-text containing your target keywords. Moreover, you can add video product descriptions and customer reviews. 3. Uploading multiple higher-quality images Product images have a significant impact on purchase decisions when it comes to shopping online. According to Justuno, visual appearance is a key factor for 93% of consumers when buying online. Make sure you include images of sufficient quality to capture the attention of your potential customers. To ensure you can list products, familiarize yourself with the marketplace’s image requirements. Most marketplaces require a high-resolution primary product image on a white background. Larger images offer greater detail, which can increase conversions leading to more sales. The Crosslist application helps you enhance images using their built-in photo editing tool. So, you can add captions or filters to pictures. 4. Setting fair prices Your price rates should be exact and accurate to avoid any misunderstanding. Price is a crucial factor influencing 74% of consumers, as per Shopify’s 2022 Future of Commerce Report. Behind every purchasing decision is a behavioral pattern. Customers are bound by internalized reference prices from previous experiences. When determining the fairness of a price, they compare it to the internal reference pricing points. Perception of price fairness is influenced by the customer-business relationship. This relationship is influenced by four factors: Transparency in pricing your products Conforming to competitive industry standards Being able to provide an explanation for price differences Maintaining price consistency while making price changes 5. Staying organized Organizing your inventory across several channels can save you time and money. Inventory management is an essential component of every reselling business, regardless of how much stock you have. If a company is not organized, it will not be scalable. Resellers manage their physical inventory in a variety of ways. Many people use garment hanging racks, sometimes organized by size or color. Other merchants employ shelf units, with some mechanism of determining what goes where. Most resellers use an [SKU system](https://fitsmallbusiness.com/sku-numbers/#:~:text=A%20stock%20keeping%20unit%20(SKU,%2Dsale%20(POS)%20software.) with corresponding bins. It goes without saying that assigning Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) to the products is vital. SKUs are one-of-a-kind identifiers assigned to each product to streamline the fulfillment and shipping processes. SKUs can be set in any way you see fit. However, they are typically classified based on the product line, brand, etc. Building an effective inventory management technique entails maintaining an orderly and straightforward structure. Organizing and streamlining inventory management can assist sellers in keeping track of inventory, avoiding overselling, and controlling product performance. 6. Managing shipping fees and times Keep any additional fees in mind when deciding which marketplaces to cross list on. Listing charges and transaction fees vary by platform, so bear that in mind while listing your items. Shipping fees are frequently included when listing items online. Be transparent on the shipping costs and who has to pay for it – the seller or the buyer. Prepare for additional costs by researching and adjusting the listing price to ensure a profit. Local pickup is now available as a delivery option on more reselling platforms, including OfferUp and Facebook Marketplace. Mercari Local offers a convenient way to buy and sell items locally without the meetup. This saves both buyers as well as resellers money on shipping fees. Always be cautious and adhere to the platform’s safety protocols when conducting in-person transactions. Your shipment times should be explicit and easily available to customers. It helps to minimize dissatisfaction with perceptions of late delivery. Pro tip: Always use one central platform and cross post to have all products in one place. It will make it much easier to automatically duplicate your product listings across multiple marketplaces. Using too many platforms without cross posting software will only cause headaches and a long line of dissatisfied customers. To avoid this, each reseller should have a single central platform where all inventory is listed first and then cross list to other places.

With millions of products, fierce competition, and the intricacies of digital marketing, it’s crucial to have a strong strategy in place.

They determine when and where your ads will appear. Here’s how you can find the right keywords for your products: ### Step-by-Step Keyword Research 1. **Use Amazon’s Search Bar**: Start typing relevant terms related to your product. Amazon will suggest popular searches, which can give you ideas on what customers are looking for. 2. **Utilize Tools**: Consider using keyword research tools like SellerMate, which can provide insights into search volume and competition for different keywords.
