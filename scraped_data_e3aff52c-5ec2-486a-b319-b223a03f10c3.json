The site's probably got some resources, too. Maybe they offer downloadable guides or even tools you can use to analyze your current backlink situation. It could be something like a backlink checker that shows you where you stand and what you need to do to improve. Sort of like a health check for your website’s visibility. If they’re really on the ball, there might be a community element. You know, a forum or a comment section where users share their experiences, successes, and maybe even the horror stories of link-building gone wrong. Because let’s be real, it can get messy out there in the SEO world! And let’s not forget that some of these sites might try to upsell you on services—like a monthly plan for backlink building or consulting.

So, all in all, https://getmorebacklinks.org/ is likely a resource for anyone looking to brush up on their backlink game.

Conclusion FAQs on Free Backlinks 1) Publish Original Research or Case Studies Original research and case studies can easily attract backlinks. People often link to content that offers unique data or solves specific problems. Begin with your own data, a survey, or a case study from the real world. For example, you may have helped some client double his traffic; you can write a case study explaining how you did it step by step. Why it Works: People trust content backed by data or real results. Unique insights make your site a go-to resource in your niche. Backlinko creates original research that’s highly useful, attracting free backlinks from top websites that cite their studies. 2) Create Engaging Infographics Infographics are one of the effective ways to get backlinks. The data will look attractive in a graphical sense that makes the information possible to understand and shareable. Start with a relevant topic to speak to your audience, perhaps from industry trends, insights gathered from data, or simple how-to guides. Then utilize free design tools such as Canva or Piktochart for clean and professional graphics. Keep it really simple and use some combination of charts and icons that will add a level of visual depth to the message; avoid filling up viewers with too much text. Once your infographic is ready, share it widely. Post it on your website and social media platforms, and even submit it to infographic directories like Visual.ly. When others find your infographic useful, they’re more likely to share it on their platforms and link back to your site. Quick Tip Include an embed code below your infographic to make it easy for others to share while giving credit to your website. 3) Offer Guest Posts Guest posting sometimes costs, mainly when the site you wish to target charges a fee for publishing. Still, free guest post opportunities exist, if approached the right way. How to Land Free Guest Posts Offer High-Quality Content: Blogs value unique, well-researched articles that provide real value to their readers. Show examples of your best work to prove you can deliver. Get Creative with Outreach: Personalize your outreach emails and stand out. Avoid using generic pitches, be engaging, do your homework, and add some personality. A little bit of humor or a creative subject line does wonders. Focus on the Right Blogs: Target blogs which are close to your niche and whose readers are quite active. Never fail to check whether the website is authentic or worthy of your effort. Sometimes, even without explicitly aiming for free opportunities, a well-crafted pitch and excellent content can earn you a free guest post. Use our list of free guest posting sites to get started! 4) Pitch for Broken Link Building Broken link building involves finding non-working links on other websites and suggesting your content as a replacement. It’s a straightforward way to earn backlinks while helping website owners improve their sites. To get started, use tools like Ahrefs or Broken Link Checker to identify broken links on relevant websites in your niche. Once you’ve found one, contact the site owner and politely point out the broken link. Offer your content as a replacement, explaining how it fits their page and adds value. This method works because website owners want to fix broken links to maintain their SEO and user experience. By providing a solution, you build goodwill and gain a high-quality backlink in return. Expert Tip! Personalize your outreach email. Mention the specific broken link and clearly explain how your content fills the gap—it increases your chances of success. 5) Claim Unlinked Mentions If people are discussing your business or website already but don’t link it, that’s free backlinks being missed. A simple and easy tactic to have unlinked mentions turned into backlinks is claiming them. First, you can use tools like BuzzSumo or Google Alerts to search for mentions of your brand or website. If you do not want to spend money, you can search for mentions yourself by Googling your business name and using search operators to filter out results from your website or social media pages. For example: Search for your brand name followed by -site:yourdomain.com to exclude your own site. Refine results by excluding major platforms like Facebook or Twitter if they’re not relevant. When you find an article mentioning your brand without a link, reach out to the site owner. Politely thank them for mentioning your business and ask if they’d consider adding a link to make it more helpful for their readers. Why It Works People are already aware of your brand, so it’s not a cold pitch. It’s a win-win situation, as adding the link improves their content and boosts your SEO. Set up Google Alerts to track mentions of your business in real-time. This saves time and ensures you don’t miss any new opportunities. 6) Answer Relevant Questions on Quora Quora is a great platform to build free backlinks by answering questions related to your expertise. It lets you share knowledge while subtly promoting your content. Start by identifying questions related to your niche or industry. Use Quora’s search bar to find topics where your knowledge can add value. Look for questions with high engagement, such as those with many followers or views, to maximize your reach. When answering, provide detailed and helpful responses. Include a link to your website, blog, or resource if it genuinely adds value to your answer. For example, if someone asks for tips on improving website traffic, you can briefly answer the question and link to a blog post offering more insights. Stay Authentic and Avoid Over-Promotion Quora’s moderators keep a close watch for spam. To avoid issues, only add links when they naturally fit into your answer and truly benefit the reader. This approach keeps your responses valuable and trustworthy, increasing the chances of readers engaging with your content. 7) Contribute to High-Quality Forums Forums are online communities where people discuss specific topics, and they can be a great place to share your expertise and earn free backlinks. These forums allow you to share insights, answer questions, and link to your content where it genuinely adds value. How to Get Started: Find Relevant Forums: Use tools like FindAForum or search for active communities in your industry. Create a Profile: Add your website or business details to your profile. Engage in Discussions: Contribute to threads with helpful advice. Link to your content only when it adds value to the conversation. Focus on Value: Share well-thought-out answers and resources that benefit readers. Stay Professional Always adhere to forum rules. Sharing irrelevant or excessive links can harm your credibility and might even result in a ban. Join forums with a good reputation and active users. High-quality forums not only provide high-quality free backlinks but also help establish your authority in your field. 8) Add Value to Wikipedia Wikipedia is a trusted resource where users can edit and create entries, often citing credible sources. Adding value to Wikipedia pages by contributing accurate and relevant information can be a way to earn free backlinks for your content. How to Add Links on Wikipedia: Find Relevant Pages: Search for topics related to your niche where you have expert knowledge or published resources. Look for Gaps or Broken Links: Some Wikipedia pages might have incomplete sections or “citation needed” tags, where your content can fit. Some articles with incomplete information often display the {{Incomplete list}} template. To find these: Visit Category:Incomplete lists to see articles marked as incomplete. Contribute Valuable Content: Edit the page by adding accurate information or replacing broken links with your content as a credible source. Ensure the information aligns with Wikipedia’s guidelines. Important Notes Wikipedia is strict about self-promotion. Always ensure your additions genuinely enhance the page. Links on Wikipedia are nofollow, meaning they won’t directly boost your SEO rankings. However, they can drive referral traffic and enhance credibility. Focus on creating high-quality content first. This increases the chances of your links being accepted as legitimate references by Wikipedia moderators. 9) Publish Trend-Focused Content When your content covers something new or popular in your industry, other websites are more likely to link to it. They want to share the latest and most useful information with their readers, and your content can become their go-to source. Start by keeping an eye on what’s trending in your field using tools like Google Trends or BuzzSumo. For example, if there’s a big change in your industry or a topic everyone is talking about, write a blog, create an infographic, or make a video explaining it. Being one of the first to publish something useful about a trend helps you attract more attention and links. Stay Shareable Add visuals, stats, or actionable tips to make your content easy to share. This increases its chances of earning free backlinks from other websites. 10) Submit Your Site to High-Quality Directories Directories act as online catalogs where businesses can showcase their services, making it easier for potential customers to find you. But it’s important to choose directories that are relevant to your business and have real value. Steps to Follow: Start with Well-Known Directories: Add your site to popular platforms like Google My Business, Yelp, or Bing Places. These directories are essential for local businesses and improving search visibility. Find Industry-Specific Directories: Look for directories that focus on your niche. For example: Tech companies: Crunchbase or Capterra Creative professionals: Behance or Dribbble Local services: Angie’s List or Chamber of Commerce Provide Complete Information: Include your name, address, phone number, website, and business details. Adding photos and a short, clear description of your business makes your listing more appealing. Keep Track of Submissions: Use a Google Sheet or a simple notepad to note where you’ve submitted your site. This will help you keep everything organized and update listings when needed. Focus on directories with real traffic and good authority. Avoid spammy sites that could harm your SEO. 11) Collaborate on Round-Up Posts Round-up posts are curated collections of top-quality content on a specific topic, shared by bloggers or niche enthusiasts. These can include articles, blogs, or podcasts and are usually published daily, weekly, or monthly. For website owners, round-up posts are an excellent way to gain free backlinks and build relationships within your industry. To find relevant round-up posts, start by using Google search operators like “your topic” + “monthly roundup.” Replace “your topic” with keywords relevant to your niche, such as “SEO tips” or “fitness trends.” Filtering results to show recent posts (within the last 1–3 months) will help you find active blogs and opportunities. Once you identify a suitable round-up, pitch your content to the creator. Highlight how your article adds value to their collection, ensuring it aligns with their audience’s interests. Always verify that the round-up includes trusted and ethical links to maintain your site’s credibility. 12) Host Free Webinars or Events Hosting free webinars or events is a practical way to earn free backlinks while offering something valuable to your audience. To get started, choose a topic that your audience finds useful. For example, if you run an SEO agency, you could host a webinar on “Simple SEO Tips to Boost Your Rankings.” Pick something that’s relevant and easy to understand. Create a dedicated page for your event with all the details, like the date, time, and how to register. Share this page through emails, social media, or forums to attract participants. The page itself can generate backlinks if people find it valuable enough to share. During the event, provide free resources like checklists or templates that attendees can use. After the webinar, upload the recording to your website or YouTube. This not only keeps the event content alive but also gives others a reason to link back to your website. Encourage attendees to share the event page or webinar recording on their blogs or social media, creating even more opportunities for backlinks. 13) Repurpose Existing Content You don’t need to create new content just to get backlinks. Sometimes, reusing old content saves time and yet contributes. For example, you take a long, detailed blog post and transform it into an infographic, video, or even a podcast. A nice infographic could bring you good quality free backlinks from blogs and social media as well. A long, detailed blog post can become a video tutorial you’ll upload to YouTube and may bring new chances for obtaining backlinks. Identify content that has performed well in the past. This could be a popular blog post, a case study, or a presentation. Update it with fresh insights or a new format, and share it on different platforms. Link It Back for Maximum Impact! Always include a link back to your original content when repurposing it for other platforms. This not only boosts your backlinks but also drives traffic to your site. 14) Contribute Testimonials When you have written a review of the product or service that you have used, many companies will show it on their website with a link to yours. That makes your relationship with the brand much stronger and gives you a free link. Reach out to companies whose products or services you genuinely use. Offer a short, specific testimonial that highlights the benefits you’ve experienced. For example, “Using this tool saved us 10 hours a week and simplified our workflow.” Target brands within your niche or industry to ensure the backlink adds SEO relevance and value to your website. 15) Reach Out for Resource Page Links Resource pages are curated lists of valuable tools, guides, or articles on a specific topic. Many websites use them to help their audience find trusted resources. If your content fits their topic, you can ask to be included in their list. Start by creating content that adds real value, such as a detailed guide, an actionable checklist, or a list of helpful tools. For example, a post like “Top 50 Free SEO Tools to Improve Rankings” can attract interest from resource page owners. Search for relevant resource pages using Google search operators like: “keyword + resources” “inurl:resources + your niche” Once you find a suitable page, contact the owner with a polite email explaining how your content can complement their list. Make sure your pitch is personalized and highlights the value of your content. Focus on resource pages within your industry to ensure the link is relevant and boosts your site’s authority. 16) Promote Content on Reddit Reddit has niche communities where their users actually discuss niche topics. It’s really the best place to share content while gaining free backlinks with the right strategy. To begin, find which subreddits are the most relevant to your topic. For example, as a digital marketer, consider communities like r/SEO or r/DigitalMarketing. Before posting, participate in the community for at least a little while just to get a feel for rules and preferences. When you share your content, make sure it provides value. For example, instead of just dropping a link, explain why the content is helpful. Add a brief summary, highlight key points, or share how it solves a problem. Reddit users appreciate genuine contributions and are quick to spot and flag promotional spam. Avoid overly promotional behavior. Focus on helping the community first, and only share links when they genuinely fit the discussion. This builds trust and credibility. 17) Participate in Online Competitions or Giveaways You can participate in online contests or giveaways, which can feature you on event sites or blogs; this is a quality backlink. Find events that are appropriate for your niche and participate appropriately, such as offering a product, service, or valuable resource. For example, if you run a fitness business, participating in a health-related competition or sponsoring a giveaway can result in your business being highlighted on the event page. This not only earns backlinks but also introduces your brand to a wider audience. Focus on competitions hosted by reputable websites with strong authority. This ensures the backlinks you earn are credible and beneficial for your SEO efforts. 18) Co-Create Content with Partners Working with industry partners allows you to create valuable content that combines expertise and reaches wider audiences. Whether it’s a guide, webinar, or blog post, this strategy not only adds depth to the content but also opens doors to sharing backlinks and traffic between both parties. For instance, a fitness coach and a nutritionist could team up to create a comprehensive health plan, showcasing their combined knowledge. Select partners who share your audience and values. A well-aligned collaboration ensures better engagement and meaningful backlinks. 19) Submit Press Releases to Free PR Sites Sharing updates through press releases on free pr sites can help spread the word about your business while earning valuable backlinks. How to use press releases effectively: Choose Reputable Platforms: Sites like PRLog and PR.com allow you to share news and gain visibility. Add Relevant Links: Link to your website or a specific page that relates to the announcement. Focus on Newsworthy Topics: Share updates like product launches, awards, or collaborations to make the content engaging. Keep your press release concise and informative. Avoid unnecessary jargon and focus on delivering value to readers. The global PR market is now valued at over $97 billion. 20) Leverage Social Media Platforms Social media is a simple way to share your content and reach more people. Platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, and Facebook Groups let you post your work in different ways that fit each audience. For example, use LinkedIn to share professional tips or Twitter for quick updates and links. Even though most social media links are no-follow, they can still add variety to your link profile and bring valuable traffic to your website. The key is to share content that helps your audience. Post naturally and avoid being overly promotional. Instead, focus on starting conversations or sharing useful information that others will want to share, too. Always engage with your audience by replying to comments and sharing insights. It not only builds trust but also improves the chances of earning free backlinks for SEO as your content gains traction. 21) Host an AMA (Ask Me Anything) Hosting an AMA (Ask Me Anything) lets you connect with your audience directly by answering their questions in real time. Platforms like Reddit, LinkedIn, or Twitter are ideal for these sessions. It’s an excellent opportunity to share your expertise while building backlinks naturally. When your AMA provides valuable insights, people are more likely to reference and link to it in their content. How to host an effective AMA:: Choose the Right Platform: Use Reddit for broader topics or LinkedIn for industry-specific discussions. Promote in Advance: Announce your AMA a few days before and encourage your audience to participate. Provide Thoughtful Answers: Focus on delivering detailed and helpful responses to build credibility and attract more links. 22) Promote Content on SlideShare or Scribd SlideShare and Scribd are great platforms to share your content in formats like presentations, PDFs, or documents. These platforms are widely used by professionals and learners, making them a powerful way to expand your reach and gain free SEO backlinks. How to get started: Transform Your Content: Take your blogs, guides, or reports and convert them into simple, visually appealing presentations or documents. Add Backlinks Smartly: Include links to your website in the description or within the content itself. This way, readers can easily visit your site. Focus on Keywords: Use relevant keywords in your titles and descriptions to increase visibility on these platforms. 23) Find Relevant Edu Backlinks Backlinks from .edu websites carry strong authority and can help improve your search rankings. Educational sites are highly trusted, so links from them give your website extra credibility. How to get Edu backlinks: Create Helpful Resources: Develop guides, tutorials, or tools that would benefit students, teachers, or researchers. Share these with relevant departments or educators. Scholarship Pages: Offer a scholarship, even a small one, and request to be listed on the university’s financial aid page. Collaborate with Faculty: Share insights or data with professors or researchers to support their projects, which might get you featured in their online publications or resources. Career Centers and Alumni Pages: If your business aligns with career development or offers resources for students and alumni, ask to be added to their directory or resource pages. Use tools like Ahrefs or Google Search to find universities with pages listing external resources. Tailor your outreach to show how your content adds value to their audience. 24) Provide Free Plugins or Widgets Creating free plugins or widgets for your audience can help you generate backlinks while offering value to users. These tools solve specific problems or add functionality to websites, making them highly shareable and link-worthy. For example, a plugin that helps optimize images for SEO or a widget showing weather updates can attract downloads and links from related websites. Ensure your tool includes a link back to your site, usually in the footer or settings. This way, every installation becomes a backlink opportunity. Promote your plugin or widget on relevant directories and forums to maximize reach. Keep the tool simple and user-friendly. A practical and easy-to-use plugin is more likely to gain traction and backlinks. Outreach Monks: Your Link-Building Partner!

Sometimes, even without explicitly aiming for free opportunities, a well-crafted pitch and excellent content can earn you a free guest post. Use our list of free guest posting sites to get started! 4) Pitch for Broken Link Building Broken link building involves finding non-working links on other websites and suggesting your content as a replacement. It’s a straightforward way to earn backlinks while helping website owners improve their sites. To get started, use tools like Ahrefs or Broken Link Checker to identify broken links on relevant websites in your niche. Once you’ve found one, contact the site owner and politely point out the broken link. Offer your content as a replacement, explaining how it fits their page and adds value. This method works because website owners want to fix broken links to maintain their SEO and user experience. By providing a solution, you build goodwill and gain a high-quality backlink in return. Expert Tip! Personalize your outreach email. Mention the specific broken link and clearly explain how your content fills the gap—it increases your chances of success. 5) Claim Unlinked Mentions If people are discussing your business or website already but don’t link it, that’s free backlinks being missed. A simple and easy tactic to have unlinked mentions turned into backlinks is claiming them. First, you can use tools like BuzzSumo or Google Alerts to search for mentions of your brand or website. If you do not want to spend money, you can search for mentions yourself by Googling your business name and using search operators to filter out results from your website or social media pages. For example: Search for your brand name followed by -site:yourdomain.com to exclude your own site. Refine results by excluding major platforms like Facebook or Twitter if they’re not relevant. When you find an article mentioning your brand without a link, reach out to the site owner. Politely thank them for mentioning your business and ask if they’d consider adding a link to make it more helpful for their readers. Why It Works People are already aware of your brand, so it’s not a cold pitch. It’s a win-win situation, as adding the link improves their content and boosts your SEO. Set up Google Alerts to track mentions of your business in real-time. This saves time and ensures you don’t miss any new opportunities. 6) Answer Relevant Questions on Quora Quora is a great platform to build free backlinks by answering questions related to your expertise. It lets you share knowledge while subtly promoting your content. Start by identifying questions related to your niche or industry. Use Quora’s search bar to find topics where your knowledge can add value. Look for questions with high engagement, such as those with many followers or views, to maximize your reach. When answering, provide detailed and helpful responses. Include a link to your website, blog, or resource if it genuinely adds value to your answer. For example, if someone asks for tips on improving website traffic, you can briefly answer the question and link to a blog post offering more insights. Stay Authentic and Avoid Over-Promotion Quora’s moderators keep a close watch for spam. To avoid issues, only add links when they naturally fit into your answer and truly benefit the reader. This approach keeps your responses valuable and trustworthy, increasing the chances of readers engaging with your content. 7) Contribute to High-Quality Forums Forums are online communities where people discuss specific topics, and they can be a great place to share your expertise and earn free backlinks. These forums allow you to share insights, answer questions, and link to your content where it genuinely adds value. How to Get Started: Find Relevant Forums: Use tools like FindAForum or search for active communities in your industry. Create a Profile: Add your website or business details to your profile. Engage in Discussions: Contribute to threads with helpful advice. Link to your content only when it adds value to the conversation. Focus on Value: Share well-thought-out answers and resources that benefit readers. Stay Professional Always adhere to forum rules. Sharing irrelevant or excessive links can harm your credibility and might even result in a ban. Join forums with a good reputation and active users. High-quality forums not only provide high-quality free backlinks but also help establish your authority in your field. 8) Add Value to Wikipedia Wikipedia is a trusted resource where users can edit and create entries, often citing credible sources. Adding value to Wikipedia pages by contributing accurate and relevant information can be a way to earn free backlinks for your content. How to Add Links on Wikipedia: Find Relevant Pages: Search for topics related to your niche where you have expert knowledge or published resources. Look for Gaps or Broken Links: Some Wikipedia pages might have incomplete sections or “citation needed” tags, where your content can fit. Some articles with incomplete information often display the {{Incomplete list}} template. To find these: Visit Category:Incomplete lists to see articles marked as incomplete. Contribute Valuable Content: Edit the page by adding accurate information or replacing broken links with your content as a credible source. Ensure the information aligns with Wikipedia’s guidelines. Important Notes Wikipedia is strict about self-promotion. Always ensure your additions genuinely enhance the page. Links on Wikipedia are nofollow, meaning they won’t directly boost your SEO rankings. However, they can drive referral traffic and enhance credibility. Focus on creating high-quality content first. This increases the chances of your links being accepted as legitimate references by Wikipedia moderators. 9) Publish Trend-Focused Content When your content covers something new or popular in your industry, other websites are more likely to link to it. They want to share the latest and most useful information with their readers, and your content can become their go-to source. Start by keeping an eye on what’s trending in your field using tools like Google Trends or BuzzSumo. For example, if there’s a big change in your industry or a topic everyone is talking about, write a blog, create an infographic, or make a video explaining it. Being one of the first to publish something useful about a trend helps you attract more attention and links. Stay Shareable Add visuals, stats, or actionable tips to make your content easy to share. This increases its chances of earning free backlinks from other websites. 10) Submit Your Site to High-Quality Directories Directories act as online catalogs where businesses can showcase their services, making it easier for potential customers to find you. But it’s important to choose directories that are relevant to your business and have real value. Steps to Follow: Start with Well-Known Directories: Add your site to popular platforms like Google My Business, Yelp, or Bing Places. These directories are essential for local businesses and improving search visibility. Find Industry-Specific Directories: Look for directories that focus on your niche. For example: Tech companies: Crunchbase or Capterra Creative professionals: Behance or Dribbble Local services: Angie’s List or Chamber of Commerce Provide Complete Information: Include your name, address, phone number, website, and business details. Adding photos and a short, clear description of your business makes your listing more appealing. Keep Track of Submissions: Use a Google Sheet or a simple notepad to note where you’ve submitted your site. This will help you keep everything organized and update listings when needed. Focus on directories with real traffic and good authority. Avoid spammy sites that could harm your SEO. 11) Collaborate on Round-Up Posts Round-up posts are curated collections of top-quality content on a specific topic, shared by bloggers or niche enthusiasts. These can include articles, blogs, or podcasts and are usually published daily, weekly, or monthly. For website owners, round-up posts are an excellent way to gain free backlinks and build relationships within your industry. To find relevant round-up posts, start by using Google search operators like “your topic” + “monthly roundup.” Replace “your topic” with keywords relevant to your niche, such as “SEO tips” or “fitness trends.” Filtering results to show recent posts (within the last 1–3 months) will help you find active blogs and opportunities. Once you identify a suitable round-up, pitch your content to the creator. Highlight how your article adds value to their collection, ensuring it aligns with their audience’s interests. Always verify that the round-up includes trusted and ethical links to maintain your site’s credibility. 12) Host Free Webinars or Events Hosting free webinars or events is a practical way to earn free backlinks while offering something valuable to your audience. To get started, choose a topic that your audience finds useful. For example, if you run an SEO agency, you could host a webinar on “Simple SEO Tips to Boost Your Rankings.” Pick something that’s relevant and easy to understand. Create a dedicated page for your event with all the details, like the date, time, and how to register. Share this page through emails, social media, or forums to attract participants. The page itself can generate backlinks if people find it valuable enough to share. During the event, provide free resources like checklists or templates that attendees can use. After the webinar, upload the recording to your website or YouTube. This not only keeps the event content alive but also gives others a reason to link back to your website. Encourage attendees to share the event page or webinar recording on their blogs or social media, creating even more opportunities for backlinks. 13) Repurpose Existing Content You don’t need to create new content just to get backlinks. Sometimes, reusing old content saves time and yet contributes. For example, you take a long, detailed blog post and transform it into an infographic, video, or even a podcast. A nice infographic could bring you good quality free backlinks from blogs and social media as well. A long, detailed blog post can become a video tutorial you’ll upload to YouTube and may bring new chances for obtaining backlinks. Identify content that has performed well in the past. This could be a popular blog post, a case study, or a presentation. Update it with fresh insights or a new format, and share it on different platforms. Link It Back for Maximum Impact! Always include a link back to your original content when repurposing it for other platforms. This not only boosts your backlinks but also drives traffic to your site. 14) Contribute Testimonials When you have written a review of the product or service that you have used, many companies will show it on their website with a link to yours. That makes your relationship with the brand much stronger and gives you a free link. Reach out to companies whose products or services you genuinely use. Offer a short, specific testimonial that highlights the benefits you’ve experienced. For example, “Using this tool saved us 10 hours a week and simplified our workflow.” Target brands within your niche or industry to ensure the backlink adds SEO relevance and value to your website. 15) Reach Out for Resource Page Links Resource pages are curated lists of valuable tools, guides, or articles on a specific topic. Many websites use them to help their audience find trusted resources. If your content fits their topic, you can ask to be included in their list. Start by creating content that adds real value, such as a detailed guide, an actionable checklist, or a list of helpful tools. For example, a post like “Top 50 Free SEO Tools to Improve Rankings” can attract interest from resource page owners. Search for relevant resource pages using Google search operators like: “keyword + resources” “inurl:resources + your niche” Once you find a suitable page, contact the owner with a polite email explaining how your content can complement their list. Make sure your pitch is personalized and highlights the value of your content. Focus on resource pages within your industry to ensure the link is relevant and boosts your site’s authority. 16) Promote Content on Reddit Reddit has niche communities where their users actually discuss niche topics. It’s really the best place to share content while gaining free backlinks with the right strategy. To begin, find which subreddits are the most relevant to your topic. For example, as a digital marketer, consider communities like r/SEO or r/DigitalMarketing. Before posting, participate in the community for at least a little while just to get a feel for rules and preferences. When you share your content, make sure it provides value. For example, instead of just dropping a link, explain why the content is helpful. Add a brief summary, highlight key points, or share how it solves a problem. Reddit users appreciate genuine contributions and are quick to spot and flag promotional spam. Avoid overly promotional behavior. Focus on helping the community first, and only share links when they genuinely fit the discussion. This builds trust and credibility. 17) Participate in Online Competitions or Giveaways You can participate in online contests or giveaways, which can feature you on event sites or blogs; this is a quality backlink. Find events that are appropriate for your niche and participate appropriately, such as offering a product, service, or valuable resource. For example, if you run a fitness business, participating in a health-related competition or sponsoring a giveaway can result in your business being highlighted on the event page. This not only earns backlinks but also introduces your brand to a wider audience. Focus on competitions hosted by reputable websites with strong authority. This ensures the backlinks you earn are credible and beneficial for your SEO efforts. 18) Co-Create Content with Partners Working with industry partners allows you to create valuable content that combines expertise and reaches wider audiences. Whether it’s a guide, webinar, or blog post, this strategy not only adds depth to the content but also opens doors to sharing backlinks and traffic between both parties. For instance, a fitness coach and a nutritionist could team up to create a comprehensive health plan, showcasing their combined knowledge. Select partners who share your audience and values. A well-aligned collaboration ensures better engagement and meaningful backlinks. 19) Submit Press Releases to Free PR Sites Sharing updates through press releases on free pr sites can help spread the word about your business while earning valuable backlinks. How to use press releases effectively: Choose Reputable Platforms: Sites like PRLog and PR.com allow you to share news and gain visibility. Add Relevant Links: Link to your website or a specific page that relates to the announcement. Focus on Newsworthy Topics: Share updates like product launches, awards, or collaborations to make the content engaging. Keep your press release concise and informative. Avoid unnecessary jargon and focus on delivering value to readers. The global PR market is now valued at over $97 billion. 20) Leverage Social Media Platforms Social media is a simple way to share your content and reach more people. Platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, and Facebook Groups let you post your work in different ways that fit each audience. For example, use LinkedIn to share professional tips or Twitter for quick updates and links. Even though most social media links are no-follow, they can still add variety to your link profile and bring valuable traffic to your website. The key is to share content that helps your audience. Post naturally and avoid being overly promotional. Instead, focus on starting conversations or sharing useful information that others will want to share, too. Always engage with your audience by replying to comments and sharing insights. It not only builds trust but also improves the chances of earning free backlinks for SEO as your content gains traction. 21) Host an AMA (Ask Me Anything) Hosting an AMA (Ask Me Anything) lets you connect with your audience directly by answering their questions in real time. Platforms like Reddit, LinkedIn, or Twitter are ideal for these sessions. It’s an excellent opportunity to share your expertise while building backlinks naturally. When your AMA provides valuable insights, people are more likely to reference and link to it in their content. How to host an effective AMA:: Choose the Right Platform: Use Reddit for broader topics or LinkedIn for industry-specific discussions. Promote in Advance: Announce your AMA a few days before and encourage your audience to participate. Provide Thoughtful Answers: Focus on delivering detailed and helpful responses to build credibility and attract more links. 22) Promote Content on SlideShare or Scribd SlideShare and Scribd are great platforms to share your content in formats like presentations, PDFs, or documents. These platforms are widely used by professionals and learners, making them a powerful way to expand your reach and gain free SEO backlinks. How to get started: Transform Your Content: Take your blogs, guides, or reports and convert them into simple, visually appealing presentations or documents. Add Backlinks Smartly: Include links to your website in the description or within the content itself. This way, readers can easily visit your site. Focus on Keywords: Use relevant keywords in your titles and descriptions to increase visibility on these platforms. 23) Find Relevant Edu Backlinks Backlinks from .edu websites carry strong authority and can help improve your search rankings. Educational sites are highly trusted, so links from them give your website extra credibility. How to get Edu backlinks: Create Helpful Resources: Develop guides, tutorials, or tools that would benefit students, teachers, or researchers. Share these with relevant departments or educators. Scholarship Pages: Offer a scholarship, even a small one, and request to be listed on the university’s financial aid page. Collaborate with Faculty: Share insights or data with professors or researchers to support their projects, which might get you featured in their online publications or resources. Career Centers and Alumni Pages: If your business aligns with career development or offers resources for students and alumni, ask to be added to their directory or resource pages. Use tools like Ahrefs or Google Search to find universities with pages listing external resources. Tailor your outreach to show how your content adds value to their audience. 24) Provide Free Plugins or Widgets Creating free plugins or widgets for your audience can help you generate backlinks while offering value to users. These tools solve specific problems or add functionality to websites, making them highly shareable and link-worthy. For example, a plugin that helps optimize images for SEO or a widget showing weather updates can attract downloads and links from related websites. Ensure your tool includes a link back to your site, usually in the footer or settings. This way, every installation becomes a backlink opportunity. Promote your plugin or widget on relevant directories and forums to maximize reach. Keep the tool simple and user-friendly. A practical and easy-to-use plugin is more likely to gain traction and backlinks. Outreach Monks: Your Link-Building Partner!

Start Now From day one, backlinks have been the foundation of search engine rankings. In this post, we’ll bring you 18 actionable strategies to secure new backlinks for yourself and your clients. We’ve been in the backlinks business for over ten years now, and in our experience, these are the 18 most effective, scalable, and creative ways to acquire backlinks. Skyscraper Content Technique The skyscraper content technique is a simple yet proven tactic. It doesn’t just set you up to acquire new links but also establishes you as an authority in your industry. It’s called skyscraper content as you outcompete other articles building yours up higher than anyone else. The first step is to identify an article in your industry that is already performing well. Performing well doesn’t mean ranking well necessarily. We want to identify the article that is getting the most links. You can use SEO tools for this such as Ahrefs or SEMrush. Select the top performer for links. This piece of content you know the ‘linkerati’ favours will form the basis for your skyscraper content. Now for the slightly trickier bit. You need to make your own version of this content but better. “Better” can be hard to define, but you’ll likely want to make it longer, more engaging, and more comprehensive. Is the average word count for the top 5 results 2500 words? Aim for 3000. Does it include generic royalty-free images and boring screenshots? Create custom graphics and dynamic GIFs. If the top result lists 10 suggestions, then aim for 15. By creating a more exhaustive piece of content, you establish yourself as an authority in your industry. Need a hand creating skyscraper content? Why not take a look at our Content Writing Services. Pitching Skyscraper Content It’s not enough just to make an awesome piece of content, though. You need to let people know about it. This part can be a bit more technical as you analyse your competitor’s backlink profile. You want to find high authority, highly relevant sites that link to the competing article you based yours on. You can then pitch your article to those sites as an even better version of that resource. The site will naturally want to link to the most helpful resources available for their readers and, hopefully, they’ll be happy to switch to linking to you instead. With this method only have you secured a shiny new link, but you’ve sniped one away from a competitor – win-win! Listicles and How-Tos Everyone loves a listicle. They’re snacky, shareable and can provide an easy win for engaging content (which is exactly why we’re producing this)! Like the skyscraper content above, industry-relevant listicles allow you to flex your industry knowledge, wowing your readers and positioning you as an expert in your space. Take our SEO Tips article, for example. This is one of our best-performing pieces as it provides a range of actionable tips in an easy-to-follow manner. An ideal listicle is focused enough to rank well for specific industry terms, while the broader nature of the piece means readers are likely to find something relevant to them, even if they can’t action every tip. Similarly, a How To article is a perfect opportunity to demonstrate your expertise while providing your reader with genuinely helpful content. Providing a How To of a service you provide might seem counter-intuitive but don’t despair. The reader will appreciate the opportunity to understand the process better, They may well give it a go themselves and, once they realise what a hassle it is, turn to you instead. Listicles and How Tos/Guides drive 38% more traffic than other article types. The more traffic you get, the more likely you are to receive new backlinks from people sharing and reposting that excellent new content you’re publishing. It could also rank very well for related terms, which naturally attracts backlinks too. Get Featured In Best X in Y Articles As we established above, everyone loves a listicle, so why not work to appear in one? “Best X in Y” posts are lists that summarise the best products/services/businesses in a given location or industry. They might, for example, be “The Best Bike Shop in Birmingham” or “Best Payment Gateway for Small Businesses”. Getting featured in these lists is a fantastic win for multiple reasons. Firstly, you’ve got a shiny new backlink, possibly from a high-authority or niche-specific site. Secondly, you’ve unlocked the potential for more traffic people see you come highly recommended from within the article. Finally, you’re boosting your credibility as a powerhouse in your sector or location. It’s all wins! To get featured in such articles, you’ll need to shortlist some targets. Use some search terms where these articles may appear. Contact the site owner and ask to be included. Also, make it easy for them. Give them the exact text and images formatted correctly so they can just add it in. It’s a win win situation! Get Featured In Resource Roundups Resource pages are posts that collate many links that are all related to a certain topic. One example would be this SEO Resource page but there are many, many examples for every sector and industry you can think of. The super simple concept of this strategy is that you contact any resource sites that are relevant to your industry and ask to be included in their pages. Don’t worry, these sites often have submission forms so you won’t need to come up with pitch emails most of the time! These pages are specifically designed to be relevant to your industry (and we all know relevance is key). Infographic Creation & Outreach Infographics are an incredible resource for winning backlinks. Easily shareable, visually engaging, and informative – a good infographic has it all. Just look at the number of impressions this article on NASA’s clean air infographic had – 740k views plus! The difficult part is creating the infographic, but plenty of services exist to help you with that! Once you’ve created the infographic you can start pitching it to bloggers and other outlets with a solid outreach process. Social media can also be a great home for infographics where they can be shared and reshared generating buzz and links as they go. Did you know we have an Infographic Design service? It pairs perfectly with our Infographic Outreach service too! Give Out Testimonials We all know it’s great to get a good testimonial that you can display proudly on your site. Rave reviews can help reassure potential clients and Google, promoting the trustworthiness of your business. But did you know they can also help you secure backlinks when you give out testimonials? Sites will often have a dedicated reviews and testimonials page. They want to brag about the credentials of those giving them reviews and will include a link to your company so that customers can see you know what you’re talking about. This approach is so beneficial as it; Gets you new backlinks Expands your network within your industry Makes you look like an authority in your industry You can pair this strategy with our earlier listicle suggestion to help pull the backlinks in. First, you can produce a well-researched listicle that is relevant to your industry. It could even be a ‘Best X in Y’ style post. Include outbound links to each company/product that you mention. Once you have published the post, contact the businesses you mention to highlight your positive coverage. If the site owner is suitably impressed, they might include a snippet as part of their testimonials page. Alternatively, they may reshare the article, again generating potential clicks and new links as it gets shared again and again. Get Reviews Okay, so you’re generating links by reviewing other businesses, but why not get them reviewing you? Reviews will naturally include links to the sites and products they cover, making them an excellent resource for new backlinks. They won’t just come to you, however. You need to put the work in. Search for industry-relevant terms and reviews to find publications and sites covering your niche. You can then draft a pitch email suggesting one of your products for them to review and why you feel it’d be worth their while to cover you. Remember, they get 10s, if not 100s, of these pitches every day, so you’ll need to stand out. Of course, you run the risk of negative coverage here, but if you back yourself, and your product, this strategy is an absolute winner. If Google sees you’re well-reviewed by industry leaders, you’re well on your way to some major SERP rewards. Stockist/Supplier Links A quick but underrated win for eCommerce sites here. If you stock a certain brand, why not contact them to get included on their stockist/supplier pages? If a company you stock has a “where to buy” page, and you’re listed on it, you’re perfectly set to acquire new traffic with specific purchase-oriented search intent. How good is that?! A similar approach can be taken even if you don’t sell physical goods. Perhaps you use certain software as a fundamental part of your services? Contact them to let them know. Perhaps you can get included in a “trusted by” carousel on their homepage? Give Donations Okay, this one is possibly a little morally ambiguous if you only donate to a cause to secure a backlink. But you wouldn’t do that, right? Of course you wouldn’t, so this suggestion is all upside! Find a great cause, ideally one in some way related to your niche, and donate away! If you build a great rapport with a non-profit or charity, they might be happy to list you on their site as a proud supporter. Remember, you’re not buying a backlink here. Make sure it’s a cause you want to be associated with anyway and, if you’re lucky, a backlink or two may come your way. Isn’t karma great? Guest Blogging An oldie, but a goodie. For as long as there have been bloggers, there has been guest blogging. Bloggers love to keep their sites ticking over with relevant content and webmasters love to get links – it’s a match made in heaven. The basic process is that you pitch an industry-relevant blogger a brand new article that just happens to include a link back to your site, among all the other great content. As simple as this sounds, it’s sadly a very manual process. First, you need to source relevant bloggers and their contact details. You next need to establish friendly contact. We’d advise checking their open to pitches before just blasting away! Once you’ve ascertained they’re happy to entertain the idea of a guest post, you need to get pitching. For best success, you’ll want to create a unique piece of content that leverages your position as an expert in your area. They need to want to post this article. Once this is done, you just need to sit back and wait for the new post to go live, hopefully with a lovely little follow link back to you. Of course, it’s sadly not always plain sailing. Bloggers can say no, timelines and promises can fall through, and so on. Need some inspiration for outreach tactics? Check out our post on Blogger Outreach Hacks here! Think this sounds like a lot of manual hassle? Why not take a look at our Blogger Outreach service to get it done for you. Podcasts/Interviews Podcasts are booming right now. As well as presenting a great opportunity to promote your brand story podcasts can be a great way of quickly securing new links. Podcasters will include show notes with any new episode, typically including a link to the credentials/website of any guests they have – including you. These notes will be published and republished any time the content is syndicated to another platform securing you more and more links! As well as getting you links, these provide a great opportunity, once again, to emphasise your expertise. Podcasts can tap into hyper-relevant niche audiences that commercial radio could never sustain, meaning you’ll appear to your exact target audience without any wasted exposure. Don’t forget, you can also sponsor a podcast for some easy links too! Outreach To Journalists Journalist quote sourcing is an invaluable resource for SEOs. It wasn’t meant to be, but it’s now used to secure high-impact, relevant links. To get started with a typical journalist source platform, you need to sign up as an expert resource. Once you have done so, you’ll receive daily updates with queries from writers covering your industry. You can review the questions and submit your responses to any you feel you can answer. Don’t just reply to any old query; make sure you really know your onions. These reporters will get tens or even hundreds of responses. If the journalist chooses to include your quote/answer you’ll receive an email to let you know. This is another great way to establish your voice as an expert in your field while securing relevant backlinks for your site. Don’t fancy pouncing on every request that comes into your inbox? Have a look at our expert links service where we’ll handle it all for you. Press Releases Old hat? Yes. Still effective? Yes. Press Releases are a classic means of securing new backlinks while generating some buzz about your business. Newsworthy developments tend to go hand-in-hand with brand new pages on your site just crying out for some links. For example, if you’ve just launched a new service, you can schedule a press release to help promote the new launch. Another avenue is to publish authoritative new research and studies. With the correct expertise, these posts can generate real press interest and buzz that you can capitalise on. One word of caution – don’t overdo them! For most businesses, a press release should come with some real fanfare. They shouldn’t be a bi-weekly occurrence. Check out our blog post on writing a winning press release if you want some tips on preparing your own release for distribution. Along with the methods recommended above, these link building tactics form the basis of Digital PR, the newset trend in link building and digital marketing. Want it handled for you? Our Press Distribution service has you covered. Directories Directories haven’t died! Working with the right directories can help solidify your local SEO. You can also work with niche-specific directories to ensure you appear in front of the right people. These directories will typically include a link back to your site. This means you’re securing contextually relevant links that also help your prospective customers find you. They also provide good trust signals to Google, as long as you’re in reputable directories! Create Free Tools Our free tools are an absolute goldmine, and not just because of how useful they are. Free tools are a great way to get your brand out there and to start populating email lists, but they can also be leveraged for links. It’s easy enough to find potential tool opportunities in your niche. Start with some basic research for “industry terms” + “tools” and see what dominates the SERPs. Once you’ve figured out which tool is most relevant to your business, you need to look at making your own version. This is the tricky bit. If you don’t have an in-house development team, you’ll need to look to sites like Fiverr to find someone to help. Be sure to work alongside them to make it clear what will make your tool better than your competitors. Broken Link Building Another classic strategy, albeit a bit of a time-consuming one. Put simply, this is the process of finding existing broken links and contacting webmasters to suggest they replace those broken links with shiny new ones to a relevant page from your site. There are two directions you might go in for this process. Tactic One is to research industry-relevant blogs. Once you’ve found a blog that posts relevant content you can trawl through their blog posts to find articles that contain broken links. Next you can find the closest match to that original link on your site. Perhaps you have a post that covers a similar topic, or a competing product/service? After you’ve determined which link you want to suggest you’ll need to contact the webmaster. Alert them to the broken link (it might be worth mentioning the SEO damage they can cause) and suggest your link as a replacement. Alternatively, you could go for a competitor-first approach. Start this method by selecting a competitor in your niche. Next, analyse their domain for any broken pages. Find a page that is broken that you have a close competitor to. Find out which external sites are linking to that page. Contact the most relevant opportunities to let them know that they currently have a broken link but not to worry, you’ve got an excellent replacement right here! These strategies not only secure you new links but they help rid the world of the scourge of broken links. Aren’t you just wonderful? Bonus Strategy: Rebuilding Broken Links So you’ve seen how to nab yourself some new links from competitors that have dropped the ball but remember – the same can happen to you! Use external SEO tools to monitor your own backlink profile and site performance, and be sure to keep on top of any potential downed pages. If a page is dead on your site, consider fixing it or implementing a redirect. You might also want to contact any website that is using a broken link and gently suggest they update it to a new, working one. You’ve put in all this work to get links, don’t let that go to waste by neglecting them once they’ve gone live! Target Unlinked Brand Mentions You’ve seen how to fix links, but how about creating them where none existed before? Sourcing unlinked brand mentions is the process of finding pages that mention you by name but don’t currently link to you. Much like broken link building, you’ll want to track down the site owner and suggest that what would make their post even better is including a link to you. You can sweeten the deal by mentioning the improved experience this will give their reader, or maybe even suggest an affiliate code, so they get a little kickback. They’ve already proven they’re happy to mention you (ideally in a positive light) so they may well be happy to chuck in a link to you too. Internal Links Okay, so these aren’t quite new backlinks but neglect them at your peril! Internal links are a vital part of your overall sitemap and can help funnel authority and ‘link juice’ precisely where you need it. Luckily smart plugins like Link Whisper exist to handle this for you. A proper internal link structure will help ensure you’re best-placed to get full value from all those brand new links you’ve secured using the methods above. Got Any Other Ideas?

Start Now From day one, backlinks have been the foundation of search engine rankings. In this post, we’ll bring you 18 actionable strategies to secure new backlinks for yourself and your clients. We’ve been in the backlinks business for over ten years now, and in our experience, these are the 18 most effective, scalable, and creative ways to acquire backlinks. Skyscraper Content Technique The skyscraper content technique is a simple yet proven tactic. It doesn’t just set you up to acquire new links but also establishes you as an authority in your industry. It’s called skyscraper content as you outcompete other articles building yours up higher than anyone else. The first step is to identify an article in your industry that is already performing well. Performing well doesn’t mean ranking well necessarily. We want to identify the article that is getting the most links. You can use SEO tools for this such as Ahrefs or SEMrush. Select the top performer for links. This piece of content you know the ‘linkerati’ favours will form the basis for your skyscraper content. Now for the slightly trickier bit. You need to make your own version of this content but better. “Better” can be hard to define, but you’ll likely want to make it longer, more engaging, and more comprehensive. Is the average word count for the top 5 results 2500 words? Aim for 3000. Does it include generic royalty-free images and boring screenshots? Create custom graphics and dynamic GIFs. If the top result lists 10 suggestions, then aim for 15. By creating a more exhaustive piece of content, you establish yourself as an authority in your industry. Need a hand creating skyscraper content? Why not take a look at our Content Writing Services. Pitching Skyscraper Content It’s not enough just to make an awesome piece of content, though. You need to let people know about it. This part can be a bit more technical as you analyse your competitor’s backlink profile. You want to find high authority, highly relevant sites that link to the competing article you based yours on. You can then pitch your article to those sites as an even better version of that resource. The site will naturally want to link to the most helpful resources available for their readers and, hopefully, they’ll be happy to switch to linking to you instead. With this method only have you secured a shiny new link, but you’ve sniped one away from a competitor – win-win! Listicles and How-Tos Everyone loves a listicle. They’re snacky, shareable and can provide an easy win for engaging content (which is exactly why we’re producing this)! Like the skyscraper content above, industry-relevant listicles allow you to flex your industry knowledge, wowing your readers and positioning you as an expert in your space. Take our SEO Tips article, for example. This is one of our best-performing pieces as it provides a range of actionable tips in an easy-to-follow manner. An ideal listicle is focused enough to rank well for specific industry terms, while the broader nature of the piece means readers are likely to find something relevant to them, even if they can’t action every tip. Similarly, a How To article is a perfect opportunity to demonstrate your expertise while providing your reader with genuinely helpful content. Providing a How To of a service you provide might seem counter-intuitive but don’t despair. The reader will appreciate the opportunity to understand the process better, They may well give it a go themselves and, once they realise what a hassle it is, turn to you instead. Listicles and How Tos/Guides drive 38% more traffic than other article types. The more traffic you get, the more likely you are to receive new backlinks from people sharing and reposting that excellent new content you’re publishing. It could also rank very well for related terms, which naturally attracts backlinks too. Get Featured In Best X in Y Articles As we established above, everyone loves a listicle, so why not work to appear in one? “Best X in Y” posts are lists that summarise the best products/services/businesses in a given location or industry. They might, for example, be “The Best Bike Shop in Birmingham” or “Best Payment Gateway for Small Businesses”. Getting featured in these lists is a fantastic win for multiple reasons. Firstly, you’ve got a shiny new backlink, possibly from a high-authority or niche-specific site. Secondly, you’ve unlocked the potential for more traffic people see you come highly recommended from within the article. Finally, you’re boosting your credibility as a powerhouse in your sector or location. It’s all wins! To get featured in such articles, you’ll need to shortlist some targets. Use some search terms where these articles may appear. Contact the site owner and ask to be included. Also, make it easy for them. Give them the exact text and images formatted correctly so they can just add it in. It’s a win win situation! Get Featured In Resource Roundups Resource pages are posts that collate many links that are all related to a certain topic. One example would be this SEO Resource page but there are many, many examples for every sector and industry you can think of. The super simple concept of this strategy is that you contact any resource sites that are relevant to your industry and ask to be included in their pages. Don’t worry, these sites often have submission forms so you won’t need to come up with pitch emails most of the time! These pages are specifically designed to be relevant to your industry (and we all know relevance is key). Infographic Creation & Outreach Infographics are an incredible resource for winning backlinks. Easily shareable, visually engaging, and informative – a good infographic has it all. Just look at the number of impressions this article on NASA’s clean air infographic had – 740k views plus! The difficult part is creating the infographic, but plenty of services exist to help you with that! Once you’ve created the infographic you can start pitching it to bloggers and other outlets with a solid outreach process. Social media can also be a great home for infographics where they can be shared and reshared generating buzz and links as they go. Did you know we have an Infographic Design service? It pairs perfectly with our Infographic Outreach service too! Give Out Testimonials We all know it’s great to get a good testimonial that you can display proudly on your site. Rave reviews can help reassure potential clients and Google, promoting the trustworthiness of your business. But did you know they can also help you secure backlinks when you give out testimonials? Sites will often have a dedicated reviews and testimonials page. They want to brag about the credentials of those giving them reviews and will include a link to your company so that customers can see you know what you’re talking about. This approach is so beneficial as it; Gets you new backlinks Expands your network within your industry Makes you look like an authority in your industry You can pair this strategy with our earlier listicle suggestion to help pull the backlinks in. First, you can produce a well-researched listicle that is relevant to your industry. It could even be a ‘Best X in Y’ style post. Include outbound links to each company/product that you mention. Once you have published the post, contact the businesses you mention to highlight your positive coverage. If the site owner is suitably impressed, they might include a snippet as part of their testimonials page. Alternatively, they may reshare the article, again generating potential clicks and new links as it gets shared again and again. Get Reviews Okay, so you’re generating links by reviewing other businesses, but why not get them reviewing you? Reviews will naturally include links to the sites and products they cover, making them an excellent resource for new backlinks. They won’t just come to you, however. You need to put the work in. Search for industry-relevant terms and reviews to find publications and sites covering your niche. You can then draft a pitch email suggesting one of your products for them to review and why you feel it’d be worth their while to cover you. Remember, they get 10s, if not 100s, of these pitches every day, so you’ll need to stand out. Of course, you run the risk of negative coverage here, but if you back yourself, and your product, this strategy is an absolute winner. If Google sees you’re well-reviewed by industry leaders, you’re well on your way to some major SERP rewards. Stockist/Supplier Links A quick but underrated win for eCommerce sites here. If you stock a certain brand, why not contact them to get included on their stockist/supplier pages? If a company you stock has a “where to buy” page, and you’re listed on it, you’re perfectly set to acquire new traffic with specific purchase-oriented search intent. How good is that?! A similar approach can be taken even if you don’t sell physical goods. Perhaps you use certain software as a fundamental part of your services? Contact them to let them know. Perhaps you can get included in a “trusted by” carousel on their homepage? Give Donations Okay, this one is possibly a little morally ambiguous if you only donate to a cause to secure a backlink. But you wouldn’t do that, right? Of course you wouldn’t, so this suggestion is all upside! Find a great cause, ideally one in some way related to your niche, and donate away! If you build a great rapport with a non-profit or charity, they might be happy to list you on their site as a proud supporter. Remember, you’re not buying a backlink here. Make sure it’s a cause you want to be associated with anyway and, if you’re lucky, a backlink or two may come your way. Isn’t karma great? Guest Blogging An oldie, but a goodie. For as long as there have been bloggers, there has been guest blogging. Bloggers love to keep their sites ticking over with relevant content and webmasters love to get links – it’s a match made in heaven. The basic process is that you pitch an industry-relevant blogger a brand new article that just happens to include a link back to your site, among all the other great content. As simple as this sounds, it’s sadly a very manual process. First, you need to source relevant bloggers and their contact details. You next need to establish friendly contact. We’d advise checking their open to pitches before just blasting away! Once you’ve ascertained they’re happy to entertain the idea of a guest post, you need to get pitching.

Ready to Start Building Backlinks? 1. Quality > Quantity. And quality is typically time-consuming and more expensive. This first strategy is more about what you shouldn’t do. Newcomers are often tempted to build as many links as possible, without putting much thought into which types of links they build or how they build them. Before you even start link building, make sure you have a clear vision. What are you trying to accomplish? Which links will help you the most? What links could hurt? Based on technical keyword research, what phrases do you want to rank for? Have you developed an anchor text strategy for your outreach? It’s much better to build a small number of extremely helpful links than a large number of links that might hurt you in the long run. Be VERY picky about the links you work to acquire manually: Work to be that guy or gal in your organization that won’t take or stand for acquiring garbage backlinks! 2. Relevance > Authority. Good links exist in context. A lengthy URL existing by itself in a forum comment isn’t going to get much positive attention; it isn’t helpful, valuable, or even natural. But a link embedded as a citation to a resource page, or a solidly written article is a different story. When building links, your first priority should be the content housing your link, and the context that justifies its existence. Focus on: Links from quality sites Links embedded in quality content Links using appropriate anchor text (depending on your existing profile) Links that point to a relevant page to the content topic AND the referring domain Without good content as a backbone, your link building strategy won’t get far. 3. High DA > Low DA (duh). Google judges not just the number of linking domains to your site, but also the quality of those linking domains. Domain authority (DA) is a relative measure of the trustworthiness of a given site. Source: Moz The higher the DA of a domain is, the more authority its links will pass. Your rankings will increase with 1) enough high DA mixed with low DA sites and 2) enough time for those links to vest. Accordingly, getting a link on a high-DA site is better than a comparable link on a low-DA site. As an added bonus, high-DA sites tend to get more traffic on their own, which means they’ll have a higher likelihood of passing referral traffic your way. 4. Favor new domains and IP addresses over already-linked domains. Links pass authority from one site to another, but there are diminishing returns for links on the same domain. In other words, the first link you build on a 78 DA website will pass significant authority to your site, but the second link you build there will pass much, much less. As a general rule, getting a link on a new domain is a better use of your time, even if its DA is slightly lower. In this example, a link on a new 55 DA site will be superior to a second link on the 78 DA site. Of course, this isn’t written in stone; even if you aren’t getting as much authority, new links on already-link domains will still increase your brand visibility and may forward additional referral traffic your way. 5. Link to a high-quality, internal page onsite. You can technically link any page of your site, but it’s a good strategy to link to the best-written blog posts or otherwise most valuable content pages of your site. This is useful for a few reasons. First, it strengthens the value of your link, meaning it’s more likely to be accepted by publishers and clicked by readers. Second, it passes page-specific page authority (PA) to this page, increasing its ranking potential disproportionately to the other pages of your site. Third, the referral traffic visitors you earn will form a much more favorable impression of your brand when they see this quality material (and you might have a better chance of converting them). Fourth, one of the top SEO ranking factors is whether your page is “internal.” With that in mind, link to internal content! 6. Add value to user experience, not just anchor text. What function is your link serving? The best links exist to provide additional value to readers. There are many possible approaches here, but you’ll need a good one if you want your link to succeed. For example, your link can serve as additional reading material on a topic, or it could serve as a citation to back up the facts you report. It could also provide resources in line with what a reader is seeking, or even add a humorous element to the article. If a reader is happy to see this link, it’s a good link for your campaign. 7. Make sure your content is relevant and placed on relevant sites. “Relevance” applies in two contexts here, and both are important. your guest blog post or offsite content need to be relevant to the publisher and the audience reading it; if it seems out of place, it either won’t get accepted or it won’t be read. the webpage you’re linking needs to be relevant to the article housing the link. There’s some wiggle room here, but if your topic is too far off-base and not included on relevant websites to your website, it’s going to weaken quality of your link. 8. Place your link early in the article. There’s some evidence to suggest that the higher up your link is in a page, the more authority it’s going to pass. Links in the header or early in the body will be much more valuable than links in a sidebar or in the footer. The more the link is buried in an article, the less impactful it will be, unless it’s a site wide footer link, but that’s its own animal. If you can, try to get your link as high above the fold as possible. This is also beneficial for referral traffic generation; early links tend to get more attention, increasing your brand visibility as well as total clicks. 9. Never include more than one link to your site in an article. While it may be possible to include multiple contextually relevant links to your domain in the body of a single article, this is inadvisable as a strategy. If you link to yourself multiple times, each subsequent link will pass less authority to your site, and if you link too much, you’ll flag the suspicions of both your publisher and Google’s search algorithm. Focus on building one strong, relevant link to your domain instead, and feel free to include links to other domains. 10. Include descriptive anchor text. Anchor text refers to the section of text in your article that “houses” the link you build (often highlighted in blue). In the early days of SEO, the best strategy was to use anchor text that exactly matched your target keywords and phrases. However, doing this now is counterproductive, both because keywords are less relevant (thanks to Google’s semantic search updates) and because excessive keyword use in your anchor text can harm your campaign. Still, the text you use for your link anchors is an important consideration, but make sure you keep it natural: Monitor the anchor text on your most important pages to understand whether your incoming links are natural. If not, you may need to engage in link building to smooth them out. These days, your best strategy is to include anchors that effectively describe the content you’re linking, with phrasing that naturally blends with the rest of your article. 11. Avoid keyword stuffing On that note, make sure you’re not keyword stuffing. As a general rule, if you start with a firm idea of the exact match anchor text you want, you’re going to end up with unnatural phrasing. Feel free to come up with a phrase adjacent to your target keywords, or contextually on topic, but your top priority should be using text in your link anchors that makes sense. 12. Include links to other high-quality sources. If you want your link to stick (and be well-received by your readership), it’s in your best interest to include links to other high-quality domains in the body of your article. This will make your brand look more authoritative in context, and perhaps more importantly, it will increase the likelihood of other people linking directly to your site if and when they research the topic your blog posts cover. In other words, it’s a useful trick to get more attention from researchers and writers on the web. 13. Don’t write off the possibility of nofollow link building. By default, links are “dofollow,” which means Google’s web crawlers and search algorithm will consider them when making calculations and determining rankings. While authority is only passed with dofollow links, Google has recently been pushing publishers to provide more clarity by tagging links based on their placement type. However, it’s also possible to include a “nofollow” tag in the backend HTML code that prevents a link from being considered. Some sites (especially high-DA publishers) intentionally make the majority of their links nofollow links to preserve their online reputation in Google’s eyes. Because nofollow links won’t increase your authority directly, many link builders dismiss them as worthless. However, nofollow links can be valuable; they’re still a source of brand visibility and referral traffic, and they may be your chance to make a good impression on a high-DA publisher, serving as a steppingstone to the dofollow link you’d prefer. They’re also part of a natural backlink profile: 14. Don’t get fixated on link building quantity. On some level, link building is a numbers game. It’s hard to dispute that more links from more publishers will increase your authority and your rankings. However, this shouldn’t be your motivating priority, especially in the early days of your link building campaign. Instead, focus on building good links; the quantity will come in time. Link Earning Strategies for More SEO Backlinks via GIPHY One common approach to getting backlinks for your site is earning links passively. The overarching goal here is to create onsite assets so interesting or valuable that other authorities naturally want to link to them. These are some of the best link building tactics for the job: 15. Include original, reference-able stats in your core content. If you want people to link to your blog posts, you need to give them a reason. Think about the links you’d build in high-quality content of your own; you’ll likely link to sources that give you numerical statistics, original research, or unique arguments that aren’t all over the web. If you include these points of reference in your own work, it will be far more likely to be cited by other authors. Conducting original research can be cost- and time-intensive, but you can guarantee access to data no one else has; as long as those data are valuable, you’ll almost certainly earn links. 16. Utilize social media for all it’s worth. There’s one small issue with pumping your content full of referenceable stats; if nobody can find or discover your content in the first place, they’ll never see what you wrote. To combat this, lean on social media. Sharing your content is free, and if you have a decent subscriber base, you can instantly make it available to hundreds, if not thousands of people. Or you can use a service like Quuu Promote: Use a service like Quuu Promote for syndicating content across social media channels. While you’re at it, engage with your followers and try to attract new followers so your future shares are even more powerful. 17. Post in niche forums regularly and comment on other posts. You’ll earn more links if you’re known as a reputable source. If people in the industry know and respect you, they’ll read your work routinely, and they’ll be willing to link to your material in their own work. One of the easiest ways to do this is to find niche forums and online communities where professionals like you gather to discuss industry topics. Make regular posts, answer community questions, and engage yourself in active discussions; over time, you’ll build a reputation, and people will take your content more seriously. 18. Provide your work to influencers who might have an interest in it. This link building tactic is something of a hybrid between asking for links and earning them naturally. The idea is to find an influencer in your field (i.e., someone with a large social following or someone known for producing great content), then provide that influencer with a piece of your content you think they’d appreciate. Find influencers in your niche with many followers. The purpose is not for social media links, but to get the word out so, blogs will also link to your great content. For example, let’s say a leading authority in your industry makes a social media post about the seeming decline of sales in the industry. You can use this opportunity to send them a case study you did on long-term industry growth; if they like it and find it valuable, they’ll probably link to it in future content (or share it with their followers). 19. Collaborate on posts. You can try something similar by collaborating on posts. Find another expert in your field, and work together on a shared piece of content. You can write a blog post together, or each contribute pieces of research that one author stitches together in a finished narrative. If you host the content on your site, you can be sure your partner will want to generate links to it; after all, it will work in both your best interests. 20. Guest post and invite guest post authors. Similarly, it’s beneficial to invite more guest post authors to your site. Ask for contributions from guest post authors as a mutually beneficial backlink exchange; they get the visibility of your blog platform, and you get the value of their work. But, be aware, guest blogging has its limitations and has been viewed negatively by Google since time immemorial. If you have trouble finding guest post authors willing to contribute, consider offering a trade and guest posting on their site. Your new guest blogging authors will likely want to reference their own work (with backlinks) in the future, or spend effort to popularize it; accordingly, you’ll earn more links. Plus, guest blogging helps you to have more diverse, authoritative voices across your various blog posts. 21. Flesh out your personal brand. Spend some time fleshing out the details of your authors’ personal brands. If you’re new to link building, start with one. Make sure this author has a clear realm of expertise, and include details on their career in an author profile. This author should be guest posting regularly, engaging with their social media community, and connecting with other professionals. Over time, they’ll build a better reputation, and the content they post, share, and distribute will carry more weight; in other words, it will be more likely to build more links. 22. Spend more time networking with other people. This has countless benefits; it will increase your number of social media followers, increase your total readership, give you access to more guest blogging authors, and introduce you to more guest posting opportunities for your own strategy. The bigger your collective network is, the more likely you’ll be to earn links. But beware of begging and definitely beware of forcing: Strategies for Approaching Link Building These strategies are high-level approaches you can use to increase your link building effectiveness: 23. Mix up strategies between link building and link earning. Link earning is undeniably safe; it’s practically impossible to get penalized by Google if you’re just passively earning links, but it’s also inconsistent and unreliable, making it difficult to scale. Link building is consistent and reliable, but it takes significant skill and effort to make the strategy work, especially over long timescales. The best approach for most businesses is to use a blend of link building strategies and link earning strategies, capitalizing on the best qualities of each. 24. Consider topics in addition to keywords. Many newcomers to SEO spend most of their strategic effort choosing and prioritizing keywords and keyword phrases. While this is beneficial in many ways (see our section on “anchor text”), it can also compromise your efforts. The big issue here is that Google’s Hummingbird update (as well as subsequent updates) utilizes semantic search capabilities; rather than scrounging for content with a one-to-one keyword relationship with the search query, Google works to understand the user’s query and find content that’s on-topic. Accordingly, while it’s still beneficial to perform keyword research, you should also consider and research high-level topics and families of keywords. 25. Create amazing on-site pages. Whether you want to earn links naturally or build them yourself, you’ll need amazing onsite pages to succeed. High-quality onsite content and blog posts will make people more eager to link to you, and will make your links “stickier”—in other words, publishers will be less likely to remove or alter them. Plus, remember that all your link building strategies will generate traffic to your site. If you get referral visitors, you’ll want them to be left with a good impression of your brand. Strong blog posts and other website pages are the only way to accomplish your link building goals. No one legitimate is going to link to a poorly created blog post. 26. Prioritize your best onsite pages. As you build links, you generate domain authority for your entire site, but also page authority for individual pages. If you want to make the most of your link building strategy, you should prioritize building links to your best onsite pages. If you have a comprehensive guide or an amazing piece of research to show off, build several links to it; this piece will rank higher and get more traffic, ultimately benefitting your brand in multiple ways. The caveat here is that you need to mix up your links as well; link building exclusively to one onsite page can look suspicious. 27. Monitor (and mimic) your competitors’ link building strategies. You aren’t the only company building backlinks for SEO; chances are, most of your competitors are doing the same. You can learn a lot by observing and mimicking their strategies. The easiest way to start here is with a tool like Moz’s Link Explorer; here, you can enter a competitor’s domain and quickly generate a list of all the links pointing to that domain on the web. Check those links to see where they’ve been built, and where they’re pointing. You’ll discover new publishers you can work with, and possibly some weaknesses in your link building strategy that you can exploit for competitive dominance. 28. Steer clear of link schemes. It’s tempting to build links quickly and by any means necessary, but many newcomers with this attitude end up falling for link schemes (or willingly engaging with them). A link scheme is basically any attempt to build low-quality links in an exclusive effort to increase your ranking. There are many varieties here, including spamming links, participating in link circles, and heavily exchanging links with one or two other participants. Link schemes are not only a short-term link building strategy, but they are also Google penalty magnets, so avoid them at all costs, and be wary of any link building company that promises immediate results (or if they have an offer that seems too good to be true). 29. Work with a professional link building agency. That said, a professional link building company could help you develop your strategy faster and more reliably. Expert link building agencies understand the nuances of the strategy, and make content, link quality, and long-term relationships with publishers their priorities. They have access to far more resources and more specialists than you do, and while they tend to charge a relatively high fee, they also tend to give you a high return on your investment (ROI). Just make sure you do your due diligence; work with an SEO company that has a good reputation and investigate their strategic approach so you know what you’re getting. And, if you’re an SEO agency yourself, it may make sense to find a company that will allow you to outsource SEO and your link building as a white label SEO reseller. 30. Start small and scale up. Even if you’re eager to grow and you’re willing to invest lots of time and money in your link building strategy, it’s a good idea to start with a small scale and work your way up. Building a small number of links with a minimal link building investment will help you discover the best approaches for your brand, without spending lots of money to do it. When you have a good bank of onsite content, knowledge of the top publishers in your industry, and a sense for your top priorities, you can gradually expand the scope of your efforts. Get a quality standard operating procedure on how you consistently build links and replicate that link building strategy among an internal or external outsourced link building team. 31. Measure your domain authority. You’ll probably be excited to check on your search engine rankings as you develop your link building strategy. But while this is a good metric to measure and improve, it may not be a direct reflection of the progress you’re making. It’s also important to measure your domain authority (DA) regularly. The higher this climbs, the more likely all your pages will be to rank higher in searches. It’s also a good indicator of whether your link building tactics are working; you should see steady progress as long as you’re committed to building more powerful links and a greater number of them. Just be aware that as your domain authority grows, it becomes harder to advance; for example, it’s very easy to go from DA 10 to DA 20, but getting from DA 80 to DA 90 is slow and challenging. There are several link building tools that can help you measure your domain authority, including the Link Explorer tool we referenced in point 27. 32. Measure your page authority. Similarly, you’ll want to measure the page-level authority (PA) of your best pages. If you’re trying to prioritize an exemplary piece of content, or if there’s a money page you want to earn more traffic, you need to know that your extra links are working. If your page authority becomes stagnant, it means something is going wrong. 33. Evaluate organic traffic, referral traffic and other factors. Domain authority and page authority are two of the strongest indicators that your strategy is working, but there are many other metrics to consider. For example, you can measure the referral traffic generated by each of your links; this will help you determine which of your publishers are most valuable for direct traffic. Sometimes, a publisher may have a relatively low DA, but the links you build forward a ton of traffic to your site, making up the difference. Also pay attention to your keyword rankings, organic traffic, and even direct traffic to your site; the more metrics you measure, the more of a comprehensive picture you’ll see. 34. Estimate link value and update your strategy as needed. Whenever you build a link with a new publisher, try to estimate the total value of that link. Try to isolate its effects on your domain- and page-level authority, determine page views of the main blog post, and measure referral traffic. Compare and combine these metrics to estimate how valuable this link is and compare your conclusion to other links you’ve built. Then, adjust your link building strategy for the future; build more links on the best publishers, and find more publishers like them. Don’t waste any more time on links or publishers that aren’t returning much value your way. Content-Focused Link Building Strategies via GIPHY Different types of content have different advantages and disadvantages when it comes to optimizing your link building strategies. The content types that follow are examples of content sources that tend to attract the best links (and attract them consistently). 35. “Best of” lists. “Best of” lists, or listicles, tend to be numbered lists that collect some of the best or most notable items within a given topic. They’re appealing because they promise the reader a concise read; something like “10 tips to improve your onion chopping experience” invites the reader in with the understanding they can glance at those tips at a high level and still learn something. It’s also easy to build a link within one of these points if you use this archetype for a guest post. 36. Surveys and other original research. Original research is extremely powerful for attracting links, but it can also be expensive to conduct. A good, inexpensive method of original research is conducting surveys; get a few hundred people within a niche to respond to a short survey, collect the data, and publish it on your site. Now you have statistics that no one else has, and you can attract or build links as you see fit. Throw in some visuals on the data and you’ll have an amazing onsite asset. In fact, we have found that original research, published well, is one of the best link building strategies for scaling natural, inbound links from other websites. 37. Controversial opinion pieces. Most brands are reluctant to write controversial opinion blog post pieces, for fear of alienating their target audience. However, taking a controversial stance can be great for your link building campaign, so long as you do it respectfully and with hard evidence. Being resolute in your opinion and sharing it, can also help you gain credibility giving you a boost for outranking other bigger brands online. And as long as your topic is debatable, it will invite lots of people to discuss and share the topic. All those comments and shares will make your work more visible, making it easier to generate links. 38. Original news reporting. If you have access to original news in your industry, work to be the first ones to report it. If your customers and other readers grow to trust you as a first-line publisher, they’re going to stay glued to your blog post—and link to your news articles the moment they get published. 39. Newsjacking. Of course, if you don’t have immediate access to industry news, there’s another way to make use of newsworthy content: newsjacking (not to be confused with brand jacking). The general idea here is to read up on some event in the news, then write a piece of content with your own spin on it. Consolidate details from multiple different sources to create an article with comprehensive coverage, or include your unique opinion on the news. 40. Initial topic exploration (or reviews). Being the first to explore a topic can also be powerful, since you won’t face much competition, but it’s hard to find a topic that’s never been covered. For example, you might review the latest tech gadget the moment it becomes available to consumers, or you might analyze a new trend in your industry. 41. Case studies and whitepapers. Case studies and whitepapers are both long-form content archetypes filled with analytical information. Case studies tend to focus on real events, individuals, or organizations, while whitepapers provide more of an overview or hypothetical examination. Either way, meaty forms of content like these tend to attract a ton of links. 42. Engaging content. Any piece of content that encourages people to interact can be valuable, since it will attract more likes, comments, shares, and visibility on its own. Engaging content comes in many forms, but one of the most valuable is a contest; a contest usually makes some request of your readers (like submitting a photo or other piece of content of their own), and is very compelling if there’s a unique reward. 43. Glossaries and indexes. Glossaries, indexes, and other forms of encyclopedic material are fantastic pieces of content, especially for complex industries. These pieces are highly informative, dense, and evergreen meaning they won’t ever expire or lose relevance. Keep them updated, and you’re bound to get lots of local backlink citations. 44. Educational content and how-to guides. This is usually one of the first archetypes of content new link builders try to use, since it’s fairly accessible. You’re an expert in at least one field, so write a blog post about what you know; teach your readers something new, or provide them with high-level education on a given topic. Step-by-step instructions and guides that include images are especially well-received. This has been done ad-nauseam as a link building strategy, but it still works if done well. 45. Entertaining/funny content. Though somewhat riskier, you can also attract links via entertaining content. Hilarious and/or fun videos tend to get lots of shares and are frequently cited in online compilations. A nut shot compilation will always bring some laughs. The trouble is, there’s no formula for what people find fun or humorous, so if you miss the mark, it could hurt more than help. 46. Infographics. Infographics capitalize on people’s desire for information and their love for digestible visuals. Visual content remains some of the most shared types of content on the web, so a sufficiently detailed and aesthetically pleasing infographic can help you earn dozens of links. Infographic link building, while still helpful, was a much more effective link building strategy five years ago, but it has admittedly diminished over time. 47. Quote graphics and other shareables. Along similar lines, you can create a “quote graphic,” which is usually a photo or illustration with a concise quote from a thought leader in your industry (or other authority). Pretty much any sharable visual piece of content that provides entertainment or information can work well for link building. 48. Directories and/or consolidated content. There’s a ton of content on the web, so users love to see directories and other forms of content organization. Compiling a list of your favorite resources, guides on a given topic, or bits of information can make you the go-to resource on the subject. 49. Interviews. Interviews have several advantages as a type of content for building links. For starters, you can publish interviews in multiple different mediums, such as video, audio, or a written transcript. You’ll also likely be interviewing people from outside your organization; those people will be incentivized to link to the finished product and share it on their own social media platforms. It’s a built-in boost to your initial distribution. 50. Memes. Memes are dangerous territory. Come up with a good template or use an existing popular template in an interesting and amusing way, and you could go viral, earning links from all over the web. Try too hard or miss the point of the meme, and you could become a laughingstock. Of course, even if people are laughing at you, they might build links to you anyway, so it could easily be worth the risk. 51. Webinars. Many companies try to promote webinars, to varying degrees of success. Webinars are interactive video presentations, generally provided to novices on a given subject. To be successful, your webinar has to cover an in-demand topic, be hosted by an expert, and either be free or worth what you’re charging for it. Interactive elements, such as live Q&A, can improve your performance, and making the webinar permanently available (i.e., not exclusively live-streamed) is ideal. 52. Tests and quizzes. As you’ve seen from many of the items on this list, interactivity is highly successful in encouraging shares, and there are few types of content more interactive than tests and quizzes. Depending on the nature of your industry, you could come up with a calculator for your products and services, a quiz to test someone’s knowledge on a subject (like financial literacy), or something sillier, like “which tech CEO are you?” 53. Videos (in combination with any of the above approaches). Videos can be incredibly powerful types of content, especially when used in combination with any of the content types above. Video interviews, video news, and video lists can all be powerful for generating links. However, you’ll need to think carefully about how you publish and distribute your video content; if you host your videos on YouTube (as most companies do), any direct links the video earns will pass authority to YouTube, not necessarily your own site. Accordingly, it’s a common link building tactic to host the YouTube video on a page of your own site, so you can earn links directly to your domain. You may also consider using these as guest blogging content material. Publisher/Partner Strategies for Link Building If you’re pursuing direct link building strategies, most of your efforts will revolve around guest blogging and guest posting. The idea is to work with external publishers of sites with high domain authority, providing them with content that their audiences want to see. When you submit the content, you’ll include a high-quality link back to your site, assuming there’s a relevant website that aligns with your content. These strategies can help you in this endeavor: 54. Start with small-time publishers and work your way up. Higher-DA publishers will reward you with more powerful links, so it’s tempting to prioritize them in your guest posting pursuits. However, high-DA publishers tend to have much higher standards for the work they accept, and may not be accessible to an unproven author or brand. Instead, focus on the publishers accessible to you; do a good job for them, publish lots of content, and eventually you’ll build a good enough reputation and a big enough portfolio that you can start climbing the ladder. Local publishers and niche-focused publishers are great stepping stones on your way to nationally renown authorities. 55. Keep things focused on one personal brand. Some companies try to write and publish blog post material under their brand name, but it’s usually better to publish under the name of an individual in your company. Over time, you can publish under multiple names, but for now, just focus on one. Focusing on an individual instead of the brand will make you more trustworthy and open up more publication opportunities. And building one personal brand before you build others will help you consolidate your progress. 56. Prioritize the needs of a publisher’s readership. You have some selfish motivations in getting published, but if you want to get published and keep getting published, your priority should be on your publisher’s readership. Editors are interested in distributing the content their readers find most valuable. Accordingly, they’re only going to accept your submissions if their readers will enjoy them. Get to know the demographics of your target publisher, and see what kind of content they like best. You may have to compromise some of your other priorities to make this relationship work. Usually, you can find a topic that both presents you with an inbound linking opportunity and appeals to the target readership. 57. Find the editor (or someone in charge). If you’re reaching out to a new publisher, it’s best to find an individual (rather than submitting a generic contact form). Look at the “About” or “Contact” page of the website to try and find the contact information for the editor, content manager, or other authority. If it’s not available here, try to find them on social media networks like LinkedIn. Making a personal appeal is always better than blindly writing to an organization, especially if you can find something in common with them and achieve mutually beneficial goals. 58. Send a warm email with a compelling, original subject line. When sending your first email, it’s important to stand out and immediately make your message seem valuable. Editors are typically very busy, with inboxes flooded with generic, unappealing requests. If you want a chance at having your email opened, you need to have a compelling, original subject line; come up with something they haven’t seen a million times already, and make it clear what the value is. Something like “New statistics on entrepreneurship – would your readers be interested?” 59. Prove that you’re an avid reader of this publisher. In the body of your email, it’s important to show that you know this publisher. If you’ve never read this publisher’s work before, the editor may not want to work with you. If your email reads as if you sent the same template to 20 different people, it’s going to get rejected. Highlight and compliment a handful of posts you’ve enjoyed in the past, and make it obvious that you know this publisher’s area of specialty. If you use this as one of your link building strategies, make sure you’re actually genuine as site owners can smell it. 60. Pitch an initial post that aligns with similar content on their site. At some point in your message, you’ll need to make a pitch. It doesn’t have to be fancy—usually, a couple of concise sentences describing your idea are plenty. Pitch a tentative headline if you can, and describe the body of the article you plan to write (or let our blog writing services pitch it and write it for you). Some publishers have specific requirements for the formatting or presentation of new pitches, so do some research before you submit, and adhere to those rules as best you can. 61. Explain why this pitch will work. It’s also helpful to explain why you think this would be valuable for the publisher’s readership. You might note that there are similar blog posts or articles already on the site, but it doesn’t cover the topic from this angle. Or you might note that the publisher’s target demographics tend to be very interested in material like this, citing statistics to back your claim. If you’ve written successful guest posts on other publishers, you may want to provide metrics like how many shares or comments those posts received. 62. Follow up politely if you don’t hear back. Like I said, editors are busy people—and they just get busier as you climb the DA ladder. It’s normal to not hear a response for a few days. If you don’t hear back after 3-4 business days, send a polite follow-up email; ask them to confirm receipt of the pitch, and ask if they think it needs any modification. 63. Comply with all editor requests. In many cases, the editor may respond to your pitch with a recommendation for how to make it a better fit. In other cases, you’ll provide a written draft, which the editing team will review; at this point, you may get additional feedback for how to improve the piece. While you may not necessarily agree with the suggestions they make, if your priority is getting published, it’s best to make the requested changes. For example, you may be forced to remove a link or replace it with a nofollow link; while not ideal, it’s often worth making this initial compromise. The more polite, agreeable, and fast you are when editing the article, the more likely they’ll be to work with you in the future—or recommend you for other opportunities. Make their life easy, and they’ll respond in kind. 64. Leverage your new guest blogging author spot. If your first article is successful, your editor/publisher will likely be eager to work with you again. They may invite you to pitch some new ideas, or eventually, set you up with a recurring guest blogging author spot. If you find yourself in this position, try to take advantage of it. Highlight your position when making pitches to new publishers, and try to publish follow-up pieces here—even if you don’t end up linking back to your site in every new submission. 65. Nurture your publisher-based community. Editors are fantastic connections to make, but readers are even more important. When publishing work on a new publisher, spend some time responding to the comments that (inevitably) roll in. If you’re an active presence in discussions and you positively reinforce the community, people will be more excited to read your work. They’ll also start following you on social media, which can lead to a bigger following—and one more reason for bigger, better publishers to accept your work. 66. Maintain old relationships. As you start to scale your link building strategy and work with higher-DA, national-level publishers, your old publishers may start to seem less valuable by comparison. However, it’s a good idea to maintain those old relationships, posting content occasionally on all your guest post accounts and checking in with editors on a periodic basis. Staying in good standing with a wide network of publishers will maximize the number of opportunities you eventually have, and boost your reputation as an author even further. The only exception here is problematic relationships (e.g., a very difficult or impolite editor, a practically nonexistent readership, etc.)—feel free to cut those out entirely. Miscellaneous “Bonus” Link Building Strategies via GIPHY These strategies don’t exactly fit with any of the other categories in this comprehensive guide, but they may still be helpful in earning you more links, stronger links, or more consistent links: 67. Set up 301 redirects for old, outdated or broken links. Occasionally, you’ll need to get rid of a page, either because it’s no longer relevant or because you’re retooling it into something else. If you change the URL, all the links you built to that page in the past will become broken, rendering them practically useless for your brand. You can combat broken links by setting up 301 redirects, which take all traffic from the old URL and redirect that traffic to a new URL. As a link building strategy, broken link building in this way can be highly effective. As long as you’re sending people to a new, relevant site page, Google is completely fine with using broken link building as an effective backlink tactic—it even encourages it. 68. Keep your old content updated. If you’re following best practices for content marketing, much of your content will be “evergreen,” meaning it’s likely to remain relevant for a long time, if not forever. However, even evergreen content could stand to be periodically updated. Revisit your older material and make sure it’s relevant, and be willing to add new facts, updated old statistics, and make tweaks to make sure it’s better suited for the modern era. It’s much cheaper and more efficient to keep your old content updated, relevant and link-generating than to only create new ones. 69. Use HARO (Help a Reporter Out)–NOW DEAD. HARO is dead as of November of 2024. Try BuzzSumo for as an alternative strategy. 70. Volunteer or donate. You can also usually earn a link by donating to a nonprofit organization, or volunteering your time or services. For example, you might donate your services to a fundraiser for a local organization. When advertising the event on their website, this organization will likely reference your business with a link. If you donate money to an organization, they may include a link to your site on their donor page. 71. Make Wikipedia edits. In rare cases, you may be able to build links to your onsite content to serve as references on Wikipedia articles. Wikipedia is open to edits from practically any user; however, be aware that their community standards are very strict. If you include a link to your site, make sure your content is highly relevant, with specific information that’s actually valuable for the article. It’s also a good idea to make occasional Wikipedia edits elsewhere, so it doesn’t look like the sole purpose of your account is to link back to your site. While Wikipedia may not help you from an SEO perspective, it can be a decent source of backlink referral traffic. 72. Engage in a broken link building campaign. As you read content on the web, you’ll likely encounter broken links—links that send you to a 404 page, or links that are no longer relevant. Treat these as an opportunity for engaging in broken link building services. If you have an Ahrefs subscription, you can start by checking for broken links there: If not Ahrefs, would suggest using our broken link checker tool: Use a broken link checker to check for broken backlinks. If and when you find a broken link, reach out to the authors, publishers or site owners with a suggestion for a quality backlink to replace the broken link; assuming you have a piece of content that fulfills this requirement, your broken link request has a high probability of being met. A broken link building strategy is one of the best ways to acquire backlinks from pages on relevant websites that are appropriately aged and have existing page authority. Similarly, you can engage in a 404 link reclamation campaign. 73. Leverage Quora and other services. Quora is a question-and-answer service where individual users can ask questions, and other users can answer them. You can think of it like an FAQ version of Wikipedia in this way. Create an account and start posting answers to questions in your specific industry; occasionally, you’ll find an opportunity to link back to an article on your site, either to cite a resource page, a statistic or for further reading. As always, make sure you aren’t spamming links; instead, prioritize good answers, and include a mix of links to different authorities. If you consistently give good answers (which users can upvote), your account will become more prominent, and your answers (and thus your links) will get even more visibility. 74. Offer corrections to existing article statistics. Occasionally, you’ll find mistakes on pieces of offsite content. They may cite a statistic or other resource pages that are out of date, or make an argument that isn’t quite accurate. When you find these instances, offer to make a correction—especially if you have an onsite article that already features the correct information. 75. Offer to update old content. You can do something similar by offering to update old content. For example, let’s say you find an article with a title like “How to Buy a Used Car in 2010” that hasn’t been touched or updated since. If you can sell another site on updating outdated content (showing of course that doing so is likely to increase their rankings if done well), then it can be a great strategy for earning more links. You can reach out to the site owner and offer to write a new version that’s updated for 2020. When you write this content (or revise what’s already there), you’ll get the chance to include a link back to your site in some way. 76. Guest speak. If you know who to talk to, you can easily find guest speaking opportunities in your city. If and when you do, take them. Guest speaking gives you a chance to speak in front of like-minded professionals and show off your expertise. You’ll also get the chance to present your blog posts to a new audience. Assuming you spend some time networking after, this can easily lead to a new influx of people reading your onsite material, and possibly new opportunities for publishing or content collaboration. Our boy Samuel Edwards is the most prolific on our team for speaking engagements: 77. Create and sustain a community. One of the best things you can do for your link building strategy is create and sustain a community. You want people to actively engage with your content, sharing it, commenting on it, and reading it no matter which site owners you use. The more active fans you have, the easier it will be to find new publishing opportunities, the more links you’ll earn, and the faster your online presence will grow. The best ways to build a community are to engage with your readers directly, give your readers a platform for comments and discussion, and network with new people constantly. Building a community is more about old-school tactics of building a brand and this is what link building is all about. Ready to Start Building Backlinks?

Ready to Start Building Backlinks? 1. Quality > Quantity. And quality is typically time-consuming and more expensive. This first strategy is more about what you shouldn’t do. Newcomers are often tempted to build as many links as possible, without putting much thought into which types of links they build or how they build them. Before you even start link building, make sure you have a clear vision. What are you trying to accomplish? Which links will help you the most? What links could hurt? Based on technical keyword research, what phrases do you want to rank for? Have you developed an anchor text strategy for your outreach? It’s much better to build a small number of extremely helpful links than a large number of links that might hurt you in the long run. Be VERY picky about the links you work to acquire manually: Work to be that guy or gal in your organization that won’t take or stand for acquiring garbage backlinks! 2. Relevance > Authority. Good links exist in context. A lengthy URL existing by itself in a forum comment isn’t going to get much positive attention; it isn’t helpful, valuable, or even natural. But a link embedded as a citation to a resource page, or a solidly written article is a different story. When building links, your first priority should be the content housing your link, and the context that justifies its existence. Focus on: Links from quality sites Links embedded in quality content Links using appropriate anchor text (depending on your existing profile) Links that point to a relevant page to the content topic AND the referring domain Without good content as a backbone, your link building strategy won’t get far. 3. High DA > Low DA (duh). Google judges not just the number of linking domains to your site, but also the quality of those linking domains. Domain authority (DA) is a relative measure of the trustworthiness of a given site. Source: Moz The higher the DA of a domain is, the more authority its links will pass. Your rankings will increase with 1) enough high DA mixed with low DA sites and 2) enough time for those links to vest. Accordingly, getting a link on a high-DA site is better than a comparable link on a low-DA site. As an added bonus, high-DA sites tend to get more traffic on their own, which means they’ll have a higher likelihood of passing referral traffic your way. 4. Favor new domains and IP addresses over already-linked domains. Links pass authority from one site to another, but there are diminishing returns for links on the same domain. In other words, the first link you build on a 78 DA website will pass significant authority to your site, but the second link you build there will pass much, much less. As a general rule, getting a link on a new domain is a better use of your time, even if its DA is slightly lower. In this example, a link on a new 55 DA site will be superior to a second link on the 78 DA site. Of course, this isn’t written in stone; even if you aren’t getting as much authority, new links on already-link domains will still increase your brand visibility and may forward additional referral traffic your way. 5. Link to a high-quality, internal page onsite. You can technically link any page of your site, but it’s a good strategy to link to the best-written blog posts or otherwise most valuable content pages of your site. This is useful for a few reasons. First, it strengthens the value of your link, meaning it’s more likely to be accepted by publishers and clicked by readers. Second, it passes page-specific page authority (PA) to this page, increasing its ranking potential disproportionately to the other pages of your site. Third, the referral traffic visitors you earn will form a much more favorable impression of your brand when they see this quality material (and you might have a better chance of converting them). Fourth, one of the top SEO ranking factors is whether your page is “internal.” With that in mind, link to internal content! 6. Add value to user experience, not just anchor text. What function is your link serving? The best links exist to provide additional value to readers. There are many possible approaches here, but you’ll need a good one if you want your link to succeed. For example, your link can serve as additional reading material on a topic, or it could serve as a citation to back up the facts you report. It could also provide resources in line with what a reader is seeking, or even add a humorous element to the article. If a reader is happy to see this link, it’s a good link for your campaign. 7. Make sure your content is relevant and placed on relevant sites. “Relevance” applies in two contexts here, and both are important. your guest blog post or offsite content need to be relevant to the publisher and the audience reading it; if it seems out of place, it either won’t get accepted or it won’t be read. the webpage you’re linking needs to be relevant to the article housing the link. There’s some wiggle room here, but if your topic is too far off-base and not included on relevant websites to your website, it’s going to weaken quality of your link. 8. Place your link early in the article. There’s some evidence to suggest that the higher up your link is in a page, the more authority it’s going to pass. Links in the header or early in the body will be much more valuable than links in a sidebar or in the footer. The more the link is buried in an article, the less impactful it will be, unless it’s a site wide footer link, but that’s its own animal. If you can, try to get your link as high above the fold as possible. This is also beneficial for referral traffic generation; early links tend to get more attention, increasing your brand visibility as well as total clicks. 9. Never include more than one link to your site in an article. While it may be possible to include multiple contextually relevant links to your domain in the body of a single article, this is inadvisable as a strategy. If you link to yourself multiple times, each subsequent link will pass less authority to your site, and if you link too much, you’ll flag the suspicions of both your publisher and Google’s search algorithm. Focus on building one strong, relevant link to your domain instead, and feel free to include links to other domains. 10. Include descriptive anchor text. Anchor text refers to the section of text in your article that “houses” the link you build (often highlighted in blue). In the early days of SEO, the best strategy was to use anchor text that exactly matched your target keywords and phrases. However, doing this now is counterproductive, both because keywords are less relevant (thanks to Google’s semantic search updates) and because excessive keyword use in your anchor text can harm your campaign. Still, the text you use for your link anchors is an important consideration, but make sure you keep it natural: Monitor the anchor text on your most important pages to understand whether your incoming links are natural. If not, you may need to engage in link building to smooth them out. These days, your best strategy is to include anchors that effectively describe the content you’re linking, with phrasing that naturally blends with the rest of your article. 11. Avoid keyword stuffing On that note, make sure you’re not keyword stuffing. As a general rule, if you start with a firm idea of the exact match anchor text you want, you’re going to end up with unnatural phrasing. Feel free to come up with a phrase adjacent to your target keywords, or contextually on topic, but your top priority should be using text in your link anchors that makes sense. 12. Include links to other high-quality sources. If you want your link to stick (and be well-received by your readership), it’s in your best interest to include links to other high-quality domains in the body of your article. This will make your brand look more authoritative in context, and perhaps more importantly, it will increase the likelihood of other people linking directly to your site if and when they research the topic your blog posts cover. In other words, it’s a useful trick to get more attention from researchers and writers on the web. 13. Don’t write off the possibility of nofollow link building. By default, links are “dofollow,” which means Google’s web crawlers and search algorithm will consider them when making calculations and determining rankings. While authority is only passed with dofollow links, Google has recently been pushing publishers to provide more clarity by tagging links based on their placement type. However, it’s also possible to include a “nofollow” tag in the backend HTML code that prevents a link from being considered. Some sites (especially high-DA publishers) intentionally make the majority of their links nofollow links to preserve their online reputation in Google’s eyes. Because nofollow links won’t increase your authority directly, many link builders dismiss them as worthless. However, nofollow links can be valuable; they’re still a source of brand visibility and referral traffic, and they may be your chance to make a good impression on a high-DA publisher, serving as a steppingstone to the dofollow link you’d prefer. They’re also part of a natural backlink profile: 14. Don’t get fixated on link building quantity. On some level, link building is a numbers game. It’s hard to dispute that more links from more publishers will increase your authority and your rankings. However, this shouldn’t be your motivating priority, especially in the early days of your link building campaign. Instead, focus on building good links; the quantity will come in time. Link Earning Strategies for More SEO Backlinks via GIPHY One common approach to getting backlinks for your site is earning links passively. The overarching goal here is to create onsite assets so interesting or valuable that other authorities naturally want to link to them. These are some of the best link building tactics for the job: 15. Include original, reference-able stats in your core content. If you want people to link to your blog posts, you need to give them a reason. Think about the links you’d build in high-quality content of your own; you’ll likely link to sources that give you numerical statistics, original research, or unique arguments that aren’t all over the web. If you include these points of reference in your own work, it will be far more likely to be cited by other authors. Conducting original research can be cost- and time-intensive, but you can guarantee access to data no one else has; as long as those data are valuable, you’ll almost certainly earn links. 16. Utilize social media for all it’s worth. There’s one small issue with pumping your content full of referenceable stats; if nobody can find or discover your content in the first place, they’ll never see what you wrote. To combat this, lean on social media. Sharing your content is free, and if you have a decent subscriber base, you can instantly make it available to hundreds, if not thousands of people. Or you can use a service like Quuu Promote: Use a service like Quuu Promote for syndicating content across social media channels. While you’re at it, engage with your followers and try to attract new followers so your future shares are even more powerful. 17. Post in niche forums regularly and comment on other posts. You’ll earn more links if you’re known as a reputable source. If people in the industry know and respect you, they’ll read your work routinely, and they’ll be willing to link to your material in their own work. One of the easiest ways to do this is to find niche forums and online communities where professionals like you gather to discuss industry topics. Make regular posts, answer community questions, and engage yourself in active discussions; over time, you’ll build a reputation, and people will take your content more seriously. 18. Provide your work to influencers who might have an interest in it. This link building tactic is something of a hybrid between asking for links and earning them naturally. The idea is to find an influencer in your field (i.e., someone with a large social following or someone known for producing great content), then provide that influencer with a piece of your content you think they’d appreciate. Find influencers in your niche with many followers. The purpose is not for social media links, but to get the word out so, blogs will also link to your great content. For example, let’s say a leading authority in your industry makes a social media post about the seeming decline of sales in the industry. You can use this opportunity to send them a case study you did on long-term industry growth; if they like it and find it valuable, they’ll probably link to it in future content (or share it with their followers). 19. Collaborate on posts. You can try something similar by collaborating on posts. Find another expert in your field, and work together on a shared piece of content. You can write a blog post together, or each contribute pieces of research that one author stitches together in a finished narrative. If you host the content on your site, you can be sure your partner will want to generate links to it; after all, it will work in both your best interests. 20. Guest post and invite guest post authors. Similarly, it’s beneficial to invite more guest post authors to your site. Ask for contributions from guest post authors as a mutually beneficial backlink exchange; they get the visibility of your blog platform, and you get the value of their work. But, be aware, guest blogging has its limitations and has been viewed negatively by Google since time immemorial. If you have trouble finding guest post authors willing to contribute, consider offering a trade and guest posting on their site. Your new guest blogging authors will likely want to reference their own work (with backlinks) in the future, or spend effort to popularize it; accordingly, you’ll earn more links. Plus, guest blogging helps you to have more diverse, authoritative voices across your various blog posts. 21. Flesh out your personal brand. Spend some time fleshing out the details of your authors’ personal brands. If you’re new to link building, start with one. Make sure this author has a clear realm of expertise, and include details on their career in an author profile. This author should be guest posting regularly, engaging with their social media community, and connecting with other professionals. Over time, they’ll build a better reputation, and the content they post, share, and distribute will carry more weight; in other words, it will be more likely to build more links. 22. Spend more time networking with other people. This has countless benefits; it will increase your number of social media followers, increase your total readership, give you access to more guest blogging authors, and introduce you to more guest posting opportunities for your own strategy. The bigger your collective network is, the more likely you’ll be to earn links. But beware of begging and definitely beware of forcing: Strategies for Approaching Link Building These strategies are high-level approaches you can use to increase your link building effectiveness: 23. Mix up strategies between link building and link earning. Link earning is undeniably safe; it’s practically impossible to get penalized by Google if you’re just passively earning links, but it’s also inconsistent and unreliable, making it difficult to scale. Link building is consistent and reliable, but it takes significant skill and effort to make the strategy work, especially over long timescales. The best approach for most businesses is to use a blend of link building strategies and link earning strategies, capitalizing on the best qualities of each. 24. Consider topics in addition to keywords. Many newcomers to SEO spend most of their strategic effort choosing and prioritizing keywords and keyword phrases. While this is beneficial in many ways (see our section on “anchor text”), it can also compromise your efforts. The big issue here is that Google’s Hummingbird update (as well as subsequent updates) utilizes semantic search capabilities; rather than scrounging for content with a one-to-one keyword relationship with the search query, Google works to understand the user’s query and find content that’s on-topic. Accordingly, while it’s still beneficial to perform keyword research, you should also consider and research high-level topics and families of keywords. 25. Create amazing on-site pages. Whether you want to earn links naturally or build them yourself, you’ll need amazing onsite pages to succeed. High-quality onsite content and blog posts will make people more eager to link to you, and will make your links “stickier”—in other words, publishers will be less likely to remove or alter them. Plus, remember that all your link building strategies will generate traffic to your site. If you get referral visitors, you’ll want them to be left with a good impression of your brand. Strong blog posts and other website pages are the only way to accomplish your link building goals. No one legitimate is going to link to a poorly created blog post. 26. Prioritize your best onsite pages. As you build links, you generate domain authority for your entire site, but also page authority for individual pages. If you want to make the most of your link building strategy, you should prioritize building links to your best onsite pages. If you have a comprehensive guide or an amazing piece of research to show off, build several links to it; this piece will rank higher and get more traffic, ultimately benefitting your brand in multiple ways. The caveat here is that you need to mix up your links as well; link building exclusively to one onsite page can look suspicious. 27. Monitor (and mimic) your competitors’ link building strategies. You aren’t the only company building backlinks for SEO; chances are, most of your competitors are doing the same. You can learn a lot by observing and mimicking their strategies. The easiest way to start here is with a tool like Moz’s Link Explorer; here, you can enter a competitor’s domain and quickly generate a list of all the links pointing to that domain on the web. Check those links to see where they’ve been built, and where they’re pointing. You’ll discover new publishers you can work with, and possibly some weaknesses in your link building strategy that you can exploit for competitive dominance. 28. Steer clear of link schemes. It’s tempting to build links quickly and by any means necessary, but many newcomers with this attitude end up falling for link schemes (or willingly engaging with them). A link scheme is basically any attempt to build low-quality links in an exclusive effort to increase your ranking. There are many varieties here, including spamming links, participating in link circles, and heavily exchanging links with one or two other participants. Link schemes are not only a short-term link building strategy, but they are also Google penalty magnets, so avoid them at all costs, and be wary of any link building company that promises immediate results (or if they have an offer that seems too good to be true). 29. Work with a professional link building agency. That said, a professional link building company could help you develop your strategy faster and more reliably. Expert link building agencies understand the nuances of the strategy, and make content, link quality, and long-term relationships with publishers their priorities. They have access to far more resources and more specialists than you do, and while they tend to charge a relatively high fee, they also tend to give you a high return on your investment (ROI). Just make sure you do your due diligence; work with an SEO company that has a good reputation and investigate their strategic approach so you know what you’re getting. And, if you’re an SEO agency yourself, it may make sense to find a company that will allow you to outsource SEO and your link building as a white label SEO reseller. 30. Start small and scale up. Even if you’re eager to grow and you’re willing to invest lots of time and money in your link building strategy, it’s a good idea to start with a small scale and work your way up. Building a small number of links with a minimal link building investment will help you discover the best approaches for your brand, without spending lots of money to do it. When you have a good bank of onsite content, knowledge of the top publishers in your industry, and a sense for your top priorities, you can gradually expand the scope of your efforts. Get a quality standard operating procedure on how you consistently build links and replicate that link building strategy among an internal or external outsourced link building team. 31. Measure your domain authority. You’ll probably be excited to check on your search engine rankings as you develop your link building strategy. But while this is a good metric to measure and improve, it may not be a direct reflection of the progress you’re making. It’s also important to measure your domain authority (DA) regularly. The higher this climbs, the more likely all your pages will be to rank higher in searches. It’s also a good indicator of whether your link building tactics are working; you should see steady progress as long as you’re committed to building more powerful links and a greater number of them. Just be aware that as your domain authority grows, it becomes harder to advance; for example, it’s very easy to go from DA 10 to DA 20, but getting from DA 80 to DA 90 is slow and challenging. There are several link building tools that can help you measure your domain authority, including the Link Explorer tool we referenced in point 27. 32. Measure your page authority. Similarly, you’ll want to measure the page-level authority (PA) of your best pages. If you’re trying to prioritize an exemplary piece of content, or if there’s a money page you want to earn more traffic, you need to know that your extra links are working. If your page authority becomes stagnant, it means something is going wrong. 33. Evaluate organic traffic, referral traffic and other factors. Domain authority and page authority are two of the strongest indicators that your strategy is working, but there are many other metrics to consider. For example, you can measure the referral traffic generated by each of your links; this will help you determine which of your publishers are most valuable for direct traffic. Sometimes, a publisher may have a relatively low DA, but the links you build forward a ton of traffic to your site, making up the difference. Also pay attention to your keyword rankings, organic traffic, and even direct traffic to your site; the more metrics you measure, the more of a comprehensive picture you’ll see. 34. Estimate link value and update your strategy as needed. Whenever you build a link with a new publisher, try to estimate the total value of that link. Try to isolate its effects on your domain- and page-level authority, determine page views of the main blog post, and measure referral traffic. Compare and combine these metrics to estimate how valuable this link is and compare your conclusion to other links you’ve built. Then, adjust your link building strategy for the future; build more links on the best publishers, and find more publishers like them. Don’t waste any more time on links or publishers that aren’t returning much value your way. Content-Focused Link Building Strategies via GIPHY Different types of content have different advantages and disadvantages when it comes to optimizing your link building strategies. The content types that follow are examples of content sources that tend to attract the best links (and attract them consistently). 35. “Best of” lists. “Best of” lists, or listicles, tend to be numbered lists that collect some of the best or most notable items within a given topic. They’re appealing because they promise the reader a concise read; something like “10 tips to improve your onion chopping experience” invites the reader in with the understanding they can glance at those tips at a high level and still learn something. It’s also easy to build a link within one of these points if you use this archetype for a guest post. 36. Surveys and other original research. Original research is extremely powerful for attracting links, but it can also be expensive to conduct. A good, inexpensive method of original research is conducting surveys; get a few hundred people within a niche to respond to a short survey, collect the data, and publish it on your site. Now you have statistics that no one else has, and you can attract or build links as you see fit. Throw in some visuals on the data and you’ll have an amazing onsite asset. In fact, we have found that original research, published well, is one of the best link building strategies for scaling natural, inbound links from other websites. 37. Controversial opinion pieces. Most brands are reluctant to write controversial opinion blog post pieces, for fear of alienating their target audience. However, taking a controversial stance can be great for your link building campaign, so long as you do it respectfully and with hard evidence. Being resolute in your opinion and sharing it, can also help you gain credibility giving you a boost for outranking other bigger brands online. And as long as your topic is debatable, it will invite lots of people to discuss and share the topic. All those comments and shares will make your work more visible, making it easier to generate links. 38. Original news reporting. If you have access to original news in your industry, work to be the first ones to report it. If your customers and other readers grow to trust you as a first-line publisher, they’re going to stay glued to your blog post—and link to your news articles the moment they get published. 39. Newsjacking. Of course, if you don’t have immediate access to industry news, there’s another way to make use of newsworthy content: newsjacking (not to be confused with brand jacking). The general idea here is to read up on some event in the news, then write a piece of content with your own spin on it. Consolidate details from multiple different sources to create an article with comprehensive coverage, or include your unique opinion on the news. 40. Initial topic exploration (or reviews). Being the first to explore a topic can also be powerful, since you won’t face much competition, but it’s hard to find a topic that’s never been covered. For example, you might review the latest tech gadget the moment it becomes available to consumers, or you might analyze a new trend in your industry. 41. Case studies and whitepapers. Case studies and whitepapers are both long-form content archetypes filled with analytical information. Case studies tend to focus on real events, individuals, or organizations, while whitepapers provide more of an overview or hypothetical examination. Either way, meaty forms of content like these tend to attract a ton of links. 42. Engaging content. Any piece of content that encourages people to interact can be valuable, since it will attract more likes, comments, shares, and visibility on its own. Engaging content comes in many forms, but one of the most valuable is a contest; a contest usually makes some request of your readers (like submitting a photo or other piece of content of their own), and is very compelling if there’s a unique reward. 43. Glossaries and indexes. Glossaries, indexes, and other forms of encyclopedic material are fantastic pieces of content, especially for complex industries. These pieces are highly informative, dense, and evergreen meaning they won’t ever expire or lose relevance. Keep them updated, and you’re bound to get lots of local backlink citations. 44. Educational content and how-to guides. This is usually one of the first archetypes of content new link builders try to use, since it’s fairly accessible. You’re an expert in at least one field, so write a blog post about what you know; teach your readers something new, or provide them with high-level education on a given topic. Step-by-step instructions and guides that include images are especially well-received. This has been done ad-nauseam as a link building strategy, but it still works if done well. 45. Entertaining/funny content. Though somewhat riskier, you can also attract links via entertaining content. Hilarious and/or fun videos tend to get lots of shares and are frequently cited in online compilations. A nut shot compilation will always bring some laughs. The trouble is, there’s no formula for what people find fun or humorous, so if you miss the mark, it could hurt more than help. 46. Infographics. Infographics capitalize on people’s desire for information and their love for digestible visuals. Visual content remains some of the most shared types of content on the web, so a sufficiently detailed and aesthetically pleasing infographic can help you earn dozens of links. Infographic link building, while still helpful, was a much more effective link building strategy five years ago, but it has admittedly diminished over time. 47. Quote graphics and other shareables. Along similar lines, you can create a “quote graphic,” which is usually a photo or illustration with a concise quote from a thought leader in your industry (or other authority). Pretty much any sharable visual piece of content that provides entertainment or information can work well for link building. 48. Directories and/or consolidated content. There’s a ton of content on the web, so users love to see directories and other forms of content organization. Compiling a list of your favorite resources, guides on a given topic, or bits of information can make you the go-to resource on the subject. 49. Interviews. Interviews have several advantages as a type of content for building links. For starters, you can publish interviews in multiple different mediums, such as video, audio, or a written transcript. You’ll also likely be interviewing people from outside your organization; those people will be incentivized to link to the finished product and share it on their own social media platforms. It’s a built-in boost to your initial distribution. 50. Memes. Memes are dangerous territory. Come up with a good template or use an existing popular template in an interesting and amusing way, and you could go viral, earning links from all over the web. Try too hard or miss the point of the meme, and you could become a laughingstock. Of course, even if people are laughing at you, they might build links to you anyway, so it could easily be worth the risk. 51. Webinars. Many companies try to promote webinars, to varying degrees of success. Webinars are interactive video presentations, generally provided to novices on a given subject. To be successful, your webinar has to cover an in-demand topic, be hosted by an expert, and either be free or worth what you’re charging for it. Interactive elements, such as live Q&A, can improve your performance, and making the webinar permanently available (i.e., not exclusively live-streamed) is ideal. 52. Tests and quizzes. As you’ve seen from many of the items on this list, interactivity is highly successful in encouraging shares, and there are few types of content more interactive than tests and quizzes. Depending on the nature of your industry, you could come up with a calculator for your products and services, a quiz to test someone’s knowledge on a subject (like financial literacy), or something sillier, like “which tech CEO are you?” 53. Videos (in combination with any of the above approaches). Videos can be incredibly powerful types of content, especially when used in combination with any of the content types above. Video interviews, video news, and video lists can all be powerful for generating links. However, you’ll need to think carefully about how you publish and distribute your video content; if you host your videos on YouTube (as most companies do), any direct links the video earns will pass authority to YouTube, not necessarily your own site. Accordingly, it’s a common link building tactic to host the YouTube video on a page of your own site, so you can earn links directly to your domain. You may also consider using these as guest blogging content material. Publisher/Partner Strategies for Link Building If you’re pursuing direct link building strategies, most of your efforts will revolve around guest blogging and guest posting. The idea is to work with external publishers of sites with high domain authority, providing them with content that their audiences want to see. When you submit the content, you’ll include a high-quality link back to your site, assuming there’s a relevant website that aligns with your content. These strategies can help you in this endeavor: 54. Start with small-time publishers and work your way up. Higher-DA publishers will reward you with more powerful links, so it’s tempting to prioritize them in your guest posting pursuits. However, high-DA publishers tend to have much higher standards for the work they accept, and may not be accessible to an unproven author or brand. Instead, focus on the publishers accessible to you; do a good job for them, publish lots of content, and eventually you’ll build a good enough reputation and a big enough portfolio that you can start climbing the ladder. Local publishers and niche-focused publishers are great stepping stones on your way to nationally renown authorities. 55. Keep things focused on one personal brand. Some companies try to write and publish blog post material under their brand name, but it’s usually better to publish under the name of an individual in your company. Over time, you can publish under multiple names, but for now, just focus on one. Focusing on an individual instead of the brand will make you more trustworthy and open up more publication opportunities. And building one personal brand before you build others will help you consolidate your progress. 56. Prioritize the needs of a publisher’s readership. You have some selfish motivations in getting published, but if you want to get published and keep getting published, your priority should be on your publisher’s readership. Editors are interested in distributing the content their readers find most valuable. Accordingly, they’re only going to accept your submissions if their readers will enjoy them. Get to know the demographics of your target publisher, and see what kind of content they like best. You may have to compromise some of your other priorities to make this relationship work. Usually, you can find a topic that both presents you with an inbound linking opportunity and appeals to the target readership. 57. Find the editor (or someone in charge). If you’re reaching out to a new publisher, it’s best to find an individual (rather than submitting a generic contact form). Look at the “About” or “Contact” page of the website to try and find the contact information for the editor, content manager, or other authority. If it’s not available here, try to find them on social media networks like LinkedIn. Making a personal appeal is always better than blindly writing to an organization, especially if you can find something in common with them and achieve mutually beneficial goals. 58. Send a warm email with a compelling, original subject line. When sending your first email, it’s important to stand out and immediately make your message seem valuable. Editors are typically very busy, with inboxes flooded with generic, unappealing requests. If you want a chance at having your email opened, you need to have a compelling, original subject line; come up with something they haven’t seen a million times already, and make it clear what the value is. Something like “New statistics on entrepreneurship – would your readers be interested?” 59. Prove that you’re an avid reader of this publisher. In the body of your email, it’s important to show that you know this publisher. If you’ve never read this publisher’s work before, the editor may not want to work with you. If your email reads as if you sent the same template to 20 different people, it’s going to get rejected. Highlight and compliment a handful of posts you’ve enjoyed in the past, and make it obvious that you know this publisher’s area of specialty. If you use this as one of your link building strategies, make sure you’re actually genuine as site owners can smell it. 60. Pitch an initial post that aligns with similar content on their site. At some point in your message, you’ll need to make a pitch. It doesn’t have to be fancy—usually, a couple of concise sentences describing your idea are plenty. Pitch a tentative headline if you can, and describe the body of the article you plan to write (or let our blog writing services pitch it and write it for you). Some publishers have specific requirements for the formatting or presentation of new pitches, so do some research before you submit, and adhere to those rules as best you can. 61. Explain why this pitch will work. It’s also helpful to explain why you think this would be valuable for the publisher’s readership. You might note that there are similar blog posts or articles already on the site, but it doesn’t cover the topic from this angle. Or you might note that the publisher’s target demographics tend to be very interested in material like this, citing statistics to back your claim. If you’ve written successful guest posts on other publishers, you may want to provide metrics like how many shares or comments those posts received. 62. Follow up politely if you don’t hear back. Like I said, editors are busy people—and they just get busier as you climb the DA ladder. It’s normal to not hear a response for a few days. If you don’t hear back after 3-4 business days, send a polite follow-up email; ask them to confirm receipt of the pitch, and ask if they think it needs any modification. 63. Comply with all editor requests. In many cases, the editor may respond to your pitch with a recommendation for how to make it a better fit. In other cases, you’ll provide a written draft, which the editing team will review; at this point, you may get additional feedback for how to improve the piece. While you may not necessarily agree with the suggestions they make, if your priority is getting published, it’s best to make the requested changes. For example, you may be forced to remove a link or replace it with a nofollow link; while not ideal, it’s often worth making this initial compromise. The more polite, agreeable, and fast you are when editing the article, the more likely they’ll be to work with you in the future—or recommend you for other opportunities. Make their life easy, and they’ll respond in kind. 64. Leverage your new guest blogging author spot. If your first article is successful, your editor/publisher will likely be eager to work with you again. They may invite you to pitch some new ideas, or eventually, set you up with a recurring guest blogging author spot. If you find yourself in this position, try to take advantage of it. Highlight your position when making pitches to new publishers, and try to publish follow-up pieces here—even if you don’t end up linking back to your site in every new submission. 65. Nurture your publisher-based community. Editors are fantastic connections to make, but readers are even more important. When publishing work on a new publisher, spend some time responding to the comments that (inevitably) roll in. If you’re an active presence in discussions and you positively reinforce the community, people will be more excited to read your work. They’ll also start following you on social media, which can lead to a bigger following—and one more reason for bigger, better publishers to accept your work. 66. Maintain old relationships. As you start to scale your link building strategy and work with higher-DA, national-level publishers, your old publishers may start to seem less valuable by comparison. However, it’s a good idea to maintain those old relationships, posting content occasionally on all your guest post accounts and checking in with editors on a periodic basis. Staying in good standing with a wide network of publishers will maximize the number of opportunities you eventually have, and boost your reputation as an author even further. The only exception here is problematic relationships (e.g., a very difficult or impolite editor, a practically nonexistent readership, etc.)—feel free to cut those out entirely. Miscellaneous “Bonus” Link Building Strategies via GIPHY These strategies don’t exactly fit with any of the other categories in this comprehensive guide, but they may still be helpful in earning you more links, stronger links, or more consistent links: 67. Set up 301 redirects for old, outdated or broken links. Occasionally, you’ll need to get rid of a page, either because it’s no longer relevant or because you’re retooling it into something else. If you change the URL, all the links you built to that page in the past will become broken, rendering them practically useless for your brand. You can combat broken links by setting up 301 redirects, which take all traffic from the old URL and redirect that traffic to a new URL. As a link building strategy, broken link building in this way can be highly effective. As long as you’re sending people to a new, relevant site page, Google is completely fine with using broken link building as an effective backlink tactic—it even encourages it. 68. Keep your old content updated. If you’re following best practices for content marketing, much of your content will be “evergreen,” meaning it’s likely to remain relevant for a long time, if not forever. However, even evergreen content could stand to be periodically updated. Revisit your older material and make sure it’s relevant, and be willing to add new facts, updated old statistics, and make tweaks to make sure it’s better suited for the modern era. It’s much cheaper and more efficient to keep your old content updated, relevant and link-generating than to only create new ones. 69. Use HARO (Help a Reporter Out)–NOW DEAD. HARO is dead as of November of 2024. Try BuzzSumo for as an alternative strategy. 70. Volunteer or donate. You can also usually earn a link by donating to a nonprofit organization, or volunteering your time or services. For example, you might donate your services to a fundraiser for a local organization. When advertising the event on their website, this organization will likely reference your business with a link. If you donate money to an organization, they may include a link to your site on their donor page. 71. Make Wikipedia edits. In rare cases, you may be able to build links to your onsite content to serve as references on Wikipedia articles. Wikipedia is open to edits from practically any user; however, be aware that their community standards are very strict. If you include a link to your site, make sure your content is highly relevant, with specific information that’s actually valuable for the article. It’s also a good idea to make occasional Wikipedia edits elsewhere, so it doesn’t look like the sole purpose of your account is to link back to your site. While Wikipedia may not help you from an SEO perspective, it can be a decent source of backlink referral traffic. 72. Engage in a broken link building campaign. As you read content on the web, you’ll likely encounter broken links—links that send you to a 404 page, or links that are no longer relevant. Treat these as an opportunity for engaging in broken link building services. If you have an Ahrefs subscription, you can start by checking for broken links there: If not Ahrefs, would suggest using our broken link checker tool: Use a broken link checker to check for broken backlinks. If and when you find a broken link, reach out to the authors, publishers or site owners with a suggestion for a quality backlink to replace the broken link; assuming you have a piece of content that fulfills this requirement, your broken link request has a high probability of being met. A broken link building strategy is one of the best ways to acquire backlinks from pages on relevant websites that are appropriately aged and have existing page authority. Similarly, you can engage in a 404 link reclamation campaign. 73. Leverage Quora and other services. Quora is a question-and-answer service where individual users can ask questions, and other users can answer them. You can think of it like an FAQ version of Wikipedia in this way. Create an account and start posting answers to questions in your specific industry; occasionally, you’ll find an opportunity to link back to an article on your site, either to cite a resource page, a statistic or for further reading. As always, make sure you aren’t spamming links; instead, prioritize good answers, and include a mix of links to different authorities. If you consistently give good answers (which users can upvote), your account will become more prominent, and your answers (and thus your links) will get even more visibility. 74. Offer corrections to existing article statistics. Occasionally, you’ll find mistakes on pieces of offsite content. They may cite a statistic or other resource pages that are out of date, or make an argument that isn’t quite accurate. When you find these instances, offer to make a correction—especially if you have an onsite article that already features the correct information. 75. Offer to update old content. You can do something similar by offering to update old content. For example, let’s say you find an article with a title like “How to Buy a Used Car in 2010” that hasn’t been touched or updated since. If you can sell another site on updating outdated content (showing of course that doing so is likely to increase their rankings if done well), then it can be a great strategy for earning more links. You can reach out to the site owner and offer to write a new version that’s updated for 2020. When you write this content (or revise what’s already there), you’ll get the chance to include a link back to your site in some way. 76. Guest speak. If you know who to talk to, you can easily find guest speaking opportunities in your city. If and when you do, take them. Guest speaking gives you a chance to speak in front of like-minded professionals and show off your expertise. You’ll also get the chance to present your blog posts to a new audience. Assuming you spend some time networking after, this can easily lead to a new influx of people reading your onsite material, and possibly new opportunities for publishing or content collaboration. Our boy Samuel Edwards is the most prolific on our team for speaking engagements: 77. Create and sustain a community. One of the best things you can do for your link building strategy is create and sustain a community. You want people to actively engage with your content, sharing it, commenting on it, and reading it no matter which site owners you use. The more active fans you have, the easier it will be to find new publishing opportunities, the more links you’ll earn, and the faster your online presence will grow. The best ways to build a community are to engage with your readers directly, give your readers a platform for comments and discussion, and network with new people constantly. Building a community is more about old-school tactics of building a brand and this is what link building is all about. Ready to Start Building Backlinks?

If backlink acquisition slows, adjustments to content marketing or outreach efforts may be needed. A SEO Manager may track this KPI monthly to report on link-building success, while a content marketer may analyze backlink trends to optimize future content strategies. KPI Example Best Practices for Link Building 📊 Track Your Link Building Success 📊 Earn High-Quality Backlinks Focus on securing links from authoritative and relevant websites to boost your site’s credibility and search rankings. 📈 Create Link-Worthy Content Develop high-value content like guides, infographics, and research studies that naturally attract backlinks. 🔄 Build Relationships for Outreach Engage with industry leaders, bloggers, and websites to foster link-building opportunities through guest posts and collaborations. 📅 Monitor & Maintain Backlinks Regularly track your backlinks to remove spammy links and ensure your site maintains a strong and healthy link profile. What is Link Building Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in link building are specific, measurable values that show how effectively your backlink strategy achieves key business objectives. These aren’t just random numbers—they’re the compass guiding your entire link building journey. Good link building management depends on these indicators to tell you whether your efforts are actually paying off. Without clear KPIs, you’re basically building links in the dark, with no way to know if your hard work translates to real business results. A thoughtful link building report includes these metrics to show progress and ROI to clients or stakeholders. The right KPIs help you connect your link building work directly to business outcomes like increased traffic, better rankings, and ultimately, more conversions. The Role of KPIs in Achieving Link Building Goals KPIs serve as both the roadmap and measuring stick for your link building strategy. They transform vague goals like “get more backlinks” into specific, trackable objectives. When used properly, these indicators help you focus your resources on the most productive link building tactics. Link building reporting becomes much more valuable when it centers around meaningful KPIs rather than just raw numbers. According to research compiled by Databox.com, the most valuable metrics to track include the number of new backlinks earned, average link quality, and the number of referring domains. These indicators provide actionable insights that help you refine your approach over time. For SEO agencies, establishing clear KPIs from the start sets proper expectations with clients and provides a framework for showing success. When everyone agrees on what success looks like, it’s easier to build trust and showcase the value of your link building services. Key Link Building KPIs to Monitor Number of Backlinks When developing your link building management strategy, the debate between quantity and quality is crucial. While tracking the total number of backlinks gives you a baseline metric, the quality of those links determines their actual impact on your site’s authority. A good link building report should highlight not just how many backlinks you’ve acquired, but their quality distribution. Research shows that 76% of SEO professionals use Ahrefs specifically for link building purposes, allowing them to assess metrics like Domain Rating (DR) alongside raw backlink counts. This combination creates a more meaningful picture of link profile strength. For effective link metrics tracking, try categorizing backlinks by authority levels. High-quality backlinks from authoritative sites in your niche deliver significantly more value than dozens of links from low-quality sources. According to data gathered by Databox, the average link quality (measuring both authority and relevance) ranks as one of the most critical KPIs to monitor in your link building efforts. Referring Domains The number of unique referring domains often proves more valuable than raw backlink counts. This metric reveals the breadth of your link profile and serves as a stronger indicator of your site’s perceived authority across the web. In link building reporting, highlighting growth in unique referring domains shows meaningful progress to clients or stakeholders. Search engines interpret links from diverse sources as multiple independent “votes of confidence” in your content. According to Databox research, the number of referring domains is considered one of the top link building metrics by industry experts. For SEO agencies, prioritizing domain diversity over sheer backlink volume often yields better results. One effective approach is tracking the ratio of referring domains to total backlinks—a healthy profile shows steady growth in both areas without excessive links from a small number of sources. Anchor Text Variation The distribution of anchor text in your backlink profile significantly impacts your SEO performance. Natural variation in anchor text helps search engines understand what your content is about while avoiding over-optimization penalties. When preparing your link building report, include anchor text distribution analysis to identify potential issues or opportunities. Databox insights confirm that anchor text distribution is among the key metrics valued by SEO professionals for evaluating link building success. Aim for a natural mix of branded terms (your company name), naked URLs, generic phrases (“click here,” “learn more”), and relevant keywords. Too many exact-match keyword anchors can trigger spam filters, while too many generic anchors might limit the contextual value of your links. Link Relevancy and Contextual Value Link relevancy has become increasingly important as search algorithms grow more sophisticated. Backlinks from websites in related industries or discussing similar topics carry more weight than random links from unrelated sources. In your link building management dashboard, include metrics that assess contextual relevance—not just domain authority. This might involve categorizing backlinks by industry, content type, or topical overlap with your site. The contextual value of a link often determines its true impact on your rankings more than raw authority metrics. For SEO agencies, showing the relevancy of acquired links adds another dimension to client reporting. Beyond showing that you’ve secured links from high-authority sites, you can highlight how these links come from sources that align with the client’s industry and audience interests. Follow vs. Nofollow Links Modern link building strategies should balance follow links (which pass SEO value) with nofollow links (which typically don’t). While follow links remain the priority for direct ranking benefits, nofollow links still contribute to a natural-looking backlink profile. When tracking link metrics, categorize links by their attribute type to ensure a balanced distribution. Too many follow links from low-quality sources can appear manipulative, while a profile containing only follow links looks unnatural in today’s linking environment. According to Databox data, successful link building campaigns typically track both follow and nofollow acquisition separately while maintaining focus on high-quality links regardless of attribute. Even nofollow links from respected sources can drive significant referral traffic and brand visibility. Traffic and Engagement from Backlinks Beyond their SEO impact, high-quality backlinks should generate direct referral traffic and engagement. Monitoring these downstream effects provides a more complete picture of your link building ROI. Effective link building reporting connects backlink acquisition to actual business outcomes by tracking metrics like referral traffic, time on site from referral sources, and conversion rates from backlink traffic. This approach demonstrates value beyond simple link counts or domain authority scores. For SEO agencies, showcasing traffic generation alongside traditional link metrics creates more compelling client reports. Using tools like Google Analytics alongside specialized SEO platforms provides this comprehensive view. As Databox research indicates, both Google Analytics and Google Search Console are essential tools for evaluating the true impact of link building efforts on website performance. Measuring and Analyzing Link Building KPIs Essential Tools for Tracking Link Building Metrics Effective link building management requires robust tools that provide comprehensive data on your backlink profile. According to research from Databox, Ahrefs stands out as the most popular tool for link building campaigns, used by 80% of surveyed contributors. Its comprehensive backlink analysis makes it an industry standard for tracking link metrics. Beyond Ahrefs, SEMrush and Moz offer similar capabilities for backlink analysis, with each providing unique features that may better suit certain organizational needs. For SEO agencies handling multiple clients, these tools offer efficient ways to monitor progress across various campaigns simultaneously. Interestingly, while Ahrefs is widely used for link building specifically, 51.3% of SEO professionals prefer SEMrush as their favorite overall SEO tool. For thorough link building reporting, don’t overlook free tools like Google Search Console, which provides valuable data on how search engines view your backlinks. Combining data from multiple sources into a unified dashboard using tools like Databox can streamline your reporting process, creating clear visualizations that help clients understand progress at a glance. For outreach tracking, tools like Hunter have become popular for gathering prospect email addresses and managing communication efforts. Interpreting Complex Data for Clear Insights The challenge in link building reporting isn’t collecting data—it’s transforming that data into actionable insights. Start by establishing baseline measurements for each KPI before launching new campaigns. This creates a reference point for measuring progress and identifying trends over time. When analyzing link data, focus on correlation patterns between different metrics. For instance, if referring domains increase but organic traffic remains flat, this might indicate you’re acquiring links from irrelevant or low-quality sources. Look beyond surface-level numbers to understand the story your data is telling about your link building effectiveness. For link building management purposes, segment your data by campaign, content type, or acquisition method. This granular approach reveals which strategies deliver the best results and deserve more resources. According to Databox research, successful SEO professionals track metrics like response rate to outreach emails alongside traditional link metrics to optimize their processes from end to end. Benchmarking Against Industry Standards Establishing realistic expectations requires understanding how your link building performance compares to industry standards. While every website starts from a different baseline, certain benchmarks can guide your strategy development and goal-setting process. For SEO agencies, contextualizing link building reports with industry averages helps manage client expectations. For example, highly competitive industries like finance or health typically require more authoritative backlinks to see movement in rankings compared to less competitive niches. Understanding these differences prevents setting unrealistic targets that lead to perceived failure. Research from Databox indicates that tracking Domain Rating (DR) of acquired backlinks provides valuable context when benchmarking link quality. By comparing your DR distribution against competitors, you can identify gaps and opportunities in your link building strategy. Additionally, tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush offer industry-specific benchmarking features that allow you to measure your performance against similar websites. When establishing benchmarks, consider factors beyond raw link counts. Metrics like link growth rate, referring domain diversity, and traffic from backlinks often provide more meaningful comparisons than absolute numbers. For SEO agencies, creating custom benchmarking reports that account for client-specific factors like site age, existing authority, and competitive landscape delivers more valuable insights than generic industry averages. Remember that benchmarking isn’t about matching exact numbers but understanding relative performance. A new website might celebrate acquiring ten high-quality backlinks in a month, while an established authority site might consider that same number disappointing. The key is establishing realistic, contextual goals based on where you start and where your competitors stand. Strategies to Optimize Link Building through KPIs Enhancing Domain Authority Domain authority remains one of the most coveted link metrics in SEO. To boost this critical indicator, focus your link building management efforts on quality rather than quantity. Start by identifying high-authority websites in your niche that could provide valuable backlinks. According to Databox research, tracking Domain Rating (DR) of acquired backlinks is a practice followed by 67% of marketers when measuring the quality of their links. Implement a tiered outreach strategy that prioritizes high-authority targets while maintaining a steady flow of mid-level acquisitions. For effective link building reporting, track how each new backlink impacts your overall domain authority over time. This approach demonstrates clear value to clients or stakeholders by connecting specific link building efforts to measurable authority growth. Consider establishing topic clusters in your content strategy, creating comprehensive resource pages that naturally attract links from authoritative sources. This approach not only enhances domain authority but also establishes topical relevance—another factor search engines increasingly value. For SEO agencies, highlighting topic authority growth alongside domain authority in your link building reports provides clients with a more complete picture of campaign success. Improving Anchor Text Distribution Anchor text distribution directly impacts how search engines interpret your backlink profile. Your link metrics should include detailed anchor text analysis to identify potential optimization opportunities or overoptimization risks. According to Databox, anchor text distribution is among the key link building reporting metrics valued by SEO professionals. To optimize your anchor text strategy, aim for a natural distribution that includes: Branded anchors (your brand name) Naked URLs (your exact website address) Generic phrases (“click here,” “learn more”) Partial-match keywords (variations of target terms) Exact-match keywords (used sparingly) Avoid excessive exact-match keyword anchors, which can trigger algorithm penalties. Instead, focus on diversification that mimics natural linking patterns. When conducting link building for SEO agencies, educate clients about the importance of varied anchor text rather than fixating on exact-match keywords. Regular anchor text audits should be part of your link building management process. These reviews help identify potential risk areas before they become problems. If your analysis reveals an overreliance on specific anchor types, adjust your outreach strategy to request more diverse anchor text in future link building efforts. Strategies for Acquiring High-Quality Backlinks High-quality backlinks form the backbone of effective link building campaigns. Start by creating truly exceptional, linkable content assets—comprehensive guides, original research, or interactive tools that naturally attract references. These resources should address specific pain points in your industry or provide unique insights not available elsewhere. Targeted outreach remains essential for acquiring premium backlinks. Tools like Hunter, mentioned in Databox research, can streamline your outreach process by gathering prospect email addresses efficiently. Track your outreach response rates as part of your link building report to continuously refine your approach and messaging. For SEO agencies, demonstrating the quality of acquired links goes beyond domain metrics. Consider including additional contextual information in your link building reporting, such as: Topic relevance to client’s industry Estimated monthly traffic of linking pages Social engagement metrics of linking domains Editorial standards of linking publications These quality indicators provide clients with a more comprehensive understanding of your link acquisition strategy and value. Remember that a single high-quality, contextually relevant backlink often delivers more value than multiple lower-quality links. Managing and Mitigating Spammy Links Even the most careful link building strategies can attract unwanted backlinks. Proactive link profile monitoring should be a core component of your link building management approach. According to Databox findings, successful SEO professionals regularly audit their backlink profiles to identify potential toxic links before they harm rankings. Implement a systematic process for identifying and addressing problematic links: Conduct regular backlink audits (monthly or quarterly) Flag suspicious links based on quality metrics and relevance Attempt outreach for removal when appropriate Use Google’s Disavow Tool for links that cannot be removed Document all actions in your link building report For clients, explain that some toxic link accumulation is normal and doesn’t indicate a problem with your strategy. Instead, emphasize how your proactive management protects their site from potential penalties. When presenting link metrics, include a “toxicity trend” that shows how your efforts keep harmful links under control over time. SEO agencies should consider including regular backlink audits as a standard service offering. This proactive approach demonstrates value beyond just link acquisition and positions your agency as a comprehensive link building management partner rather than simply a link builder. As search algorithms continue to emphasize quality over quantity, this protective service becomes increasingly valuable to clients concerned about their long-term search visibility. Addressing Common Challenges and FAQs How Long Does It Take to See Improvements in Link Building KPIs? One of the most common questions in link building management is about timeline expectations. The truth is that improvements in link metrics vary widely depending on several factors. Typically, you’ll notice changes in direct link KPIs (like referring domains or backlink counts) immediately, but their impact on authority metrics and rankings often takes longer. For most sites, expect to see meaningful movement in domain authority metrics within 3-6 months of consistent, quality link building. However, competitive niches may require longer timeframes. When creating a link building report for clients or stakeholders, it’s crucial to set realistic expectations about these timelines from the beginning. Several factors influence how quickly you’ll see results: Your site’s existing authority (higher authority sites often see faster impacts) The quality and relevance of acquired links Consistency of link acquisition over time Competitive landscape in your niche According to Databox research, tracking both immediate metrics (new backlinks earned, referring domains) and lagging indicators (domain rating, organic traffic) provides a more complete picture of progress. This approach helps manage expectations while still demonstrating incremental wins along the way. Is It Necessary to Remove Low-Quality Links? Proper backlink hygiene remains essential in 2024’s SEO landscape. While Google has improved its ability to ignore low-quality links rather than penalizing sites for them, proactive management of your link profile is still a best practice in link building reporting. For SEO agencies, regular link audits should be part of your standard service offering. These audits help identify potentially harmful links before they impact client performance. When toxic links are discovered, you have several options: Contact webmasters requesting removal (effective but time-consuming) Use Google’s Disavow Tool (especially for links that can’t be removed) Monitor without action (for borderline cases where disavowal might do more harm than good) The key is developing a consistent process for evaluating link quality. Not every “low-quality” link requires action—focus on truly spammy or manipulative links that could trigger algorithmic or manual penalties. Document your decisions in your link building management system to maintain a clear history of actions taken. Impact of Internal and Social Media Links on KPIs While external backlinks often get the spotlight, internal linking and social media signals play important supporting roles in comprehensive link building strategies. Internal links help distribute page authority throughout your site and establish topical relevance clusters that complement your external link building efforts. In your link building report, consider including internal linking metrics alongside external backlink data. This holistic approach demonstrates how your overall link strategy (both internal and external) works together to improve site authority and user experience. Social media links typically carry “nofollow” attributes, limiting their direct SEO impact. However, they deliver other benefits worth tracking in your link metrics dashboard: Increased content visibility and amplification Potential for attracting natural backlinks from social audiences Direct referral traffic that can lead to conversions Brand awareness and reputation building For SEO agencies, explaining this ecosystem approach helps clients understand how different types of links contribute to overall performance. Tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console can help attribute traffic and engagement from these various link sources. FAQs Link Building Metrics “More links always mean better rankings.” This persistent myth needs addressing in client education. Quality and relevance now far outweigh quantity. A focused strategy targeting fewer, higher-quality links often delivers better results than mass acquisition of mediocre links. “Only follow links matter for SEO.” While follow links pass more direct ranking power, nofollow links still provide brand exposure, referral traffic, and diversification of your link profile. A natural link profile includes both types. “Domain Authority is an official Google metric.” Many clients confuse third-party authority metrics (like Moz’s DA or Ahrefs’ DR) with Google’s actual ranking factors. Explain in your link building reporting that these are useful comparative tools but not direct Google rankings factors. “All link building happens quickly.” Sustainable link building is a marathon, not a sprint. Educate stakeholders that quality link acquisition takes time and rushing typically leads to lower-quality links that deliver less long-term value. “Anchor text should always include keywords.” Excessive keyword-rich anchor text can appear manipulative. A diverse, natural-looking anchor text profile performs better long-term than one over-optimized for keywords. Related Topics for Further Exploration To deepen your link building expertise, consider exploring these related areas: Digital PR for Link Acquisition Public relations strategies increasingly overlap with link building. Techniques like data-driven stories, expert commentary, and newsworthy content can attract high-authority links from media outlets. Content-Driven Link Building Creating linkable assets—comprehensive guides, original research, or interactive tools—can generate passive link acquisition over time. This approach complements active outreach strategies. Technical SEO’s Impact on Link Equity How your site handles redirects, canonicalization, and internal linking directly affects how link equity flows through your site. Technical optimizations can maximize the value of your link building efforts. Competitive Link Analysis Techniques Advanced competitive analysis helps identify link gaps and opportunities. Learning to effectively analyze competitor backlink profiles can reveal valuable strategic insights. Local Link Building Strategies For businesses with physical locations, local link building techniques focused on community relationships and geographic relevance offer unique opportunities. For SEO agencies looking to enhance their link building services, staying current with these evolving topics helps maintain a competitive edge. Consider incorporating educational content about these areas in your client communications and link building reporting to demonstrate your ongoing expertise and value.

Link Relevancy and Contextual Value Link relevancy has become increasingly important as search algorithms grow more sophisticated. Backlinks from websites in related industries or discussing similar topics carry more weight than random links from unrelated sources. In your link building management dashboard, include metrics that assess contextual relevance—not just domain authority. This might involve categorizing backlinks by industry, content type, or topical overlap with your site. The contextual value of a link often determines its true impact on your rankings more than raw authority metrics. For SEO agencies, showing the relevancy of acquired links adds another dimension to client reporting. Beyond showing that you’ve secured links from high-authority sites, you can highlight how these links come from sources that align with the client’s industry and audience interests. Follow vs. Nofollow Links Modern link building strategies should balance follow links (which pass SEO value) with nofollow links (which typically don’t). While follow links remain the priority for direct ranking benefits, nofollow links still contribute to a natural-looking backlink profile. When tracking link metrics, categorize links by their attribute type to ensure a balanced distribution. Too many follow links from low-quality sources can appear manipulative, while a profile containing only follow links looks unnatural in today’s linking environment. According to Databox data, successful link building campaigns typically track both follow and nofollow acquisition separately while maintaining focus on high-quality links regardless of attribute. Even nofollow links from respected sources can drive significant referral traffic and brand visibility. Traffic and Engagement from Backlinks Beyond their SEO impact, high-quality backlinks should generate direct referral traffic and engagement. Monitoring these downstream effects provides a more complete picture of your link building ROI. Effective link building reporting connects backlink acquisition to actual business outcomes by tracking metrics like referral traffic, time on site from referral sources, and conversion rates from backlink traffic. This approach demonstrates value beyond simple link counts or domain authority scores. For SEO agencies, showcasing traffic generation alongside traditional link metrics creates more compelling client reports. Using tools like Google Analytics alongside specialized SEO platforms provides this comprehensive view. As Databox research indicates, both Google Analytics and Google Search Console are essential tools for evaluating the true impact of link building efforts on website performance. Measuring and Analyzing Link Building KPIs Essential Tools for Tracking Link Building Metrics Effective link building management requires robust tools that provide comprehensive data on your backlink profile. According to research from Databox, Ahrefs stands out as the most popular tool for link building campaigns, used by 80% of surveyed contributors. Its comprehensive backlink analysis makes it an industry standard for tracking link metrics. Beyond Ahrefs, SEMrush and Moz offer similar capabilities for backlink analysis, with each providing unique features that may better suit certain organizational needs. For SEO agencies handling multiple clients, these tools offer efficient ways to monitor progress across various campaigns simultaneously. Interestingly, while Ahrefs is widely used for link building specifically, 51.3% of SEO professionals prefer SEMrush as their favorite overall SEO tool. For thorough link building reporting, don’t overlook free tools like Google Search Console, which provides valuable data on how search engines view your backlinks. Combining data from multiple sources into a unified dashboard using tools like Databox can streamline your reporting process, creating clear visualizations that help clients understand progress at a glance. For outreach tracking, tools like Hunter have become popular for gathering prospect email addresses and managing communication efforts. Interpreting Complex Data for Clear Insights The challenge in link building reporting isn’t collecting data—it’s transforming that data into actionable insights. Start by establishing baseline measurements for each KPI before launching new campaigns. This creates a reference point for measuring progress and identifying trends over time. When analyzing link data, focus on correlation patterns between different metrics. For instance, if referring domains increase but organic traffic remains flat, this might indicate you’re acquiring links from irrelevant or low-quality sources. Look beyond surface-level numbers to understand the story your data is telling about your link building effectiveness. For link building management purposes, segment your data by campaign, content type, or acquisition method. This granular approach reveals which strategies deliver the best results and deserve more resources. According to Databox research, successful SEO professionals track metrics like response rate to outreach emails alongside traditional link metrics to optimize their processes from end to end. Benchmarking Against Industry Standards Establishing realistic expectations requires understanding how your link building performance compares to industry standards. While every website starts from a different baseline, certain benchmarks can guide your strategy development and goal-setting process. For SEO agencies, contextualizing link building reports with industry averages helps manage client expectations. For example, highly competitive industries like finance or health typically require more authoritative backlinks to see movement in rankings compared to less competitive niches. Understanding these differences prevents setting unrealistic targets that lead to perceived failure. Research from Databox indicates that tracking Domain Rating (DR) of acquired backlinks provides valuable context when benchmarking link quality. By comparing your DR distribution against competitors, you can identify gaps and opportunities in your link building strategy. Additionally, tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush offer industry-specific benchmarking features that allow you to measure your performance against similar websites. When establishing benchmarks, consider factors beyond raw link counts. Metrics like link growth rate, referring domain diversity, and traffic from backlinks often provide more meaningful comparisons than absolute numbers. For SEO agencies, creating custom benchmarking reports that account for client-specific factors like site age, existing authority, and competitive landscape delivers more valuable insights than generic industry averages. Remember that benchmarking isn’t about matching exact numbers but understanding relative performance. A new website might celebrate acquiring ten high-quality backlinks in a month, while an established authority site might consider that same number disappointing. The key is establishing realistic, contextual goals based on where you start and where your competitors stand. Strategies to Optimize Link Building through KPIs Enhancing Domain Authority Domain authority remains one of the most coveted link metrics in SEO. To boost this critical indicator, focus your link building management efforts on quality rather than quantity. Start by identifying high-authority websites in your niche that could provide valuable backlinks. According to Databox research, tracking Domain Rating (DR) of acquired backlinks is a practice followed by 67% of marketers when measuring the quality of their links. Implement a tiered outreach strategy that prioritizes high-authority targets while maintaining a steady flow of mid-level acquisitions. For effective link building reporting, track how each new backlink impacts your overall domain authority over time. This approach demonstrates clear value to clients or stakeholders by connecting specific link building efforts to measurable authority growth. Consider establishing topic clusters in your content strategy, creating comprehensive resource pages that naturally attract links from authoritative sources. This approach not only enhances domain authority but also establishes topical relevance—another factor search engines increasingly value. For SEO agencies, highlighting topic authority growth alongside domain authority in your link building reports provides clients with a more complete picture of campaign success. Improving Anchor Text Distribution Anchor text distribution directly impacts how search engines interpret your backlink profile. Your link metrics should include detailed anchor text analysis to identify potential optimization opportunities or overoptimization risks. According to Databox, anchor text distribution is among the key link building reporting metrics valued by SEO professionals. To optimize your anchor text strategy, aim for a natural distribution that includes: Branded anchors (your brand name) Naked URLs (your exact website address) Generic phrases (“click here,” “learn more”) Partial-match keywords (variations of target terms) Exact-match keywords (used sparingly) Avoid excessive exact-match keyword anchors, which can trigger algorithm penalties. Instead, focus on diversification that mimics natural linking patterns. When conducting link building for SEO agencies, educate clients about the importance of varied anchor text rather than fixating on exact-match keywords. Regular anchor text audits should be part of your link building management process. These reviews help identify potential risk areas before they become problems. If your analysis reveals an overreliance on specific anchor types, adjust your outreach strategy to request more diverse anchor text in future link building efforts. Strategies for Acquiring High-Quality Backlinks High-quality backlinks form the backbone of effective link building campaigns. Start by creating truly exceptional, linkable content assets—comprehensive guides, original research, or interactive tools that naturally attract references. These resources should address specific pain points in your industry or provide unique insights not available elsewhere. Targeted outreach remains essential for acquiring premium backlinks. Tools like Hunter, mentioned in Databox research, can streamline your outreach process by gathering prospect email addresses efficiently. Track your outreach response rates as part of your link building report to continuously refine your approach and messaging. For SEO agencies, demonstrating the quality of acquired links goes beyond domain metrics. Consider including additional contextual information in your link building reporting, such as: Topic relevance to client’s industry Estimated monthly traffic of linking pages Social engagement metrics of linking domains Editorial standards of linking publications These quality indicators provide clients with a more comprehensive understanding of your link acquisition strategy and value. Remember that a single high-quality, contextually relevant backlink often delivers more value than multiple lower-quality links. Managing and Mitigating Spammy Links Even the most careful link building strategies can attract unwanted backlinks. Proactive link profile monitoring should be a core component of your link building management approach. According to Databox findings, successful SEO professionals regularly audit their backlink profiles to identify potential toxic links before they harm rankings. Implement a systematic process for identifying and addressing problematic links: Conduct regular backlink audits (monthly or quarterly) Flag suspicious links based on quality metrics and relevance Attempt outreach for removal when appropriate Use Google’s Disavow Tool for links that cannot be removed Document all actions in your link building report For clients, explain that some toxic link accumulation is normal and doesn’t indicate a problem with your strategy. Instead, emphasize how your proactive management protects their site from potential penalties. When presenting link metrics, include a “toxicity trend” that shows how your efforts keep harmful links under control over time. SEO agencies should consider including regular backlink audits as a standard service offering. This proactive approach demonstrates value beyond just link acquisition and positions your agency as a comprehensive link building management partner rather than simply a link builder. As search algorithms continue to emphasize quality over quantity, this protective service becomes increasingly valuable to clients concerned about their long-term search visibility. Addressing Common Challenges and FAQs How Long Does It Take to See Improvements in Link Building KPIs? One of the most common questions in link building management is about timeline expectations. The truth is that improvements in link metrics vary widely depending on several factors. Typically, you’ll notice changes in direct link KPIs (like referring domains or backlink counts) immediately, but their impact on authority metrics and rankings often takes longer. For most sites, expect to see meaningful movement in domain authority metrics within 3-6 months of consistent, quality link building. However, competitive niches may require longer timeframes. When creating a link building report for clients or stakeholders, it’s crucial to set realistic expectations about these timelines from the beginning. Several factors influence how quickly you’ll see results: Your site’s existing authority (higher authority sites often see faster impacts) The quality and relevance of acquired links Consistency of link acquisition over time Competitive landscape in your niche According to Databox research, tracking both immediate metrics (new backlinks earned, referring domains) and lagging indicators (domain rating, organic traffic) provides a more complete picture of progress. This approach helps manage expectations while still demonstrating incremental wins along the way. Is It Necessary to Remove Low-Quality Links? Proper backlink hygiene remains essential in 2024’s SEO landscape. While Google has improved its ability to ignore low-quality links rather than penalizing sites for them, proactive management of your link profile is still a best practice in link building reporting. For SEO agencies, regular link audits should be part of your standard service offering. These audits help identify potentially harmful links before they impact client performance. When toxic links are discovered, you have several options: Contact webmasters requesting removal (effective but time-consuming) Use Google’s Disavow Tool (especially for links that can’t be removed) Monitor without action (for borderline cases where disavowal might do more harm than good) The key is developing a consistent process for evaluating link quality. Not every “low-quality” link requires action—focus on truly spammy or manipulative links that could trigger algorithmic or manual penalties. Document your decisions in your link building management system to maintain a clear history of actions taken. Impact of Internal and Social Media Links on KPIs While external backlinks often get the spotlight, internal linking and social media signals play important supporting roles in comprehensive link building strategies. Internal links help distribute page authority throughout your site and establish topical relevance clusters that complement your external link building efforts. In your link building report, consider including internal linking metrics alongside external backlink data. This holistic approach demonstrates how your overall link strategy (both internal and external) works together to improve site authority and user experience. Social media links typically carry “nofollow” attributes, limiting their direct SEO impact. However, they deliver other benefits worth tracking in your link metrics dashboard: Increased content visibility and amplification Potential for attracting natural backlinks from social audiences Direct referral traffic that can lead to conversions Brand awareness and reputation building For SEO agencies, explaining this ecosystem approach helps clients understand how different types of links contribute to overall performance. Tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console can help attribute traffic and engagement from these various link sources. FAQs Link Building Metrics “More links always mean better rankings.” This persistent myth needs addressing in client education. Quality and relevance now far outweigh quantity. A focused strategy targeting fewer, higher-quality links often delivers better results than mass acquisition of mediocre links. “Only follow links matter for SEO.” While follow links pass more direct ranking power, nofollow links still provide brand exposure, referral traffic, and diversification of your link profile. A natural link profile includes both types. “Domain Authority is an official Google metric.” Many clients confuse third-party authority metrics (like Moz’s DA or Ahrefs’ DR) with Google’s actual ranking factors. Explain in your link building reporting that these are useful comparative tools but not direct Google rankings factors. “All link building happens quickly.” Sustainable link building is a marathon, not a sprint. Educate stakeholders that quality link acquisition takes time and rushing typically leads to lower-quality links that deliver less long-term value. “Anchor text should always include keywords.” Excessive keyword-rich anchor text can appear manipulative. A diverse, natural-looking anchor text profile performs better long-term than one over-optimized for keywords. Related Topics for Further Exploration To deepen your link building expertise, consider exploring these related areas: Digital PR for Link Acquisition Public relations strategies increasingly overlap with link building. Techniques like data-driven stories, expert commentary, and newsworthy content can attract high-authority links from media outlets. Content-Driven Link Building Creating linkable assets—comprehensive guides, original research, or interactive tools—can generate passive link acquisition over time. This approach complements active outreach strategies. Technical SEO’s Impact on Link Equity How your site handles redirects, canonicalization, and internal linking directly affects how link equity flows through your site. Technical optimizations can maximize the value of your link building efforts. Competitive Link Analysis Techniques Advanced competitive analysis helps identify link gaps and opportunities. Learning to effectively analyze competitor backlink profiles can reveal valuable strategic insights. Local Link Building Strategies For businesses with physical locations, local link building techniques focused on community relationships and geographic relevance offer unique opportunities. For SEO agencies looking to enhance their link building services, staying current with these evolving topics helps maintain a competitive edge. Consider incorporating educational content about these areas in your client communications and link building reporting to demonstrate your ongoing expertise and value.

It’s easy to guess that you should Google “Keyword + Write For Us” or look at high-ranking sites in your target niche and scrape their backlinks. What you really need is a list of inventive tips that you’ve not tried before. Having been involved in building backlinks and running a link building service from the UK since 2008, I know the techniques that few ever put on generic lists. So dive in, and I’ll share some of the innovative strategies that we use to get backlinks. Let’s get started! How to get backlinks: tools & strategies 1. Look beyond your competitors for opportunities Many link builders recommend that you check out your competitor’s backlinks for inspiration; but have you thought of checking out the backlink profiles of the sites that link to them? Go down the rabbit hole! Check out the backlink profiles of the sites that link to your competitors, then check the backlink profiles of the sites that link to them, and so on. Some great tools for this are Ahrefs, Majestic SEO and Moz Link Explorer. It might sound convoluted, but you’ll tap into a supply of fresh site options to explore if you use this method. 2. Dig deep into Ahrefs’ link building tools Ahrefs is a very handy bit of kit for link building, and there are loads of different ways to make the most of it. The solution has various tools that can help you to find high-quality backlink opportunities. It also offers lots of filters so that you can find the right sites for your backlink profile. For starters, you can use the Keyword Explorer tool to find associated keywords that other high-ranking pages in your niche incorporate into their content. These keywords can inform every stage of your process; if you don’t get much joy with your main keywords, or you exhaust all of the options, you can use associated keywords to find more sites. You can then put your new keywords into Ahrefs’ Content Explorer to find pages that discuss your chosen topic and rank well for the keywords you’re targeting. Then, you can use the Link Intersect tool to find sites that link to your new targets but don’t link to your site – yet! Finally, one of the most ingenious ways to use Ahrefs as one of your link building strategies is to check out the Site Explorer to see growing pages. By using the “Top content” section, you can see the pages on each target URL or competitor’s site that are growing the fastest. You can then target the sites that are linking to them, as well as seeing if you can emulate their approach. For example, if your competitor is driving a lot of traffic to a new press release or announcement, then you could incorporate this approach into your digital marketing strategy. As you can see, Ahrefs is a favorite tool of mine. My team and I use it a lot when building backlinks and finding exciting new opportunities for our clients and our own site. 3. See what sites rank on BuzzSumo Another great tool that can help you find amazing sites for your link building strategy is BuzzSumo. Using BuzzSumo’s Web Content search tool, you can find top-performing content that ranks for your target keywords and phrases. The site shows you the engagement that the content received on a range of platforms, as well as its own metric, “Evergreen Score.” The Evergreen Score is BuzzSumo’s unique value, given to each piece of content based on the engagement and backlink earnings 30 days after being published. This is an indication that the content is continuing to provide value when it’s no longer new. The more ongoing engagement the piece gets, the more evergreen—that is to say, continually relevant—BuzzSumo finds the piece. Using this score and the other engagement information provided by BuzzSumo, you can find sites that publish lasting and engaging content in your niche. You can also use this information for outreach: you could highlight the content as a high-performing piece and suggest a similar topic to emulate its success. 4. Review your organic competitors on SEMrush SEMrush is another versatile tool that I love using to find link building opportunities. With dozens of useful tools and analytics to offer, there are loads of ways you can use SEMrush in link building. One great way to start is to find your organic competitors and then explore their backlinks. You could even consider reaching out to them if you’re in a “sharing is caring” kind of market! To find your organic competitors, you can put your site into the “Domain Overview” section, then check out the Organic Research insights that the tool can offer. The tool will give you loads of amazing insights into your organic rankings, including your main organic competitors. You can then export this data as a CSV and work through the sites, assessing linking domains and other insights. Using this approach, you can gather loads of data and potentially find thousands of potential backlinking opportunities. 5. Never rely on one metric alone There are loads of SEO metrics out there—it seems like almost every tool on the market has at least one! Each metric represents something different, whether it’s total number of backlinks or content quality. When building backlinks, you need to consider a range of metrics, including traffic. You should look for a metric that focuses on how likely a page is to rank on top SERPs, such as Moz’s Domain Authority. You could also consider a metric that focuses on the quality of the sites linking to your chosen domain, such as Majestic SEO’s Trust Flow. Obviously, these companies don’t tell us exactly how they calculate their scores, or else we could copy them. So you need to be objective and use a combination of metrics to assess sites. If you focus on one single metric without fully understanding it, then you could miss out on valuable link building opportunities. Incidentally, at UK Linkology, we felt that none of the current metrics could reliably give us enough confidence to accept or reject a site. We remedied this by creating our own formula that uses domain-level metrics like Moz DA and combines them with organic traffic and keyword metrics. (You can read more about how we developed and use our M-Flux metric here.) 6. Think like a visitor In addition to metrics, you also need to consider the human approach with your link building strategies. Before you commit to a site as a link building target, make sure that you look at it as a website visitor. Open the site and see if it looks like a real person is connected to it. Does the site have a social media presence? Is the content readable? Do they use generic stock images or unique pictures? If you think the site looks like a PBN (private blog network), then the chances are that it is one. Readers and search algorithms will notice too, so avoid it at all costs. How to get backlinks: outreach & communication tips 7. Use Facebook’s “About” section to find email addresses Finding email addresses can be tough, and everyone knows that contact forms aren’t the best when you’re trying to chase link building opportunities. So, how can you find email addresses when they’re not on the contact page? While tools like Hunter.io can help, there are easier and sometimes quicker ways, especially if you don’t have a pro plan and run out of free checks! Often, businesses have an email address listed on their Facebook page’s About section. You don’t even need to be logged in to Facebook to access this—most business pages are visible to everyone! Check out the Contact Details, beneath the Business Info section, to find an email address. Usually, this email sends you directly to the online editor or marketing team, so your email will get delivered to your target audience! 8. Don’t be afraid to follow up It’s not nagging if it’s for a good cause. Never be afraid to send follow-up emails to your target websites. Often, my team and I find that follow-up emails actually get the highest response rate! They might’ve missed your first email, or forgotten it, but a follow-up is harder to ignore. As a rule, we usually follow up two or three times. If there’s no response after that, then it usually means they either hate you, or the email isn’t in regular use. Try finding an alternative contact, and if that doesn’t work and you still hear nada, then write that site off as a lost cause. Don’t waste too much time on sites that ignore you, and instead focus on finding exciting new opportunities and dealing with the sites that actually respond. 9. Personalize your outreach templates with unique insights (not just their name) Templates save you time, but you can spot them a mile off! So, while you should use a template, you need to make sure that it can be personalized to your target. That personalization could be as simple as adding the name of the recipient and merging their site name into the email. But you can use email sending tools, such as Mailshake, to mass mail your template while also including personal information. As well as names, you should try to add unique insight into their site. For example, if you’ve got access to SEO tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush, then you can use them to see the top-ranking pages. You can then mention that you want to create something similar or emulate the style of that post to earn even more traffic for them. Most site owners will know that you’re looking for a backlink, but they’ll be willing to help if they think they can get something out of the deal. So, you need to show them the benefits of working with you. If they don’t see them in your first email, then they’re probably not going to ask. 10. Follow the site’s contributor guidelines Many sites have a “write for us” page to let potential writers know what they’re looking for. Here is WordStream’s page, for example. If your target site has one, then you need to follow the instructions on it. Most quality sites will have instructions, so you need to make sure that you use them. For example, many sites ask that you use a specific subject line. Some even have a phrase that they use to check that you’ve read the content guidelines. Even if they don’t have specific instructions, you should read the “write for us” page and see if there’s anything on it that you can use. Some pages will include a joke, so as part of your personalization of the outreach email, you could reference and riff on the joke. This approach will make them see that there’s a human behind the email, and that they’re not just a number on a massive list sent out by a faceless agency. 11. Don’t be afraid of quality link drops “Link drops” sound ominous, but in reality, they can be a great way to save yourself time. You can find an article on your chosen topic, then offer to add your quote and link. Many link builders use the broken link method to find links that have disappeared over time and recommend their own link as a replacement. We have also found that tools like Pitchbox and HARO work really well for finding opportunities for link drops. Using these tools, you can find opportunities to add your link to an article and save yourself time; instead of writing a full article, you only need to write a quote! When you’re link dropping, you need to check the metrics of the page as well as the overall site. There’s no point in dropping your link onto a great site but choosing a piece of content that doesn’t get any traffic or have any authority. Old pages that have not garnered any authority are unlikely to do so and are best avoided. Use SEMrush to check the traffic for the page and review the engagement using BuzzSumo to make sure that you pick valuable link drop opportunities. Also use metrics like Moz Page Authority (PA) and Ahrefs UR to get a feel for how internal links might be affecting pages you are considering. Final tips on how to get backlinks 12. Alternate your anchor text Search engines are always on the lookout for link building activities, so you need to make yours hard to spot by being smart with your anchor text. A load of sites with the same or similar metrics, all linking back to you at around the same time, with the same anchor text, all in one backlink profile, is deeply suspicious. That’s why variation is key throughout your backlink profile. As well as varying the sites that you target, you should also vary the anchor text you use on your links. A rule of thumb is never (or almost never) use the same one twice. This approach makes your backlink profile look more natural and increases your chances of achieving the rankings you’re aiming for. 13. Remember a higher word count isn’t always better Many blogs will require you to write a long-form content piece to get a guest post spot, but quantity doesn’t always mean quality or SEO success. Search engines are focused on usability as well as technical SEO, so if your content is full of filler words, then it won’t achieve your objectives. The point is to supply Google with enough information to answer the query fully and accurately—and sometimes that can be done in three words! You need to research the SERPs and see what Google is already ranking on page one. Then look to improve on the incumbent pages or tackle the query from a completely new angle. Equally, if you’re writing an ultimate guide, then you need to provide everything that the reader needs to know. In that case, you might need to go in-depth, which means more words. Write content that will meet your readers’ needs (AKA intent), and you’ll benefit your SEO at the same time. Writing fluff to fit a word count won’t get your rankings off the ground! 14. Write content you’d be happy to publish When writing your content for this type of back link strategy, make sure that it’s of the same quality that you’d use on your own site. The content might not be published on your site, but if it’s got your link in it, then you will be affiliated with it one way or another. As such, you need to make sure you produce quality, insightful content. After all, the best backlinks are found in quality content. The more engagement and traffic that your piece gets, the more benefit it will bring to any sites it links to, including yours. How to get backlinks: recap Link building is an art, so get creative! If you finish this article having learned only one thing, let it be this: link building is an ever-evolving market. These techniques work for us now, and they could help you. That doesn’t mean that they’re the only ways to get backlinks. Use your ingenuity and resources to find unique approaches that work for you. I’ve been building backlinks for decades, so I’ve saved you time with these tips. That being said, the best thing I can recommend is that you test everything and keep going.

It’s easy to guess that you should Google “Keyword + Write For Us” or look at high-ranking sites in your target niche and scrape their backlinks. What you really need is a list of inventive tips that you’ve not tried before. Having been involved in building backlinks and running a link building service from the UK since 2008, I know the techniques that few ever put on generic lists. So dive in, and I’ll share some of the innovative strategies that we use to get backlinks. Let’s get started! How to get backlinks: tools & strategies 1. Look beyond your competitors for opportunities Many link builders recommend that you check out your competitor’s backlinks for inspiration; but have you thought of checking out the backlink profiles of the sites that link to them? Go down the rabbit hole! Check out the backlink profiles of the sites that link to your competitors, then check the backlink profiles of the sites that link to them, and so on. Some great tools for this are Ahrefs, Majestic SEO and Moz Link Explorer. It might sound convoluted, but you’ll tap into a supply of fresh site options to explore if you use this method. 2. Dig deep into Ahrefs’ link building tools Ahrefs is a very handy bit of kit for link building, and there are loads of different ways to make the most of it. The solution has various tools that can help you to find high-quality backlink opportunities. It also offers lots of filters so that you can find the right sites for your backlink profile. For starters, you can use the Keyword Explorer tool to find associated keywords that other high-ranking pages in your niche incorporate into their content. These keywords can inform every stage of your process; if you don’t get much joy with your main keywords, or you exhaust all of the options, you can use associated keywords to find more sites. You can then put your new keywords into Ahrefs’ Content Explorer to find pages that discuss your chosen topic and rank well for the keywords you’re targeting. Then, you can use the Link Intersect tool to find sites that link to your new targets but don’t link to your site – yet! Finally, one of the most ingenious ways to use Ahrefs as one of your link building strategies is to check out the Site Explorer to see growing pages. By using the “Top content” section, you can see the pages on each target URL or competitor’s site that are growing the fastest. You can then target the sites that are linking to them, as well as seeing if you can emulate their approach. For example, if your competitor is driving a lot of traffic to a new press release or announcement, then you could incorporate this approach into your digital marketing strategy. As you can see, Ahrefs is a favorite tool of mine. My team and I use it a lot when building backlinks and finding exciting new opportunities for our clients and our own site. 3. See what sites rank on BuzzSumo Another great tool that can help you find amazing sites for your link building strategy is BuzzSumo. Using BuzzSumo’s Web Content search tool, you can find top-performing content that ranks for your target keywords and phrases. The site shows you the engagement that the content received on a range of platforms, as well as its own metric, “Evergreen Score.” The Evergreen Score is BuzzSumo’s unique value, given to each piece of content based on the engagement and backlink earnings 30 days after being published. This is an indication that the content is continuing to provide value when it’s no longer new. The more ongoing engagement the piece gets, the more evergreen—that is to say, continually relevant—BuzzSumo finds the piece. Using this score and the other engagement information provided by BuzzSumo, you can find sites that publish lasting and engaging content in your niche. You can also use this information for outreach: you could highlight the content as a high-performing piece and suggest a similar topic to emulate its success. 4. Review your organic competitors on SEMrush SEMrush is another versatile tool that I love using to find link building opportunities. With dozens of useful tools and analytics to offer, there are loads of ways you can use SEMrush in link building. One great way to start is to find your organic competitors and then explore their backlinks. You could even consider reaching out to them if you’re in a “sharing is caring” kind of market! To find your organic competitors, you can put your site into the “Domain Overview” section, then check out the Organic Research insights that the tool can offer. The tool will give you loads of amazing insights into your organic rankings, including your main organic competitors. You can then export this data as a CSV and work through the sites, assessing linking domains and other insights. Using this approach, you can gather loads of data and potentially find thousands of potential backlinking opportunities. 5. Never rely on one metric alone There are loads of SEO metrics out there—it seems like almost every tool on the market has at least one! Each metric represents something different, whether it’s total number of backlinks or content quality. When building backlinks, you need to consider a range of metrics, including traffic. You should look for a metric that focuses on how likely a page is to rank on top SERPs, such as Moz’s Domain Authority. You could also consider a metric that focuses on the quality of the sites linking to your chosen domain, such as Majestic SEO’s Trust Flow. Obviously, these companies don’t tell us exactly how they calculate their scores, or else we could copy them. So you need to be objective and use a combination of metrics to assess sites. If you focus on one single metric without fully understanding it, then you could miss out on valuable link building opportunities. Incidentally, at UK Linkology, we felt that none of the current metrics could reliably give us enough confidence to accept or reject a site. We remedied this by creating our own formula that uses domain-level metrics like Moz DA and combines them with organic traffic and keyword metrics. (You can read more about how we developed and use our M-Flux metric here.) 6. Think like a visitor In addition to metrics, you also need to consider the human approach with your link building strategies. Before you commit to a site as a link building target, make sure that you look at it as a website visitor. Open the site and see if it looks like a real person is connected to it. Does the site have a social media presence? Is the content readable? Do they use generic stock images or unique pictures? If you think the site looks like a PBN (private blog network), then the chances are that it is one. Readers and search algorithms will notice too, so avoid it at all costs. How to get backlinks: outreach & communication tips 7. Use Facebook’s “About” section to find email addresses Finding email addresses can be tough, and everyone knows that contact forms aren’t the best when you’re trying to chase link building opportunities. So, how can you find email addresses when they’re not on the contact page? While tools like Hunter.io can help, there are easier and sometimes quicker ways, especially if you don’t have a pro plan and run out of free checks! Often, businesses have an email address listed on their Facebook page’s About section. You don’t even need to be logged in to Facebook to access this—most business pages are visible to everyone! Check out the Contact Details, beneath the Business Info section, to find an email address. Usually, this email sends you directly to the online editor or marketing team, so your email will get delivered to your target audience! 8. Don’t be afraid to follow up It’s not nagging if it’s for a good cause. Never be afraid to send follow-up emails to your target websites. Often, my team and I find that follow-up emails actually get the highest response rate! They might’ve missed your first email, or forgotten it, but a follow-up is harder to ignore. As a rule, we usually follow up two or three times. If there’s no response after that, then it usually means they either hate you, or the email isn’t in regular use. Try finding an alternative contact, and if that doesn’t work and you still hear nada, then write that site off as a lost cause. Don’t waste too much time on sites that ignore you, and instead focus on finding exciting new opportunities and dealing with the sites that actually respond. 9. Personalize your outreach templates with unique insights (not just their name) Templates save you time, but you can spot them a mile off! So, while you should use a template, you need to make sure that it can be personalized to your target. That personalization could be as simple as adding the name of the recipient and merging their site name into the email. But you can use email sending tools, such as Mailshake, to mass mail your template while also including personal information. As well as names, you should try to add unique insight into their site. For example, if you’ve got access to SEO tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush, then you can use them to see the top-ranking pages. You can then mention that you want to create something similar or emulate the style of that post to earn even more traffic for them. Most site owners will know that you’re looking for a backlink, but they’ll be willing to help if they think they can get something out of the deal. So, you need to show them the benefits of working with you. If they don’t see them in your first email, then they’re probably not going to ask. 10. Follow the site’s contributor guidelines Many sites have a “write for us” page to let potential writers know what they’re looking for. Here is WordStream’s page, for example. If your target site has one, then you need to follow the instructions on it. Most quality sites will have instructions, so you need to make sure that you use them. For example, many sites ask that you use a specific subject line. Some even have a phrase that they use to check that you’ve read the content guidelines. Even if they don’t have specific instructions, you should read the “write for us” page and see if there’s anything on it that you can use. Some pages will include a joke, so as part of your personalization of the outreach email, you could reference and riff on the joke. This approach will make them see that there’s a human behind the email, and that they’re not just a number on a massive list sent out by a faceless agency. 11. Don’t be afraid of quality link drops “Link drops” sound ominous, but in reality, they can be a great way to save yourself time. You can find an article on your chosen topic, then offer to add your quote and link. Many link builders use the broken link method to find links that have disappeared over time and recommend their own link as a replacement. We have also found that tools like Pitchbox and HARO work really well for finding opportunities for link drops. Using these tools, you can find opportunities to add your link to an article and save yourself time; instead of writing a full article, you only need to write a quote! When you’re link dropping, you need to check the metrics of the page as well as the overall site. There’s no point in dropping your link onto a great site but choosing a piece of content that doesn’t get any traffic or have any authority. Old pages that have not garnered any authority are unlikely to do so and are best avoided. Use SEMrush to check the traffic for the page and review the engagement using BuzzSumo to make sure that you pick valuable link drop opportunities. Also use metrics like Moz Page Authority (PA) and Ahrefs UR to get a feel for how internal links might be affecting pages you are considering. Final tips on how to get backlinks 12. Alternate your anchor text Search engines are always on the lookout for link building activities, so you need to make yours hard to spot by being smart with your anchor text. A load of sites with the same or similar metrics, all linking back to you at around the same time, with the same anchor text, all in one backlink profile, is deeply suspicious. That’s why variation is key throughout your backlink profile. As well as varying the sites that you target, you should also vary the anchor text you use on your links. A rule of thumb is never (or almost never) use the same one twice. This approach makes your backlink profile look more natural and increases your chances of achieving the rankings you’re aiming for. 13. Remember a higher word count isn’t always better Many blogs will require you to write a long-form content piece to get a guest post spot, but quantity doesn’t always mean quality or SEO success. Search engines are focused on usability as well as technical SEO, so if your content is full of filler words, then it won’t achieve your objectives. The point is to supply Google with enough information to answer the query fully and accurately—and sometimes that can be done in three words! You need to research the SERPs and see what Google is already ranking on page one. Then look to improve on the incumbent pages or tackle the query from a completely new angle. Equally, if you’re writing an ultimate guide, then you need to provide everything that the reader needs to know. In that case, you might need to go in-depth, which means more words. Write content that will meet your readers’ needs (AKA intent), and you’ll benefit your SEO at the same time. Writing fluff to fit a word count won’t get your rankings off the ground! 14. Write content you’d be happy to publish When writing your content for this type of back link strategy, make sure that it’s of the same quality that you’d use on your own site. The content might not be published on your site, but if it’s got your link in it, then you will be affiliated with it one way or another. As such, you need to make sure you produce quality, insightful content. After all, the best backlinks are found in quality content. The more engagement and traffic that your piece gets, the more benefit it will bring to any sites it links to, including yours. How to get backlinks: recap Link building is an art, so get creative! If you finish this article having learned only one thing, let it be this: link building is an ever-evolving market. These techniques work for us now, and they could help you. That doesn’t mean that they’re the only ways to get backlinks. Use your ingenuity and resources to find unique approaches that work for you. I’ve been building backlinks for decades, so I’ve saved you time with these tips. That being said, the best thing I can recommend is that you test everything and keep going. You never know what works and what doesn’t until you try it. To recap, here is how to get backlinks: Look beyond your competitors for opportunities Dig deep into Ahrefs’ link building tools See what sites rank on BuzzSumo Review your organic competitors on SEMrush Never rely on one metric alone Think like a visitor Use Facebook’s “About” section to find email addresses Don’t be afraid to follow up Personalize your outreach templates with unique insights (not just their name) Follow the site’s contributor guidelines Don’t be afraid of quality link drops Alternate your anchor text Remember a higher word count isn’t always better Write content you’d be happy to publish Good luck building some great links!

  "existingPosts": "# Man, you won’t believe the crap I’ve seen with backlinks!\n\nSo, the main topic revolves around strategies for obtaining high-quality backlinks for a website, emphasizing the importance of ethical SEO practices and content creation that genuinely offers value. You got it? The world of backlinks is wild, my friend. Picture me sitting in a dimly lit diner, channeling all my energy into this rant. Buckle up because we’re hitting this topic from both ends.\n\nListen, backlinks are like oxygen for your website. Without them, you’re gasping for air, stuck in the depths of page two (or worse) of search results. It’s not just about climbing that SEO ladder; it’s about building a reputation, establishing your presence, and doing it all ethically. We’re ripping past the fluff and getting into the raw shit about creating content that genuinely offers value—not just jargon-filled pages chasing the latest SEO trend.\n\nThis isn’t a game of manipulation or shortcuts. Trust me, I've been there and done that, and it blew up in my face harder than my cousin Tony’s epic paint mishap! That dude thought he was some kind of Picasso and trashed his whole setup with paint everywhere when he tried to DIY. I’d swear, I didn’t think it was possible to mess up so badly. Paint on the ceiling? Yeah, that happened.\n\nBut Tony’s moment of chaos taught me something vital. If you don’t take the time to lay down a solid foundation, the entire structure can come crashing down in a colorful frenzy of regret. Same goes for your website; if you’re not building those backlinks ethically, you’ll be cleaning up a mess you didn’t even see coming.\n\nNow, let’s strap in because it’s a rollercoaster—here’s the full damn ride…\n\n## Why Quick Fixes Aren’t Enough\n\nLet’s hit the ground running. Quick fixes are like a sugar rush; they feel great for a hot minute but leave you crashing hard. Picture my buddy Tony again, who started that eco-friendly paint company. Dude went viral on social media one day, and boom! Sales sp",
