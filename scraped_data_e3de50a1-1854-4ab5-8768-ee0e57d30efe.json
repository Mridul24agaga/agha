  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, let’s take a crack at it. So, the URL you dropped—https://playpickups.app/—gives off some vibes that it’s all about interactive fun, maybe gaming or something cool in the sports realm. First off, the \"play\" part in the URL definitely hints at some sort of active engagement. We might be looking at an app that lets you participate in games or contests. Think about it: there’s loads of apps these days where you can predict outcomes, join leagues, or just generally get in on the action. If it’s got “play” in the name, it's probably got something to do with having a good time, right? Now, “pickups” is an interesting word here. It makes me think of sports, maybe fantasy leagues or something like fantasy football where you make ‘picks’ on player performances or game outcomes. If you're a sports fan, you probably know the thrill of picking the right players for your fantasy team and gloating over your friends when that one underdog scores big. Could be a place where you draft your dream team, or maybe even make bets on games, like a fun twist on good ol’ fantasy sports. The “.app” part suggests it’s specifically made for mobile users—definitely tapping into the modern trend where most people want their entertainment in their pockets. So, this could also mean it’s sleek, user-friendly, and geared toward on-the-go experiences. Imagine chilling on your couch, phone in hand, casually making picks while you watch the game—you know that’s gotta be the vibe. I wouldn’t be surprised if it also has some community features. You know, like forums or chat options where players can brag about their picks and share advice with one another. Maybe there’s a leaderboard or some rewards system to keep that competitive spirit alive. There’s something about the camaraderie of sports that makes it even more fun, and if this app’s tapping into that, it could really get people engaged. On top of all that, they might be focusing on a really specific niche or sport. Perhaps it’s not just the big leagues like the NFL or NBA but could dig into some lesser-known sports that deserve a bit more spotlight. That could definitely attract a passionate crowd who’s looking to connect with like-minded fans. Overall, I imagine it's a place where sports enthusiasts can feel that rush of competition without the pressure of serious betting, just pure enjoyment and the thrill of making the right picks. Perfect for casual fans or even die-hards looking for a fun twist in the way they engage with their favorite games and players. So, yeah, it’s probably a fun little hub for people who like to play games centered around picking teams or players, enjoying a bit of friendly competition, all while hanging out on their phones. If that's the case, it could be a pretty sweet find for anyone looking to add some extra excitement to their sports-watching experience!",

It’s also a great marketing asset that allows you to connect with potential sponsors and donors as well as recruit new team members. But for your website to be effective and help you achieve those goals, there are a few features you must have on your sports website. Top 8 Features To Add To Your Sports Website In this post, we’ll share what features you should have on your sports website if you want it to help you make an impact and ensure your team’s success. 1. Player Galleries Or Lists Player galleries and lists make it easy for your visitors to immediately see who’s playing on your team. They can also click on individual team player names to access more detailed information about them. This typically includes a player’s bio, team name, the position they’re playing, their nationality, and more. Player galleries allow you to display photos of your players along with their name. They can click on the gallery to access the list of all players along with relevant information. A player list, on the other hand, gives an at-a-glance view of team statistics immediately. No matter which option you choose, your visitors will still be able to access individual player information. 2. Player Profiles Aside from player lists and galleries, you should also include individual player profiles. Be sure to include as much information about each player and not just the statistics. Add their bio, share their likes and dislikes, and more. You can also include a video interview with a player to make it more personable and interactive. 3. Next Event Countdown Adding a countdown timer to your next match is a good way to keep your fans updated and build hype long before the match takes place. You can easily add a countdown to your sidebar or even at the top of your website in the header area so it’s immediately visible. A plugin like SportsPress makes it easy to display a countdown anywhere on your site. You can select a specific match or let the widget display the next match automatically. On top of that, you can go beyond the basic countdown. You can include information about the venue and league so that all the important information is easily accessible. 4. League Tables Next up on our list of top features your sports website should have is the league table widget. By adding league tables, you can easily share how each team is doing in the league with all the relevant information readily available. If you’re managing multiple teams, you can choose exactly how many teams should display. You can also customize the league table when it comes to which statistics and the information it will show. 5. Event List Publishing information about each match is a great way to make it easy for your fans to get an overview of the match. However, the individual match display means they have to go browsing through the archives to find results from previous matches. In some cases, your website visitors might only want to see an overview of past matches and not go through the entire match recap one by one. Make it easy for them by displaying an event list on your homepage. You can choose between several different layouts which include a calendar, a list, and a block layout. You can also add a header scoreboard like those found on pro sports websites such as the NFL, NBA, and others. This will make it easy to see the latest scores and check out your match reports by clicking the recap and preview links. 6. Tournament Brackets Give your fans a real treat and display interactive tournament brackets on your website. This is the best way to keep them updated with how your team is progressing through a tournament. You can quickly set up your future tournament and schedule matches by adding dates, times, and the teams that are participating in the tournament. This feature will automatically create events for you and you can easily update the results after each match. SportsPress makes it easy to add tournament layouts that support single and double elimination with separate brackets for losers and winners. Another cool feature is that you can easily insert league tables before the tournament bracket to show how each team performed before the tournament. 7. Fixtures And Results No respectable sports team website would be complete without displaying fixtures and results. After all, your fans want to know how your team did and they are hungry for statistics that they can discuss at length with their friends. With this information, you can display the address of the venue and a map of its location so your fans can get directions and arrive there without any issues. You can also add a starting lineup and then update the information with a scoring timeline and match statistics after the match. 8. Social Media Profiles, Sharing, And Feeds Finally, be sure to add the links to your social media profiles to your website. This will make it easier for your website visitors to follow you on their preferred social media platform and stay up to date with your team’s news. Social sharing buttons will make it easy for your followers and fans to share your content which will drive more traffic to your website and put you in front of a new audience. You can take this a step further and incorporate your Twitter, Instagram or Facebook feed so they can see the type of content you’re sharing before they follow you. There are numerous WordPress plugins that make it easy to add these features to your website. From dedicated social media follow and share plugins like Social Media Follow Buttons Bar and Super Socializer plugin to simple social media feeds plugins like Custom Twitter Feeds and Social Slider Widget for Instagram, you can easily make your site more interactive. Final Thoughts The features on this list are the absolute must haves for your website. They will keep your visitors informed and provide them with an instant overview of important information about your team. Luckily SportsPress makes it easy to add them to your site so be sure to take advantage of all its features. Don’t forget to download our cheat sheet that lists out all of these features so you can keep it handy as you’re updating your site.

      "content": "Creating Unforgettable Sports Fan Moments: Trends For 2025 Creating Unforgettable Sports Fan Moments: Trends For 2025 Author Dropthought Published on: Tue Jan 07 2025 Categories Fan Experience In the constantly changing world of sports, one constant remains: fans are the lifeblood of the sports industry. As we look to 2025, creating unforgettable experiences for sports fans will become a top priority for teams, leagues, and event organizers. The year 2025 will bring a revolution in fan engagement, driven by cutting-edge technology, innovative strategies, and a deeper understanding of fan expectations. The modern fan will not only expect more than just a game but will demand an all-encompassing, immersive, and interactive experience that resonates both emotionally and intellectually. Here are the key trends shaping the future of fan engagement in 2025:- 1. Immersive technologies: Improving the game-day experience Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) will revolutionize the way fans interact with sports. In 2025, VR will allow fans to experience the game from a player’s perspective, while AR will improve in-stadium experiences with real-time stats and interactive features. Whether it’s watching a replay or overlaying player data during a game, these technologies will make fans feel closer to the action than ever before. 2. Hyper-personalization through data analytics Big data will continue to change fan engagement. By analyzing fan behavior, preferences, and purchasing patterns, companies will create tailored experiences. From personalized ticket offers to customized merchandise and content, the emphasis on tailoring to individual fans will ensure they feel valued and connected. For example, predictive analytics will notify fans about their favorite player’s milestone moments, creating opportunities for unique merchandise. 3. Sustainability in sports venues Environmental consciousness will become an important factor for fans. In 2025, sports venues will lead the way in sustainability by integrating green practices such as zero-waste initiatives, renewable energy, and eco-friendly merchandise. Fans will increasingly support teams that align with their values, making sustainability not just an ethical choice but a strategic one for organizations. 4. The rise of fan-generated content User-generated content (UGC) will thrive as fans become active participants in storytelling. In 2025, organizations will utilize UGC campaigns to create deeper connections, using tools like AI to spotlight fan contributions during games or on official channels. This two-way interaction will foster a sense of community and belonging. 5. Connected wearables for fan engagement In 2025, connected wearables will revolutionize how fans interact with sports events. Smart wristbands will provide personalized updates, vibrate during key moments of the game, and enable contactless payments at venues. These devices will also allow fans to participate in live polls, and real-time games synced with the action on the field. This innovative use of wearable technology will create a more dynamic and engaging fan experience. 6. Loyalty programs with real value In 2025, fans will expect rewards that resonate with their passions. Companies will offer exclusive experiences such as meet-and-greets, behind-the-scenes access, and limited-edition merchandise. Blockchain technology will provide transparency in these programs, enabling fans to easily give and receive rewards. 7. AI-driven fan engagement Artificial intelligence will be at the heart of fan engagement strategies. Chatbots will provide instant assistance with ticketing or event queries, while AI-powered platforms will offer real-time insights to improve the fan journey. Personalized push notifications, interactive polls, and AI-curated content will keep fans engaged before, during, and after the game. 8. Health and safety innovations In 2025, advanced technologies such as contactless entry, health monitoring wearables, and smart sanitation systems will ensure that fans can enjoy events with peace of mind. These measures will not only prioritize safety but also improve the overall experience by reducing entry queues and promoting comfort. 9. Improved accessibility and inclusivity Inclusivity will be a key focus for sports organizations. This includes captioning live broadcasts for hearing-impaired viewers and designing stadiums with improved accessibility features, ensuring that all fans feel welcome. In 2025, teams will utilize AI-powered translation tools to communicate with their global fan bases, breaking down language barriers and expanding their reach. 10. Globalization of fan communities Thanks to digital platforms, fan communities will be more connected than ever. In 2025, virtual viewers and online fan forums will bring together supporters from around the world. Companies can also host international events and tours to engage with their global fan base, fostering a sense of unity and shared passion. Conclusion As we move into 2025, the focus on creating unforgettable moments for sports fans will drive innovation and redefine engagement. By embracing technology, and prioritizing sustainability, sports organizations will build lasting connections with their fans. These trends will not only improve the game-day experience but also strengthen the emotional bond between fans and their favorite teams.

These complexes play host to many weekend tournaments throughout the year and provide recreational opportunities for weekly league play. The tremendous amount of activity has made them a popular social gathering spot as well. Athletes and spectators spend a lot of time at these sports complexes, especially during tournament weekends for youth sports, so they must be designed to accommodate the needs of everyone—athletes, families, spectators, umpires and officials, vendors and more. Sports complexes have become destination facilities, so they should encompass the competitive elements that enhance the athlete experience, while maintaining comfort and convenience for spectators. People love to gather with their friends and family—at sports complexes—to cheer on athletes, participate in sports and even enjoy a snack or two. Here are five things to help create a great sports complex experience. 1. The player experience: It goes without saying that competitors require great fields. The quality of the turf or dirt infield, the playability after a rain and practice areas are all key components of a great field. Other elements can elevate the playing experience such as replacing traditional chain-link backstops with masonry backstop walls and protective netting, masonry-enclosed dugouts with permanent bat racks and two-tiered seating, enhanced outfield fencing and upgraded scoreboards. These changes create a feeling of competing on a professional-level field. Warmup areas, away from spectators, are also important for players, who may be participating in multiple games throughout the day. Is there a place, such as a shaded pavilion with misters, to debrief following a game? Batting cages can boost the competitive atmosphere as well. Majestic Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas, contains top-notch features with new-and-improved red brick, steel trusses, plenty of nighttime lighting and many site furnishing details throughout this historic park. Finally, recent advances in LED stadium lighting allow the lights to be programmed to strobe or “dance” across the sky when a player belts a home run, for instance. Great lighting enhances the experience and improves player safety. 2. The mom factor: If mom is happy, everybody wins! A baseball, softball or soccer mom may spend most of her weekend at the area sports complex. While it’s important that her children who are competing are having a great experience playing on quality fields in a competitive environment, it’s equally important she is comfortable. Shaded bleacher areas with comfortable raised seating platforms make moms happy. Activities for brothers and sisters who aren’t competing, such as playgrounds, spray grounds and splash pads within clear eyesight of mom are important as well. Restrooms that are close and have plenty of stalls make moms want to return to your complex. Shaded areas and playgrounds provide much-need relief from the sun’s intense UV rays, helping relieve and prevent heat fatigue. 3. Friendly confines: No one wants to get to the sports complex and drive around aimlessly to find a place to park. Some are going to arrive in the morning, park and be on the grounds all day, so ample parking—conveniently located near the fields of play—is very important. Clear directional signage is equally important for out-of-town visitors. Lakewood Destination Park has a large splash pad perfect for children and families to cool off in the hot summer heat. And what do players, parents and friends do between games? Some sports complexes integrate spaces for water features, performance stages, walking paths or, yes, even zip lines. It’s important to program different activities that engage all levels of spectators and users. Don’t forget about food. More complexes are now creating food court areas, centrally located within the complex with parking for food trucks to provide lunch and dinner options for families who don’t want to leave. Sports complexes have traditionally been a sea of light poles, fences and concrete. Landscaping and masonry elements tend to soften the harshness of this environment, making the user experience a more park-like, comfortable experience. 4. Technology infusion: Connectivity is a big thing, even at a sports complex. Wi-Fi should be readily available, giving officials, players and parents the ability to access results of other games, schedules and even real-time statistics through a mobile app. Friends and family are also going to want to post photos of their loved ones. This historically-rich baseball park (Majestic Park) once served as the training grounds for the Boston Red Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Brooklyn Dodgers and St. Louis Browns. Statues and steel features incorporate this history nicely into an engaging overall theme. 5. Theming components: Finally, sports complex designs that are context-sensitive to the community or area they are located, or incorporate historical references from the area, make for a memorable experience. Theming elements bring a unique, thoughtful touch to the complex. As the competition between communities grows to bring tournaments to their complexes, paying attention to these five items will help your complex stand out and make visitors and athletes want to return again and again.

It's fundamentally changing fan engagement as fans want to connect with real people, not brands. The new fan engagement challenge for sports marketers is to turn their athletes, staff and superfans into influencers. Greenfly Share Article It’s hard not to notice that social media is influencing the sports industry profoundly — and its impact is only just the start. From the COVID-19 pandemic to a recovering world, more and more fans have been taking to platforms like Instagram and TikTok. There, they banter and discuss their favorite sports topics, especially when they can’t attend games or events in person. Others watch sports primarily — or even exclusively — on social media now. The impact of social media on fan engagement and the business of sports is advancing more rapidly than the adoption of TV broadcasts. It’s creating new business models that will make it harder for sports organizations to compete for fan attention. And the teams and leagues who can deliver more content through digital channels will be the new media rights winners. Fans of all ages now turn to social platforms for sports content, including: 51% of fans getting sports content on Facebook 46% on YouTube 31% on Instagram 25% on Twitter Every day, a sport-related topic is trending on social media platforms like Twitter. Additionally, some of the most followed accounts on social media are sports-related: Real Madrid has 134 million followers on Instagram. The NBA has 88 million followers. Cristiano Ronaldo, the most followed person, has 580 million followers. The takeaway for leagues and teams? Social media has simply taken over as the preferred method for fans to follow sports. It’s time for sports marketers all sports leagues, teams, national associations and competitions that aren’t yet taking advantage of the rapid rise of new social networking to get on board. Let’s explore a few different trends we’re seeing for social media in sports, highlighting a few ways this two-way communication has influenced sports marketers around the world already. How Social Media Is Changing Sports Media, in general, has been transforming the dynamics of many industries for decades. And the sports industry is no exception – first live broadcast TV, then cable, then OTT subscription, and now social media. The rise of social has been especially rapid over the years of Covid isolation. At its core, it’s easy to understand. Broadcast TV is a one-way push of information. Social media is a two-way conversation that enables sports fans to engage, react and feel more connected to the teams and athletes they love. Consider sports fans’ current social media use patterns: 41% of global sports fans stream live sports through digital platforms. 32% of sports fans — and more specifically, 43% of Gen Z fans — use social media platforms while watching live sports. These statistics and more like these prove one thing: the effect of social media on sports and fans is massive — and accelerating every day. Increasingly, social media is becoming deeply woven into today’s sports culture. With more people spending more time online, fans take to social media to engage in sports-related topics and content. Also, organizations are building creative ways to promote their sports teams and encourage sports conversation. From live-filming games to sharing memes and trash-talking, people no longer just watch sports. They actively engage with them. A few key social media effects on sports include: 1. Sports Marketing The new generation of sports marketers know that the combination of sports and social media are the key to providing an ‘always on’ experience for fans. Social media has simplified sports marketing. Many sports marketers leverage social channels to promote sports-related events and activities. And many organizations are getting fans involved in creating original user-generated content (UGC) to build deeper connections. See a few sports marketing examples to understand better how social media can help organizations and brands alike. 2. The Source of Truth, Stats and Information Social media accounts for athletes and sports organizations have become essential destinations for fans. This is especially true for younger fans just forming their lifelong alliances and loyalties. 58% of 16- to 24-year-olds and 49% of 25- to 34-year-olds report following athletes on social media; 43% in each age group follow leagues on social. Also, almost every sports team has multiple social channels on which they share relevant news with fans. That’s a smart move because fans are now using social for sports news and updates more than ever. Nielsen reports that between April 2020 and August 2021, global usage of TikTok for sports news and content grew 30%; the same use case for Twitch grew 21%. Social media has made it easy to share sports news and content as a medium for two-way conversations that reduce marketing costs for organizations. And for sports fans, social media is a means to stay updated with sports content, follow their favorite athletes or teams, and interact with other sports audiences. Overall, sports are increasing in popularity. One of the reasons is the rise of social media, the growing importance of short-form content, and the need for sports teams and leagues to start gathering and sharing all-access content. 3. Sports Leagues’ Global Reach Social media enables sports leagues to have direct and real-time access to fans worldwide. This connection allows international fans to connect with their favorite teams no matter where they live. And teams reap the benefits of accessing a larger fan base. For example, while Americans love basketball, the NBA actually has more fans in the U.K., Germany, and China than in the U.S.! 4. Live Streaming TV was the only way to broadcast live sports or events visually for many decades. Now, sports organizations and media outlets can leverage social media on mobile screens to share live events and real-time games with audiences. According to a 2020 study, 39% of American adults watch sports via online live streams. Consumers ages 18-24 are over 2x more likely to live-stream sports than fans ages 55+. Sports fans now watch (and often prefer to watch) their favorite team playing right from their mobile devices. 5. Social Media’s Increased Revenue Opportunities Broadcasters are realizing the benefits of providing updates and streaming content that viewers want to see on social. They’re using digital media from their league partners to attract and retain audiences. As a result, digital media rights are becoming critical components to broadcast rights deals, generating more revenue for leagues everywhere. This same digital media and social media buzz around players and teams can boost ticket sales and merch sales. This happens through increased engagement, especially when sponsorship comes into play. How Social Media Impacts Sports Organizations Another notable effect of social media is the avenue for sports organizations to share information with fans directly and make them feel a part of the league experience. Especially casual fans – those fans that don’t tune into many broadcasts, and might not follow teams or players. Most people’s time spent online involves scrolling to find something that interests them, and social media is a great way to remind them about the sport, the team, or the league. Being active on social media is a great way for sports organizations to build relationships with the public. Many sports teams have social media accounts to promote events or activities and engage people with sports content. These organizations use social media platforms to announce upcoming games, share lineups for a new game, or even highlight a player’s performance. Social media also helps people stay connected with their favorite sports teams and athletes. For example, during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, many competitions were suspended. But social media allowed organizations to create fresh content, keep fans updated about their favorite players and coaches, and engage their audiences. For instance, during the NBA’s stoppage, they released photo and video content celebrating memorable moments from player and team histories. This powerful fan engagement content reached 1.6 billion followers! Short-form digital media like this is incredibly powerful. In addition to being a news medium, social media helps organizations boost fan engagement and partner revenue opportunities. This happens through targeted social media sports marketing campaigns using digital content. And using software like Greenfly’s digital media distribution platform, sports teams like Paris Saint-Germain have grown their audiences massively through athlete advocacy on social media. Social Media Helps Sports Organizations Engage Fans Keep fans updated on team news like new signings, contracts, announcements and events Foster fan engagement with original content from leagues, teams, coaches, and players Promote events or teams Create and share live sports content like live video, real-time games, play-by-play updates, goal announcements, etc. Gather feedback from fans through tools like Twitter and Instagram polls and authentic UGC from them, too Build new revenue from partners and fans through the digital media captured every day How Social Media Impacts Revenue At the moment, TV broadcast revenue, sponsorships and ticket sales make up most of any team or league revenue. Social media provides a new opportunity to expand and grow revenue from those same channels. It also opens up new opportunities. Sports properties can leverage their digital media feeds — short-form images and photos created for social media — and turn that inventory into an asset. For sponsors, fans, and alumni associations, that content is valuable in so many ways. There’s so much to explore here that we wrote a whole playbook on the topic: Boost Revenue From Social Media Here’s our free 3-step plan and insights for activating players as social marketers — with the digital media you capture every day. Get the Playbook How Social Media Impacts Athletes Getting your favorite athlete’s attention was almost impossible just a decade or two ago. Social media has almost single-handedly bridged the gap between sports fans and athletes. Many professional athletes have personal social media accounts where they engage fans, promote sponsors, and share their events and lives. Aside from engaging fans, social media plays a massive role in exposing the human side of athletes. Many athletes share personal social media content like behind-the-scenes or day-to-day activities. For athletes who are often considered heroic in their performance, social media humanizes them — making them more relatable. Sharing their stories also helps athletes build their personal brands. This capability strengthens their opportunities and increases their value for endorsement deals and other career gains. Another benefit for athletes: Social media makes it easy to stand for a cause and amplify social issues. For example, Jah’kiyla Atwaters started a social media campaign to raise donations for children who couldn’t afford the costs of participating in sports. With the right social media strategy, athletes can: Enhance their public image Build a community of loyal audiences and Position themselves for future opportunities and earnings.

It's fundamentally changing fan engagement as fans want to connect with real people, not brands. The new fan engagement challenge for sports marketers is to turn their athletes, staff and superfans into influencers. Greenfly Share Article It’s hard not to notice that social media is influencing the sports industry profoundly — and its impact is only just the start. From the COVID-19 pandemic to a recovering world, more and more fans have been taking to platforms like Instagram and TikTok. There, they banter and discuss their favorite sports topics, especially when they can’t attend games or events in person. Others watch sports primarily — or even exclusively — on social media now. The impact of social media on fan engagement and the business of sports is advancing more rapidly than the adoption of TV broadcasts. It’s creating new business models that will make it harder for sports organizations to compete for fan attention. And the teams and leagues who can deliver more content through digital channels will be the new media rights winners. Fans of all ages now turn to social platforms for sports content, including: 51% of fans getting sports content on Facebook 46% on YouTube 31% on Instagram 25% on Twitter Every day, a sport-related topic is trending on social media platforms like Twitter. Additionally, some of the most followed accounts on social media are sports-related: Real Madrid has 134 million followers on Instagram. The NBA has 88 million followers. Cristiano Ronaldo, the most followed person, has 580 million followers. The takeaway for leagues and teams? Social media has simply taken over as the preferred method for fans to follow sports. It’s time for sports marketers all sports leagues, teams, national associations and competitions that aren’t yet taking advantage of the rapid rise of new social networking to get on board. Let’s explore a few different trends we’re seeing for social media in sports, highlighting a few ways this two-way communication has influenced sports marketers around the world already. How Social Media Is Changing Sports Media, in general, has been transforming the dynamics of many industries for decades. And the sports industry is no exception – first live broadcast TV, then cable, then OTT subscription, and now social media. The rise of social has been especially rapid over the years of Covid isolation. At its core, it’s easy to understand. Broadcast TV is a one-way push of information. Social media is a two-way conversation that enables sports fans to engage, react and feel more connected to the teams and athletes they love. Consider sports fans’ current social media use patterns: 41% of global sports fans stream live sports through digital platforms. 32% of sports fans — and more specifically, 43% of Gen Z fans — use social media platforms while watching live sports. These statistics and more like these prove one thing: the effect of social media on sports and fans is massive — and accelerating every day. Increasingly, social media is becoming deeply woven into today’s sports culture. With more people spending more time online, fans take to social media to engage in sports-related topics and content. Also, organizations are building creative ways to promote their sports teams and encourage sports conversation. From live-filming games to sharing memes and trash-talking, people no longer just watch sports. They actively engage with them. A few key social media effects on sports include: 1. Sports Marketing The new generation of sports marketers know that the combination of sports and social media are the key to providing an ‘always on’ experience for fans. Social media has simplified sports marketing. Many sports marketers leverage social channels to promote sports-related events and activities. And many organizations are getting fans involved in creating original user-generated content (UGC) to build deeper connections. See a few sports marketing examples to understand better how social media can help organizations and brands alike. 2. The Source of Truth, Stats and Information Social media accounts for athletes and sports organizations have become essential destinations for fans. This is especially true for younger fans just forming their lifelong alliances and loyalties. 58% of 16- to 24-year-olds and 49% of 25- to 34-year-olds report following athletes on social media; 43% in each age group follow leagues on social. Also, almost every sports team has multiple social channels on which they share relevant news with fans. That’s a smart move because fans are now using social for sports news and updates more than ever. Nielsen reports that between April 2020 and August 2021, global usage of TikTok for sports news and content grew 30%; the same use case for Twitch grew 21%. Social media has made it easy to share sports news and content as a medium for two-way conversations that reduce marketing costs for organizations. And for sports fans, social media is a means to stay updated with sports content, follow their favorite athletes or teams, and interact with other sports audiences. Overall, sports are increasing in popularity. One of the reasons is the rise of social media, the growing importance of short-form content, and the need for sports teams and leagues to start gathering and sharing all-access content. 3. Sports Leagues’ Global Reach Social media enables sports leagues to have direct and real-time access to fans worldwide. This connection allows international fans to connect with their favorite teams no matter where they live. And teams reap the benefits of accessing a larger fan base. For example, while Americans love basketball, the NBA actually has more fans in the U.K., Germany, and China than in the U.S.! 4. Live Streaming TV was the only way to broadcast live sports or events visually for many decades. Now, sports organizations and media outlets can leverage social media on mobile screens to share live events and real-time games with audiences. According to a 2020 study, 39% of American adults watch sports via online live streams. Consumers ages 18-24 are over 2x more likely to live-stream sports than fans ages 55+. Sports fans now watch (and often prefer to watch) their favorite team playing right from their mobile devices. 5. Social Media’s Increased Revenue Opportunities Broadcasters are realizing the benefits of providing updates and streaming content that viewers want to see on social. They’re using digital media from their league partners to attract and retain audiences. As a result, digital media rights are becoming critical components to broadcast rights deals, generating more revenue for leagues everywhere. This same digital media and social media buzz around players and teams can boost ticket sales and merch sales. This happens through increased engagement, especially when sponsorship comes into play. How Social Media Impacts Sports Organizations Another notable effect of social media is the avenue for sports organizations to share information with fans directly and make them feel a part of the league experience. Especially casual fans – those fans that don’t tune into many broadcasts, and might not follow teams or players. Most people’s time spent online involves scrolling to find something that interests them, and social media is a great way to remind them about the sport, the team, or the league. Being active on social media is a great way for sports organizations to build relationships with the public. Many sports teams have social media accounts to promote events or activities and engage people with sports content. These organizations use social media platforms to announce upcoming games, share lineups for a new game, or even highlight a player’s performance. Social media also helps people stay connected with their favorite sports teams and athletes. For example, during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, many competitions were suspended. But social media allowed organizations to create fresh content, keep fans updated about their favorite players and coaches, and engage their audiences. For instance, during the NBA’s stoppage, they released photo and video content celebrating memorable moments from player and team histories. This powerful fan engagement content reached 1.6 billion followers! Short-form digital media like this is incredibly powerful. In addition to being a news medium, social media helps organizations boost fan engagement and partner revenue opportunities. This happens through targeted social media sports marketing campaigns using digital content. And using software like Greenfly’s digital media distribution platform, sports teams like Paris Saint-Germain have grown their audiences massively through athlete advocacy on social media. Social Media Helps Sports Organizations Engage Fans Keep fans updated on team news like new signings, contracts, announcements and events Foster fan engagement with original content from leagues, teams, coaches, and players Promote events or teams Create and share live sports content like live video, real-time games, play-by-play updates, goal announcements, etc. Gather feedback from fans through tools like Twitter and Instagram polls and authentic UGC from them, too Build new revenue from partners and fans through the digital media captured every day How Social Media Impacts Revenue At the moment, TV broadcast revenue, sponsorships and ticket sales make up most of any team or league revenue. Social media provides a new opportunity to expand and grow revenue from those same channels. It also opens up new opportunities. Sports properties can leverage their digital media feeds — short-form images and photos created for social media — and turn that inventory into an asset. For sponsors, fans, and alumni associations, that content is valuable in so many ways. There’s so much to explore here that we wrote a whole playbook on the topic: Boost Revenue From Social Media Here’s our free 3-step plan and insights for activating players as social marketers — with the digital media you capture every day. Get the Playbook How Social Media Impacts Athletes Getting your favorite athlete’s attention was almost impossible just a decade or two ago. Social media has almost single-handedly bridged the gap between sports fans and athletes. Many professional athletes have personal social media accounts where they engage fans, promote sponsors, and share their events and lives. Aside from engaging fans, social media plays a massive role in exposing the human side of athletes. Many athletes share personal social media content like behind-the-scenes or day-to-day activities. For athletes who are often considered heroic in their performance, social media humanizes them — making them more relatable. Sharing their stories also helps athletes build their personal brands. This capability strengthens their opportunities and increases their value for endorsement deals and other career gains. Another benefit for athletes: Social media makes it easy to stand for a cause and amplify social issues. For example, Jah’kiyla Atwaters started a social media campaign to raise donations for children who couldn’t afford the costs of participating in sports. With the right social media strategy, athletes can: Enhance their public image Build a community of loyal audiences and Position themselves for future opportunities and earnings.

Updated January 29, 2025 Written by Sofija Vidjikant Content Writer Written by Meghan Neville Content Marketing Coordinator Thought Leadership 8 minutes Fan engagement in sports and entertainment is rapidly evolving, driven by AI, gamification, streaming, and personalized digital experiences. At Softjourn, with our extensive experience in software development and consulting for the event ticketing industry, we are always exploring new ways to enhance fan engagement. From building interactive ticketing solutions to integrating cutting-edge technology, we understand that the key to success in sports, entertainment, and beyond lies in creating unforgettable fan experiences. This article explores key trends shaping the industry, from AI-powered content recommendations and real-time updates to blockchain-based ticketing and immersive technologies like AR/VR. Discover how teams, leagues, and event organizers can leverage these innovations to deepen fan connections, boost revenue, and stay ahead in an increasingly digital landscape. Innovations in Fan Engagement The world of fan engagement is continuously evolving, driven by emerging technologies. A major trend shaping the industry is the rise of gamification and experiential marketing, which transforms passive fans into active participants. Integrating game mechanics into the ticketing experience enhances engagement, turning each interaction into an opportunity for deeper fan connection. For example, loyalty programs that reward fans with points, badges, or exclusive perks create a sense of achievement and encourage repeat participation. Meanwhile, augmented reality (AR) experiences—such as event sneak peeks, interactive venue tours, and AR-powered scavenger hunts—are redefining pre-event excitement and engagement. Another key innovation is data-driven cross-selling. By leveraging deep customer insights and fan behavior data, ticketing platforms can now offer highly relevant add-ons, exclusive merchandise, and VIP upgrades, increasing both revenue and customer satisfaction. Personalized experiences, such as commemorative souvenir or digital tickets, provide a tangible connection to the event, making the experience more memorable while opening up new monetization opportunities. Enhancing Customer Experience Through Technology Leading industry events, like INTIX, emphasize the importance of enhancing the customer experience through technology. A mobile-first strategy and a connected tech stack are crucial for a seamless customer journey from discovery to post-event engagement. A global report by Nielsen found that sports fans are becoming more fragmented across streaming, app, and gaming platforms, underlining the need for sports properties to continue broad technology development and data analysis to stay on top of changing fan behaviors and capitalize on the interest of younger groups. This approach includes providing free WiFi at venues, supporting mobile payments, and offering digital rewards. Additionally, looking beyond the ticketing industry for innovation—such as adopting practices from fintech—can introduce new technologies to improve engagement, pricing, and security. What is Fan Engagement? The concept of fan engagement is related to how performers, sports teams, Esports players, and more connect with their fan base. When a franchise is interested in building its following, its online communication can play a vital role in gathering fans, enhancing their engagement, and monetizing their interactions. Some experts find that fan engagement in sports and other types of entertainment is about the emotional connection that is created between the team or performer and the fans. If fans stopped showing support by no longer attending events and games, buying merchandise, and sharing event-related information on social media, many sports teams and entertainers would fail to succeed. Participation in events is no longer limited to physical presence at a concert, sporting event, or conference. With the rise of interactive digital experiences, streaming platforms, and mobile engagement tools, fans can now connect with events in more ways than ever before. The more a team or artist is part of a fan’s everyday life, the more value they will place on the entertainer’s brand, increasing fan satisfaction, brand popularity, and overall earnings. Advancements in second-screen experiences, AI-driven personalization, and immersive technologies like AR/VR are transforming how fans engage—whether they’re attending in person or following remotely. This shift opens up new opportunities for event organizers to foster year-round engagement, enhance accessibility, and create dynamic experiences that keep fans connected beyond the event itself. Read more: How AI is Transforming the Ticketing Industry The Four Quadrants of Fan Engagement One of the hardest things when it comes to fans' engagement is to strike the right chord with fans. Too much engagement can be annoying while too little can make fans forget about events. That’s why sports marketers and consultants, Fowler and Wilson, created a matrix that explains how to manage both on and off-site fan engagement needs. Why Fan Engagement Matters Raising awareness is the first step toward establishing a solid fan base. Behind-the-screen videos, interviews, and competitions on social media are activities that encourage fan engagement during a show, and patron continuity in the long run. A strong emotional connection between a sports player, artist, or team and their fans leads to increased brand loyalty and a positive perception of the brand. A Deloitte survey of more than 15,000 respondents found that the most engaged fans are six times more likely than casual fans to spend more on their teams. For example, excluding tickets, season ticket holders spend five times more than non-season ticket holders. Fan Engagement in Sports The connection between entertainers and their fans is growing stronger in the digital era. With the sports industry expected to grow by 7.3% over the next 3-5 years, investing in innovative fan engagement strategies is more crucial than ever. Teams and organizations that prioritize personalized and interactive experiences will be well-positioned to capture this expanding market. In particular, sports fans' eagerness for content skyrocketed in the past few years and more than half of them say they enjoy being engaged all year round. Sports teams have discovered that apps are the perfect way to increase fan engagement. As the line between the fans and teams continues to blur, the need for an interactive experience that keeps fans connected and engaged is paramount. These apps provide just that, creating an enjoyable platform for passionate fans to engage with their favorite teams on a deeper level. Some popular fan engagement apps in sports include ScoreStream, Sports Pledge, FanAI, and Wooter. ScoreStream allows teams to post-game information and updates in real time, while Sports Pledge rewards loyal fans with exclusive products, experiences, and access. FanAI helps teams and brands understand what drives their fans’ engagement by providing in-depth insights into their demographics and behaviors. Most of these apps include features such as digital wallets, navigation to parking spaces, in-venue navigation, parking booking, and a range of exclusive rewards and discounts. Fan engagement activities are not only reserved for game days. Many fans use their mobile devices to follow an event because they are interested in interacting with other fans, watching replays, and checking stats. When watching a game on TV, a large number of fans reach for an additional device. According to the Sports Business Institute, 87% of sports fans are second screening while watching a live sports broadcast, while some are even triple screening or multiple screening. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the majority of sports fans on their phones engage in social media or message their friends, potentially to share their excitement about the game with friends or other fans and see their reactions. Esports, it's no different. The Esports audience has grown impressively from approximately 435 million in 2020 to over 600 million in 2024, and it's projected to surpass 896 million users by 2029, highlighting the sustained expansion and rising popularity of Esports worldwide. Additionally, the revenue in the Esports market worldwide is projected to reach US $4.8bn in 2025, with a projected market volume of US $5.9bn by 2029. Twitch is one example of how an online platform can be transformed into a community-building interactive powerhouse. In 2017 there were 750,000 eSport viewers on Twitch, and in 2024 reached nearly 6 million. Twitch upholds its standing as one of the most-visited websites in the US through user engagement features, like live broadcasting, chat boxes, and interactive content. What Sports Fan Engagement Features Should be Prioritized? Sports fan engagement ideas can include various activities and initiatives to increase fan interaction and loyalty. For example, teams can host fan appreciation days, offer exclusive discounts and merchandise, or create fan clubs and reward programs. Additionally, they can host watch parties, organize meet-and-greets with players and coaches, or host game-day events such as tailgates and barbecues. Social media can also be used to engage with fans by responding to comments, hosting Q&A sessions, or creating content that fans can share. Finally, teams can host contests and giveaways or create exclusive content such as behind-the-scenes videos, interviews with players and coaches, or podcasts. While there are many interesting and innovative ideas and features for sports fan engagement apps, the most common ones are: Team news and updates Results overview Fixtures Statistics Game analysis Replays Highlights Radio coverage Interactive social media feeds Exclusive content like interviews, podcasts and videos Others like Fantasy Leagues and VR may be rising in trendiness, but are not necessarily the first tools to prioritize when initially building an app. Strategizing Fan Engagement in Sports Engagement never stops. Even when fans are not in the stadium or when players are giving online interviews, fan engagement platforms are there to keep fans interested. The industry is shifting toward more innovative business models to attract investment, with 83% of executives believing that new commercial models will be required to sustain and grow sports engagement. These changes emphasize the need for flexible, technology-driven approaches that offer unique and monetizable experiences. Below, we've shared ways to boost sports engagement year-round: Understand fans’ needs. Designing an effective sports fan engagement strategy requires that you understand your fans' demographic, interests, and how they want to interact with each other. For example, when it comes to sports, sharing results and giving more data and statistics allow fans to gain different perspectives on the game they’re following. Personalized messaging. Programs and features designed to communicate with everyone often speak to no one. When fans don’t feel included in the conversation, they may not stay interested, or even find a different, more engaging platform. To send personalized and captivating messaging to fans, you must first understand their preferences and appeal to their style of communication. Support loyalty. Rewarding loyal fans is one of the best ways to show how much you appreciate their commitment to your franchise. Special offers and access to additional services can help create organic content for later use in promotional materials. Most successful stars in sports and entertainment create and maintain a culture that fans can quickly adopt as their own. Holistic approach. Thorough consideration and planning in advance are necessary for fan engagement platforms to have better results in the long run. After every concert or sports game, make sure to let fans know what to expect next, and guide them towards the next big event. Push notifications directly link fans, ensuring that everyone stays connected. Building Communities with a Live Chat and Fantasy Leagues Communities built around celebrities, musicians, and sports players or teams are created through additional engagement. Social features, like a chat box, help fans feel more connected and keep them coming back for more related content, such as player updates and leaderboards in the case of sports. Inside a live sports streaming app, fans can have a variety of information available so they are always able to tune in to what is happening. Fantasy sports apps are another way to build community engagement for sports and entertainment. Fantasy teams compete in virtual championships and leagues based on the statistical performance of those players in actual games. Fantasy sports range from Fantasy Football drafts to ESPN Fantasy Sports. Next-Generation Streaming Services Participation in events can be seen in a variety of interactive forms. Prior to the pandemic, participation was usually bound to physical presence at a concert, sporting event, or conference. Today, fans can participate in many different, yet still meaningful ways. Streaming content allows audiences to attend and participate in virtually any event remotely, while also having the ability to share their opinions and other relevant information. Audience members feel like they are contributing in a meaningful way by sharing and commenting on the content. The shift toward digital sports consumption is evident, with younger audiences leading the transition. Fans aged 18-29 are more likely to watch sporting events via mobile devices and subscription streaming services, while those 45+ remain more loyal to traditional linear broadcasting (IBM). This generational divide highlights the importance of multi-platform accessibility in fan engagement strategies. Sports fans are increasingly using multiple devices to follow live events, with younger audiences leading this shift. 10% of fans aged 18-29 use three or more devices while watching sports, compared to only 2% of fans 55+. Additionally, while TV remains the most common method for viewing sports, 56% of fans turn to social media for additional content, with highlight videos (64%) and post-match recaps (48%) being the most consumed formats. These trends underscore the need for multi-platform content distribution and second-screen experiences to maintain fan engagement. In Japan, Yamaha developed an app, ‘Remote Cheerer’, that allows fans to cheer for their teams and create a full-stadium atmosphere while watching from the safety of their home. The app enables fans to cheer, chant, clap, and boo from their phones and broadcasts the sounds to stadiums in real-time. Fans are engaged in the streaming content, plus they create an exciting atmosphere for teams playing in nearly-empty stadiums. Push Notifications Quick updates allow fans to know the latest score, see exclusive content, or get breaking news. Such prompts drive traffic and revenue by reminding users your platform exists and is filled with useful and interesting information about events, performers, and teams they care about. They also improve the live stream watching experience by making it more immersive. With various topics, fans can be notified and engaged before, during, and after the event, so they don’t miss funny and exciting moments. Gamified Event Participation Many consider gamification to be a silver bullet that solves problems with brand loyalty. When game mechanics are carefully planned and added to a fan engagement app, users often gain a real sense of satisfaction. Streaming platforms still haven't adopted gaming concepts, but interest is on the rise. Nickelodeon and the NFL are using gamified participation, which encourages live interactions that work similarly to a game; users can earn badges and collect valuable game points. Virtual and Augmented Reality Virtual reality technology is still in its infancy, but sports and other fan engagement apps are beginning to embrace VR and AR, for gamification, mapping tools, marketing, and improved fan experience.. MLB at Bat, NBA AR, and Vikings AR are just a few examples of popular apps that utilize VR and AR to foster fan engagement. Virtual and augmented reality apps have the potential to allow fans to attend games from their own couch, enhance sporting experiences with special effects, enjoy pregame and half-time entertainment, and even analyze player stats with in-app trackers and computer vision. Enhanced sporting experiences may incentivize fans to virtually attend games which could allow for new types of monetization, such as in-app purchases, sponsorships, and advertisements. Advanced Analytics AI and data analytics are becoming game-changers in fan engagement, with 63% of respondents identifying data analytics as having the most positive impact on sports, while 50% believe AI will play a crucial role. Fans also expect AI to enhance their experience through real-time updates (34%) and personalized content (29%) (IBM). These trends highlight the growing importance of AI-driven insights for both engagement and monetization strategies. Turning your sports fan engagement app into a revenue stream becomes possible when you understand your fans and can offer services they’re interested in using. Predictive analytics are also helpful in understanding what drives the most traffic, what sponsors ROI statistics, and other valuable data. For example, if you know your fans react well to exclusive discounts and coupons, you can create new revenue-driving opportunities with interactive shoppable features in live streams. We recommend using post-event surveys strategically to gather data and feedback from fans to improve your events and fan engagement strategy. Blockchain in Ticketing Blockchain-based ticketing is gaining traction as a secure way to combat fraud, enhance ticket authenticity, and offer fans verifiable digital collectibles. While the early NFT craze has subsided, blockchain-powered ticketing solutions—such as Coachella’s lifetime pass experiment and tamper-proof digital event tickets—continue to evolve, providing new engagement and security opportunities for event organizers. Year-Round Engagement and Personalization Year-round engagement and personalization stand at the forefront of creating lasting relationships with ticket buyers. Over 60% of fans say that a great year-round experience would make them more likely to be more engaged with their team in future seasons, with 55% more likely to purchase a ticket at some point in the future. Maintaining communication with customers throughout the year fosters a sense of loyalty and anticipation for upcoming events. Fan engagement in sports cannot be neglected if you want to be a top industry player. Personalization, fueled by strategic data use, ensures that every interaction feels bespoke and valuable. Crafting experiences that resonate on social media or \"Instagrammable Moments\" can leverage digital word-of-mouth, attracting a broader audience. This Year's Top Ticketing Trends get in touch Catering to Millennials and Gen Z Attracting and retaining younger audiences, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, requires a nuanced approach that goes beyond traditional engagement strategies. We recommend creating shareable, memorable experiences and leveraging digital channels for communication.

These strategies, focused on digital fan engagement and community building, are essential for cultivating loyalty among younger fans.

Updated January 29, 2025 Written by Sofija Vidjikant Content Writer Written by Meghan Neville Content Marketing Coordinator Thought Leadership 8 minutes Fan engagement in sports and entertainment is rapidly evolving, driven by AI, gamification, streaming, and personalized digital experiences. At Softjourn, with our extensive experience in software development and consulting for the event ticketing industry, we are always exploring new ways to enhance fan engagement. From building interactive ticketing solutions to integrating cutting-edge technology, we understand that the key to success in sports, entertainment, and beyond lies in creating unforgettable fan experiences. This article explores key trends shaping the industry, from AI-powered content recommendations and real-time updates to blockchain-based ticketing and immersive technologies like AR/VR. Discover how teams, leagues, and event organizers can leverage these innovations to deepen fan connections, boost revenue, and stay ahead in an increasingly digital landscape. Innovations in Fan Engagement The world of fan engagement is continuously evolving, driven by emerging technologies. A major trend shaping the industry is the rise of gamification and experiential marketing, which transforms passive fans into active participants. Integrating game mechanics into the ticketing experience enhances engagement, turning each interaction into an opportunity for deeper fan connection. For example, loyalty programs that reward fans with points, badges, or exclusive perks create a sense of achievement and encourage repeat participation. Meanwhile, augmented reality (AR) experiences—such as event sneak peeks, interactive venue tours, and AR-powered scavenger hunts—are redefining pre-event excitement and engagement. Another key innovation is data-driven cross-selling. By leveraging deep customer insights and fan behavior data, ticketing platforms can now offer highly relevant add-ons, exclusive merchandise, and VIP upgrades, increasing both revenue and customer satisfaction. Personalized experiences, such as commemorative souvenir or digital tickets, provide a tangible connection to the event, making the experience more memorable while opening up new monetization opportunities. Enhancing Customer Experience Through Technology Leading industry events, like INTIX, emphasize the importance of enhancing the customer experience through technology. A mobile-first strategy and a connected tech stack are crucial for a seamless customer journey from discovery to post-event engagement. A global report by Nielsen found that sports fans are becoming more fragmented across streaming, app, and gaming platforms, underlining the need for sports properties to continue broad technology development and data analysis to stay on top of changing fan behaviors and capitalize on the interest of younger groups. This approach includes providing free WiFi at venues, supporting mobile payments, and offering digital rewards. Additionally, looking beyond the ticketing industry for innovation—such as adopting practices from fintech—can introduce new technologies to improve engagement, pricing, and security. What is Fan Engagement? The concept of fan engagement is related to how performers, sports teams, Esports players, and more connect with their fan base. When a franchise is interested in building its following, its online communication can play a vital role in gathering fans, enhancing their engagement, and monetizing their interactions. Some experts find that fan engagement in sports and other types of entertainment is about the emotional connection that is created between the team or performer and the fans. If fans stopped showing support by no longer attending events and games, buying merchandise, and sharing event-related information on social media, many sports teams and entertainers would fail to succeed. Participation in events is no longer limited to physical presence at a concert, sporting event, or conference. With the rise of interactive digital experiences, streaming platforms, and mobile engagement tools, fans can now connect with events in more ways than ever before. The more a team or artist is part of a fan’s everyday life, the more value they will place on the entertainer’s brand, increasing fan satisfaction, brand popularity, and overall earnings. Advancements in second-screen experiences, AI-driven personalization, and immersive technologies like AR/VR are transforming how fans engage—whether they’re attending in person or following remotely. This shift opens up new opportunities for event organizers to foster year-round engagement, enhance accessibility, and create dynamic experiences that keep fans connected beyond the event itself. Read more: How AI is Transforming the Ticketing Industry The Four Quadrants of Fan Engagement One of the hardest things when it comes to fans' engagement is to strike the right chord with fans. Too much engagement can be annoying while too little can make fans forget about events. That’s why sports marketers and consultants, Fowler and Wilson, created a matrix that explains how to manage both on and off-site fan engagement needs. Why Fan Engagement Matters Raising awareness is the first step toward establishing a solid fan base. Behind-the-screen videos, interviews, and competitions on social media are activities that encourage fan engagement during a show, and patron continuity in the long run. A strong emotional connection between a sports player, artist, or team and their fans leads to increased brand loyalty and a positive perception of the brand. A Deloitte survey of more than 15,000 respondents found that the most engaged fans are six times more likely than casual fans to spend more on their teams. For example, excluding tickets, season ticket holders spend five times more than non-season ticket holders. Fan Engagement in Sports The connection between entertainers and their fans is growing stronger in the digital era. With the sports industry expected to grow by 7.3% over the next 3-5 years, investing in innovative fan engagement strategies is more crucial than ever. Teams and organizations that prioritize personalized and interactive experiences will be well-positioned to capture this expanding market. In particular, sports fans' eagerness for content skyrocketed in the past few years and more than half of them say they enjoy being engaged all year round. Sports teams have discovered that apps are the perfect way to increase fan engagement. As the line between the fans and teams continues to blur, the need for an interactive experience that keeps fans connected and engaged is paramount. These apps provide just that, creating an enjoyable platform for passionate fans to engage with their favorite teams on a deeper level. Some popular fan engagement apps in sports include ScoreStream, Sports Pledge, FanAI, and Wooter. ScoreStream allows teams to post-game information and updates in real time, while Sports Pledge rewards loyal fans with exclusive products, experiences, and access. FanAI helps teams and brands understand what drives their fans’ engagement by providing in-depth insights into their demographics and behaviors. Most of these apps include features such as digital wallets, navigation to parking spaces, in-venue navigation, parking booking, and a range of exclusive rewards and discounts. Fan engagement activities are not only reserved for game days. Many fans use their mobile devices to follow an event because they are interested in interacting with other fans, watching replays, and checking stats. When watching a game on TV, a large number of fans reach for an additional device. According to the Sports Business Institute, 87% of sports fans are second screening while watching a live sports broadcast, while some are even triple screening or multiple screening. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the majority of sports fans on their phones engage in social media or message their friends, potentially to share their excitement about the game with friends or other fans and see their reactions. Esports, it's no different. The Esports audience has grown impressively from approximately 435 million in 2020 to over 600 million in 2024, and it's projected to surpass 896 million users by 2029, highlighting the sustained expansion and rising popularity of Esports worldwide. Additionally, the revenue in the Esports market worldwide is projected to reach US $4.8bn in 2025, with a projected market volume of US $5.9bn by 2029. Twitch is one example of how an online platform can be transformed into a community-building interactive powerhouse. In 2017 there were 750,000 eSport viewers on Twitch, and in 2024 reached nearly 6 million. Twitch upholds its standing as one of the most-visited websites in the US through user engagement features, like live broadcasting, chat boxes, and interactive content. What Sports Fan Engagement Features Should be Prioritized? Sports fan engagement ideas can include various activities and initiatives to increase fan interaction and loyalty. For example, teams can host fan appreciation days, offer exclusive discounts and merchandise, or create fan clubs and reward programs. Additionally, they can host watch parties, organize meet-and-greets with players and coaches, or host game-day events such as tailgates and barbecues. Social media can also be used to engage with fans by responding to comments, hosting Q&A sessions, or creating content that fans can share. Finally, teams can host contests and giveaways or create exclusive content such as behind-the-scenes videos, interviews with players and coaches, or podcasts. While there are many interesting and innovative ideas and features for sports fan engagement apps, the most common ones are: Team news and updates Results overview Fixtures Statistics Game analysis Replays Highlights Radio coverage Interactive social media feeds Exclusive content like interviews, podcasts and videos Others like Fantasy Leagues and VR may be rising in trendiness, but are not necessarily the first tools to prioritize when initially building an app. Strategizing Fan Engagement in Sports Engagement never stops. Even when fans are not in the stadium or when players are giving online interviews, fan engagement platforms are there to keep fans interested. The industry is shifting toward more innovative business models to attract investment, with 83% of executives believing that new commercial models will be required to sustain and grow sports engagement. These changes emphasize the need for flexible, technology-driven approaches that offer unique and monetizable experiences. Below, we've shared ways to boost sports engagement year-round: Understand fans’ needs. Designing an effective sports fan engagement strategy requires that you understand your fans' demographic, interests, and how they want to interact with each other. For example, when it comes to sports, sharing results and giving more data and statistics allow fans to gain different perspectives on the game they’re following. Personalized messaging. Programs and features designed to communicate with everyone often speak to no one. When fans don’t feel included in the conversation, they may not stay interested, or even find a different, more engaging platform. To send personalized and captivating messaging to fans, you must first understand their preferences and appeal to their style of communication. Support loyalty. Rewarding loyal fans is one of the best ways to show how much you appreciate their commitment to your franchise. Special offers and access to additional services can help create organic content for later use in promotional materials. Most successful stars in sports and entertainment create and maintain a culture that fans can quickly adopt as their own. Holistic approach. Thorough consideration and planning in advance are necessary for fan engagement platforms to have better results in the long run. After every concert or sports game, make sure to let fans know what to expect next, and guide them towards the next big event. Push notifications directly link fans, ensuring that everyone stays connected. Building Communities with a Live Chat and Fantasy Leagues Communities built around celebrities, musicians, and sports players or teams are created through additional engagement. Social features, like a chat box, help fans feel more connected and keep them coming back for more related content, such as player updates and leaderboards in the case of sports. Inside a live sports streaming app, fans can have a variety of information available so they are always able to tune in to what is happening. Fantasy sports apps are another way to build community engagement for sports and entertainment. Fantasy teams compete in virtual championships and leagues based on the statistical performance of those players in actual games. Fantasy sports range from Fantasy Football drafts to ESPN Fantasy Sports. Next-Generation Streaming Services Participation in events can be seen in a variety of interactive forms. Prior to the pandemic, participation was usually bound to physical presence at a concert, sporting event, or conference. Today, fans can participate in many different, yet still meaningful ways. Streaming content allows audiences to attend and participate in virtually any event remotely, while also having the ability to share their opinions and other relevant information. Audience members feel like they are contributing in a meaningful way by sharing and commenting on the content. The shift toward digital sports consumption is evident, with younger audiences leading the transition. Fans aged 18-29 are more likely to watch sporting events via mobile devices and subscription streaming services, while those 45+ remain more loyal to traditional linear broadcasting (IBM). This generational divide highlights the importance of multi-platform accessibility in fan engagement strategies. Sports fans are increasingly using multiple devices to follow live events, with younger audiences leading this shift. 10% of fans aged 18-29 use three or more devices while watching sports, compared to only 2% of fans 55+. Additionally, while TV remains the most common method for viewing sports, 56% of fans turn to social media for additional content, with highlight videos (64%) and post-match recaps (48%) being the most consumed formats. These trends underscore the need for multi-platform content distribution and second-screen experiences to maintain fan engagement. In Japan, Yamaha developed an app, ‘Remote Cheerer’, that allows fans to cheer for their teams and create a full-stadium atmosphere while watching from the safety of their home. The app enables fans to cheer, chant, clap, and boo from their phones and broadcasts the sounds to stadiums in real-time. Fans are engaged in the streaming content, plus they create an exciting atmosphere for teams playing in nearly-empty stadiums. Push Notifications Quick updates allow fans to know the latest score, see exclusive content, or get breaking news. Such prompts drive traffic and revenue by reminding users your platform exists and is filled with useful and interesting information about events, performers, and teams they care about. They also improve the live stream watching experience by making it more immersive. With various topics, fans can be notified and engaged before, during, and after the event, so they don’t miss funny and exciting moments. Gamified Event Participation Many consider gamification to be a silver bullet that solves problems with brand loyalty. When game mechanics are carefully planned and added to a fan engagement app, users often gain a real sense of satisfaction. Streaming platforms still haven't adopted gaming concepts, but interest is on the rise. Nickelodeon and the NFL are using gamified participation, which encourages live interactions that work similarly to a game; users can earn badges and collect valuable game points.

From major leagues to local teams, marketing strategies and fan experiences shape the way brands grow, attract revenue, and retain their loyal fan base. Whether it’s filling stadiums, increasing merchandise sales, or building long-lasting relationships with fans, the right approach to sports marketing can have a transformative impact. This blog post examines how to implement sports marketing and engagement strategies to foster growth within sports organizations while referencing “Advancing Careers in Sport Management,” which outlines various career paths in this dynamic field. Here, we’ll dive into the real-world applications of marketing strategies, engagement techniques, and sponsorships within the world of sports. Sports marketing strategies A successful sports marketing plan begins with understanding the target audience. Sports organizations need to identify who their fans are—whether they’re loyal season ticket holders, casual viewers, or new fans being introduced through digital platforms. Once the audience is defined, sports marketers must choose the most effective channels, from traditional advertising to social media platforms, to enhance fan engagement.1 Digital marketing in sports Digital marketing is a game-changer in the sports world. Today, fans engage with their favorite teams online more than ever before. Social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter provide real-time updates, behind-the-scenes content, and direct interaction between fans and athletes. Influencer marketing is another powerful tool, with teams and brands collaborating with athletes and social media influencers to broaden their reach.2 In 2020, the NFL teamed up with TikTok to create the #TikTokTailgate campaign, generating massive engagement during the Super Bowl. The campaign delivered a unique pregame Super Bowl experience to healthcare workers as a thank-you for their hard work during the COVID-19 pandemic.3 The experience was posted on TikTok for fans to watch and had appearances from many celebrities, including Miley Cyrus who performed a live concert. The campaign encouraged fans to use #TikTokTailgate and #SuperBowlLV to share videos, interact with exclusive content, and participate in challenges, all contributing to an unforgettable online experience.4 This unique experience has continued to draw in millions of viewers each year. Measuring marketing success Marketing success in sports isn’t just about getting the message out; it’s about measuring impact. Key performance indicators (KPIs) like fan engagement, social media growth, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue are crucial in evaluating marketing efforts. Return on investment (ROI) calculations help organizations understand the financial outcomes of their marketing campaigns.1 For instance, after a social media marketing push, a sports team can analyze metrics like follower growth and post interactions to gauge success. Surveys, social media listening, and data analytics provide valuable insights into what fans enjoy and what they want to see improved.5 Organizations may also assess ticket sales or merchandise sales linked to those campaigns, providing a clear picture of what worked and what didn’t. Analyzing data on fan behavior can help sports marketers create highly targeted campaigns that speak to fans’ unique interests.1 Sports teams that consistently adapt based on fan feedback are more likely to retain a loyal and engaged fan base. Fan engagement techniques Fan engagement is at the heart of sports marketing. Teams are always looking for ways to improve the fan experience. Building fan loyalty in the sports industry Fan loyalty is a key ingredient for long-term success in sports. Building it takes more than just winning games—it’s about creating a sense of community and belonging. Successful strategies include launching fan clubs, loyalty programs, and offering personalized experiences.1 Many sports organizations provide opportunities for fans to purchase season tickets. While being a season ticket holder does show loyalty, organizations want to retain season ticket holders year after year. Providing unique experiences to season ticket holders, like exclusive content, meet-and-greet opportunities, and discounts, creates an enhanced fan experience that strengthens loyalty. Interactive engagement for sports fans Technology continues to play a major role in elevating the fan experience. Sports fans crave interaction. Social media, live streams, and gamification offer dynamic ways to keep fans engaged. Gamification, for instance, involves adding gaming elements such as quizzes, polls, or fantasy leagues to the fan experience. This creates fun, memorable moments that keep fans invested in the brand.1 A perfect example is the NFL’s partnership with Nickelodeon, where games were broadcast with kid-friendly graphics and interactive elements to engage a younger audience. These games had guest appearances by Nick stars, interviews with some of the players, and of course, plenty of slime. The result of the program generated “more than two billion social media impressions and made Nickelodeon the top trending topic in the U.S. on Twitter.”6 By combining sports with entertainment, the NFL introduced new fans to the sport in a unique, engaging way. Enhancing fan experience The use of innovative technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) is revolutionizing the fan experience. Teams are enhancing the game-day experience by allowing fans to view exclusive content through VR headsets or interact with AR overlays through mobile apps.7 A great example is the Sacramento Kings’ virtual reality courtside experience, which allows fans at home to feel like they’re sitting in premium seats at the arena. The Kings were the first sports team in the United States to deliver “a live, in-game, 360 virtual reality experience to fans.”8 The Kings have shown how important it is to use technology to enhance their fans’ experiences. In-game experience To truly captivate sports fans, the in-game experience needs to be memorable. From stadium amenities to fan engagement activities, teams are constantly innovating to make the experience more enjoyable. Many teams, like the Dallas Cowboys, have incorporated high-tech stadiums with luxury amenities, creating an environment where fans feel they’re part of something special. Their video board was the largest in the world and allowed fans in the stadium to have a better viewing experience.9 In order to draw people to attend games, organizations need to find ways to make the in-person experience better than watching the game at home. Sports sponsorship Sponsorships play a vital role in generating revenue and building brand recognition for sports organizations. Creating successful sponsorship deals involves more than slapping a logo on a jersey. Brands partner with teams or athletes to reach target audiences in a more authentic and organic way. Partnering with athletes and sports teams is a way for brands to show fans they share the same beliefs.10 This helps create trust with the brand, which can increase a fan’s interaction with the sports team. Successful sponsorship deals can elevate both the brand and the sports entity, leading to a win-win situation for both parties. Take Coca-Cola’s long-standing partnership with the FIFA World Cup. This sponsorship has gone beyond mere logo placement. Coca-Cola has exclusively sponsored the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour, which allows fans to view the trophy. This unique experience gets fans excited for the tournaments. Coca-Cola actively engages with fans through digital content, stadium activations, and exclusive promotions, making their brand synonymous with the excitement of the World Cup.11 Jump into the world of sports At the University of Kansas, we prepare future sport management leaders with the skills and knowledge to drive success in the world of sports.
