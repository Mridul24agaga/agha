  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, let’s break it down. So, we’ve got this URL: https://playpickups.app/. Just from the name alone, “Play Pickups” sounds like it could be a pretty cool spot for folks who are into games or sports. The word \"play\" usually evokes fun and activities, while \"pickups\" makes me think of picking teams or maybe even sports betting. Now, if I had to guess, I'd say this site probably has something to do with picking players or teams for fantasy sports. You know how people get super into fantasy leagues, strategizing to assemble their dream team? It could be a platform where you can either draft players or keep track of player stats, and maybe even compete with friends or other users. But it’s not just about fantasy, I mean, \"pickups\" might also indicate a social aspect—like meeting up for games or even organizing pickup sports sessions. Think basketball at the local park or casual soccer games where you just grab some pals and play. So, there might be a feature that helps you find people in your area to join in on some fun, whether that’s organizing matches or just playing casually. Also, since it’s an app, I’m guessing it’s got a slick user interface. Maybe it has notifications for when games are happening or when players are performing really well so you can jump on those fantasy points. It’s all about staying connected and being in the loop, right? And let’s not forget about the competitive vibe. There could be leaderboards, challenges, and maybe even some kind of rewards system to keep everyone hyped. Gamifying the experience always adds to the fun, and everyone loves a little bragging rights among friends, right? Honestly, if it’s like most of these platforms, they probably have some community features too. So, forums or chat options where users can swap strategies, talk smack, or just bond over their love of the game. That’s always a big draw for any sports or gaming enthusiast. In summary, I’m thinking Play Pickups is all about combining the thrill of games with a social hangout vibe—whether it’s drafting a killer fantasy team, finding an impromptu basketball game, or just connecting with other fans. It’s definitely got that chill, community-oriented flavor, keeping everything fresh and engaging for sports lovers. Sounds like a cool spot to check out, especially if you’re looking to up your game or just have some fun with others who share the same passion.",

Table of contents Example H2 Example H3 Fantasy football is a virtual game where players act as team managers, drafting real NFL players to form a personal team. The performance of these real players in actual games determines the fantasy team's success in the fantasy league. To excel, understanding player statistics, league settings, and fantasy football advice is crucial. This advice can guide you through draft strategies and daily management, ensuring you make informed decisions to potentially lead your team to victory. The goal is to compile a team that outperforms others based on gathered points, which are scored according to real-life performances of the players on your team. Drafting Like a Pro: Building a Strong Foundation Researching and Ranking Players Before the Draft The foundation of a winning strategy begins well before the draft starts; it's entrenched in meticulous research and the thoughtful ranking of players. This process is not simply about selecting star athletes; it involves a comprehensive analysis of several critical factors that can influence a player's projected performance for the upcoming season. Starting with player performance statistics is standard, but the real edge comes from analyzing trends over time, not just last season's outcomes. Injury history is equally pivotal as it can significantly affect a player's availability and productivity; hence, a player's health and recovery trajectory should be closely monitored. Additionally, off-season team changes—trades, new coaching staff, and changes in team strategy—can drastically alter a player's context and, consequently, their fantasy output. For instance, a running back who might have been pivotal in a previous season could see fewer touches due to a shift towards a pass-heavy offensive scheme under a new coach. Engaging with a variety of resources, such as podcasts, expert columns, and advanced statistical tools like predictive modeling, can uncover insights not immediately apparent through conventional stats. Balancing Star Players and Sleepers in Your Draft Striking the right balance between proven star players and potential sleepers is essential. Star players provide a reliable foundation with consistently high scores, but they often come with a high draft cost. On the other hand, sleepers—less heralded players poised for a breakout season—can provide immense value. Managing fantasy team success involves predicting which mid-to-late-round players could turn into season-defining performers, offering a significant return on investment. League Format and Scoring Rules Understanding your specific league format and scoring rules is crucial for a successful draft strategy. Whether it’s a point-per-reception (PPR) league, standard scoring, or a dynasty league, each format demands a different approach to drafting. For example, PPR leagues elevate the value of pass-catching running backs and receivers. Tailoring your draft strategy to your league's settings ensures that every player you select maximizes their scoring potential, enhancing your best fantasy football strategies. Avoiding Common Draft Day Mistakes One major pitfall is drafting based on the previous season’s performance without considering changes like player transfers, new coaching staff, or scheme alterations. Neglecting to prepare for your draft position or overvaluing players based on personal bias rather than objective data can lead to poor selections. Being aware of these potential errors and maintaining a disciplined approach to drafting are key aspects of winning fantasy football. Managing Your Roster Throughout the Season Player Matchups and Bye Weeks Players facing weaker opponents or those who excel in certain conditions can make or break a week's performance. Planning for bye weeks in advance prevents a roster shortfall when your key players are unavailable. Strategic foresight allows for preemptive adjustments, ensuring you never miss an opportunity to score maximum points and maintain a competitive edge in your NFL fantasy league. Navigating the Waiver Wire for Hidden Gems The waiver wire acts as a dynamic resource for acquiring players who may not have been drafted but show potential due to various factors such as injuries to starters, changes in team strategy, or unexpected improvements in performance. It's crucial to understand the specific rules and timing of your league’s waiver process, as this can affect your strategy. Some leagues use a waiver priority system based on reverse standings, while others may employ a budget-based system (FAAB, or Free Agent Acquisition Budget), where managers bid on players. Knowing the intricacies of these systems can give you a competitive edge. For example, in a priority system, a manager might hold back on using a high waiver spot on a marginal player, waiting instead for a more impactful opportunity. In contrast, with FAAB, it's about managing your budget wisely throughout the season, knowing when to splurge on a must-have player and when to save funds for future rounds. This practice is essential for adapting to injuries and underperformances, and continually optimizing your team. Making Smart Trades to Strengthen Your Team Engaging in trades is another strategy to enhance your team's composition and address weaknesses. Evaluate your roster for surplus strengths or potential upgrades and target other teams that offer complementary benefits. Effective trading requires a keen understanding of player values and negotiation skills, aiming to secure favorable exchanges that benefit your seasonal trajectory. Strategic trades, especially before trade deadlines, can be pivotal in positioning your team for a postseason run in fantasy premier league contests. Keeping Your Bench Depth Strong Maintaining a robust and flexible bench is crucial for long-term success in fantasy football. This involves selecting backups who can step in without a significant drop in team performance during player absences. A well-curated bench not only provides insurance against unforeseen circumstances but also offers strategic options for matchup-based player rotations, which is vital for navigating the ups and downs of a fantasy football season. Optimizing Your Weekly Lineup for Success Player Projections and Stats Evaluating player projections and statistics is crucial for making informed decisions on setting your weekly fantasy lineup. Analysts and fantasy experts use historical data, player health, and matchups to predict weekly outcomes. However, as a manager, you need to interpret these projections critically, considering your unique league dynamics and scoring rules. To effectively utilize these stats, you should: Compare Multiple Sources: Relying solely on one fantasy football website for player projections can be risky. Different platforms use varied algorithms and expert insights to generate their forecasts. By comparing projections from multiple reputable sources, you can identify consensus views and outliers. This approach minimizes the risk of basing decisions on potentially skewed data from a single source. It’s akin to consulting multiple experts before making a crucial business decision, where more inputs typically lead to a more informed outcome. Consider the Context: Player performance data is more meaningful when analyzed in the right context. A player's impressive track record against a particular team might not hold if significant changes have occurred since those games, such as coaching shifts or strategic overhauls. Always consider the current team dynamics, coaching strategies, and player roles. For instance, a running back who thrived under a coach with a run-heavy philosophy might see reduced output under a new coach who favors aerial attacks. This nuanced approach helps anticipate changes in player output more accurately. Analyze Matchup Details: Certain players have historically performed well against specific defenses or in particular scenarios, like when their team is trailing and needs to throw frequently. Detailed analysis of such matchups can uncover advantageous trends. For example, a quarterback who excels at passing under pressure may be a valuable starter against teams known for aggressive defense. Understanding these dynamics allows you to exploit matchups that are favorable to your players, giving you an edge over competitors who may not delve as deeply into such details. By integrating diverse sources, considering the evolving context, and analyzing specific matchups, you can craft a more robust strategy. This methodical approach to player projections helps in making informed decisions, thereby potentially leading to superior performance in your fantasy football endeavors. Deciding When to Start or Sit Players Choosing which players to start or sit in any given week is a nuanced decision that requires a deep understanding of your roster and the overall player landscape. Factors such as player health, recent performance trends, and specific game matchups should influence these decisions. A typically strong player facing a top defense might be benched in favor of a lesser player with a more favorable matchup. This tactic, known as \"playing the matchups,\" can significantly influence weekly results and requires constant attention and strategic foresight. Leveraging Fantasy Football Tools and Resources Best Fantasy Football Websites Staying updated with real-time information is crucial for effective fantasy football management. The best fantasy football websites offer extensive coverage, player stats, real-time injury updates, and expert analysis that can significantly influence decision-making processes. In addition to articles and updates, advanced tools like customizable mock drafts are invaluable for honing your drafting strategy. These simulations allow managers to experiment with different draft positions and strategies to see how choosing certain players might affect overall team composition and balance. Practice can be particularly beneficial for understanding how early or late certain players are likely to be picked, which assists in planning your draft strategy around when to target specific positions or players. The most effective fantasy football websites also foster vibrant communities where managers can exchange tips, strategies, and insights. Participating in these communities can provide additional layers of strategic depth, as you gain access to a wide range of opinions and tactics. Furthermore, many top sites integrate social media elements that allow for real-time interaction during games, which can lead to immediate strategic shifts based on live performances. Tools for Tracking Player In the dynamic world of fantasy football, having the right tools to track player performance and manage injuries can be the difference between a winning and losing season. Here are essential tools every fantasy manager should consider: Mobile Apps: Apps are invaluable for fantasy football managers on the go. They provide not just real-time updates on player statistics but also crucial injury reports, directly on your mobile device. This immediate access allows managers to make swift decisions, adjusting their lineups in response to the latest developments. The convenience of having all necessary information at your fingertips cannot be overstressed, as it ensures that you can react promptly to any last-minute changes before game time. Fantasy Football Analytics Platforms: To truly get an edge in fantasy football, advanced metrics and predictive analytics are key. Platforms dedicated to fantasy football analytics take into account various variables that might affect player performance, from historical data to current season trends. These tools are designed to provide a deeper understanding of a player’s potential, going beyond basic stats to offer insights that can inform more strategic drafting and trading decisions. By leveraging such sophisticated analytics, managers can predict player performance with greater accuracy, giving them a competitive advantage in their leagues. Injury Notification Services: Timeliness in handling player injuries is critical in fantasy football. Subscribing to an injury notification service ensures that you receive immediate alerts whenever there are updates about player injuries. These services often provide faster notifications than official team reports and news outlets, allowing fantasy managers to make quick and informed decisions regarding their lineups. Staying updated through such dedicated channels can mean the difference between securing a pivotal player off waivers before your competitors or missing out due to delayed reactions. Harnessing these tools effectively can transform the way you manage your fantasy football team, from draft day to the playoffs. As the fantasy season progresses, the value of real-time data and predictive analytics only grows, underscoring the importance of these tools in achieving fantasy football success. Adjusting Your Strategy Based on League Trends As mentioned previously, successful managers are those who not only set a good initial strategy but also adjust it based on ongoing league trends and player developments. This could mean changing your drafting technique, trading policy, or player selection approach as the season progresses. Keeping an eye on emerging players, unexpected drop-offs in performances, and shifts in team playstyles are all crucial for staying ahead in the game. Adapting your strategy to these changes can provide the edge needed to outmaneuver opponents and secure your position at the top of the league standings. Achieving consistency in fantasy football is a blend of strategy, foresight, and a bit of luck. Emphasizing a thorough understanding of your league’s rules, active engagement through the season, and flexible management of your team are pillars for success. To excel, keep up-to-date on the latest fantasy football tips and trends, engage with community advice, and continuously learn from each season's outcomes. Reflect on your decisions, both the successful and the less effective ones, to refine your approach each year. This cycle of preparation, execution, and revision is key to evolving from a beginner to a pro in the fantasy sports arena. ‍ This article contains betting tips and strategies for basketball fans.

Table of contents Example H2 Example H3 Fantasy football is a virtual game where players act as team managers, drafting real NFL players to form a personal team. The performance of these real players in actual games determines the fantasy team's success in the fantasy league. To excel, understanding player statistics, league settings, and fantasy football advice is crucial. This advice can guide you through draft strategies and daily management, ensuring you make informed decisions to potentially lead your team to victory. The goal is to compile a team that outperforms others based on gathered points, which are scored according to real-life performances of the players on your team. Drafting Like a Pro: Building a Strong Foundation Researching and Ranking Players Before the Draft The foundation of a winning strategy begins well before the draft starts; it's entrenched in meticulous research and the thoughtful ranking of players. This process is not simply about selecting star athletes; it involves a comprehensive analysis of several critical factors that can influence a player's projected performance for the upcoming season. Starting with player performance statistics is standard, but the real edge comes from analyzing trends over time, not just last season's outcomes. Injury history is equally pivotal as it can significantly affect a player's availability and productivity; hence, a player's health and recovery trajectory should be closely monitored. Additionally, off-season team changes—trades, new coaching staff, and changes in team strategy—can drastically alter a player's context and, consequently, their fantasy output. For instance, a running back who might have been pivotal in a previous season could see fewer touches due to a shift towards a pass-heavy offensive scheme under a new coach. Engaging with a variety of resources, such as podcasts, expert columns, and advanced statistical tools like predictive modeling, can uncover insights not immediately apparent through conventional stats. Balancing Star Players and Sleepers in Your Draft Striking the right balance between proven star players and potential sleepers is essential. Star players provide a reliable foundation with consistently high scores, but they often come with a high draft cost. On the other hand, sleepers—less heralded players poised for a breakout season—can provide immense value. Managing fantasy team success involves predicting which mid-to-late-round players could turn into season-defining performers, offering a significant return on investment. League Format and Scoring Rules Understanding your specific league format and scoring rules is crucial for a successful draft strategy. Whether it’s a point-per-reception (PPR) league, standard scoring, or a dynasty league, each format demands a different approach to drafting. For example, PPR leagues elevate the value of pass-catching running backs and receivers. Tailoring your draft strategy to your league's settings ensures that every player you select maximizes their scoring potential, enhancing your best fantasy football strategies. Avoiding Common Draft Day Mistakes One major pitfall is drafting based on the previous season’s performance without considering changes like player transfers, new coaching staff, or scheme alterations. Neglecting to prepare for your draft position or overvaluing players based on personal bias rather than objective data can lead to poor selections. Being aware of these potential errors and maintaining a disciplined approach to drafting are key aspects of winning fantasy football. Managing Your Roster Throughout the Season Player Matchups and Bye Weeks Players facing weaker opponents or those who excel in certain conditions can make or break a week's performance. Planning for bye weeks in advance prevents a roster shortfall when your key players are unavailable. Strategic foresight allows for preemptive adjustments, ensuring you never miss an opportunity to score maximum points and maintain a competitive edge in your NFL fantasy league. Navigating the Waiver Wire for Hidden Gems The waiver wire acts as a dynamic resource for acquiring players who may not have been drafted but show potential due to various factors such as injuries to starters, changes in team strategy, or unexpected improvements in performance. It's crucial to understand the specific rules and timing of your league’s waiver process, as this can affect your strategy. Some leagues use a waiver priority system based on reverse standings, while others may employ a budget-based system (FAAB, or Free Agent Acquisition Budget), where managers bid on players. Knowing the intricacies of these systems can give you a competitive edge. For example, in a priority system, a manager might hold back on using a high waiver spot on a marginal player, waiting instead for a more impactful opportunity. In contrast, with FAAB, it's about managing your budget wisely throughout the season, knowing when to splurge on a must-have player and when to save funds for future rounds. This practice is essential for adapting to injuries and underperformances, and continually optimizing your team. Making Smart Trades to Strengthen Your Team Engaging in trades is another strategy to enhance your team's composition and address weaknesses. Evaluate your roster for surplus strengths or potential upgrades and target other teams that offer complementary benefits. Effective trading requires a keen understanding of player values and negotiation skills, aiming to secure favorable exchanges that benefit your seasonal trajectory. Strategic trades, especially before trade deadlines, can be pivotal in positioning your team for a postseason run in fantasy premier league contests. Keeping Your Bench Depth Strong Maintaining a robust and flexible bench is crucial for long-term success in fantasy football. This involves selecting backups who can step in without a significant drop in team performance during player absences. A well-curated bench not only provides insurance against unforeseen circumstances but also offers strategic options for matchup-based player rotations, which is vital for navigating the ups and downs of a fantasy football season. Optimizing Your Weekly Lineup for Success Player Projections and Stats Evaluating player projections and statistics is crucial for making informed decisions on setting your weekly fantasy lineup. Analysts and fantasy experts use historical data, player health, and matchups to predict weekly outcomes. However, as a manager, you need to interpret these projections critically, considering your unique league dynamics and scoring rules. To effectively utilize these stats, you should: Compare Multiple Sources: Relying solely on one fantasy football website for player projections can be risky. Different platforms use varied algorithms and expert insights to generate their forecasts. By comparing projections from multiple reputable sources, you can identify consensus views and outliers. This approach minimizes the risk of basing decisions on potentially skewed data from a single source. It’s akin to consulting multiple experts before making a crucial business decision, where more inputs typically lead to a more informed outcome. Consider the Context: Player performance data is more meaningful when analyzed in the right context. A player's impressive track record against a particular team might not hold if significant changes have occurred since those games, such as coaching shifts or strategic overhauls. Always consider the current team dynamics, coaching strategies, and player roles. For instance, a running back who thrived under a coach with a run-heavy philosophy might see reduced output under a new coach who favors aerial attacks. This nuanced approach helps anticipate changes in player output more accurately. Analyze Matchup Details: Certain players have historically performed well against specific defenses or in particular scenarios, like when their team is trailing and needs to throw frequently. Detailed analysis of such matchups can uncover advantageous trends. For example, a quarterback who excels at passing under pressure may be a valuable starter against teams known for aggressive defense. Understanding these dynamics allows you to exploit matchups that are favorable to your players, giving you an edge over competitors who may not delve as deeply into such details. By integrating diverse sources, considering the evolving context, and analyzing specific matchups, you can craft a more robust strategy. This methodical approach to player projections helps in making informed decisions, thereby potentially leading to superior performance in your fantasy football endeavors. Deciding When to Start or Sit Players Choosing which players to start or sit in any given week is a nuanced decision that requires a deep understanding of your roster and the overall player landscape. Factors such as player health, recent performance trends, and specific game matchups should influence these decisions. A typically strong player facing a top defense might be benched in favor of a lesser player with a more favorable matchup. This tactic, known as \"playing the matchups,\" can significantly influence weekly results and requires constant attention and strategic foresight.

It requires strategy, research, and a deep understanding of the game. For fantasy enthusiasts aiming to dominate their leagues, a few essential tips can make all the difference. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you build the ultimate fantasy football team and achieve success this season. 1. Master the Draft Strategy The foundation of a successful fantasy football team lies in a well-executed draft strategy. Start by familiarizing yourself with the scoring system and draft format for your league. This knowledge will guide your choices and help you prioritize players based on their value. Mock drafts are invaluable for practicing different scenarios and adjusting your strategy. During the draft, aim to balance your roster with a mix of high-upside players and consistent performers. Be on the lookout for NFL week 1 odds until week 18 odds. Flexibility is key, so be prepared to adjust your strategy based on how the draft unfolds. 2. Prioritize Value Over Names While star players often dominate headlines, prioritizing value can lead to tremendous success in fantasy football. Instead of focusing solely on high-profile names, seek players who offer high potential relative to their draft position. This involves analyzing past performance, injury history, and off-season changes. For instance, a player with a solid performance history but coming off an injury may be undervalued compared to a consistent performer at a higher draft cost. Look for potential sleepers—players who might not be in the spotlight but have the chance to break out due to changes in their team’s roster or offensive scheme. Assess how a player fits into your team’s overall strategy and their role within their current team. Players stepping into more significant roles due to a teammate’s departure or who have significantly improved in the preseason can be great assets. Avoid getting swayed by flashy names alone. Instead, focus on how well players align with your strategy and their potential to deliver consistent, high returns. This approach can lead to finding valuable assets that outperform their draft cost. 3. Balance Your Roster A well-rounded roster is crucial for sustained success throughout the season. Strive for balance across all positions, ensuring that you have reliable starters and quality backups. Pay attention to positional scarcity. Some positions may have fewer top-tier options, making it essential to secure talent early. Also, consider the depth of each position and how injuries or bye weeks might impact your team. Building depth and flexibility ensures you can weather any challenges during the season. 4. Stay Informed on Player News Injuries, trades, and coaching changes can significantly impact player performance, making it crucial to stay updated. Monitor injury reports to anticipate player availability and adjust your lineup accordingly. For instance, an injury to a key starter can open opportunities for backups or affect overall team dynamics. Trades can alter player roles and opportunities, while coaching changes might shift strategies and player usage. Leverage multiple sources for the latest updates, including team beat writers, official team websites, and reputable sports news outlets. Many fantasy platforms offer news feeds and alerts tailored to your team, helping you stay informed in real time. Regularly check these updates to ensure you have the most current information when setting your lineup or making trades. Being proactive allows you to capitalize on emerging opportunities and avoid pitfalls, giving you a competitive edge throughout the season. 5. Monitor Matchups and Trends Understanding matchups and trends is essential for making informed weekly lineup decisions. Begin by analyzing how opposing defenses perform against specific positions. For instance, if a defense is known for struggling against the run, starting a running back with a strong matchup against that team could lead to significant gains. Similarly, if a defense is weak against the pass, favoring a receiver who has been performing well in recent games might be advantageous. Additionally, keep a close eye on player performance trends. Look at recent game logs to identify players on a hot streak or experiencing a decline in performance. Recent changes in offensive schemes, quarterback play, or even weather conditions can affect player output. Pay attention to these nuances and adjust your lineup accordingly to capitalize on favorable trends and avoid potential pitfalls. 6. Be Strategic with Waiver Wire Picks The waiver wire is valuable for improving your team throughout the season. Stay vigilant and proactive in monitoring available players and potential additions. Look for emerging talents that might have been overlooked in the draft early in the season. As the season progresses, prioritize players who can address weaknesses or fill gaps due to injuries. Being strategic with your waiver wire picks can significantly boost and keep your team competitive. 7. Adapt and Adjust Flexibility and adaptability are crucial for fantasy football success. The season is dynamic, and circumstances can change rapidly. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on performance, injuries, and other factors. Regularly evaluate your team and make necessary changes to improve your chances. Whether making trades, adjusting your lineup, or exploring different strategies, staying adaptable ensures you can respond effectively to evolving situations. Takeaway Building the ultimate fantasy football team involves more than just picking standout players. It requires a blend of strategic planning, informed decision-making, and adapting to changing circumstances. Following all the tips here can set you up for a successful and enjoyable fantasy football season. 0 Like This Story Share on FacebookShare on XEmail this StoryPrint this Story 100 Adler Journalism Building, E131 Iowa City, IA 52242 Newsroom: 319-335-6030 Contact Staff Editorial Policy Publishing Guidelines Reprints and Permissions Newsletters Job Opportunities Scholarship Opportunities Advertise / Rate Card Print Subscription Classified Ads DI Historical Archives News Sports Politics Opinions Arts Multimedia DITV The Daily Iowan • © 2025 Student Publications, Inc.

Look for potential sleepers—players who might not be in the spotlight but have the chance to break out due to changes in their team’s roster or offensive scheme. Assess how a player fits into your team’s overall strategy and their role within their current team. Players stepping into more significant roles due to a teammate’s departure or who have significantly improved in the preseason can be great assets. Avoid getting swayed by flashy names alone. Instead, focus on how well players align with your strategy and their potential to deliver consistent, high returns. This approach can lead to finding valuable assets that outperform their draft cost. 3. Balance Your Roster A well-rounded roster is crucial for sustained success throughout the season. Strive for balance across all positions, ensuring that you have reliable starters and quality backups. Pay attention to positional scarcity. Some positions may have fewer top-tier options, making it essential to secure talent early. Also, consider the depth of each position and how injuries or bye weeks might impact your team. Building depth and flexibility ensures you can weather any challenges during the season. 4. Stay Informed on Player News Injuries, trades, and coaching changes can significantly impact player performance, making it crucial to stay updated. Monitor injury reports to anticipate player availability and adjust your lineup accordingly. For instance, an injury to a key starter can open opportunities for backups or affect overall team dynamics. Trades can alter player roles and opportunities, while coaching changes might shift strategies and player usage. Leverage multiple sources for the latest updates, including team beat writers, official team websites, and reputable sports news outlets. Many fantasy platforms offer news feeds and alerts tailored to your team, helping you stay informed in real time. Regularly check these updates to ensure you have the most current information when setting your lineup or making trades. Being proactive allows you to capitalize on emerging opportunities and avoid pitfalls, giving you a competitive edge throughout the season. 5. Monitor Matchups and Trends Understanding matchups and trends is essential for making informed weekly lineup decisions. Begin by analyzing how opposing defenses perform against specific positions. For instance, if a defense is known for struggling against the run, starting a running back with a strong matchup against that team could lead to significant gains. Similarly, if a defense is weak against the pass, favoring a receiver who has been performing well in recent games might be advantageous. Additionally, keep a close eye on player performance trends. Look at recent game logs to identify players on a hot streak or experiencing a decline in performance. Recent changes in offensive schemes, quarterback play, or even weather conditions can affect player output. Pay attention to these nuances and adjust your lineup accordingly to capitalize on favorable trends and avoid potential pitfalls. 6. Be Strategic with Waiver Wire Picks The waiver wire is valuable for improving your team throughout the season. Stay vigilant and proactive in monitoring available players and potential additions. Look for emerging talents that might have been overlooked in the draft early in the season. As the season progresses, prioritize players who can address weaknesses or fill gaps due to injuries. Being strategic with your waiver wire picks can significantly boost and keep your team competitive. 7. Adapt and Adjust Flexibility and adaptability are crucial for fantasy football success. The season is dynamic, and circumstances can change rapidly. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on performance, injuries, and other factors. Regularly evaluate your team and make necessary changes to improve your chances. Whether making trades, adjusting your lineup, or exploring different strategies, staying adaptable ensures you can respond effectively to evolving situations. Takeaway Building the ultimate fantasy football team involves more than just picking standout players. It requires a blend of strategic planning, informed decision-making, and adapting to changing circumstances. Following all the tips here can set you up for a successful and enjoyable fantasy football season. 0 Like This Story Share on FacebookShare on XEmail this StoryPrint this Story 100 Adler Journalism Building, E131 Iowa City, IA 52242 Newsroom: 319-335-6030 Contact Staff Editorial Policy Publishing Guidelines Reprints and Permissions Newsletters Job Opportunities Scholarship Opportunities Advertise / Rate Card Print Subscription Classified Ads DI Historical Archives News Sports Politics Opinions Arts Multimedia DITV The Daily Iowan • © 2025 Student Publications, Inc.

Building a winning fantasy football team requires a mix of preparation, strategy and a bit of luck. Here are some essential tips to help you dominate your league this season. 1. Do your research Preparation is key. Before your draft, spend time researching player rankings, recent performances and offseason changes. Pay attention to: 2. Know your league’s scoring system Understanding your league’s scoring system is crucial for drafting the right players. Different leagues may reward points differently for yardage, touchdowns and receptions. For example, in a PPR (Points Per Reception) league, wide receivers and running backs who catch a lot of passes are more valuable. 3. Mock drafts are your friend Participating in mock drafts can help you get a feel for where players are being picked and develop your draft strategy. Websites like ESPN and Yahoo offer free mock draft lobbies. Use these to practice different draft positions and scenarios. 4. Balance risk and reward While it’s tempting to draft the highest-scoring players from the previous season, it’s also important to consider their risk factors. Injury-prone players or those with new team dynamics might not perform as expected. Mix reliable players with high-upside picks to balance your roster. 5. Wait on quarterbacks Unless you can grab a top-tier quarterback like Patrick Mahomes or Josh Allen, it’s often wise to wait until the middle rounds to draft your QB. There is typically good depth at the quarterback position, and you can find value picks later. 6. Focus on running backs and wide receivers early Running backs and wide receivers tend to score the most points and have the most significant impact on your weekly matchups. Prioritize these positions in the early rounds to ensure you have a strong foundation for your team. 7. Don’t ignore tight ends While the tight end position can be tricky, having a top performer like Travis Kelce or Mark Andrews can give you a significant advantage. If you can’t get an elite tight end, look for value picks later in the draft. 8. Stay flexible and adaptable Have a draft plan but be ready to adapt. If a player you didn’t expect to be available falls to you, consider taking them even if it wasn’t part of your initial strategy. Flexibility can be the key to capitalizing on draft-day surprises. 9. Monitor training camp and preseason news Player injuries, position battles and coaching decisions can significantly impact player value. Stay updated on the latest news throughout training camp and the preseason to make informed decisions during your draft. 10. Handcuff your top running backs If you draft a top-tier running back, consider also drafting their backup (handcuff) in the later rounds. This strategy can protect you against injuries and ensure you have a reliable option if your star player goes down. 11. Don’t neglect defense and kickers While defense and kickers are typically drafted in the later rounds, they can still contribute to your weekly points total. Look for defenses with favorable early-season matchups and kickers on high-scoring teams. 12. Keep an eye on the waiver wire Your work isn’t done after the draft. Stay active on the waiver wire throughout the season to pick up emerging talent and cover for injuries or underperforming players. Building a winning fantasy football team takes preparation, strategy and adaptability. By doing your research, understanding your league’s scoring system, and staying flexible during the draft, you can set yourself up for a successful season. Good luck, and may your fantasy team bring you championship glory!

Building a championship roster isn’t easy, but nothing beats the thrill of victory. That’s why we’re here, right? Whether you’re a seasoned manager or just kicking off, you need a game plan. So, grab your virtual clipboard, and let’s huddle up! Let’s talk strategies to take your fantasy squad all the way! Know the Rules: Master Your League’s Settings Every fantasy football league has its playbook. That’s where the scoring system comes in. Here’s why it matters: Positional Value: Some systems reward quarterbacks heavily, while others favor running backs or wide receivers. Find out if it’s a PPR league (points-per-reception). Points vs. Categories: Do you get points for every yard gained, or do you win head-to-head matchups in categories like passing touchdowns or rushing yards? Roster Construction: How many players do you start at each position? Are there flex spots? Figuring this out is like deciphering the opponents’ defense – vital to making those winning plays. Research is Power: Dig Deep Draft day is the culmination, not the beginning, of your championship run. Winning managers are like scouts, always on the hunt for information. Here’s where to focus your analysis: Player Projections: Look at expert consensus and find the stats you care about. Do you target those with a high floor (consistent points) or those with huge potential upside? Injury Reports: Don’t gamble on sidelined stars. Availability is as important as talent. Depth Charts: Understand who’s starting and who might emerge as a surprise contributor. NFL FanDuel Sportsbook: Check out the odds! Lines and over/under can hint at potential value picks. Draft Day Dominance: Executing Your Plan It’s going time. Draft day is where the rubber meets the road. Here’s how to nail it: The Anchor Strategy: Target a top-tier running back or wide receiver early. They’ll be your workhorse, the one you can count on week in and week out. Avoid the “Homer” Pick: Don’t draft based on your NFL fandom. Your heart and your fantasy roster have different goals. Best Available: Sometimes value trumps need. If there’s a star at a different position on the board, adjust your plan on the fly. Look Ahead: Consider bye weeks when building your roster. You don’t want huge gaps in your starting lineup later in the season. Don’t Sleep on the Waiver Wire The draft isn’t the end of the story—injuries happen, and breakout players emerge. That’s where the waiver wire becomes your secret weapon. Stash Your Handcuffs: If you draft a star running back, snag their backup too. It’s insurance, minimizing your risk in case of injury. Target Upside: Rookie wide receivers or running backs who show flashes of brilliance? It’s worth a stash if you’ve got the roster space. Speculate Based on Opportunity: Sometimes injuries open the door for a lesser-known player. If their situation is right, take advantage! Stay Engaged for the Win Fantasy football is a marathon, not a sprint. Winning means staying involved. Set Your Lineups: Obvious, maybe, but don’t miss game days! Don’t be that manager. Trade Market: Be savvy about possible upgrades. Have an aging star? Package them with a rising player to a contending team. The Playoffs: Know your league’s playoff format, and adjust your late-season pickups accordingly. Conclusion Building a winning fantasy football roster is thrilling. It requires a mix of strategy, knowledge, and a bit of good, old-fashioned luck. Remember, even the best-laid plans sometimes go awry—have fun with the process! Stay up-to-date, adjust when needed, and with a little dedication, you might just hoist that championship trophy.

Building a championship roster isn’t easy, but nothing beats the thrill of victory. That’s why we’re here, right? Whether you’re a seasoned manager or just kicking off, you need a game plan. So, grab your virtual clipboard, and let’s huddle up! Let’s talk strategies to take your fantasy squad all the way! Know the Rules: Master Your League’s Settings Every fantasy football league has its playbook. That’s where the scoring system comes in. Here’s why it matters: Positional Value: Some systems reward quarterbacks heavily, while others favor running backs or wide receivers. Find out if it’s a PPR league (points-per-reception). Points vs. Categories: Do you get points for every yard gained, or do you win head-to-head matchups in categories like passing touchdowns or rushing yards? Roster Construction: How many players do you start at each position? Are there flex spots? Figuring this out is like deciphering the opponents’ defense – vital to making those winning plays. Research is Power: Dig Deep Draft day is the culmination, not the beginning, of your championship run. Winning managers are like scouts, always on the hunt for information. Here’s where to focus your analysis: Player Projections: Look at expert consensus and find the stats you care about. Do you target those with a high floor (consistent points) or those with huge potential upside? Injury Reports: Don’t gamble on sidelined stars. Availability is as important as talent. Depth Charts: Understand who’s starting and who might emerge as a surprise contributor. NFL FanDuel Sportsbook: Check out the odds! Lines and over/under can hint at potential value picks. Draft Day Dominance: Executing Your Plan It’s going time. Draft day is where the rubber meets the road. Here’s how to nail it: The Anchor Strategy: Target a top-tier running back or wide receiver early. They’ll be your workhorse, the one you can count on week in and week out. Avoid the “Homer” Pick: Don’t draft based on your NFL fandom. Your heart and your fantasy roster have different goals. Best Available: Sometimes value trumps need. If there’s a star at a different position on the board, adjust your plan on the fly. Look Ahead: Consider bye weeks when building your roster. You don’t want huge gaps in your starting lineup later in the season. Don’t Sleep on the Waiver Wire The draft isn’t the end of the story—injuries happen, and breakout players emerge. That’s where the waiver wire becomes your secret weapon. Stash Your Handcuffs: If you draft a star running back, snag their backup too. It’s insurance, minimizing your risk in case of injury. Target Upside: Rookie wide receivers or running backs who show flashes of brilliance? It’s worth a stash if you’ve got the roster space. Speculate Based on Opportunity: Sometimes injuries open the door for a lesser-known player. If their situation is right, take advantage! Stay Engaged for the Win Fantasy football is a marathon, not a sprint. Winning means staying involved. Set Your Lineups: Obvious, maybe, but don’t miss game days! Don’t be that manager. Trade Market: Be savvy about possible upgrades. Have an aging star? Package them with a rising player to a contending team. The Playoffs: Know your league’s playoff format, and adjust your late-season pickups accordingly. Conclusion Building a winning fantasy football roster is thrilling. It requires a mix of strategy, knowledge, and a bit of good, old-fashioned luck. Remember, even the best-laid plans sometimes go awry—have fun with the process! Stay up-to-date, adjust when needed, and with a little dedication, you might just hoist that championship trophy.

Whether you’re diving into fantasy football rankings, preparing for your fantasy football draft, or chasing the ultimate fantasy football trophy, this game offers endless excitement.

Fantasy football isn’t just a game; it’s a community. Podcasts like The Fantasy Footballers provide expert fantasy football advice, while apps like Underdog Fantasy and FTN Fantasy keep players updated with the latest fantasy football news and tools. It’s more than just football. Many fans dabble in other fantasy sports like fantasy baseball or daily fantasy football, but nothing compares to the thrill of topping week 1 fantasy rankings or discovering the season’s best fantasy football sleepers. Ready to dominate your league? Let’s get started! What is Fantasy Football? Fantasy football is a fun and engaging fantasy sport where players act as team managers. The goal is to build the best team by picking real-life football players for your fantasy roster. Each player earns fantasy points based on their real-world performance during NFL games. From casual leagues to intense competitions, fantasy football brings fans closer to the game they love. How Does Fantasy Football Work? Fantasy football begins with a fantasy draft, where participants, called “owners,” select players to form their team. There are different types of drafts, including the traditional snake draft and the auction draft. The draft strategy is key, as owners aim to pick top players using fantasy football rankings or printable fantasy football rankings to guide their choices. Once the draft is complete, team owners set weekly lineups, deciding which players will start and which will sit based on matchups and fantasy football projections. Lineups can include quarterbacks, running backs, wide receivers, tight ends, kickers, and defenses. Points are scored based on player performance, such as yards gained, touchdowns scored, and other stats. During the season, owners manage their teams by trading players, picking up free agents, and using fantasy start sit tools to optimize their lineups. Staying updated on the latest fantasy football news and following resources like The Fantasy Footballers can help owners make informed decisions. Fantasy Football Formats Fantasy football offers a variety of formats to suit different preferences: Standard Leagues: The most basic format, focusing on touchdowns, yards, and other straightforward stats. PPR (Points Per Reception) Leagues: A format that rewards players for each reception, making wide receivers and running backs more valuable. Dynasty Leagues: In this format, teams are carried over from year to year, creating a long-term strategy for drafting rookies and managing trades. Keeper Leagues: Similar to dynasty leagues but with fewer players retained each year. Why is Fantasy Football So Popular? Fantasy football dominates fantasy sports because it’s both strategic and social. Fans love the challenge of using fantasy draft rankings and predicting fantasy sleepers to outsmart their opponents. Apps like Underdog Fantasy and fantasy football apps make it easy to stay connected, while prizes like a fantasy football trophy add extra motivation. From beginners to experts, fantasy football is a thrilling game that turns fans into active participants. The Appeal of Fantasy Football Fantasy football isn’t just a game—it’s an experience that brings people together and adds excitement to every NFL season. From friendly rivalries to the thrill of managing a team, the appeal of fantasy football lies in its ability to engage fans in unique and meaningful ways. Social Interaction One of the biggest reasons fantasy football is so popular is its social aspect. Whether you’re in a league with friends, family, or colleagues, the competition creates lasting connections. Weekly discussions about fantasy football rankings, trades, and matchups spark friendly debates and fun trash talk. Platforms like Underdog Fantasy and fantasy football apps make it easy to stay in touch, even when players are spread across the country. Hosting live drafts or celebrating a league champion with a fantasy football trophy only adds to the camaraderie. Engagement with Real-Life Football Fantasy football transforms the way fans watch the NFL. Every game, player, and touchdown becomes more exciting because it directly affects your team’s fantasy points. Even games between less popular teams suddenly matter when your players are involved. Keeping up with fantasy football news and monitoring players through apps like Fantasy Life enhances the connection to the sport. This increased interest benefits not only fans but also the NFL, as more people tune in to games each week. Strategic Challenge Fantasy football offers more than just entertainment—it’s a game of strategy. Owners need to manage rosters, navigate injuries, and make critical decisions, like when to start or bench players. Tools like fantasy footballers start sit and fantasy football projections help with these tough choices. Success often depends on spotting fantasy football sleepers or making the right trade at the right time. This strategic aspect keeps the game engaging and rewarding, even for seasoned players. Monetary Incentives For many, the potential to win money adds another layer of excitement. Leagues often feature entry fees and prizes, making the stakes higher and victories sweeter. Platforms like Underdog Fantasy Sports and daily fantasy football competitions offer quick games with cash rewards. Whether it’s a friendly bet or a competitive league, the possibility of earning prizes motivates players to stay involved and aim for the top. Fantasy football combines social fun, love for the NFL, strategy, and rewards—making it irresistible for millions of fans worldwide. Key Components of Fantasy Football Fantasy football is a game of strategy, requiring careful planning and management to succeed. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned player, understanding the key components is essential for a competitive edge. From drafting players to managing the season, every decision can make or break your fantasy season. Let’s break it down step by step. 1. Drafting Players The draft is the foundation of your fantasy football team. This is where you pick players to build your roster, and your decisions here set the tone for the entire season. Draft Types There are two main draft formats: Snake Drafts: In this format, the order reverses each round. If you pick first in Round 1, you’ll pick last in Round 2. Auction Drafts: Players are bid on using a budget, allowing more control to target specific stars or sleepers. Player Rankings and Strategies Before the draft, it’s vital to study fantasy football rankings and identify key players. Star players, like top quarterbacks and wide receivers, are usually picked early. However, identifying fantasy football sleepers can give you a big advantage, as these underrated players often outperform their draft position. Preseason Research Successful drafting requires preparation. Look at fantasy football projections, player stats, and injury reports. Resources like Fantasy Footballers Rankings or tools on fantasy apps like Underdog Fantasy can help you make informed picks. 2. Setting Lineups After the draft, the weekly lineup becomes your focus. Setting the right players each week can determine your success. Matchups matter. A star player facing a tough defense might score fewer fantasy points, while a lesser-known player could thrive against a weaker opponent. Pay attention to bye weeks, as players on bye can’t score for your team. Most leagues include flex positions, allowing flexibility to start running backs, wide receivers, or tight ends. Choosing the right mix of offense and defense is key to maximizing your weekly score. 3. Scoring Systems Understanding your league’s scoring system is crucial, as it affects player values and strategies. Standard Scoring This basic system awards points for yards gained, touchdowns scored, and turnovers. For example, quarterbacks earn points for passing yards, while defenses gain points for interceptions. PPR Scoring In PPR (Points Per Reception) leagues, players earn additional points for each catch. This scoring type makes wide receivers and pass-catching running backs more valuable. Custom Scoring Variations Some leagues introduce unique scoring rules, like bonuses for long touchdowns or penalties for missed field goals. Always review your league’s settings before drafting and setting lineups. 4. Managing the Season The fantasy football season doesn’t end after the draft. Ongoing management is critical to adapting to changes and staying competitive. Trades and Waiver Wire Acquisitions Trades allow you to improve your team by exchanging players with other owners. The waiver wire is where undrafted players can be added to your roster. Monitoring fantasy football news and using tools like fantasy start sit can help you identify the best moves. Navigating Injuries and Underperforming Players Injuries are inevitable, and even top players can underperform. Having depth on your bench and being proactive about replacing injured stars is essential. Look for high-potential players on the waiver wire or consider daily fantasy sports options for short-term fixes. Playoff Formats and Championship Weeks Most leagues feature playoffs, where the top teams compete for the championship. Strategies may change during these weeks, focusing on matchups rather than season-long trends. Winning your league could mean claiming the ultimate prize: a fantasy football trophy or bragging rights. Tools and Resources for Success To excel in fantasy football, utilize the best resources: Fantasy Apps: Platforms like Underdog Fantasy and FTN Fantasy offer real-time updates and tools to optimize your team. Rankings and Projections: Use fantasy football rankings, including dynasty fantasy football rankings or week 1 fantasy rankings, to guide decisions. Expert Advice: Follow podcasts and websites like The Fantasy Footballers for in-depth analysis and strategies. Fantasy football is a dynamic and engaging game that combines strategy, research, and passion for football. Mastering these key components—drafting, setting lineups, understanding scoring, and managing the season—can turn a casual player into a league champion. Whether you aim for the ultimate fantasy trophy or just want to enjoy the camaraderie, fantasy football is a rewarding experience for everyone.

Many fans dabble in other fantasy sports like fantasy baseball or daily fantasy football, but nothing compares to the thrill of topping week 1 fantasy rankings or discovering the season’s best fantasy football sleepers. Ready to dominate your league? Let’s get started! What is Fantasy Football? Fantasy football is a fun and engaging fantasy sport where players act as team managers. The goal is to build the best team by picking real-life football players for your fantasy roster. Each player earns fantasy points based on their real-world performance during NFL games. From casual leagues to intense competitions, fantasy football brings fans closer to the game they love. How Does Fantasy Football Work? Fantasy football begins with a fantasy draft, where participants, called “owners,” select players to form their team. There are different types of drafts, including the traditional snake draft and the auction draft. The draft strategy is key, as owners aim to pick top players using fantasy football rankings or printable fantasy football rankings to guide their choices. Once the draft is complete, team owners set weekly lineups, deciding which players will start and which will sit based on matchups and fantasy football projections. Lineups can include quarterbacks, running backs, wide receivers, tight ends, kickers, and defenses. Points are scored based on player performance, such as yards gained, touchdowns scored, and other stats. During the season, owners manage their teams by trading players, picking up free agents, and using fantasy start sit tools to optimize their lineups. Staying updated on the latest fantasy football news and following resources like The Fantasy Footballers can help owners make informed decisions. Fantasy Football Formats Fantasy football offers a variety of formats to suit different preferences: Standard Leagues: The most basic format, focusing on touchdowns, yards, and other straightforward stats. PPR (Points Per Reception) Leagues: A format that rewards players for each reception, making wide receivers and running backs more valuable. Dynasty Leagues: In this format, teams are carried over from year to year, creating a long-term strategy for drafting rookies and managing trades. Keeper Leagues: Similar to dynasty leagues but with fewer players retained each year. Why is Fantasy Football So Popular? Fantasy football dominates fantasy sports because it’s both strategic and social. Fans love the challenge of using fantasy draft rankings and predicting fantasy sleepers to outsmart their opponents. Apps like Underdog Fantasy and fantasy football apps make it easy to stay connected, while prizes like a fantasy football trophy add extra motivation. From beginners to experts, fantasy football is a thrilling game that turns fans into active participants. The Appeal of Fantasy Football Fantasy football isn’t just a game—it’s an experience that brings people together and adds excitement to every NFL season. From friendly rivalries to the thrill of managing a team, the appeal of fantasy football lies in its ability to engage fans in unique and meaningful ways. Social Interaction One of the biggest reasons fantasy football is so popular is its social aspect. Whether you’re in a league with friends, family, or colleagues, the competition creates lasting connections. Weekly discussions about fantasy football rankings, trades, and matchups spark friendly debates and fun trash talk. Platforms like Underdog Fantasy and fantasy football apps make it easy to stay in touch, even when players are spread across the country. Hosting live drafts or celebrating a league champion with a fantasy football trophy only adds to the camaraderie. Engagement with Real-Life Football Fantasy football transforms the way fans watch the NFL. Every game, player, and touchdown becomes more exciting because it directly affects your team’s fantasy points. Even games between less popular teams suddenly matter when your players are involved. Keeping up with fantasy football news and monitoring players through apps like Fantasy Life enhances the connection to the sport. This increased interest benefits not only fans but also the NFL, as more people tune in to games each week. Strategic Challenge Fantasy football offers more than just entertainment—it’s a game of strategy. Owners need to manage rosters, navigate injuries, and make critical decisions, like when to start or bench players. Tools like fantasy footballers start sit and fantasy football projections help with these tough choices. Success often depends on spotting fantasy football sleepers or making the right trade at the right time. This strategic aspect keeps the game engaging and rewarding, even for seasoned players. Monetary Incentives For many, the potential to win money adds another layer of excitement. Leagues often feature entry fees and prizes, making the stakes higher and victories sweeter. Platforms like Underdog Fantasy Sports and daily fantasy football competitions offer quick games with cash rewards. Whether it’s a friendly bet or a competitive league, the possibility of earning prizes motivates players to stay involved and aim for the top.

Key Components of Fantasy Football Fantasy football is a game of strategy, requiring careful planning and management to succeed. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned player, understanding the key components is essential for a competitive edge. From drafting players to managing the season, every decision can make or break your fantasy season. Let’s break it down step by step. 1. Drafting Players The draft is the foundation of your fantasy football team. This is where you pick players to build your roster, and your decisions here set the tone for the entire season. Draft Types There are two main draft formats: Snake Drafts: In this format, the order reverses each round. If you pick first in Round 1, you’ll pick last in Round 2. Auction Drafts: Players are bid on using a budget, allowing more control to target specific stars or sleepers. Player Rankings and Strategies Before the draft, it’s vital to study fantasy football rankings and identify key players. Star players, like top quarterbacks and wide receivers, are usually picked early. However, identifying fantasy football sleepers can give you a big advantage, as these underrated players often outperform their draft position. Preseason Research Successful drafting requires preparation. Look at fantasy football projections, player stats, and injury reports. Resources like Fantasy Footballers Rankings or tools on fantasy apps like Underdog Fantasy can help you make informed picks. 2. Setting Lineups After the draft, the weekly lineup becomes your focus. Setting the right players each week can determine your success. Matchups matter. A star player facing a tough defense might score fewer fantasy points, while a lesser-known player could thrive against a weaker opponent. Pay attention to bye weeks, as players on bye can’t score for your team. Most leagues include flex positions, allowing flexibility to start running backs, wide receivers, or tight ends. Choosing the right mix of offense and defense is key to maximizing your weekly score. 3. Scoring Systems Understanding your league’s scoring system is crucial, as it affects player values and strategies. Standard Scoring This basic system awards points for yards gained, touchdowns scored, and turnovers. For example, quarterbacks earn points for passing yards, while defenses gain points for interceptions. PPR Scoring In PPR (Points Per Reception) leagues, players earn additional points for each catch. This scoring type makes wide receivers and pass-catching running backs more valuable. Custom Scoring Variations Some leagues introduce unique scoring rules, like bonuses for long touchdowns or penalties for missed field goals. Always review your league’s settings before drafting and setting lineups. 4. Managing the Season The fantasy football season doesn’t end after the draft. Ongoing management is critical to adapting to changes and staying competitive. Trades and Waiver Wire Acquisitions Trades allow you to improve your team by exchanging players with other owners. The waiver wire is where undrafted players can be added to your roster. Monitoring fantasy football news and using tools like fantasy start sit can help you identify the best moves. Navigating Injuries and Underperforming Players Injuries are inevitable, and even top players can underperform. Having depth on your bench and being proactive about replacing injured stars is essential. Look for high-potential players on the waiver wire or consider daily fantasy sports options for short-term fixes. Playoff Formats and Championship Weeks Most leagues feature playoffs, where the top teams compete for the championship. Strategies may change during these weeks, focusing on matchups rather than season-long trends. Winning your league could mean claiming the ultimate prize: a fantasy football trophy or bragging rights. Tools and Resources for Success To excel in fantasy football, utilize the best resources: Fantasy Apps: Platforms like Underdog Fantasy and FTN Fantasy offer real-time updates and tools to optimize your team. Rankings and Projections: Use fantasy football rankings, including dynasty fantasy football rankings or week 1 fantasy rankings, to guide decisions. Expert Advice: Follow podcasts and websites like The Fantasy Footballers for in-depth analysis and strategies. Fantasy football is a dynamic and engaging game that combines strategy, research, and passion for football. Mastering these key components—drafting, setting lineups, understanding scoring, and managing the season—can turn a casual player into a league champion. Whether you aim for the ultimate fantasy trophy or just want to enjoy the camaraderie, fantasy football is a rewarding experience for everyone.

As the NFL grows to a nearly $13 billion business, fantasy football has soared in popularity. BI spoke with expert analysts Nick Zylak and Liz Loza about the top tips for building a team. They recommended looking at your league's scoring format and focusing on high-ceiling players early. As the NFL prepares to kick off the regular season on September 5, fans are already rejoicing with the return of one of the season's favorite pastimes: fantasy. According to the Fantasy Sports and Gaming Association, 79% of fantasy players are involved in fantasy football, and the total number of fantasy sports players across the US and Canada in 2022 totaled upward of 60 million. As fans draft their fantasy squads for the 2024 season, Business Insider spoke with Fantasy Football Advice founder Nick Zylak and ESPN fantasy sports analyst Liz Loza to learn the top tips for building a fantasy football team. Whether you're a beginner or your league's reigning champion, here's everything you need to know. Before you think about players, remember to consider your league's scoring format. Christian McCaffrey is one of the best running backs in the league. Ryan Kang/Contributor/Getty Images \"A lot of people don't pay full attention to the scoring format, and if their league is different from normal,\" Zylak said. A common league scoring format is PPR, which stands for \"point per reception.\" In this type of league, each player in your starting lineup receives 1 point for every catch they make, as well as points for other factors like yardage (0.1 points per yard) and touchdowns. For example, if Christian McCaffrey were to catch 5 passes for 42 yards and rush for 80 yards, his total fantasy points in a PPR league would be equivalent to 5 (PPR points) + 4.2 + 8, so 17.2 points. Other league scoring formats include half-PPR (which awards 0.5 points per reception) and Standard/non-PPR (which doesn't award any points for receptions). Each league has specific rules and point allotments for things like scoring, fumbles, interceptions, etc. so make sure to research your league's rules to understand what players will best maximize your point potential. Then make a draft strategy. Wide receivers and running backs are valuable in PPR leagues. Carmen Mandato/Staff/Getty Images Zylak told BI that the best teams this year are taking running backs early and wide receivers in the middle rounds of the draft. \"And then, ideally, you probably want a top seven tight end, because there's a really good group of tight ends,\" he added. \"It doesn't really matter which one you get, just getting one of them, and then probably a top 11 quarterback.\" While you don't have to stick to a formula, it's helpful to at least have a plan. That way, you're not overwhelmed with choices when you're on the clock. When determining your draft strategy, Loza also recommended considering who you're drafting with. \"Is there a person who's a giant Buffalo Bills fan? If so, then you should probably anticipate that Josh Allen is going to get drafted earlier than the ADP, which stands for average draft position, right? Or [drafted] ahead of the rankings, the ESPN consensus rankings that one may be using as a guide,\" Loza said. This way, you can set more realistic expectations and strategies for both positions and players before your draft. While drafting, don't be afraid to hit the upside early. Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson has a high talent ceiling. Andy Lyons/Staff/Getty Images The NFL has an incredible amount of depth, particularly on offense, so Loza recommends using that to your advantage by going for players with high ceilings during the first half of your draft. One high-ceiling player she said to look out for is Anthony Richardson. The 22-year-old quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts didn't play much during his rookie season due to injuries. \"However, his upside, the potential that he could produce, is wild,\" Loza said. \"So, I often get like, 'Why would you want to take Anthony Richardson?' And my answer is like, well, there is a 100% injury rate in the NFL, but not 100% of the players in the NFL present with Richardson's ceiling.\" She continued, \"He averaged 18 fantasy points per game and 49% of those points came via his legs. And in fantasy, rushing, mobile quarterbacks are great because of the numbers they put up.\" So, you can afford to take a risk on a high-ceiling player in the beginning, knowing that the league's incredible depth will provide you with more tried-and-true, dependable players in the later rounds. Remember volume is king. Derrick Henry led the league in carries last season for the Tennessee Titans. This year, he'll be playing for the Baltimore Ravens. Wesley Hitt/Contributor/Getty Images \"The more times a player touches the ball, the more opportunities that player has to put up points. So volume is always king,\" Loza said. This is particularly relevant for running backs — those with higher fantasy value are the players who consistently get an opportunity to run the ball, which is why you'll see them go in the first round of the draft. However, she cautioned that the worry is if one of those players gets hurt, finding a replacement of equal value becomes much harder. Don't stack pass catchers from the same team. Stefon Diggs joins Nico Collins, Tank Dell, and Joe Mixon in Houston this season. Perry Knotts/Contributor/Getty Images Traditionally, \"stacking\" refers to taking a quarterback and a pass catcher from the same team, like a Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce duo, so you can maximize your points. What you want to avoid, though, is stacking two pass catchers from the same team, analysts told BI. \"I don't like to take two pass catchers from the same team because I think again, the volume is dipped,\" Loza said, offering the Houston Texans as an example. With Nico Collins, Stefon Diggs, Tank Dell, and Joe Mixon all competing for touches, Loza said it's an offense \"you want a piece of,\" but if you were to take Tank Dell and Nico Collins, you could miss out \"on a receiver who might not be part of as efficient an offense, but would see more targets.\" \"The targets don't always have to be pretty to be productive,\" she added. Defenses don't win championships in fantasy — and neither do kickers. Unlike in the league, Loza said defenses don't win championships in fantasy. Ryan Kang/Contributor/Getty Images Both Zylak and Loza said you shouldn't pick a defense and a kicker until the last two rounds of the draft. Otherwise, you're just wasting valuable picks. Speaking of value, focus on what's in front of you and remember not to panic. If you notice people are all starting to draft one position, don't panic and rush to do the same. Candice Ward/Contributor/Getty Images Starting a positional run is always better than ending one, according to Loza. \"So if quarterbacks start coming off the board, do not panic and say like, 'Oh my god, if I don't take a quarterback now, the one I want is gonna be gone,'\" she said. \"He may be, but also, you want to zig when everyone else is zagging because you want to take full advantage of the value in front of you at every time.\" Context is key, so don't focus too much on what happened in previous seasons. Aaron Rodgers is set to return from a season-ending Achilles injury. Perry Knotts/Contributor/Getty Images Take a look at Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Drake London. At first glance, the 23-year-old may not seem like an obvious choice. He averaged 6.1 fantasy points per game last season, and just 5.8 the season prior, according to CBS Sports. However, one could argue that London was undervalued in former head coach Arthur Smith's run-heavy system. But now that the Falcons are being led by Raheem Morris and veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins, London's chances of becoming a breakout star have significantly increased. He's the 14th-ranked wide receiver in ESPN's current fantasy rankings compared to the 30th-ranked choice a year ago. Not all changes are as big as a coaching change, though. \"There are little wrinkles, and you're like, 'Hmm, how much is this fourth-round rookie really going to affect this offense?'\" Loza said, adding, \"You kind of have to gauge it.\" You don't have to be super focused on statistics if you don't want to be. Instead, you can use existing rankings to help judge the strength of your choices. CeeDee Lamb of the Dallas Cowboys is ESPN's highest-rated wide receiver for fantasy this season. Michael Owens/Contributor/Getty Images \"Don't let the weeds of the stats bring you down,\" Loza said. \"You're allowed to just root for the players that you're excited about.\" So if there's a player that's amazing strategically, but isn't someone you feel like rooting for every week, just don't draft them — that's the benefit of the league having such depth. And with all those options, Loza encourages everyone to use the rankings available. \"Me and my colleagues do not spend all of this time to make rankings so that you can't use 'em,\" she said. So, if someone has caught your eye, check the rankings to ensure you draft them at an appropriate time. \"If you are someone who's like, 'Oh, I know Player X is a really good player and they're fun and I'm into them,' then look where they are on the rankings, like maybe they're wide receiver 30, and then see who else in that range is going and circle them,\" Loza said. \"Just be like, 'OK, when we get to this general part of the draft, I'm going to get that guy.'\" This way, you won't pass up on valuable talent in an effort to pick them. Don't give up if your season starts off slow — and remember to have fun. Zylak advises players not to feel defeated if their team doesn't perform well initially. Courtney Culbreath/Stringer/Getty Images Building a fantasy team extends beyond the initial draft, so Zylak advises players not to feel discouraged if they don't start the season with a winning record. \"Like, really, all you have to do is make the playoffs. It doesn't really matter what your seeding is,\" he said. \"And in most leagues, either half or like 40% of people make playoffs, so as long as you can squeak in — even if you start one and four — like look for trades, look for the waiver wire, because you just got to squeak into the playoffs, then anything can happen.\" And as cheesy as it may sound, remember to have fun. \"This is a secondary experience that only enriches the primary experience of watching football on Sundays,\" Loza said.

Scott Taetsch/Stringer/Getty Images This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in. As the NFL grows to a nearly $13 billion business, fantasy football has soared in popularity. BI spoke with expert analysts Nick Zylak and Liz Loza about the top tips for building a team. They recommended looking at your league's scoring format and focusing on high-ceiling players early. As the NFL prepares to kick off the regular season on September 5, fans are already rejoicing with the return of one of the season's favorite pastimes: fantasy. According to the Fantasy Sports and Gaming Association, 79% of fantasy players are involved in fantasy football, and the total number of fantasy sports players across the US and Canada in 2022 totaled upward of 60 million. As fans draft their fantasy squads for the 2024 season, Business Insider spoke with Fantasy Football Advice founder Nick Zylak and ESPN fantasy sports analyst Liz Loza to learn the top tips for building a fantasy football team. Whether you're a beginner or your league's reigning champion, here's everything you need to know. Before you think about players, remember to consider your league's scoring format. Christian McCaffrey is one of the best running backs in the league. Ryan Kang/Contributor/Getty Images \"A lot of people don't pay full attention to the scoring format, and if their league is different from normal,\" Zylak said. A common league scoring format is PPR, which stands for \"point per reception.\" In this type of league, each player in your starting lineup receives 1 point for every catch they make, as well as points for other factors like yardage (0.1 points per yard) and touchdowns. For example, if Christian McCaffrey were to catch 5 passes for 42 yards and rush for 80 yards, his total fantasy points in a PPR league would be equivalent to 5 (PPR points) + 4.2 + 8, so 17.2 points. Other league scoring formats include half-PPR (which awards 0.5 points per reception) and Standard/non-PPR (which doesn't award any points for receptions). Each league has specific rules and point allotments for things like scoring, fumbles, interceptions, etc. so make sure to research your league's rules to understand what players will best maximize your point potential. Then make a draft strategy. Wide receivers and running backs are valuable in PPR leagues. Carmen Mandato/Staff/Getty Images Zylak told BI that the best teams this year are taking running backs early and wide receivers in the middle rounds of the draft. \"And then, ideally, you probably want a top seven tight end, because there's a really good group of tight ends,\" he added. \"It doesn't really matter which one you get, just getting one of them, and then probably a top 11 quarterback.\" While you don't have to stick to a formula, it's helpful to at least have a plan. That way, you're not overwhelmed with choices when you're on the clock. When determining your draft strategy, Loza also recommended considering who you're drafting with. \"Is there a person who's a giant Buffalo Bills fan? If so, then you should probably anticipate that Josh Allen is going to get drafted earlier than the ADP, which stands for average draft position, right? Or [drafted] ahead of the rankings, the ESPN consensus rankings that one may be using as a guide,\" Loza said. This way, you can set more realistic expectations and strategies for both positions and players before your draft. While drafting, don't be afraid to hit the upside early. Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson has a high talent ceiling. Andy Lyons/Staff/Getty Images The NFL has an incredible amount of depth, particularly on offense, so Loza recommends using that to your advantage by going for players with high ceilings during the first half of your draft. One high-ceiling player she said to look out for is Anthony Richardson. The 22-year-old quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts didn't play much during his rookie season due to injuries. \"However, his upside, the potential that he could produce, is wild,\" Loza said. \"So, I often get like, 'Why would you want to take Anthony Richardson?' And my answer is like, well, there is a 100% injury rate in the NFL, but not 100% of the players in the NFL present with Richardson's ceiling.\" She continued, \"He averaged 18 fantasy points per game and 49% of those points came via his legs. And in fantasy, rushing, mobile quarterbacks are great because of the numbers they put up.\" So, you can afford to take a risk on a high-ceiling player in the beginning, knowing that the league's incredible depth will provide you with more tried-and-true, dependable players in the later rounds. Remember volume is king. Derrick Henry led the league in carries last season for the Tennessee Titans. This year, he'll be playing for the Baltimore Ravens. Wesley Hitt/Contributor/Getty Images \"The more times a player touches the ball, the more opportunities that player has to put up points. So volume is always king,\" Loza said. This is particularly relevant for running backs — those with higher fantasy value are the players who consistently get an opportunity to run the ball, which is why you'll see them go in the first round of the draft. However, she cautioned that the worry is if one of those players gets hurt, finding a replacement of equal value becomes much harder. Don't stack pass catchers from the same team. Stefon Diggs joins Nico Collins, Tank Dell, and Joe Mixon in Houston this season. Perry Knotts/Contributor/Getty Images Traditionally, \"stacking\" refers to taking a quarterback and a pass catcher from the same team, like a Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce duo, so you can maximize your points. What you want to avoid, though, is stacking two pass catchers from the same team, analysts told BI. \"I don't like to take two pass catchers from the same team because I think again, the volume is dipped,\" Loza said, offering the Houston Texans as an example. With Nico Collins, Stefon Diggs, Tank Dell, and Joe Mixon all competing for touches, Loza said it's an offense \"you want a piece of,\" but if you were to take Tank Dell and Nico Collins, you could miss out \"on a receiver who might not be part of as efficient an offense, but would see more targets.\" \"The targets don't always have to be pretty to be productive,\" she added. Defenses don't win championships in fantasy — and neither do kickers. Unlike in the league, Loza said defenses don't win championships in fantasy. Ryan Kang/Contributor/Getty Images Both Zylak and Loza said you shouldn't pick a defense and a kicker until the last two rounds of the draft. Otherwise, you're just wasting valuable picks. Speaking of value, focus on what's in front of you and remember not to panic. If you notice people are all starting to draft one position, don't panic and rush to do the same. Candice Ward/Contributor/Getty Images Starting a positional run is always better than ending one, according to Loza. \"So if quarterbacks start coming off the board, do not panic and say like, 'Oh my god, if I don't take a quarterback now, the one I want is gonna be gone,'\" she said. \"He may be, but also, you want to zig when everyone else is zagging because you want to take full advantage of the value in front of you at every time.\" Context is key, so don't focus too much on what happened in previous seasons. Aaron Rodgers is set to return from a season-ending Achilles injury. Perry Knotts/Contributor/Getty Images Take a look at Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Drake London. At first glance, the 23-year-old may not seem like an obvious choice. He averaged 6.1 fantasy points per game last season, and just 5.8 the season prior, according to CBS Sports.

He's the 14th-ranked wide receiver in ESPN's current fantasy rankings compared to the 30th-ranked choice a year ago. Not all changes are as big as a coaching change, though. \"There are little wrinkles, and you're like, 'Hmm, how much is this fourth-round rookie really going to affect this offense?'\" Loza said, adding, \"You kind of have to gauge it.\" You don't have to be super focused on statistics if you don't want to be.
