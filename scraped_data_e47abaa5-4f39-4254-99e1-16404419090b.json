Keep both catalogue and non-catalogue products priced competitively without constant attention. Book a demo Trusted by more than 4,200 sellers across 13 Amazon and eBay channels Finally, an eBay repricer tool done right Unlike other eBay repricing solutions, RepricerExpress supports competition-based rules and formula-based rules—so you can reprice both your catalogue and non-catalogue products. Competition-based rules These will alter your eBay price (for Buy It Nows only) by analysing competitors selling the same catalogue items on eBay (using Barcode, EAN or UPC to match products). Competitors listed above or below your minimum/maximum prices would be ignored. You can also choose to filter out competitors using inventory quantity, feedback rating, country, Top-rated Seller status etc. You can have different competition rules for different types of products—and can choose to beat, match or price above your competitors as required. Typical examples: Formula-based rules These will alter your eBay price (for Buy It Nows only) using a price calculation which you can base on your Min Price (could be cost price or cost plus fees etc.), your Max Price or Amazon prices (using any Amazon channel you are subscribed to). You can have different formulae for different types of products. If the price you have based your rule on (e.g. Min Price, Amazon UK price etc.) changes—then the formula rule re-adjusts to calculate a new price and keep your eBay listings super competitive 24/7. Typical examples: N.B. All products can be repriced using formula-based rules. RepricerExpress is a proud member of the eBay Developers Program.

Book a demo Trusted by more than 4,200 sellers across 13 Amazon and eBay channels Finally, an eBay repricer tool done right Unlike other eBay repricing solutions, RepricerExpress supports competition-based rules and formula-based rules—so you can reprice both your catalogue and non-catalogue products. Competition-based rules These will alter your eBay price (for Buy It Nows only) by analysing competitors selling the same catalogue items on eBay (using Barcode, EAN or UPC to match products). Competitors listed above or below your minimum/maximum prices would be ignored. You can also choose to filter out competitors using inventory quantity, feedback rating, country, Top-rated Seller status etc. You can have different competition rules for different types of products—and can choose to beat, match or price above your competitors as required. Typical examples: Formula-based rules These will alter your eBay price (for Buy It Nows only) using a price calculation which you can base on your Min Price (could be cost price or cost plus fees etc.), your Max Price or Amazon prices (using any Amazon channel you are subscribed to). You can have different formulae for different types of products. If the price you have based your rule on (e.g. Min Price, Amazon UK price etc.) changes—then the formula rule re-adjusts to calculate a new price and keep your eBay listings super competitive 24/7. Typical examples: N.B. All products can be repriced using formula-based rules. RepricerExpress is a proud member of the eBay Developers Program.

But like most eCommerce software, eBay product research tools have their fair share of pros and cons. It’s best to know them before investing in any particular tool. Pros Streamlines Product Research Tasks With an eBay product research tool, you don’t have to spend hours combing through eBay listings. All you need to do is enter a keyword or product name, and all the relevant information you need will be displayed on your screen. Some tools even give you supplier options to help source your products without additional research. Minimizes Risk Although running a business always involves risks, product research can minimize them. You can turn any market situation to your advantage when you know which product to sell and when. If you want to expand your catalog, rebrand, or tap into a new market, product research will ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks, maximizing your chances of success. Increases Sales eBay product research tools can tell you what your target audience needs and wants. You can also stay updated on trends and tailor your product ideas and marketing strategies based on these. Some tools even show customer feedback, giving you opportunities to improve a trending product based on the weaknesses you identify. As a result, you can sell a product with greater value and draw more revenue. Cons Expensive An eBay product research tool can be expensive, especially if you’ve just begun your business. But you can find a tool that doesn’t break the bank by focusing on options with flexible pricing plans. Several tools have scalable features, so you only have to pay more when your business grows. Not Enough Features With numerous eBay product research tools in the market, comparing options and eventually choosing one can take some time. However, rushing the process can result in selecting a tool that does not have the features your business needs. It’s crucial to take the time to research and compare different tools based on their features, pricing, and compatibility with your business model before making a final decision. Now that we’ve explained the pros and cons of eBay product research tools, let’s discuss the features you should look for to ensure that you’ll end up with the tool best suited for your business. Features to Look For in an eBay Product Research Tool The features you should look for in an eBay product research tool depend on different factors, such as the size of your business, model, and budget. As a new eBay seller, you may benefit most from simplified reports and analytics, competitor analysis, keyword research tools, listing builders, and a user-friendly dashboard. In that case, Terapeak could be the best eBay product research tool for you. It's free for Basic, Premium, Anchor, and Enterprise eBay Store subscribers. If you want to use Terapeak Sourcing Insights, it only costs $12 a month for Starter Store subscribers. ZIK Analytics and ShelfTrend may also suit new eBay sellers and medium-sized businesses. ZIK Analytics has affordable paid plans for businesses of any size, while ShelfTrend has scalable plans for every type of eBay seller. If you’re an eBay dropshipper, AutoDS and SaleHoo are specifically designed for your business model. Their features aid in supplier selection, product category search, store configurations, and trend monitoring, helping your dropshipping business take off successfully. Lastly, advanced features such as competitor analysis, profit and ROI estimation, forecasting, and Business Intelligence reports may greatly benefit large businesses. Although these eBay product research tools can be expensive, their capabilities extend beyond product research and play a crucial role in business success. Wrapping Up Selling on eBay has significant advantages, such as low startup costs and access to a wide audience. However, you'll also be competing against billions of listings, so standing out can take considerable effort. By using the right eBay product research tool, you can focus on profitable product ideas, tap into opportunity-rich niches, keep up with trends, and stay ahead of the competition. These tools can also grow with your business, providing scalable features and enabling you to achieve consistent and long-term success on eBay.

It’s advisable to start with a basic plan to familiarize yourself with the tool’s capabilities and gradually upgrade as you grow more comfortable and require more advanced features. Factors to Consider When Using Amazon Sellers Tools Understanding Your Specific Needs Business Size and Volume: Are you a small seller just starting out, or do you manage a larger inventory with significant sales volume? Tools like Helium 10 might be perfect for larger setups due to their extensive features, while something simpler like AMZ Scout could suit new entrants. Budget Constraints: While investing in good tools is vital, it’s important to align their costs with your budget. Evaluate whether the higher-priced options offer must-have features that justify their cost, or if a more budget-friendly tool can meet your needs effectively. Integration and Compatibility Seamless Integration: Check how well the tool integrates with your existing systems. A tool that syncs smoothly with your Amazon seller account and other platforms (like your eCommerce website or a third-party logistics provider) can save you a lot of hassle. Platform Compatibility: Make sure the tool works well with the specific Amazon marketplaces you sell in. Some tools might offer specialized features for North America but lack support for other regions like Europe or Asia. Features and Scalability Comprehensive Features: Does the tool cover all the areas you need help with? For instance, if you struggle with inventory management, a tool like Inventory Lab that offers detailed tracking and management features might be ideal. Scalability: As your business grows, your needs will change. Opt for tools that can scale with your business, offering more advanced features as you need them without switching to a new platform. Usability and Support User-Friendliness: A tool could have all the bells and whistles, but if it’s not user-friendly, you’ll end up wasting time and energy trying to figure it out. Look for tools with intuitive interfaces and good user experience ratings. Customer Support: The availability of responsive and helpful customer support is crucial. Tools like FeedbackWhiz that offer proactive support can enhance your experience, ensuring you get the most out of your investment. Data Security and Compliance Data Security: Since these tools will handle sensitive data related to your sales, inventory, and customers, ensure they follow stringent security protocols to protect your information. Compliance: Make sure that the tool complies with all relevant laws and Amazon’s policies. Non-compliance could lead to penalties or even suspension from the Amazon marketplace. Analytics and Reporting In-depth Analytics: Tools that offer detailed analytics can help you understand your market better and tailor your strategies accordingly. Look for tools that provide actionable insights, not just raw data. Customizable Reports: The ability to customize reports to see exactly what you need, when you need it, can make a big difference. This allows you to focus on key metrics that are crucial for your business’s growth. Reviews and Community Feedback Peer Reviews: Before committing, check out reviews from other sellers. How have they benefited from the tool? Are there any recurring complaints? Community and Forums: Some tools have active communities and forums where users share tips and advice. These can be invaluable resources for troubleshooting and learning how to make the most of the tool. Choosing the right Amazon Seller Tools isn’t just about buying into the best features; it’s about finding the right fit for your business model, budget, and future growth. Take your time, do your homework, and pick tools that will not only solve your immediate problems but will also grow your business. Happy selling!

It stands out as a critical tool for Amazon sellers who are keen on making informed decisions based on comprehensive data analysis. With its robust product database, detailed historical data analysis, and unique niche score system, AMZ Scout arms sellers with the necessary insights to uncover profitable opportunities in less saturated markets. Understanding AMZ Scout’s Features AMZ Scout provides a plethora of tools designed to maximize your Amazon selling experience: Product Database: Access a vast library of products to discover items that align with your business goals. Whether you’re looking for products with low competition, high demand, or both, the product database offers filters and metrics that help you narrow down your search effectively. Historical Data Analysis: This feature allows you to look back at price trends, sales volumes, and seasonal impacts on any given product. Understanding how products have performed over time can help you predict future trends and make smarter stocking decisions. Niche Score: This is calculated by analyzing a niche’s demand, competition, and potential profit. A high niche score indicates a lucrative opportunity with less competition, making it easier for new sellers to enter the market or for established sellers to expand their product lines. How to Use? To harness the power of AMZ Scout effectively: Start with the Product Database: Input criteria that match your business model and goals. Are you seeking products under a specific price? Do you prefer items with a certain level of monthly sales? Adjust the filters to tailor your search to your needs. Analyze Historical Data: Select a few products that catch your interest. Dive into their historical data to see how they have performed during different seasons, during sales or promotional periods, and across various market changes. This data can guide when to launch or ramp up your marketing efforts for specific products. Evaluate Niche Scores: Focus on products within niches with high scores. These are the goldmines with ample demand and manageable competition, often overlooked by the majority of sellers. Pros: Data-Rich Insights: Provides sellers with deep dives into market dynamics, offering a competitive edge. User-Friendly Interface: Even with the vast amount of data available, navigating through AMZ Scout’s platform is intuitive and straightforward. Strategic Product Selection: Helps in identifying products with the best balance of demand, competition, and profitability. Cons: Information Overload: The sheer amount of data available can be overwhelming, especially for new sellers who might find it challenging to discern what’s most relevant. Cost Factor: While it starts at $29.99/month, full access to all features can be more expensive, which might be a consideration for those on a tight budget. Pricing and Suggestions for Sellers Starting at $29.99 per month, AMZ Scout offers various pricing tiers that cater to different levels of user needs—from those just starting to seasoned sellers looking to expand further. It’s advisable to start with a basic plan to familiarize yourself with the tool’s capabilities and gradually upgrade as you grow more comfortable and require more advanced features. Factors to Consider When Using Amazon Sellers Tools Understanding Your Specific Needs Business Size and Volume: Are you a small seller just starting out, or do you manage a larger inventory with significant sales volume? Tools like Helium 10 might be perfect for larger setups due to their extensive features, while something simpler like AMZ Scout could suit new entrants. Budget Constraints: While investing in good tools is vital, it’s important to align their costs with your budget. Evaluate whether the higher-priced options offer must-have features that justify their cost, or if a more budget-friendly tool can meet your needs effectively. Integration and Compatibility Seamless Integration: Check how well the tool integrates with your existing systems. A tool that syncs smoothly with your Amazon seller account and other platforms (like your eCommerce website or a third-party logistics provider) can save you a lot of hassle. Platform Compatibility: Make sure the tool works well with the specific Amazon marketplaces you sell in. Some tools might offer specialized features for North America but lack support for other regions like Europe or Asia. Features and Scalability Comprehensive Features: Does the tool cover all the areas you need help with? For instance, if you struggle with inventory management, a tool like Inventory Lab that offers detailed tracking and management features might be ideal. Scalability: As your business grows, your needs will change. Opt for tools that can scale with your business, offering more advanced features as you need them without switching to a new platform. Usability and Support User-Friendliness: A tool could have all the bells and whistles, but if it’s not user-friendly, you’ll end up wasting time and energy trying to figure it out. Look for tools with intuitive interfaces and good user experience ratings. Customer Support: The availability of responsive and helpful customer support is crucial. Tools like FeedbackWhiz that offer proactive support can enhance your experience, ensuring you get the most out of your investment. Data Security and Compliance Data Security: Since these tools will handle sensitive data related to your sales, inventory, and customers, ensure they follow stringent security protocols to protect your information. Compliance: Make sure that the tool complies with all relevant laws and Amazon’s policies. Non-compliance could lead to penalties or even suspension from the Amazon marketplace. Analytics and Reporting In-depth Analytics: Tools that offer detailed analytics can help you understand your market better and tailor your strategies accordingly. Look for tools that provide actionable insights, not just raw data. Customizable Reports: The ability to customize reports to see exactly what you need, when you need it, can make a big difference. This allows you to focus on key metrics that are crucial for your business’s growth. Reviews and Community Feedback Peer Reviews: Before committing, check out reviews from other sellers. How have they benefited from the tool? Are there any recurring complaints? Community and Forums: Some tools have active communities and forums where users share tips and advice. These can be invaluable resources for troubleshooting and learning how to make the most of the tool. Choosing the right Amazon Seller Tools isn’t just about buying into the best features; it’s about finding the right fit for your business model, budget, and future growth. Take your time, do your homework, and pick tools that will not only solve your immediate problems but will also grow your business. Happy selling!

How to choose an Amazon PPC tool With so many Amazon advertising tools on the market, it can be hard to know which one is right for your business. When making your choice, you should keep on four key aspects: 1. Features First and foremost, it all comes down to what the tool can do. Features to keep an eye out for are: Detailed Reporting: In-depth analytics are crucial for optimizing Amazon PPC campaigns, and the best tools will clearly display this information within their dashboard to avoid having to go into Seller Central. Campaign Creation: A good Amazon PPC strategy involves creating a range of different campaign types and tools that can automate the creation of these campaigns can save a lot of time. Bid Optimization: Having the ability to set up rules and automations is a huge part of how Amazon PPC software can help optimize and scale your advertising efforts. Aim to find tools that allow you to set parameters for metrics like ACOS and adjust bids accordingly. Keyword Harvesting: Being able to automate the negating and promoting of keywords amongst campaigns can really help with keyword and campaign management while saving a ton of time. 2. Ease of use Next, you also want to look for tools that aren’t overly difficult to use. Amazon PPC can be complex, so the tools you use won’t always be the simplest. However the best tools will overcome some of that complexity with a good user interface and well laid out functionality. 3. Value for money Any marketing spend in your Amazon business needs to have a return on investment, and tools should be considered just that—an investment, rather than simply an expense. However, you need to ensure you’re getting maximum value for your money, so you should weigh up the costs against the benefits. Different tools price in different ways, most commonly: A percentage of ad spend A fixed fee A combination of the above For example, tools like PPC Entourage and Teikametrics price on a percentage of ad spend. PPC Entourage is particularly good value for money for lower ad spend (under $5k/month) as there is no minimum monthly fee. Tools like Quartile, Sellerboard, and Kinetic have a fixed fee pricing model. Some (like Sellerboard and Kinetic) remain fixed regardless of ad spend, whereas others like Quartile will move up in tiers based on your monthly ad spend. Finally, tools like Adtomic by Helium 10 have a fixed base-level price and a fee based on a percentage of ad spend (this only applies to over $10k/monthly ad spend with Helium 10). However, our top pick, Scale Insights, has a unique pricing model in that it charges by ASINs automated. You can automate up to 5 ASINs for just $78/month (or $70/month with the 10% discount they kindly offer our readers), regardless of ad spend. This is especially good value for sellers with high volume products… …but really provides what we feel is the best bang for the buck in the industry, regardless of the size of your business. 4. Support Finally, the support a tool offers can be a make-or-break factor. Each of the top tools we’ve tested and recommended offers email support and detailed tutorials to make sure you get the hang of things quickly. Once again though, Scale Insights does stand out from its competitors with its very active Facebook group. What makes the group unique is how active the creators of the tool are. Given they are 8 and 9-figure Amazon sellers themselves, it’s invaluable support. Amazon PPC Software FAQs What is Amazon PPC management software? Amazon PPC management software tools are programs developed to save users time by automating otherwise cumbersome tasks like pulling spreadsheets, applying keyword bid adjustments, and creating new Amazon advertising PPC campaigns. How did you choose the best Amazon PPC tools for this list? We compiled this list using: Personal experience: All of our reviews and roundups of the best Amazon seller tools are written by humans who’ve spent much of their eCommerce journey using and testing various software tools. We spend hours every week using and testing tools for our own businesses and this helps us form opinions on what works well. Community feedback: We also source opinions from our large community of Amazon sellers and eCommerce operators to make sure there is a full range of opinions on different Amazon PPC analysis tools. Expert insight: We regularly interview industry experts on our podcast and for our articles, and often asked what tools they are using and recommend. Some links within our content may be affiliate links, whereby if you make a purchase after clicking we might earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. This does not affect our reviews as we only ever recommend products we know and approve of. What free Amazon PPC software tools are available? Most Amazon PPC software and tools will require a paid subscription to let you start managing advertising campaigns. However many offer free trials. The most generous free trial is offered by Scale Insights which includes full, unlimited access for 30 days with no credit card required. Find out more here. Is Amazon advertising AI reliable? Amazon advertising PPC AI is a subject that gets a lot of debate. Some will say it’s worthwhile, some will say you’re better off manually carrying out Amazon advertising bulk operations. The reality is, the AI being used by Amazon Sponsored Ads management tools is relatively simplistic using ‘if this then that’ rule-sets. For example, if ACOS hits 40%, then reduce bids by 10%. The key is the time-saving you can gain by letting AI run this to automate Amazon advertising rather than it taking up a lot of human time. Can you do Amazon PPC yourself? Yes, you can manage Amazon PPC campaigns without a tool. You can access search term reports in Seller Central to analyze your data and then make the necessary bid and keyword adjustments manually in Campaign Manager. However, most growing Amazon sellers find an Amazon product ads management tool speeds up their workflow helping them save time and grow PPC sales. How do I succeed with Amazon PPC? Of course, Amazon Ads software can help with growing sales, but succeeding with Amazon PPC is also about learning the fundamentals and staying consistent in applying them week in and week out. There are no secret hacks, just consistent good practices like listing optimization, keyword research and campaign management. If you’d like more guidance, check out our step-by-step PPC course. What is the best Amazon advertising software? There’s no ‘one size fits all’ solution when it comes to Amazon PPC tools, and choosing the best Amazon PPC management software option for your business very much depends on two factors: Budget: Ideally, you don’t want to be spending more than 5-10% of your ad spend on a PPC optimization tool or service. Goals: Are you looking for simple reporting? Advanced automations? Full account management? Depending on the above, our best recommendations are: Scale Insights (top pick) for most sellers looking for advanced rule-based automation and optimized campaign creation PPC Entourage for budget-conscious sellers looking for advanced features with flexible pricing Adtomic for existing Helium 10 users looking for maximum value from their subscription Quartile for large brands and agencies looking for high-level automation and scalability We hope you’ve found this review of the best Amazon PPC tools helpful in finding the best Amazon PPC software for your business.

Its performance insights, campaign creation, and automation rules can help users save a lot of time and money. My current Amazon PPC tool of choice and one of the fastest-growing tools in the space for a reason. It gives sellers powerful optimization and automation features at a very attractive price point. There is a higher learning curve than with some other tools, but the payoff is worth it. The team is also rolling out high-quality courses included in your membership to teach you how to get the most out of the software.

You can also create single keyword campaigns in bulk, which saves time on that particular strategy. Pros & Cons Time-saving automation rules Pre-optimized quick-start campaigns Detailed reporting for granular insight High-quality support and tutorials 30-day free trial Steep-ish initial learning curve Pricing Options SKU-based pricing will be cost-efficient for many brands, particularly those with a low SKU count and high volume. However, brands with high SKU counts can hand-pick SKUs for automation to keep costs down. 30-day free trial (no credit card needed) Plans start at $78/month for 5 automated ASINs Special offer: Save 10% with our exclusive discount Full Review Try Scale Insights 2.

Adtomic ----------- Overall 4.7 Best for Helium 10 users Starting from $199/month Promotion Save 20% Quick Verdict Helium 10 — arguably the leading suite of Amazon seller tools — includes in your subscription Adtomic, a powerful Amazon PPC automation software. It provides a very slick user interface and allows you to analyze PPC performance, create keyword bidding and harvesting rules, and apply rules either with automation or manually to give you a little more control and insight. The main downside of Adtomic is the extra cost on top of your Helium 10 subscription which means it will most appeal to sellers looking to keep everything in one place and avoid multiple tool subscriptions.

Kinetic ----------- Overall 4.5 Best for Viral Launch users Starting from $199/month Promotion Free Trial Quick Verdict Kinetic is a solid tool with all the functionality you’d expect at its price point. Its easy-to-create rules allow you to pick which recurring actions you want the tool to perform to keep your ads profitable. You can tweak existing templates or create your own rules, so you know exactly what’s happening and aren’t tied to cookie-cutter setups.

Sellerboard --------------- Overall 4.5 Best for Low budgets Starting from $15/month Promotion Free Trial Quick Verdict Sellerboard’s main offering is a powerful profits dashboard, but it also features Amazon PPC software with some automation features allowing you to set a target ACOS and have rules applied to keyword bids to help meet your ACOS goals.

It also offers managed services for those sellers looking to outsource the Amazon PPC process. Perpetua: A robust toolset that helps sellers automate Amazon advertising across many campaign types and formats. Trusted by a number of large PPC agencies. Zon.Tools: A good solution for new sellers or those on a budget. A flexible pricing model combined with a variety of features makes this a cost-effective option for a dedicated Amazon PPC tool. Ad Badger: A powerful Amazon PPC management solution that helps analyze, automate, and optimize your Amazon campaigns around the clock and is one of the more proven and trusted names in the Amazon PPC software space. BidX: BidX is an Amazon-certified partner and member of its Solution Provider Network. It provides a high-quality platform with a good UX design. From keyword research to campaign creation and performance optimization, BidX covers all the bases an Amazon seller would look for in a tool to improve Amazon PPC advertising performance. SellerApp: Another suite of tools that has a PPC tool included and, as such, presents good value for money. The PPC tool has all the features you’d expect from an analysis and optimization standpoint and has some automation features too. It covers a wide range of Amazon global marketplaces, too. Ignite by SellerLabs: Ignite helps you build your advertising strategy and optimize your PPC ads with AI-powered PPC analytics. The goal, like many of the Amazon advertising software tools mentioned, is to help you set, meet, and exceed your advertising goals with automated suggestions by machine learning algorithms. Trellis: Used by leading brands like Adidas and Unilever, and currently has over 2 million products managed under its advertising platform. It has solutions for growing and established brands, but the pricing tiers mean this is best suited to brands spending at least $5,000 per month on Amazon Ads.

Users can set Amazon PPC campaigns to run with bid management automation and automatically remove any search terms that aren’t converting well. Pacvue: Pacvue bills itself as a complete software solution for eCommerce businesses, allowing them to manage advertising across a range of platforms. This makes it an Amazon advertising tool more suited to large brands scaling on multiple channels, but not ideal for small to medium-sized Amazon sellers. Profit Whales: Profit Whales combines Amazon advertising expertise and marketing practices to scale Amazon PPC advertising. They are more of an Amazon paid ads management service than a tool, but they do have a proprietary PPC management tool. AdRazor: The flat fee plan gives you the ability to manage an unlimited number of PPC campaigns, search terms, and ASINs with daily data updates from the Amazon API. It offers helpful color coding of ACOS data and a visual 12-month performance history for all search terms allowing you to quickly and easily optimize your Amazon PPC campaigns. PPC Ninja: PPC Ninja is an Amazon Ads partner that offers Amazon PPC software along with managed services. The Excel-like user interface makes it easy to get started, especially for those who have been managing PPC with search term reports. How to choose an Amazon PPC tool With so many Amazon advertising tools on the market, it can be hard to know which one is right for your business. When making your choice, you should keep on four key aspects: 1. Features First and foremost, it all comes down to what the tool can do. Features to keep an eye out for are: Detailed Reporting: In-depth analytics are crucial for optimizing Amazon PPC campaigns, and the best tools will clearly display this information within their dashboard to avoid having to go into Seller Central. Campaign Creation: A good Amazon PPC strategy involves creating a range of different campaign types and tools that can automate the creation of these campaigns can save a lot of time. Bid Optimization: Having the ability to set up rules and automations is a huge part of how Amazon PPC software can help optimize and scale your advertising efforts. Aim to find tools that allow you to set parameters for metrics like ACOS and adjust bids accordingly. Keyword Harvesting: Being able to automate the negating and promoting of keywords amongst campaigns can really help with keyword and campaign management while saving a ton of time. 2. Ease of use Next, you also want to look for tools that aren’t overly difficult to use. Amazon PPC can be complex, so the tools you use won’t always be the simplest. However the best tools will overcome some of that complexity with a good user interface and well laid out functionality. 3. Value for money Any marketing spend in your Amazon business needs to have a return on investment, and tools should be considered just that—an investment, rather than simply an expense. However, you need to ensure you’re getting maximum value for your money, so you should weigh up the costs against the benefits. Different tools price in different ways, most commonly: A percentage of ad spend A fixed fee A combination of the above For example, tools like PPC Entourage and Teikametrics price on a percentage of ad spend. PPC Entourage is particularly good value for money for lower ad spend (under $5k/month) as there is no minimum monthly fee. Tools like Quartile, Sellerboard, and Kinetic have a fixed fee pricing model. Some (like Sellerboard and Kinetic) remain fixed regardless of ad spend, whereas others like Quartile will move up in tiers based on your monthly ad spend. Finally, tools like Adtomic by Helium 10 have a fixed base-level price and a fee based on a percentage of ad spend (this only applies to over $10k/monthly ad spend with Helium 10). However, our top pick, Scale Insights, has a unique pricing model in that it charges by ASINs automated. You can automate up to 5 ASINs for just $78/month (or $70/month with the 10% discount they kindly offer our readers), regardless of ad spend. This is especially good value for sellers with high volume products… …but really provides what we feel is the best bang for the buck in the industry, regardless of the size of your business. 4. Support Finally, the support a tool offers can be a make-or-break factor. Each of the top tools we’ve tested and recommended offers email support and detailed tutorials to make sure you get the hang of things quickly. Once again though, Scale Insights does stand out from its competitors with its very active Facebook group. What makes the group unique is how active the creators of the tool are. Given they are 8 and 9-figure Amazon sellers themselves, it’s invaluable support. Amazon PPC Software FAQs What is Amazon PPC management software? Amazon PPC management software tools are programs developed to save users time by automating otherwise cumbersome tasks like pulling spreadsheets, applying keyword bid adjustments, and creating new Amazon advertising PPC campaigns. How did you choose the best Amazon PPC tools for this list? We compiled this list using: Personal experience: All of our reviews and roundups of the best Amazon seller tools are written by humans who’ve spent much of their eCommerce journey using and testing various software tools. We spend hours every week using and testing tools for our own businesses and this helps us form opinions on what works well. Community feedback: We also source opinions from our large community of Amazon sellers and eCommerce operators to make sure there is a full range of opinions on different Amazon PPC analysis tools. Expert insight: We regularly interview industry experts on our podcast and for our articles, and often asked what tools they are using and recommend. Some links within our content may be affiliate links, whereby if you make a purchase after clicking we might earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. This does not affect our reviews as we only ever recommend products we know and approve of. What free Amazon PPC software tools are available? Most Amazon PPC software and tools will require a paid subscription to let you start managing advertising campaigns. However many offer free trials. The most generous free trial is offered by Scale Insights which includes full, unlimited access for 30 days with no credit card required. Find out more here. Is Amazon advertising AI reliable? Amazon advertising PPC AI is a subject that gets a lot of debate. Some will say it’s worthwhile, some will say you’re better off manually carrying out Amazon advertising bulk operations. The reality is, the AI being used by Amazon Sponsored Ads management tools is relatively simplistic using ‘if this then that’ rule-sets. For example, if ACOS hits 40%, then reduce bids by 10%. The key is the time-saving you can gain by letting AI run this to automate Amazon advertising rather than it taking up a lot of human time. Can you do Amazon PPC yourself? Yes, you can manage Amazon PPC campaigns without a tool. You can access search term reports in Seller Central to analyze your data and then make the necessary bid and keyword adjustments manually in Campaign Manager. However, most growing Amazon sellers find an Amazon product ads management tool speeds up their workflow helping them save time and grow PPC sales. How do I succeed with Amazon PPC? Of course, Amazon Ads software can help with growing sales, but succeeding with Amazon PPC is also about learning the fundamentals and staying consistent in applying them week in and week out. There are no secret hacks, just consistent good practices like listing optimization, keyword research and campaign management. If you’d like more guidance, check out our step-by-step PPC course. What is the best Amazon advertising software? There’s no ‘one size fits all’ solution when it comes to Amazon PPC tools, and choosing the best Amazon PPC management software option for your business very much depends on two factors: Budget: Ideally, you don’t want to be spending more than 5-10% of your ad spend on a PPC optimization tool or service. Goals: Are you looking for simple reporting? Advanced automations? Full account management? Depending on the above, our best recommendations are: Scale Insights (top pick) for most sellers looking for advanced rule-based automation and optimized campaign creation PPC Entourage for budget-conscious sellers looking for advanced features with flexible pricing Adtomic for existing Helium 10 users looking for maximum value from their subscription Quartile for large brands and agencies looking for high-level automation and scalability We hope you’ve found this review of the best Amazon PPC tools helpful in finding the best Amazon PPC software for your business.

With millions of products, fierce competition, and the intricacies of digital marketing, it’s crucial to have a strong strategy in place. Today, we’ll explore actionable strategies for mastering Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising and effective management techniques to help you thrive in the Amazon marketplace. Grab a cup of coffee, and let’s break this down step by step. ## Understanding PPC Advertising on Amazon Before diving into strategies, let’s ensure we understand what PPC advertising is. Simply put, PPC allows sellers to bid on keywords, paying for their products to appear in sponsored slots on Amazon search results. It’s a vital tool that can significantly increase your product's visibility and drive traffic to your listings. ### Quick Tip: Start Small With Your Budget When starting with PPC, set a modest budget. This allows you to test and learn without risking too much capital. As you find what works, you can gradually increase your spend. ## Choosing the Right Keywords Keywords are the backbone of a successful PPC campaign. They determine when and where your ads will appear. Here’s how you can find the right keywords for your products: ### Step-by-Step Keyword Research 1. **Use Amazon’s Search Bar**: Start typing relevant terms related to your product. Amazon will suggest popular searches, which can give you ideas on what customers are looking for. 2. **Utilize Tools**: Consider using keyword research tools like SellerMate, which can provide insights into search volume and competition for different keywords. (SellerMate also offers a range of analytics to help refine your keyword strategy.) 3. **Analyze Competitors**: Look at your competitors’ listings and see which keywords they are targeting.
