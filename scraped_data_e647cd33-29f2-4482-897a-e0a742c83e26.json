  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, let‚Äôs kick this off. So, based on the URL \"https://softgen.ai/\", it‚Äôs giving off some serious vibes that this site is about software and AI‚Äîlike, a mash-up of both worlds. The \"soft\" probably hints at software, and \"gen\" could actually tie into generating something‚Äîlike, content, ideas, or even code. You know how it is these days; AI is all about that generation game. I‚Äôm imagining this place might be showcasing some cool AI tools or platforms that help folks create software more efficiently. Maybe it‚Äôs about using artificial intelligence to streamline development processes or whip up new applications without needing to be a coding wizard. You can almost picture it as a digital playground where developers can come together, share tools, and build things that would make even the most seasoned techies take notice. Then again, if it‚Äôs on the AI train, there‚Äôs a good chance they‚Äôre also dabbling in things like automated processes or machine learning. Maybe they‚Äôre offering services that help businesses optimize their workflow by leveraging AI to handle mundane tasks. I mean, who doesn‚Äôt want to automate that boring stuff and focus on the creative side of things, am I right? And let‚Äôs not forget the whole community aspect. A site like this could be gathering a crowd of like-minded tech enthusiasts who are all about sharing knowledge, best practices, and maybe even collaborating on projects. You might find forums or resources that help people get their heads around the latest trends in AI and software development. It could totally be a spot where newbies to the field are learning the ropes while veterans are flexing their expertise. Maybe they're even pushing the envelope on some innovative tech solutions. You know, stuff that challenges the status quo and gets people thinking outside the box. Think about user-friendly interfaces that integrate AI seamlessly into everyday software tools. It‚Äôs all about making technology accessible, right? Or it could be offering cutting-edge products‚Äîlike customizable AI tools that businesses can plug into their existing systems. They might have everything from chatbots for customer service to predictive analytics that help companies make informed decisions. It‚Äôs all pretty exciting when you think about the possibilities! But hey, since it‚Äôs AI-focused, I wouldn't be surprised if they‚Äôve got some cool stuff for content generation‚Äîlike tools that help marketers whip up articles, graphics, or even video content in no time. Imagine having some AI buddy that gets your style and churns out perfectly fitting content while you kick back with a cold one. That kind of stuff is becoming more normal these days, and it‚Äôs kind of dope. In summary, I‚Äôm picturing \"softgen.ai\" as this rad hub for software development and AI innovation, packed with tools, community, and insights that make tech more approachable for everyone. It‚Äôs probably all about harnessing the power of AI to make life easier for developers and businesses alike. So yeah, whether you‚Äôre diving into the nitty-gritty of coding or just trying to figure out how AI can help your workflow, this site seems like it‚Äôd be a great spot to hang out. Cheers to that!",

Developers haven‚Äôt stayed behind. When GitHub surveyed the use of AI in programmers in 2023, 92% of developers already admitted to using AI at work. Their expected benefits were clear-cut: A different survey, this time by Stack Overflow, mentioned hoped-for advantages such as ‚Äúincreased productivity‚Äù (writing more code in less time) and ‚Äúimproved code accuracy,‚Äù which translates as sidestepping bugs or finding them. With developers expecting AI to make them better at their jobs, missing out on AI seems like a death knell. Developers need to stay ahead of the curve, and these are the best AI tools for developers in 2024: 1. Tabnine for code completion ‚ÄçTabnine is an AI tool for developers that provides code completion and code prediction. It is available in various programming languages, including JavaScript and Python. It uses a machine learning algorithm to learn from your code and predict the next line of code you will likely write. The tool can also suggest code snippets, complete functions, and even generate entire classes. What‚Äôs more, Tabnine can suggest code refactoring. It can identify areas of your code that can be refactored to make them more efficient or readable. It can also be integrated with popular IDEs and editors like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Sublime Text. Pricing: Tabnine has a free plan. For the Pro plan, the pricing starts at $12 per month.‚Äç 2. Synk for code analysis and scanning security ‚Äç SNYK is a cloud-based code analysis tool that can help developers find security vulnerabilities and open-source licence compliance issues in their code. The tool uses various techniques to analyse code, including machine learning, static analysis, and dynamic analysis. Developers report that Snyk is very accurate and reliable. It has been trained on a massive dataset of code, and it is constantly being updated with new data. This means that Snyk can identify potential problems in code even with high confidence. It‚Äôs also very easy to use. Even Reddit has taken advantage of this tool. Pricing: Snyk offers an excellent free plan. Their team plan starts at $52 per month. 3. PolyCoder for code generation ‚Äç PolyCoder is an AI-powered code generation tool that can help developers generate code in diverse programming languages, including JavaScript and Python. Because it is trained on a large dataset of code, it should be able to produce good-quality code. It can also learn the patterns and conventions of different programming languages and generate code for specific tasks, such as creating machine learning models or developing web applications. Now, this is an excerpt from their announcement whitepaper from May 2022: ‚ÄúWe release a new model, PolyCoder, with 2.7B parameters based on the GPT-2 architecture, that was trained on 249 GB of code across 12 programming languages on a single machine.‚Äù When the paper dropped, this seemed like a failsafe approach. But, in hindsight, seeing how Large Language Models are inclined to hallucinate, and seeing how GPT-2 is already outdated, you should still closely watch out for any code put out by PolyCoder. It can be an exceptional assistant to brainstorming ideas, but better to primarily rely on your own code. Pricing: Free and open source. Featured Partners Discover your next career opportunity with Hoffmann Group Turn code into personalised experiences. Start building with Twilio. Explore the newest episode of Coffee with Developers with Kyle Daigle, CTO at GitHub 4. Otter.ai for meeting and transcription ‚Äç Otter.ai is an AI-powered meeting transcription tool that can help developers transcribe their meetings. It is available for both desktop and mobile devices. The tool is able to identify the speakers in a meeting and attribute their words to them in the transcript. It also includes timestamps in its transcripts, so developers can easily find specific points in a meeting with a Ctrl+F command. Otter.ai is uses a combination of deep learning and natural language processing to transcribe meetings with high accuracy, even in noisy environments. It works very well for most meetings. Yet, speakers with non-American English accents have consistently reported that Otter‚Äôs transcription feature doesn‚Äôt quite accurately capture them. It might have been trained with American accents only. So we recommend combining Otter with other tools if your meeting is multinational. Pricing: Otter.ai offers a free plan and other plans with varying features. The Pro plan costs $10 per user/month when billed annually. 5. Rewind.ai for documentation Rewing.ai was founded by the team behind Scribe.ai, an AI-powered process documentation tool that was acquired by Google in 2020. The Rewing.ai team has taken the best of Scribe.ai and built a new AI-powered process documentation tool that is even more powerful, accurate, and easy to use. It can help devs create clear and concise documentation for their code and processes. Rewing.ai is a highly customisable tool. Devs can customise the output of Rewing.ai. For example, they can generate documentation in different formats, such as Markdown, HTML, or PDF. Pricing: The pricing for Rewind.ai starts at $100 per month, per regular update. 6. Hugging Face for natural language processing ‚Äç Hugging Face is an open-source software organisation that brings together resources dedicated to natural language processing and LLMs. This platform simplifies NLP application development because it collects pre-trained language models that can handle tasks like text classification, question answering, and machine translation. There‚Äôs a ‚Äúplayground‚Äù option where developers can try some prompts through a pre-defined GUI. For example, you can always ask OpenGPT-4o (not endorsed by Scarlett Johansson yet) to make some easy calculations based on image recognition. Hugging Face also provides a well-organised library of datasets specifically designed for NLP tasks, along with essential tools like tokenizers, transformers, and training scripts. Pricing: Hugging Face has a free plan, but it offers a Pro plan for $9 a month for those who want to contribute financially. 7. Figstack for code understanding ‚Äç Figstack is an AI-powered code-reading tool that can help developers understand code written in any language. It uses various techniques, including machine learning and natural language processing, to understand code and generate accurate and easy-to-understand explanations. It can be used to explain code that is being written, code that is being reviewed, and code that is being debugged. The tool can also analyse code for potential errors, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues and create documentation for code, including documentation for specific functions, classes, and modules. Pricing: Figstack has a free plan with 30 credits per month; subsequently, the starter plan comes at $9 a month. 8. Codepeer.ai for website generation Codepeer.ai is an AI-powered website generation tool that can help developers to create websites quickly and easily, without having to write any code. It uses plenty of techniques found on other AIs, including machine learning and natural language processing, to generate websites that are responsive, accessible, and SEO-friendly. The tool is also able to create websites that are accessible to people with disabilities. This means that the websites can be used by people with visual, hearing, and other disabilities. Pricing: Codeeper.ai has a very short-living free plan; it starts at $10 monthly if you really want to build a website. 9. Stepsize AI for code debugging ‚Äç ‚Äç‚ÄçStepsize AI is an AI-powered tool that can help devs debug code more quickly and easily. The tool can be used for various tasks, including debugging new code, existing code, debugging code reviews and production code. Stepsize AI is not only very accurate at identifying and fixing bugs in code, but also very speedy. It can debug code in seconds or minutes, even for complex codebases. Pricing: Stepsize AI begins at $100 per month per regular update. 10. Mutable.ai to generate high-quality code Mutable.ai is an AI-powered code generation tool that can help developers generate high-quality code quickly and easily. It can create code from simple text descriptions. It also allows developers to collaborate on code generation projects. What‚Äôs more, Mutable.ai generates maintainable code. This is because the tool uses various techniques to make the code it generates easy to read and understand. Pricing: Mutable.ai offers a free plan and other plans with varying features. The Basic plan costs $10 per month per seat. 11. Cursor for code edition Cursor is an AI-powered editor built on top of the Visual Studio Code platform. It integrates functionalities of GPT-4 to beef up the code-writing experience (you do have to use your own OpenAI API key). Since it ‚Äúknows‚Äù your code, you can ask it about specific parts of it. For example, GPT-4's ability to understand and generate text translates to real-time search with ‚Äúnatural language‚Äù (the way we write) and extends to code completion and suggestions. The tool can also give developers access to relevant help documentation and explanations directly from the editor. Despite this, some Reddit users have reported issues when using GPT-4 within Cursor, suggesting potential performance or integration problems that the vendor should check against OpenAI‚Äôs API. The engineering team already confirmed Cursor is working with GPT-4o. Pricing: The Free plan lets you try out the editor with basic features and GPT-3.5. Upgrading to Pro ($20/month) unlocks access to GPT-4, unlimited uses of most features, and some daily Claude Opus functionality. Businesses can access additional management features with the Business plan ($40/user/month). 12. Codium AI for test-writing assistance Codium AI stands out as an AI tool specifically designed to integrate with VS Code and improve the software testing process. As you code, Codium analyses your code, comments, and docstrings to recommend relevant test ideas. This real-time assistance helps prevent errors and bugs by prompting you to consider potential edge cases. It also goes beyond basic suggestions by offering hints into how code changes might impact the whole system. Unlike some AI coding assistants, Codium feels particularly intuitive while using VS Code, probably because it was developed specifically for this platform. Pricing: The free tier offers test suggestions, but for a paid subscription ($19/month), Codium can actually write the tests for you. 13. Grit.io for code migration Grit.io is a tool that automates technical debt management, specifically focusing on tasks like code migrations and dependency upgrades. It uses machine learning to analyse code and suggest improvements, conceivably completing migrations that would take months in just a few days. One of their clients completed a migration they had expected to do in 6 months in only a few days. Grit automates technical debt management, simplifying code migrations and dependency upgrades. It can also automatically generate pull requests. Grit still works with a waitlist. The quickest way to try it is to book a demo with their founder and get access. Pricing: Grit.io offers a free tier for personal and open-source use, and paid team plans starting at $39/contributor per month.

Mark all as read Contact Us Home Pragmatic Blog AI Make sure your developers use these AI tools AI Jun 16,2023 9 min read Make sure your developers use these AI tools It is not true that AI poses a potential threat to programmers. While it may be more challenging for junior programmers to find their first job, experienced senior programmers can benefit from artificial intelligence, as we‚Äôve experienced firsthand by leveraging AI in software development. In fact, rejecting AI instead of embracing it might be okay right now, but it will negatively impact the development of your product in the nearest future. It will weaken your competitive advantage ‚Äì you should assume that your competitors already started to use AI development tools to boost their productivity and time to market. In short, the relationship will soon look like this: no automation and optimization = it will take longer to build a product = you will pay more for software development = you will have less budget for other aspects of product development = you might fall behind your competitors. So, if you want to avoid this, ensure the developers you hire use AI. However, note that the ones we mentioned above are only examples. To find the best tools that will match your company‚Äôs needs, always have your business‚Äôs strategic goals in mind. üëÅ From A Product Manager‚Äôs Perspective Why is it crucial that your team members use AI tools?Senior developers work faster, which, in turn, increases their productivity.

So many new artificial intelligence (AI) tools have been released this year as large language models like ChatGPT have gathered meteoric pace. So I‚Äôve picked out the very best tools every software developer should know about and have a play with. 1. Stepsize AI: Effortless Sprint Reporting Stepsize AI writes perfect sprint reports for us. Your team will thank you for introducing this time-saving (and effort-saving) tool. It writes sprint reports better than humans can, and that engineering leaders, POs and Scrum Masters adore. It‚Äôs designed for teams using platforms like Jira or Linear. Stepsize AI automatically creates sprint reports with the perfect amount of context and detail. With Stepsize AI, everyone‚Äôs aligned an on the same page about product development progress. The AI processes data from your issue tracker, forms connections between projects and tasks and uses this to surface the perfect level of context and commentary.

It‚Äôs great for providing the pertinent details without bombarding people with unnecessary info. Learn more about Stepsize AI here. You can get your first sprint report for free 2. Cody AI: Advanced Code Assistant Cody AI accelerates our process of writing code. If you‚Äôre not using an AI coding assistant, you‚Äôre being left behind.

They save time, and can help you out in all kinds of ways from suggesting code to automatically generating entire files through their natural language processing capabilities, and more. This list has a few AI coding assistants and Cody is the first. By deeply analyzing your existing code, documentation, and code graph, Cody can give you speedy and insightful responses to queries about your codebase.

This question was originally answered on Quora and written as is. I‚Äôm not familiar with Devin per se, but I don‚Äôt see AI ‚Äúreplacing people‚Äù in any capacity it is developed to function within ‚Äî and I use that description with a caveat because AI IS replacing hundreds of thousands of jobs ‚Äî if not millions worldwide. https://preview.devin.ai/ AI has the potential to liberate humans from mundane tasks. It can free up time that would otherwise be spent on repetitive, clearly defined functions while still relying on humans to make decisions and set the parameters for these tasks. Tasks that require creativity, judgment, and understanding of context will continue to be the domain of humans. These include quality control analyses, determining the scope and context of tasks, and designing the application for which a task is intended. This is where the waters become muddy because most jobs are mostly drudge work. Millions of labour hours are spent every year on tasks that can be automated. Capitalists know how much they can save by eliminating humans from repetitive and clearly defined tasks. Many may be arrogant enough to believe they can supplant human creativity and intuitive judgment with an artificial solution. Companies like Disney, however, are butting up against an immovable wall in this regard and getting their noses bloody because of their sociopathic disregard for the human equation in the capitalist environment. We will see many psychopathic capitalists decide they can do without the most expensive of their labouring monkeys, and they will fail because of it. We are likely to witness a significant loss of jobs due to AI. This is a reality that few people doubt, and those who do will be in for a rude awakening when the replacement rate reaches a critical level. Yes and no, but yes, jobs will be lost. Developers with initiative, resources, and creativity to imagine solutions will also be empowered to create their own software enterprises. New jobs will be created, and we‚Äôll see an explosion of ‚Äúindividual corporations‚Äù replacing a landscape of monolithic enterprises that employ hundreds of thousands, which will be much healthier for our economy in the long run. This change in our corporate landscape will reintroduce the stability we once had before the middle class came under assault in the 80s and eviscerated our unions. Right now, when a monolithic corporation makes a minor cut in its costs, thousands of jobs are lost. The economy is stunted as a result of a minor bookkeeping adjustment or on the whims of a sociopath who decides they no longer need to pay half of the staff of the enterprise they just purchased and sends them off packing. In an environment populated mainly by independent entrepreneurs and small ‚Äúmom-and-pop shops,‚Äù any single endeavour can fail, and its failure has no discernable impact on the economy or society at large. The biggest, most disruptive, and potentially destructive challenge is arriving at this newly recovered and economically defined demographic dynamic through a smoothly managed transition. The most crucial step to reduce the negative impact and the widespread hardship resulting from the transition to an automated society is to build a solid base upon which people are free to live and pursue the motivations arising from their imaginations and inventiveness. We must improve liquidity throughout our economic systems, which requires a two-fold process. While the first is to ensure everyone‚Äôs basic living needs are met through a universal income floor, the second requires freeing up capitalization for entrepreneurial initiatives. This second step will be the most difficult to implement because it will require the most powerful among us to relinquish their power. That will happen through reasoned measures or due to entrenched and narcissistic arrogance that will lead us all to widespread chaos. Hopefully, most will be able to identify entirely new vistas of opportunity for themselves in which they can benefit from the changing landscape in ways that are becoming less and less possible by reaching a saturation level where the only room left for growth is a takeover of smaller enterprises. As individuals, their creative capacities and economic potential are far more reliant on the support and inspiration they receive from the collaboration synergies than on armies of sycophants telling them what they want to hear. Some will be wise enough to leverage a massive transition in human society in their favour because they understand and value human ingenuity. Others will fail because their misanthropic disdain toward their servants leads their economic inventiveness to an empty silo devoid of value in the marketplace. If we are to go by the statistics which indicate the prevalence of psychopaths at the boardroom level matches the density of a prison population, I would expect about 20 percent of our plutocrat dynasties will not survive the transition and humanity as a whole will be the beneficiaries of such a surgical culling of our economic dynamics.

This second step will be the most difficult to implement because it will require the most powerful among us to relinquish their power. That will happen through reasoned measures or due to entrenched and narcissistic arrogance that will lead us all to widespread chaos. Hopefully, most will be able to identify entirely new vistas of opportunity for themselves in which they can benefit from the changing landscape in ways that are becoming less and less possible by reaching a saturation level where the only room left for growth is a takeover of smaller enterprises. As individuals, their creative capacities and economic potential are far more reliant on the support and inspiration they receive from the collaboration synergies than on armies of sycophants telling them what they want to hear. Some will be wise enough to leverage a massive transition in human society in their favour because they understand and value human ingenuity. Others will fail because their misanthropic disdain toward their servants leads their economic inventiveness to an empty silo devoid of value in the marketplace. If we are to go by the statistics which indicate the prevalence of psychopaths at the boardroom level matches the density of a prison population, I would expect about 20 percent of our plutocrat dynasties will not survive the transition and humanity as a whole will be the beneficiaries of such a surgical culling of our economic dynamics.

Let‚Äôs explore each in greater detail to help you make an informed decision. Find in this Guide for Industries how Different Businesses Are Using AI Understand Your Business Needs Before reaching out to potential partners, identify what you want to achieve with generative AI. Ask yourself questions such as: ‚Äç What specific problem do I want to solve? ‚Äç What outcomes am I expecting (e.g., cost savings, enhanced customer engagement, product innovation)? ‚Äç What kind of solution am I looking for‚Äîcustom software, APIs, or a full-scale AI system? ‚Äç Having a clear vision of your needs helps you communicate effectively with vendors and ensures you focus on companies with relevant expertise. Understand how Generative AI can Impact Software Development Evaluate Technical Expertise Generative AI encompasses a wide range of technologies and applications. To ensure your project is in good hands, look for a company that demonstrates strong expertise in: ‚Äç Machine Learning Frameworks: Companies should excel in frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face, as these power the most generative AI models. ‚Äç Domain-Specific Applications: If your project requires natural language processing (NLP), ensure the company has a history of building robust language models. They should also have experience with image generation and analysis for computer vision tasks. ‚Äç Model Training and Fine-Tuning: The ability to train custom models or fine-tune existing ones (like OpenAI‚Äôs GPT) is crucial for creating solutions tailored to your business. ‚Äç Data Management: Ensure they can handle data preparation, labelling, and processing, key components of building successful AI systems. ‚Äç Technical certifications, partnerships with AI tech providers, and experience with cutting-edge tools further validate expertise. ‚Äç Review Case Studies and Portfolios Dig deep into the company‚Äôs past projects. Look for case studies that highlight: ‚Äç Client Challenges: What was the problem they solved? Was it similar to your situation? ‚Äç Solutions Delivered: Did the company design a custom AI tool, integrate existing technology, or optimise processes? ‚Äç Results Achieved: Check for measurable outcomes, such as increased efficiency, revenue growth, or reduced operational costs. ‚Äç Consider Scalability and Flexibility Generative AI is rapidly evolving, and your needs might grow or change. Look for a company that: ‚Äç Designs solutions that can scale as your business expands. ‚Äç Offers modular systems, allowing you to add features or integrate with other technologies. ‚Äç Demonstrates flexibility in their development approach through agile methodologies or custom timelines. ‚Äç This ensures your investment remains future-proof and that you can adapt to new demands or advancements in AI technology. ‚Äç Check Client Reviews and Testimonials Gather feedback from other clients to gauge the company‚Äôs reliability and professionalism. Consider: ‚Äç Online Reviews: Sites like Clutch and Google Reviews can provide insights. ‚Äç Client Testimonials: These are found on the company‚Äôs website or during discussions with their team. ‚Äç Direct References: Ask for contact details of past clients to learn about their experience firsthand. ‚Äç Positive reviews about timely delivery, proactive communication, and innovative problem-solving are strong indicators of a trustworthy partner. ‚Äç Assess Communication and Collaboration Clear and open communication is essential for a successful partnership. Evaluate the company‚Äôs: ‚Äç Communication Channels: Do they provide regular updates via email, calls, or project management tools like Trello or Jira? ‚Äç Project Transparency: Are they transparent about project timelines, milestones, and challenges? ‚Äç Cultural Fit: Does their working style align with your organisation‚Äôs values and decision-making processes? ‚Äç Understand Post-Deployment Support AI development doesn‚Äôt end when the system is deployed. Post-launch support is critical to maintain the solution‚Äôs effectiveness. Ensure the company offers: ‚Äç Monitoring and Maintenance: Regular checks to ensure the system operates efficiently and without errors. ‚Äç Bug Fixes and Updates: Quick responses to address any issues and to update the AI model as needed. ‚Äç Performance Optimisation: Continuous improvements to align the solution with evolving business needs. ‚Äç Here's a checklist to help you make an informed decision: ‚Äç Benefits of Partnering with a Generative AI Development Company Collaborating with a generative AI development company offers businesses a range of advantages that go beyond technology.

Let‚Äôs explore each in greater detail to help you make an informed decision. Find in this Guide for Industries how Different Businesses Are Using AI Understand Your Business Needs Before reaching out to potential partners, identify what you want to achieve with generative AI. Ask yourself questions such as: ‚Äç What specific problem do I want to solve? ‚Äç What outcomes am I expecting (e.g., cost savings, enhanced customer engagement, product innovation)? ‚Äç What kind of solution am I looking for‚Äîcustom software, APIs, or a full-scale AI system? ‚Äç Having a clear vision of your needs helps you communicate effectively with vendors and ensures you focus on companies with relevant expertise. Understand how Generative AI can Impact Software Development Evaluate Technical Expertise Generative AI encompasses a wide range of technologies and applications. To ensure your project is in good hands, look for a company that demonstrates strong expertise in: ‚Äç Machine Learning Frameworks: Companies should excel in frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face, as these power the most generative AI models. ‚Äç Domain-Specific Applications: If your project requires natural language processing (NLP), ensure the company has a history of building robust language models. They should also have experience with image generation and analysis for computer vision tasks. ‚Äç Model Training and Fine-Tuning: The ability to train custom models or fine-tune existing ones (like OpenAI‚Äôs GPT) is crucial for creating solutions tailored to your business. ‚Äç Data Management: Ensure they can handle data preparation, labelling, and processing, key components of building successful AI systems. ‚Äç Technical certifications, partnerships with AI tech providers, and experience with cutting-edge tools further validate expertise. ‚Äç Review Case Studies and Portfolios Dig deep into the company‚Äôs past projects. Look for case studies that highlight: ‚Äç Client Challenges: What was the problem they solved? Was it similar to your situation? ‚Äç Solutions Delivered: Did the company design a custom AI tool, integrate existing technology, or optimise processes? ‚Äç Results Achieved: Check for measurable outcomes, such as increased efficiency, revenue growth, or reduced operational costs. ‚Äç Consider Scalability and Flexibility Generative AI is rapidly evolving, and your needs might grow or change. Look for a company that: ‚Äç Designs solutions that can scale as your business expands. ‚Äç Offers modular systems, allowing you to add features or integrate with other technologies. ‚Äç Demonstrates flexibility in their development approach through agile methodologies or custom timelines. ‚Äç This ensures your investment remains future-proof and that you can adapt to new demands or advancements in AI technology. ‚Äç Check Client Reviews and Testimonials Gather feedback from other clients to gauge the company‚Äôs reliability and professionalism. Consider: ‚Äç Online Reviews: Sites like Clutch and Google Reviews can provide insights. ‚Äç Client Testimonials: These are found on the company‚Äôs website or during discussions with their team. ‚Äç Direct References: Ask for contact details of past clients to learn about their experience firsthand. ‚Äç Positive reviews about timely delivery, proactive communication, and innovative problem-solving are strong indicators of a trustworthy partner. ‚Äç Assess Communication and Collaboration Clear and open communication is essential for a successful partnership. Evaluate the company‚Äôs: ‚Äç Communication Channels: Do they provide regular updates via email, calls, or project management tools like Trello or Jira? ‚Äç Project Transparency: Are they transparent about project timelines, milestones, and challenges? ‚Äç Cultural Fit: Does their working style align with your organisation‚Äôs values and decision-making processes? ‚Äç Understand Post-Deployment Support AI development doesn‚Äôt end when the system is deployed. Post-launch support is critical to maintain the solution‚Äôs effectiveness. Ensure the company offers: ‚Äç Monitoring and Maintenance: Regular checks to ensure the system operates efficiently and without errors. ‚Äç Bug Fixes and Updates: Quick responses to address any issues and to update the AI model as needed. ‚Äç Performance Optimisation: Continuous improvements to align the solution with evolving business needs. ‚Äç Here's a checklist to help you make an informed decision: ‚Äç Benefits of Partnering with a Generative AI Development Company Collaborating with a generative AI development company offers businesses a range of advantages that go beyond technology.

These hot new tools, however, aren't just for writers and artists to enjoy. Software developers can reap the benefits of automated assistants right now. From generating and reviewing code to writing documentation and bug tracking, along with lots of stuff in between, there are AI tools for developers to use that match their budgets. In this article, we'll look at the application of AI in software development and examine some of the issues to keep in mind. Then, we'll present a list of the best AI tools for developers. How AI is used in software development Copy link Let's start with a brief overview of what AI can do today regarding software development and if it's worth trusting it to perform well. In short, AI is changing the development landscape and can even create simple apps without a whole development team. Sre Chakra Yeddula is someone who did just this by mastering AI tools to develop an app, books, and podcasts. He designed and built his app, Plan My Lunch, in 30 days using AI tools, and he's not alone. GitHub conducted a survey that revealed that 92% of US-based developers use AI coding tools for their work and personal projects. Given the advances in AI technology in recent years, there's no mystery behind these results. The advantages for developers of using these tools are many; however, some disadvantages also require attention. The pros of AI in software development Copy link How does AI do all of this? The coding tools we'll be examining work in a similar way to text-based generation models. They use generative AI models and large language models (LLM) that have been trained on code datasets. The models make suggestions for completing lines when developers are writing code. Given the proper prompts, they can also create code from scratch, which is what the creator of Plan My Lunch did. Besides code generation, AI tools have other benefits for developers, such as: Increased collaboration Copy link Developers can automate parts of their workflow using AI to free up their time for projects and tasks that require working with other engineers and team members, such as security reviews, planning, and pair programming. Automated debugging and testing Copy link AI tools can find bugs and other coding errors faster than humans. They can also test code and give reports to reduce the time spent on code reviews and bug checking to bring a product online sooner. Smart assistants Copy link Developers can benefit from AI tools that suggest ways to complete code or solve problems, whether developing code or handling other tasks. Likewise, they can help developers avoid repeating themselves in their code and offer real-time feedback. Strategy design Copy link When AI tools have access to a team's past projects, they can suggest what features will benefit a product best based on developer experience and user reviews. Team management Copy link AI tools can help developers coordinate their work to avoid conflicts in code and increase communication to resolve issues more efficiently. The cons of AI in software development Copy link Developers deserve a word of caution concerning the use of these tools in their work. We won't delve into the ethical debates surrounding AI in different professions because developers use these instruments now and will continue to use them. They ease the work of development teams and individual engineers. AI tools are not, however, a cure-all, and there are concerns about how they already affect development and what future effects could be. Code quality Copy link Code-generating AI tools are trained on human-produced code to create code like a human. If people make mistakes, these tools will likely do the same. In a study, GitClear analyzed four years' worth of code written with AI assistants. They found that the quality of the code was lacking. Over time, code churn increased, which refers to the number of lines updated or reverted less than two weeks after creation. The researchers believe this phenomenon will double in 2024 compared to 2021. They also spotted an increase in copied and pasted code instead of that which is updated or moved. They conclude that the code generated in 2023 was prone to violate the \"don't-repeat-yourself\" (DRY) principle. Tech debt potential Copy link AI generates code at incredible speeds that no human can match. The temptation is to create endless lines of machine-generated code while trusting that it's good and necessary. If not reviewed and tested, developers will encounter more work and use extra resources later to remove the extra lines. Low-quality code that is produced quickly is still low-quality code that can create problems down the line. Security risks Copy link A Cornell University study found that developers with access to assistants, such as OpenAI's codex-davinci-002 model, wrote less secure code than those without access. Further results showed that developers using the AI assistants trusted themselves more to write secure code, while those without these tools were more skeptical towards their own code. Overall, developers who trusted the AI less and reviewed the code it produced with a critical eye created code with fewer vulnerabilities. Dependence on AI Copy link As in other professions, relying too much on AI tools can lead to a degradation of professional skills. If developers also turn to AI to solve problems or find a solution to a difficult coding situation, they lose confidence and avoid learning from experience or experimenting with their own ideas. There's a risk of a decrease in innovation and creativity. Regardless of whether someone uses AI to write texts or code, the advice and solutions are the same to avoid harming your work and that of others on your team. It's not a question of using the tools but doing so correctly. Here is how you can adequately employ AI tools to ease your work and save you time without creating more significant problems in the future: Writing better prompts Establishing clear guidelines on when and how to use, Code-scanning Using static application security testing (SAST) The bottom line is to approach AI-generated code like human-generated code. Review it. It's not perfect and not a solution for all the issues you'll encounter in software development. Doing this will save you and your team time and allow you to focus your energy and resources on more creative and exciting tasks. AI software development tools Copy link With this word of caution in mind and an understanding of how to make the most of the AI tools available today, it's time to explore the instruments that can reduce the time you spend on mundane coding tasks and improve your productivity. GitHub Copilot Copy link The developer platform GitHub created Copilot to assist developers in generating code Recently, it was integrated with OpenAI's GPT-4 to enhance its generative abilities. This tool has received generally positive reviews from users. Developers appreciate its ability to suggest code snippets, complete functions, and provide helpful comments to significantly speed up the coding process, especially when completing repetitive tasks and boilerplate code. However, some reviewers note that Copilot's suggestions are not always accurate or context-appropriate, requiring careful review and occasional adjustments. Additionally, there are concerns about the tool's reliance on existing codebases and potential copyright issues. Despite these limitations, many users report increased productivity and improved code quality when using GitHub Copilot, making it a valuable asset for both experienced developers and those learning to code. | Why users like it | Why users DON'T like it | | --- | --- | | * Easy to use * Tab completion * Great for repetitive, simple tasks | Can't handle complex logic Can be inaccurate Expensive | Pricing: 2-week free trial for all plans Free plan with up to 20 open issues $19/month per user annually with unlimited issues $49/month per user annually with expanded features ChatGPT Copy link It's for writers, though, isn't it?

Stepsize AI Copy link While not a code-generating instrument, Stepsize takes over some of the routine \"paperwork\" in development, leaving more time to code and tackle engineering challenges. It works with Jira and Linear, but it's expected to be integrated with other issue trackers soon. The tool has received positive reviews from developers for its ability to enhance the software development process by tracking, prioritizing, and resolving technical debt directly within their IDE. Many users find it particularly useful for reducing technical debt, easier problem-solving, and improving security. However, some reviewers note that Stepsize AI requires a learning curve and buy-in from the engineering team to be fully effective.

They are excellent tools for accomplishing this task, and many of them offer free plans that allow you and your team to test them before committing. Consider how much you are willing to pay for full functionality, but also remember that your team's culture and approach to work determines how productive and efficient you are, not a tool. If there's no culture to test or review code in place now without AI tools, it won't magically appear by using them. Avoid sacrificing quality for speed without understanding the consequences of tech debt. Mad Devs embraces AI tools in our work, and our engineers prefer using Chat GPT, Co-Pilot, and Codium in their projects. Outside of coding, we love tools that help us coordinate projects with colleagues worldwide. One example is Enji, an instrument we created to analyze data about how we work to guide our planning. We didn't develop Enji to be a \"cool\" tool. First, we saw a problem, and then we developed a solution from that situation that required this kind of instrument. That's how you can choose the right AI software development tool for you and your team. Find the problem and then match the tool to the solution. Joseph Taylor Content Creator Contributors: Oleg Puzanov ‚Äì CSO Andrew Sapozhnikov ‚Äì CIO & CTO Rail Batyrshin ‚Äì Software engineer Pavel Zverev ‚Äì CCO FAQ What is an AI model? An AI model is a system that can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence. Examples include machine learning models, deep learning models, natural language processing models, and computer vision models. What is a large language model (LLM)? A large language model is an advanced artificial intelligence system designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language by learning from vast amounts of text data. What is a token? In terms of LLMs, a token is a unit of text that the model uses to process and generate language. The size can vary from one character to a word or even a piece of a word. They are the fundamental units of text that LLMs operate on and play a significant role in how these models interpret, process, and generate language.

They are excellent tools for accomplishing this task, and many of them offer free plans that allow you and your team to test them before committing. Consider how much you are willing to pay for full functionality, but also remember that your team's culture and approach to work determines how productive and efficient you are, not a tool. If there's no culture to test or review code in place now without AI tools, it won't magically appear by using them. Avoid sacrificing quality for speed without understanding the consequences of tech debt. Mad Devs embraces AI tools in our work, and our engineers prefer using Chat GPT, Co-Pilot, and Codium in their projects. Outside of coding, we love tools that help us coordinate projects with colleagues worldwide. One example is Enji, an instrument we created to analyze data about how we work to guide our planning. We didn't develop Enji to be a \"cool\" tool. First, we saw a problem, and then we developed a solution from that situation that required this kind of instrument. That's how you can choose the right AI software development tool for you and your team. Find the problem and then match the tool to the solution. Joseph Taylor Content Creator Contributors: Oleg Puzanov ‚Äì CSO Andrew Sapozhnikov ‚Äì CIO & CTO Rail Batyrshin ‚Äì Software engineer Pavel Zverev ‚Äì CCO FAQ What is an AI model? An AI model is a system that can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence. Examples include machine learning models, deep learning models, natural language processing models, and computer vision models. What is a large language model (LLM)? A large language model is an advanced artificial intelligence system designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language by learning from vast amounts of text data. What is a token? In terms of LLMs, a token is a unit of text that the model uses to process and generate language. The size can vary from one character to a word or even a piece of a word. They are the fundamental units of text that LLMs operate on and play a significant role in how these models interpret, process, and generate language.

Next, I talk about GitHub Copilot, which integrates deeply with GitHub. Then, I introduce Continue, an open-source IDE alternative. Moving on, I delve into text app builders such as Bolt.new and Lovable.dev for easy app creation. Finally, I highlight versatile platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, and Google AI Studio for diverse AI capabilities. I also touch upon structured learning resources from 'Zero to Mastery' and discuss the potential of AI agents in the workforce. Don't forget to check out the links in the description! üîóüí° 00:00 Introduction: Exploring AI Tools for 2025 00:08 AI IDEs: Cursor and Windsurf 02:31 GitHub Copilot: Deep Integration with GitHub 03:21 Open Source Alternatives: Continue and Olama 03:59 Text App Builders: Bolt, Lovable, and V0 05:17 Frontier Models: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity 06:43 Google AI Studio: Real-Time Assistance 07:47 Sponsored Segment: Zero to Mastery 08:45 AI Agents: No-Code and Coding Solutions 28 comments in this video I'm going to try something a little bit different and I'm going to go over five different categories of tools that I would encourage you to explore in 2025 the first one is an AI IDE now you've probably heard of a number of these now cursor is arguably the most popular AI IDE that's out there an AI IDE what it allows you to do is to have a really ergonomic environment on how you can write code what you can do for instance is within cursor is you can begin to write out code like you typically would but then you can just tab through and have autocomplete for different functions or different sections and it's gotten to the point where it is really reliable and what I really love with cursor as well as all of these AI idees is they are a direct beneficiary whenever these large language models come out and have improvements for instance when Sona 3.5 came out it was shortly thereafter that cursor and a number of these AI idees really took off because now you're able to reliably create these agentic systems Within I it will allow you to write code for you with natural language but it can also do things like multifile edit and the features are really increasing day by day I personally have a pro subscription and I'd encourage you to check it out there's also a free trial that you can check out as well next up another great option is wind surf by codium this just came out in the fall and it is another really powerful option one of the things that I found great with wind surf is it has really good contextual awareness what do I mean by that basically if you're using the right-and panel where you're interacting and asking questions about your code base or asking for changes or what have you it will automatically attempt to find the particular files that you're referencing or the particular features that need to be updated and often times certain features might spam across a number of different files and it does a surprisingly good job at being able to Traverse what can be sometimes often relatively complex code bases I'd really encourage you to check this out I tried this out a number of months ago when it first came out and I just recently tried it out over the past weekend and I was able to build out a full stack application that I'm open sourcing this week in just a number of hours the other thing that's nice with this is there is also a free tier but it is slightly cheaper than cursor as well and from my experience there are some really great developers that actually even prefer the offering from codium and wind surf over cursor just something to consider now I'm going to put links to the videos where I've covered both cursor as well as wisor within the description of the video if you're interested in checking out any of this now next another great option is GitHub co-pilot this is one of the First videos that I covered on the channel and what GitHub co-pilot allows you to do is very similar to the other tools but what's interesting with GitHub co-pilot it is it has a deep as you might expect integration within GitHub itself now what you're going to be able to do more and more is be able to have these AI features and increasingly be able to do more and more at the repository level in addition to being able to use it directly within your IDE as well now the other great thing with co-pilot is they recently released a pretty generous free tier you'll be able to get a number of different premium requests per month through their free tiers so you'll be able to access models like gb40 as well as sonit 3.5 and have a number of free requests even to those premium models for free each month so next another great option is continue continue is an open source alternative to what I showed you and what's great with this is you can even pull down local models and try out all of these new AI models that come out these small language models or slms as they're often referred to you'll be able to use those within the context of something like continue as well and continue pairs really well with a tool known as olama where you can pull down local models and you can use those with continue and have these models completely offline on your machine you won be incurring any cost at all and these small language models are becoming increasingly powerful as well next what encourage you to check out are some of these text app Builders some of the popular ones from last year were bolt. new lovable as well as v0 and what these allow you to do is you can put in with natural language what you want your application to be and it will effectively create it for you so under the hood within a lot of these they're using models like Cloud 3.5 Sonet and it's essentially going through this sort of agentic pattern where it's set up in a way where it's very specific to app building and it will allow you to create these apps that you can even go connect to superbase and even deploy in most of the options that are out there now another really good option that I'd encourage you to check out is also lovable. deev you can also try out all of these platforms for free as well there is obviously a limit on the free tier but if you just want to try these out I'd encourage you honestly to check out all of them now another great one is also v0 so VZ is built by the team over at verell and where this does particularly well is with things like Shad CN UI components the do have the creator of Shad ceni on staff and honestly they're some of the best full stack Engineers as well as front-end Engineers that are out there at verel vzer does increasingly well at a number of different tasks and it's also really easy to pull down these components and integrate them within your project as well so next and you're probably using one of these platforms already whether it's Chad GPT Claude gemini or perplexity let's say you don't want to subscribe to any service you'll be able to access a lot of these Frontier models for free at least for a number of requests now all of these platforms do have Pro features as well chat GPT for instance has access to 01 and 01 mini and soon to be 03 mini within chat GPT which if you're looking for advanced reasoning capability that could be a really good option for you if you're doing a lot of coding specific task a ton of people love the artifacts feature within Claud which is a really great option being able to access 3.5 Sonet one that I've been enjoying using this month is Gemini Advance 1.5 Pro with deep research where where what it will do for you is it will give you a brief of the tasks that it aims to complete and if you accept it it will go through all of these links and it will give you this synthesized report at the end of it with annotations of all of the different sources that it pulled from in the report that it generated fre you so if you're doing research that's a really great option and additionally for a similar type of tool is perplexity this initially came out and was popularized by being able to access real-time information and perform that search capability where it could Scout or the internet for relevant information on what you were looking for that's another great option and within the platform here you'll be able to access a number of the Frontier Model so you can select whether you want to use gp24 or sonic 3.5 or what have you next another one and this one just came out in December is in Google AI Studio they have this really cool feature called stream real time where what you can do is you can stream whether it's your computer screen or your camera or what have you and you can ask questions for tutorials for instance let's say you're within a video editing software and you don't know how to use it what you'll be able to do is you can talk in real time as if there's someone right beside you to be able to figure out whatever you might be doing just to demonstrate that here I'll just show you what the audio sounds like speaker says that Google AI Studio has a new feature called stream real time this feature allows you to stream your computer screen or camera and ask questions the speaker suggest that this could be useful if you are in a video editing software and need help the speaker claims you can talk in real time and have someone help you as if they were there with you you can have different windows open you could imagine even using this within the context of using your IDE and using it like a pair programmer or what have you it's really really neat and the great thing with this is it's actually completely free that's something to consider as well next up is the sponsor for today's video Zero to Mastery I'd encourage you to check out some form of structured learning in 2025 within zero to Mastery there are a ton of different courses on here from prompt engineering AI engineering AI for beginners within Ai and machine learning there are courses like the complete python developers guide The Prompt engineering guide you can learn about tensorflow P torch there are also a ton of Applied courses as well if you're actually looking to leverage some of these large language models in building out applications there are courses on how to build out apps with open AI AWS Gemini Lang chain and that's just to name a handful there are an absolute ton of different courses on here is not necessarily just AI either maybe you're a python developer and you want to learn about frontend there are courses within here on that there are even courses about interview skills so if you're trying to get a job within the field there are a number within this if you're interested in trying out zero to Mastery I'll put the link within the description below next this sort of stems from what Sam Alman said in a recent blog post where he believes that in 2025 we may see the first AI agents quote unquote join the workforce and materially change the output of companies so AI agents are definitely a little bit of a buzzword right now but what I'd encourage you to check out especially these no code offerings out there n8n is a great open source option where effectively what a lot of these tools will allow you to do is based on a trigger it will go through this workflow and oftentimes reason about the different steps that it needs to go through within NN here's an example of where you onboard a new Joiner and it goes through and it Provisions the different accounts but there are a number of really great tools out there whether it's Lindy AI which helps you automate different tasks Vector shift is another great op option as well defi is also another great open source option that I've covered on this channel before and if you're looking for coding based Solutions one that I've actually gravitated towards that I quite like is the B agent framework I find for especially beginners for building out AI agents this is probably a really non nonent framework especially for typescript developers that allow you to create these agents in just a number of lines of code that are extremely powerful quick and easy to use it does a lot of the heavy look under the hood of setting up tool calls doing reflection and all of that sort of agentic ability that you'd often consider when you hear the term AI agent but if you're more familiar with AI agents what they can do how you can build them I'd encourage you to check out langra this is probably the industry standard in my opinion for building out a agents right now there's both a python as well as a typescript implementation of Lang graph not only are there a ton of companies that are integrating this today in production use cases but this is probably the most malleable framework there definitely is a learning curve to Lang graph but Lang graph allows you to build out very specific reliable and very customizable AI agents",

it's also really easy to pull down these components and integrate them within your project as well so next and you're probably using one of these platforms already whether it's Chad GPT Claude gemini or perplexity let's say you don't want to subscribe to any service you'll be able to access a lot of these Frontier models for free at least for a number of requests now all of these platforms do have Pro features as well chat GPT for instance has access to 01 and 01 mini and soon to be 03 mini within chat GPT which if you're looking for advanced reasoning capability that could be a really good option for you if you're doing a lot of coding specific task a ton of people love the artifacts feature within Claud which is a really great option being able to access 3.5 Sonet one that I've been enjoying using this month is Gemini Advance 1.5 Pro with deep research where where what it will do for you is it will give you a brief of the tasks that it aims to complete and if you accept it it will go through all of these links and it will give you this synthesized report at the end of it with annotations of all of the different sources that it pulled from in the report that it generated fre you so if you're doing research that's a really great option and additionally for a similar type of tool is perplexity this initially came out and was popularized by being able to access real-time information and perform that search capability where it could Scout or the internet for relevant information on what you were looking for that's another great option and within the platform here you'll be able to access a number of the Frontier Model so you can select whether you want to use gp24 or sonic 3.5 or what have you next another one and this one just came out in December is in Google AI Studio they have this really cool feature called stream real time where what you can do is you can stream whether it's your computer screen or your camera or what have you and you can ask questions for tutorials for instance let's say you're within a video editing software and you don't know how to use it what you'll be able to do is you can talk in real time as if there's someone right beside you to be able to figure out whatever you might be doing just to demonstrate that here I'll just show you what the audio sounds like speaker says that Google AI Studio has a new feature called stream real time this feature allows you to stream your computer screen or camera and ask questions the speaker suggest that this could be useful if you are in a video editing software and need help the speaker claims you can talk in real time and have someone help you as if they were there with you you can have different windows open you could imagine even using this within the context of using your IDE and using it like a pair programmer or what have you it's really really neat and the great thing with this is it's actually completely free that's something to consider as well next up is the sponsor for today's video Zero to Mastery I'd encourage you to check out some form of structured learning in 2025 within zero to Mastery there are a ton of different courses on here from prompt engineering AI engineering AI for beginners within Ai and machine learning there are courses like the complete python developers guide The Prompt engineering guide you can learn about tensorflow P torch there are also a ton of Applied courses as well if you're actually looking to leverage some of these large language models in building out applications there are courses on how to build out apps with open AI AWS Gemini Lang chain and that's just to name a handful there are an absolute ton of different courses on here is not necessarily just AI either maybe you're a python developer and you want to learn about frontend there are courses within here on that there are even courses about interview skills so if you're trying to get a job within the field there are a number within this if you're interested in trying out zero to Mastery I'll put the link within the description below next this sort of stems from what Sam Alman said in a recent blog post where he believes that in 2025 we may see the first AI agents quote unquote join the workforce and materially change the output of companies so AI agents are definitely a little bit of a buzzword right now but what I'd encourage you to check out especially these no code offerings out there n8n is a great open source option where effectively what a lot of these tools will allow you to do is based on a trigger it will go through this workflow and oftentimes reason about the different steps that it needs to go through within NN here's an example of where you onboard a new Joiner and it goes through and it Provisions the different accounts but there are a number of really great tools out there whether it's Lindy AI which helps you automate different tasks Vector shift is another great op option as well defi is also another great open source option that I've covered on this channel before and if you're looking for coding based Solutions one that I've actually gravitated towards that I quite like is the B agent framework I find for especially beginners for building out AI agents this is probably a really non nonent framework especially for typescript developers that allow you to create these agents in just a number of lines of code that are extremely powerful quick and easy to use it does a lot of the heavy look under the hood of setting up tool calls doing reflection and all of that sort of agentic ability that you'd often consider when you hear the term AI agent but if you're more familiar with AI agents what they can do how you can build them I'd encourage you to check out langra this is probably the industry standard in my opinion for building out a agents right now there's both a python as well as a typescript implementation of Lang graph not only are there a ton of companies that are integrating this today in production use cases but this is probably the most malleable framework there definitely is a learning curve to Lang graph but Lang graph allows you to build out very specific reliable and very customizable AI agents"

By Harry Guinness December 02, 2024 You have 1 article left to read this month before you need to register a free LeadDev.com account. Estimated reading time: 6 minutes Don‚Äôt miss out Get weekly engineering leadership content in your inbox. Email address(Required) Email This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. There has been an explosion of generative AI programming tools hitting the market over the past two years, many of which are free to use. ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools have shown that they can fit into software developers‚Äô workflows and provide an instant productivity boost. These apps ‚Äì which leverage large language models (LLMs) and other kinds of AI models to understand language, imagery, and code ‚Äì can answer questions, reorganize information, and provide writing or code snippets. Of course, these tools aren‚Äôt perfect yet, and still require a lot of supervision to get the most from them, but it‚Äôs hard to deny that they can be useful when deployed under the right circumstances. As with any tech boom, there are suddenly dozens of different programming tools vying for engineers‚Äô attention. Here are a few you should know about. ChatGPT OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT is the free app that made the world aware of what generative AI could do. While the chatbot might not be the best app for programming tasks specifically, it is still able to generate boilerplate code, translate or refactor lines of code into different languages, automate rote tasks, and even help with more complex coding problems. London ‚Ä¢ June 16 & 17, 2025 Speakers Gergely Orosz, Camille Fournier and Lara Hogan confirmed. See who else is speaking While you don‚Äôt have to pay, install anything, or give it access to your codebase to see if the suggestions are good, or if it can explain what complex functions do, ChatGPT Plus at $20 per month gives you more access to OpenAI‚Äôs most powerful models. This makes ChatGPT a good starting point when it comes to exploring what a generative AI tool can do and it can provide good solutions to some problems, but there are better coding-focused tools out there. Google Bard Gemini is Google‚Äôs response to ChatGPT. Google developed the transformer architecture that has underpinned the recent boom in LLMs, so it has a huge amount of AI expertise, but it has been slow to leverage that into consumer products. As a coding assistant, Bard can code in more than 20 programming languages, including Python, Java, C++, and Javascript. It can generate code from your prompts and comments, explain code you paste in, and help you refactor any code you‚Äôve already written. While Gemini is also free at the moment, it‚Äôs also available as part of Google Workspaces plans which integrate it with other Google apps like Gmail and Google Docs. GitHub Copilot GitHub Copilot is meant to be an AI pair programmer. Unlike ChatGPT and Google Gemini, it‚Äôs explicitly designed to be capable of writing functional code in languages like Python, Javascript, Go, PHP, Ruby, and Swift. Because Copilot has full access to your project, it is able to generate specific code suggestions based on architecture, style conventions, and context. If you ask it to create a function it won‚Äôt just give you boilerplate code ‚Äì it will do it using the variables, classes, and methods you‚Äôve already defined. You can also select what model from OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic you want it to use to generate your code suggestions. Right now, Copilot integrates with a small number of popular integrated development environments (IDEs), including Neovim, Visual Studio, and Xcode. Amazon Q Developer Amazon Q Developer (formerly CodeWhisperer) is Amazon‚Äôs answer to GitHub Copilot. It was trained on billions of lines of publicly available code, as well as Amazon code. It similarly works with multiple programming languages like Python and Java, integrates with your IDE, and suggests complete functions based on your prompts, comments, and project code. The key difference is that Amazon Q is optimized for AWS APIs, including the popular EC2, Lambda, and S3 infrastructure types. If you‚Äôre trying to build on top of Amazon‚Äôs cloud platforms, it can suggest code using the relevant services that meet AWS best practices. While it can also suggest non-AWS code, it‚Äôs less likely to get things perfect. Cursor While Copilot and Q Developer are add-ons available in multiple IDEs, Cursor is an AI-first IDE itself. Instead of AI being a useful if optional extra, with Cursor it‚Äôs a core part of the coding experience. Features like Composer allow the AI to work on multiple files at once in an autonomous, agent-like manner, and Cursor‚Äôs access to your whole code-base means it can make intelligent suggestions based on your existing functions. Although it‚Äôs only been available for a bit over a year, it‚Äôs already proving to be incredibly popular with engineers. Zed Like Cursor, Zed is a new IDE designed to enable collaboration between humans and AI. At the moment, it‚Äôs completely free and open-source. The company behind it intends to charge for more powerful team and collaboration features, rather than access to AI autocomplete and other AI features. Tabnine Tabnine is another AI coding assistant that supports a range of LLMs including Claude, GPT-4o, Command R+, and Codestral, to generate code suggestions. It can auto-complete whole lines of code or full functions, as well as match the style and conventions of your existing codebase. Where Tabnine stands out is with its availability. GitHub Copilot and Amazon Q Developer are only available in a handful of major IDEs, like VS Code, whereas Tabnine is also available in a wider variety of apps, including Sublime, Eclipse, Neovim, and Android Studio. CodeWP by WPAI WordPress is the most popular content management system (CMS) in the world, powering more than 40% of the world‚Äôs websites. If you‚Äôre one of the developers who has built a career on top of WordPress or any of its popular plugins like WooCommerce, then CodeWP might be exactly what you‚Äôre looking for. CodeWP has been designed and trained explicitly to generate PHP, Javascript, and jQuery that‚Äôs compatible with WordPress, its plugins, and its database. Like most AI coding assistants, it‚Äôs a relatively new app, so it might not have all the capabilities you‚Äôd expect, but it is under active development, with new features rolling out regularly. What the Diff What the Diff is designed to help teams review code and create better documentation. What the Diff integrates with your GitHub and GitLab repositories. When someone on your team commits a pull request, it analyzes the difference between the new and old code ‚Äì and automatically creates a natural language summary. Instead of a pull request comment just saying ‚Äúbug fixes‚Äù, there will be an accurate summary of what code has changed and what it‚Äôs done. It‚Äôs a great way to keep non-technical team members in the loop, and just make documentation neater for everyone. As well as improving documentation, What the Diff can also directly refactor code based on a prompt or comment, and create weekly reports summarizing all the pull requests your team has made. DALL-E 3, FLUX.1, and Midjourney It‚Äôs not just back-end developers who can get the benefits of the current generative AI boom. Text-to-image tools like DALL-E 3, FLUX.1, and Midjourney allow you to generate any image you want from a simple, written prompt to quickly generate app icons, interface elements, and placeholders for any front-end design elements. If you don‚Äôt have the time ‚Äì or the design chops ‚Äì and need something workable right now, even just as a placeholder, they‚Äôre surprisingly effective. Remember, stay cautious As powerful as all these AI programming tools appear to be, there are still plenty of reasons to be cautious. Enough major enterprises are legitimately concerned about how GPT and other LLM-powered tools handle important data to have banned them from the workplace, and these apps are nowhere near reliable enough to be left to their own devices just yet. They might be able to help engineers work faster ‚Äì but they can‚Äôt do their job for them. Yet.

It‚Äôs this AI-powered platform for web app development, right? You basically create applications using just natural language‚Äîno coding skills required. It‚Äôs all about making it accessible for everyone, whether you're an experienced dev or a total newbie. Speed, flexibility, and ease of use are the names of the game, letting folks turn their wild ideas into actual functional web apps. Crazy tales incoming‚Äîbuckle up for the big-ass combo, my dude!Just picture me, jamming with my buddy by a fire after a few drinks. You know the vibe‚Äîfire crackling, stars shining, and I‚Äôm diving deep into this Softgen phenomenon that‚Äôs taking the tech world by storm. So what‚Äôs the deal with Softgen? It‚Äôs not just another tech tool some geek whipped up in their garage. This is the future, man! It‚Äôs like a magic wand for anyone wanting to turn their ideas into web apps without getting tangled in that spaghetti code nightmare.What the Hell is Softgen, Anyway?Let‚Äôs break it down for a second. You know how coding used to look like some hieroglyphics from a lost civilization? Well, with Softgen, that madness is over! It‚Äôs like having your tech-savvy friend who totally gets you, even when you can‚Äôt describe what you want clearly.Imagine this: you stroll up to a virtual whiteboard, and instead of sweating over lines of code, you just say, \"I want a web app where people can book appointments.\" Boom! Softgen‚Äôs AI kicks in, and before you can even finish your drink, you‚Äôve got a prototype ready to roll. It‚Äôs like having a magical coder at your disposal‚Äîno coding experience needed.The Rise of No-Code RevolutionLet‚Äôs get real here‚Äîcoding has historically been a realm reserved for the nerdy elite, right?
