Additionally, creating consistent, engaging and dynamic content has always been a challenge for broadcasters, but with 2025 set to be “the year of the audience,” audience participation through remote guest appearances could very well be the answer to these requirements. Narayanan Rajan, CEO, Media Excel: In 2025, broadcasting will see the acceleration of artificial intelligence in content production, content localization, and long tail content mining. The growth of immersive technologies like multi-view, AR and VR will enable both richer and more personalized audience experiences as well as increased flexibility in production with virtual studios. The shift will continue to cloud native playout, IP and the adoption of 5G to enable more agile workflows, remote collaboration and reduced infrastructure investment. By utilizing consumer information, broadcasters will create personalized content offerings — from localized programming to dynamic ad delivery — that speak directly to individual tastes and behaviors. Personalized content can extend beyond just recommendations, allowing narratives or content formats to be adjusted in real time. Additionally, interactive advertising will become more sophisticated, leveraging personalized data to target the right audience at the right moment. For example, AI could allow the personalization of pre-roll ads or create dynamic, location-based campaigns for live events, increasing viewer engagement and enhancing ad performance. Business Model Evolution Gatis Gailis, CEO and founder, Veset: With the rise of streaming services dominating the industry, direct-to-consumer (DTC) growth has seen a surge of interest, with platforms such as Netflix, Disney+, YouTube and Paramount+ becoming popular among consumers. The proliferation of OTT platforms and niche streaming services has intensified in an appetite for DTC, which has also unlocked new content monetization streams through subscription models, ad-supported platforms and hybrid approaches. Michael Lantz, CEO, Accedo: I believe We will see improved content packaging in SVOD subscription services. Video services will be looking to package content and even adapt the UX depending on the type of content. It might, for example, involve giving viewers the option to pay for early access to content releases or staggered release dates depending on the subscription tier. I believe we will also see some services beginning to experiment with thematic packaging of content at different price points. Kristan Bullett, CEO, Humans Not Robots (HNR): The ongoing drive for cost optimization in technology operations will continue to have a strong impact, meaning fewer resources and the need to do more with less. As a result, productivity measurement will become crucial to ensure efficiency.

Nick Anderson, product manager, DigitalGlue: Support for SRT will continue to progress across vendors and organizations, hopefully catching up to NDI to provide a more open standard for delivery. With both cameras and video editing applications supporting transmission, organizations will need to revisit a tape-like mentality for media handling to properly leverage the benefits over file-based delivery. Instead of point to point file transfers, a SRT can multicast content on the network for multiple systems to receive in real-time and record to a file. Suzana Brady, SVP, worldwide sales and marketing, Cobalt Digital: A general increase in available transmission bandwidth, coupled with advances in compression technology. The technologies to watch for are anything that provides ubiquitous high bandwidth (5G, fiber access everywhere, etc.), transport protocols with high security and low latency, such as RIST, and low latency CODECs such as JPEG-XS, HTJ2K, and special HEVC modes. 5G is great for on-the-spot transmission of high-quality live material, and advances in 5G will make the bandwidth more reliably available. How will IP-based workflows continue to shape content production in the future? Economic & Business Impact Thorsten Sauer, CEO, Pixel Power: The halcyon world of real-time live production in the cloud hasn’t really materialized yet. Cloud storage is a stubbornly expensive proposition (especially as camera technology evolves and file sizes keep growing), and much of the world still wants the security of on-premise solutions (that have already been bought and paid for). IP-based workflows look great in theory – who doesn’t like the idea of sharing/collaborating/producing and delivering content remotely? – but the truth is that hybrid models will persist for many years to come until the process of moving content around in the cloud becomes cheaper, faster and safer. Philip Grossman, VP, business development and solutions architecture, DigitalGlue: One of the greatest values in an IP-based workflow is the ability to reduce location based workflows meaning that IP allows for more location independent operations. IP-based workflows will allow talent to remain in larger metropolitan areas where overall employment cost are higher, but will allow for production teams to be located in lower cost locations in the countries. This will also allow for technology and its support personnel also to be located in lower cost areas of the country. Steve Reynolds, CEO, Imagine Communications: IP increasingly makes economic sense for operations of all sizes and is helping accelerate the move toward remote and cloud-based production thanks to SMPTE ST 2110 and the native IP protocols used for contribution to cloud. The natural synthesis between 2110 and JPEG XS was proven on the world stage at the Paris Games, and we’ve also seen extensive use of H.264 via SRT in cases where the cost vs. bandwidth trade-off favors higher compression. These advancements not only exceeded expectations, but also established valuable proof points and case studies, which will help drive broader industry adoption. Vincent Noyer, director of product marketing, Lynx Technik: IP-based workflows open the door for improved lower-tier sport leagues coverage by eliminating the need for a full production unit. The live audio commentary, graphic overlays, and even full production can often be managed remotely. The flexibility and reduced entry cost make live broadcasts of niche market events more competitive. Technical Standards & Implementation Russell Johnson, director, Hitomi Broadcast: While IP adoption was initially held back by complexity and fear factors, we’ve now reached a tipping point where expertise has grown and the benefits are clear.

IP-based systems also make it easier to achieve remote and cloud-based production, enabling broadcasters to scale operations efficiently. Anupama Anantharaman, VP, product management, Interra Systems: On the content production side, the move to all-IP will require broadcasters to make upfront investments in new hardware and software — such as ST 2110 systems and live and VOD stream monitoring tools — while prioritizing security, low latency, and interoperability. These considerations are expected to enhance production quality and streamline operations through AI-driven tools. Remote Production Benefits Sergio Ammirata, founder and chief scientist, SipRadius: Remote production of live content is transformative. Sending only minimal crews to an event and streaming all sources back to a central production base slashes the cost and carbon footprint, and massively boosts the utilization of expensive production technology. To be successful, production technologists need to add to their skillsets network and transport stream skills, aided by highly automated systems. Ciro Noronha, president, The RIST Forum: IP transport allows broadcasters and content providers to work entirely remotely if needed. There are a few advantages to this, including less need to transport staff and less power-down time leading to better equipment utilization. Many broadcasters are already seeing advances in compression and bandwidth availability, not to mention the rise of sophisticated transport protocols, allowing remote production to become a reality. Sergio Brighel, EVP, robotics and prompting technology, Videndum: IP workflows allow media assets to be managed, distributed, and edited from anywhere, facilitating remote collaboration. Distributed production models will allow broadcasters to scale across interconnected studios over any distance, improving adaptability and reducing environmental impact. Fundamental parts of this model are growth in cloud base production and 5G streaming. Robin Kirchhoffer, CMO, Dalet: Building upon the success of the Paris Olympics, IP-based workflows will continue to revolutionize content production by unlocking new programming opportunities and enhancing operational flexibility. These workflows enable broadcasters to capture and produce news, sports, and other live events at scale and on the fly (e.g. editing growing files), accelerating the delivery of content and the reach of new audiences. Additionally, the elasticity in operations allows for scalable and efficient resource management, adapting to varying demands. This allows for TCO reduction, avoiding large investments in hardware and infrastructure based on peak usage. Operational Flexibility & Scalability Andy Rayner, CTO, Appear: IP-based workflows will drive faster, more collaborative, and geographically dispersed production models, breaking free from the limitations of traditional hardware.

What emerging trends will have the biggest impact on broadcasting in the year ahead? AI & Automation Impact Jan Weigner, CTO, Cinegy: AI is steadily chipping away at broadcast production in every corner: subtitles, VFX, sound effects, dubbing, music, scripts, editing, video generation, restoration, virtual avatars, logging – you name it. This will be a continuous process eating into existing workflows (read: jobs) — or if you prefer the positive spin: accelerating time-intensive processes and freeing creative resources to achieve more in less time. On the delivery side, it depends whether you can swap out content and at what level. AI will drive everything from ad placement to scheduling to what shows up in your streaming menu. For linear channels, it comes down to how granular you can get with regional, local or hyper-local ad insertion. With streaming, it’s all about tracking individual viewers. Welcome to the personalized future. Bea Alonso, independent media tech consultant and strategic advisor on behalf of Grithaus Agency: AI-powered tools are quickly — and often silently — becoming part of day-to-day workflows, like newsroom scripting, video clipping and highlights editing, language translation, basic subtitle generation, compliance image detection, and more. These technologies create time savings and efficiencies, enabling media companies to deliver more content in less time. No doubt this will also impact roles in the industry, with manual tasks becoming automated and users needing to develop new skills. Sergio Brighel, EVP, robotics and prompting technology, Videndum: Emerging trends in broadcasting in 2025 are likely to centre around immersive technologies (AR, VR and mixed reality), AI-driven automation (advances in auto-directing and automated cameras), personalized content delivery, and cloud-based workflows. Our work to create a potential revolutionary ingress point for intelligent and flexible automation in Studios is well represented by our VEGA robotic control platform and Autoscript Voice Presenter/Director. Other trends will be 5G streaming and sustainability. Tim Jackson, SVP, sales and marketing, Globecast: What emerging trends will have the biggest impact in broadcast in 2025? Greater intelligence (let’s not call it AI) across the spectrum will provide an opportunity for an increase in quality control and operational efficiencies. The features of monitoring tools and ability to be more efficient with quality control (QC) can augment the human component and make the use of labor more efficient. Advertisement Infrastructure & Technical Evolution Vincent Noyer, director of product marketing, Lynx Technik: ST-2110-22 (with low latency and visually lossless compression) paired with NMOS-compatible devices for automated discovery and connection management is set to simplify and accelerate ST 2110 adoption. By lowering technical barriers to entry, the combination has the potential to capture market share from other IP solutions. Erling Hedkvist, sales and business development, Arkona Technologies and Manifold Technologies: Transformation to IP-based infrastructures in broadcasting continued in 2024 and will into the future. At the center is growing reliance on software-defined processing, virtualized environments and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies, shifting from hardware-heavy setups to flexible, software-centric systems. For example, the new Virtual OB concept, seen in Paris this past summer, is a software driven, virtualized solution at the highest level that successfully used COTS servers instead of trucks or flypacks. Ciro Noronha, president, The RIST Forum: In 2025, the emerging trends in broadcasting will likely include the move towards remote production, specifically fueled by the availability of equipment, bandwidth and the rise of suitable transport protocols such as RIST. The availability of new technologies in the content distribution space will sky-rocket the opportunities available to the remote production industry and will continue to grow in importance for many years to come. Sid Stanley, general manager, Calrec: The last few years have been all about building more remote and distributed workflows, and that will continue into 2025, we should expect there to be more elements of these workflows located in the cloud. This might be augmenting an existing console with additional processing, mixing in parallel with cloud-based playout to deliver a single transmission mix, or even accessing a virtualized mixer alongside existing technologies. Since the launch of Calrec’s cloud-based ImPulseV core at IBC, we’ve been working with broadcasters to deliver more and more workable implementations. Content Personalization & Advertising Peter Docherty, CTO and founder, ThinkAnalytics: We expect to see a continual rise in contextual and addressable advertising as advertisers prepare for the long-awaited death of cookies and the benefits of targeting contextually and/or addressably continue to rise. At the same time, Walmart’s acquisition of Vizio earlier this year demonstrated the increasing importance of data for advertising and the cost of ad substitution is falling. This carrot and stick environment make targeted advertising in either of these forms ripe for mainstream in 2025. Steve Reynolds, CEO, Imagine Communications: The biggest impact on broadcasting in 2025 may surprisingly come from bucking the trend, as media companies — even digital natives — rediscover linear as a way to drive ROI and TCO. Amazon’s decision to live stream NFL “Thursday Night Football” paired with linear ad sales demonstrates the enduring value of linear TV in reaching broad audiences and driving monetization. With emerging ad tech innovations, it’s possible for big brands to purchase ads that guarantee category exclusivity during a commercial break in the digital environment — something that was previously limited to linear TV. Meghna Krishna, chief revenue officer, Magnifi: Something that is already swamping the industry is Mobile eSports. We anticipate a continued surge in global streaming numbers, fueled by strong growth in Latin America and Southeast Asia, bringing the global audience closer to a billion. With AI and big data, we’ll see a revolution in audience engagement. We’ll have hyper-personalized content, smarter ad targeting, and algorithms that predict what viewers want; retail media integration, led by giants like Amazon and Walmart, will transform advertising strategies using shopper data.

As one of the most influential and talked about emerging trends, AI offers endless opportunities for the broadcast industry by providing unlimited ways to streamline workflows and become more cost-effective with existing resources. Additionally, creating consistent, engaging and dynamic content has always been a challenge for broadcasters, but with 2025 set to be “the year of the audience,” audience participation through remote guest appearances could very well be the answer to these requirements. Narayanan Rajan, CEO, Media Excel: In 2025, broadcasting will see the acceleration of artificial intelligence in content production, content localization, and long tail content mining. The growth of immersive technologies like multi-view, AR and VR will enable both richer and more personalized audience experiences as well as increased flexibility in production with virtual studios. The shift will continue to cloud native playout, IP and the adoption of 5G to enable more agile workflows, remote collaboration and reduced infrastructure investment. By utilizing consumer information, broadcasters will create personalized content offerings — from localized programming to dynamic ad delivery — that speak directly to individual tastes and behaviors. Personalized content can extend beyond just recommendations, allowing narratives or content formats to be adjusted in real time. Additionally, interactive advertising will become more sophisticated, leveraging personalized data to target the right audience at the right moment. For example, AI could allow the personalization of pre-roll ads or create dynamic, location-based campaigns for live events, increasing viewer engagement and enhancing ad performance. Business Model Evolution Gatis Gailis, CEO and founder, Veset: With the rise of streaming services dominating the industry, direct-to-consumer (DTC) growth has seen a surge of interest, with platforms such as Netflix, Disney+, YouTube and Paramount+ becoming popular among consumers. The proliferation of OTT platforms and niche streaming services has intensified in an appetite for DTC, which has also unlocked new content monetization streams through subscription models, ad-supported platforms and hybrid approaches. Michael Lantz, CEO, Accedo: I believe We will see improved content packaging in SVOD subscription services. Video services will be looking to package content and even adapt the UX depending on the type of content. It might, for example, involve giving viewers the option to pay for early access to content releases or staggered release dates depending on the subscription tier. I believe we will also see some services beginning to experiment with thematic packaging of content at different price points. Kristan Bullett, CEO, Humans Not Robots (HNR): The ongoing drive for cost optimization in technology operations will continue to have a strong impact, meaning fewer resources and the need to do more with less. As a result, productivity measurement will become crucial to ensure efficiency. However, this focus on measurement may not always remain a top priority due to factors like the HiPPO effect (highest paid person’s opinion) influencing decisions; balancing resource constraints with innovation will be a critical challenge for the industry. Costa Nikols, executive-team strategy advisor for media and entertainment, Telos Alliance: Product virtualization, improved workflow efficiency, and more cost-effective production solutions are front of mind. Virtualized communication systems are becoming increasingly common, replacing expensive, proprietary hardware with scalable, software-based solutions. Hybrid cloud models will also grow in popularity, offering broadcasters a balanced approach that blends private infrastructure for daily operations with public cloud services to handle peak demand.

Most are using AI to drive efficiencies in the backend, especially in media asset management and post-production. I expect we will see AI continue driving efficiencies in areas like user behavior analysis and ad targeting, as well as used to clip, edit, and distribute social media content faster, helping broadcasters engage audiences across more platforms more effectively. Derek Barrilleaux, CEO, Projective: AI vendors need to focus on concrete deliverables. Broad visionary promises sound compelling, but those tend to become vanity projects that don’t deliver real value to the organization. As the technology evolves and quick wins become possible, look for incremental solutions to point problems to become the first real success stories for AI. Michael Lantz, CEO, Accedo: As we move into 2025, we will see more focus on using AI for the real tangible benefits it can bring, especially around operational improvements. On the contrary, it is difficult to see a short term material shift in the core content production, where the legal implications will need to be settled before any major changes will take place. We will see further experimentation with AI in content production process, where in particular metadata, localization and quality assurance processes are already significantly impacted by new AI methods. Kristan Bullett, CEO, Humans Not Robots (HNR): We’ve moved beyond the peak of inflated expectations in the hype cycle, and generative AI now finds itself in the trough of disillusionment. However, despite the tempered enthusiasm, AI remains a powerful tool with the potential to drive cost savings and boost productivity. Content Creation & Post-Production Robin Kirchhoffer, CMO, Dalet: AI can provide new creative possibilities by offering innovative ways to produce, repurpose, and personalize content. At the same time, As AI continues to advance, it is key for broadcasters to address the prevalence of misleading online information by certifying the provenance of media content. Technical standards such as C2PA can be integrated into existing workflows and provide publishers, creators, and consumers the ability to trace the origin of different types of media. Bob Caniglia, director of sales operations, North America, Blackmagic Design: In post production, assistive AI is already transforming content creation and in 2025 will continue to revolutionize the post process and enhance storytelling by automating time-intensive tasks. For example, with DaVinci Resolve Studio’s DaVinci Neural Engine-backed AI tools, facial recognition technology can automatically detect, track, and organize footage based on individual faces, speeding up workflows for projects like documentaries and long-format films. Similarly, smart reframe tools intelligently resize and reposition footage to fit various aspect ratios, facilitating content repurposing across platforms. James Fraser, VP, U.S Sales, Moments Lab: Multimodal and generative AI is already transforming content production and delivery by automating the creation of video clips and highlights, as exemplified by Coca-Cola’s use of GenAI to create its iconic Christmas 2024 advertisement. On the delivery side, AI offers exciting possibilities for personalizing content to captivate audiences. Specifically, AI can leverage user data to create highly customized viewer experiences — for instance, by adapting the dialogue and visuals in content to fit regional or cultural preferences — thereby enhancing engagement and relevance. Martin Klampferer, director, R&D, Vizrt: In a set, new AI-based keying capabilities will create better immersion of talents in virtual environments, as well as more freedom in how AR graphics can be utilized. AI advancements can also impact storytelling, with the generative creation of assets or automatic highlight creation, for example the condensed highlight clips for social media platforms. It’s clear that AI will play a role in more personalized content delivery. James Eddershaw, managing director for Shotoku: AI increases automation and provides underlying support for face tracking, an important technology used in robotically controlled camera systems. There is also great potential for intelligent camera control that allows camera positions and angles to be predicted (or suggested) without necessarily being pre-programmed. Metadata & Media Asset Management Dana Forte, SVP product management and strategic partnerships, Vubiquity: One problem statement I find myself gravitating to is library reconciliation and cleanup. Library acquisitions are still a big topic, and the process of title identification, metadata enrichment, asset normalization, and delivery readiness are all key areas where generative AI is enabling efficiency. Sam Peterson, COO, Bitcentral: Advancements in generative AI are transforming content production and delivery by reshaping how media companies manage and utilize their archives. AI-powered tools analyze and enhance metadata, making vast content libraries more searchable and accessible. This enables faster discovery of assets to produce relevant content, streamline its adaptation for multiple platforms, and allows creative teams to focus more on storytelling instead of time-consuming tasks. Nick Anderson, product manager, DigitalGlue: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a valuable tool for assisting in the text-based elements of production and delivery. As the advancements in this area plateau, the development focus will begin to shift to targeted workflow solutions that focus on specific niche use cases, such as analyzing and repackaging content. Most importantly, these LLMs will emerge as middlemen for triggering API calls to handle a wide range of tasks that currently handle extensive knowledge in vendor-specific proprietary solutions. Neil Maycock, CCO, Pebble: Content rights and the data used by AI to create content are complex; it’s likely that broadcasters will want to own the AI content they use. In the playout environment, we see it as another tool to be integrated into seamless transmission under our automation. An example might be using a generative AI system to automate the creation of a “coming up next” promo, using graphics and a voiceover. Muralidhar Sridhar, SVP, AI and ML, Prime Focus Technologies: AI is revolutionizing industries like media, sports, marketing, and beyond by automating content creation, metadata enrichment, and distribution. With organizations now implementing AI into everyday processes, content production and delivery it is set to scale up at a rapid pace. This will result in a more robust content strategy for broadcasters, unlocking an omni-channel presence across markets. Workflow Optimization & Automation Sergio Ammirata, founder and chief scientist, SipRadius: The real advances in AI and machine learning will take place behind the scenes, in automating services which otherwise would be too unreliable. Remote production and delivery depends on sending deterministic, low latency, consistent streams across countries and continents. AI can learn the characteristics of a specific network routing, react instantly to dynamic changes, and manage services like RIST to ensure uninterrupted content delivery. Tim Jackson, SVP, sales and marketing, Globecast: A good way to look at this is to compare AI in broadcast to an autopilot in an airplane. Although the autopilot doesn’t replace the pilots, it does reduce workload and makes certain tasks more efficient and, indeed, smoother. Production will always have (at least it should) a human component for creative decision making but delivery, especially in the monitoring and control environment, is ripe for greater use of AI. Adam Leah, creative director, Nxtedition: The “boring AI” is already well-established, handling tasks like transcription, translation, and metadata identification. The next frontier is generative AI, which is currently in a phase of experimentation. Its ultimate impact will depend on the outcomes and practical applications of these ongoing experiments. Mathieu Planche, CEO, Witbe: Looking ahead, we anticipate AI implementation into video content to become increasingly refined and focused. Rather than simply trying to add AI to everything, organizations will focus on specific areas where AI can demonstrably improve efficiency, user experience, or content delivery, as well as further the blending of QA and video operations teams when it comes to video testing. This is part of a broader industry movement toward accelerated workflows and practical optimizations instead of technical maximalism. Advertising & Personalization Sergio Brighel, EVP, robotics and prompting technology, Videndum: Advancements in AI are expected to transform the delivery of advertising by enabling more targeted, context-aware ad placements. AI can analyze content in real-time to serve ads that are relevant to the specific scenes or themes being viewed, allowing for highly personalized advertising experiences. This automation of content tagging and ad matching not only improves ad relevance but also expands the reach and efficiency of advertisers, creating more engaging and effective campaigns. Yang Cai, CEO and president of VisualOn: Advancements in AI are revolutionizing video streaming by automating content creation, enhancing personalization, and optimizing video quality and delivery. AI enables more dynamic, interactive experiences, like real-time content adjustments, personalized recommendations, and immersive VR/AR environments, while also improving accessibility through AI-generated translations and subtitles.

Costa Nikols, executive-team strategy advisor for media and entertainment, Telos Alliance: Promising developments in AI are poised to benefit content production and delivery by automating key processes and enabling more personalized viewer experiences. With Next Generation Audio (NGA) quickly gaining traction, broadcasters need to look into ways they can enhance audio quality to maximize the content. Leveraging AI technology can be one way broadcasters can look to make their mark by offering personalized and optimized audio content which corrects and clarifies audio mixes in real-time. Having clear dialogue that viewers can adjust according to their preferences becomes a key differentiator in content production and technology by keeping audiences immersed in their viewing experience. Gatis Gailis, CEO and founder, Veset: AI has already started to make its mark on the industry, with content providers and vendors introducing the technology in their workflows in multiple ways for automated content delivery, data analytics and advertising, for example. AI powered automation will likely see a huge increase in 2025, with more vendors realizing the benefits of AI-powered monetization, analytics management and content workflow assistance. What innovations in content delivery infrastructure are expected in the coming twelve months? Thorsten Sauer, CEO, Pixel Power: I think we’re going to need greater standardization here, and I expect to see the vendor community offering more secure and robust frameworks for delivery that help to automate things like QC and metadata. The content delivery process has traditionally required lots of (wasteful) manual intervention and it’s an area that is ripe of improvement. It’s also clear that moving content around via FTP or sending hard drives via courier is not the answer, so we’d all welcome solutions that improve security and speed up the verification, acceptance and delivery process. Sergio Ammirata, founder and chief scientist, SipRadius: WebRTC will become widespread and readily integrated, moving it into the mainstream. WebRTC is an open standard for realtime communication between peers, potentially carrying high quality stable streams with very low latency – sub one second. James Cranfield, VP, sales and partnerships, Cinedeck: Perhaps the biggest innovation in content delivery infrastructure we will see in 2025, although not new, is the development and roll-out of unified content management systems. This trend will be particularly interesting to see being implemented in cloud-based production workflows, especially with the rise of content personalization influenced by AI-driven user data and analytics. There is a considerable demand for content management and delivery systems to be accessible in one place, and this is something that content management systems will address in the coming year. Anupama Anantharaman, VP, product management, Interra Systems: Advancements in video compression standards like AV1 and VVC are expected to achieve broader adoption in 2025. There will likely be an increased focus on cloud-native architectures, cutting-edge technologies to minimize latency, and more efficient methods for ensuring stream quality. Additionally, AI-powered personalization, analytics, and automated quality assurance will enable broadcasters to customize content, boost viewer engagement, and deliver uninterrupted, high-quality streaming experiences. Russell Johnson, director, Hitomi Broadcast: Native ST 2110 installations will become the norm rather than the exception, replacing hybrid SDI/IP setups. However, managing colour accuracy in HDR workflows remains challenging, with ongoing industry debate about appropriate lookup tables and the need for precise measurement throughout the broadcast chain. Yang Cai, CEO and president of VisualOn: To enhance efficiency, content delivery infrastructure will leverage edge computing to process and store data closer to users, reducing latency. Additionally, AI-driven encoding will optimize bitrates, manage bandwidth, and allocate resources, ensuring smooth playback, especially during peak demand. Gatis Gailis, CEO and founder, Veset: This will come as no surprise, but AI and machine learning (ML) will continue to enhance content delivery, optimizing streaming quality, personalizing viewer experiences and automating content management processes. The rollout of 5G technology will also significantly improve content delivery speeds, reducing latency and enabling smoother streaming experiences. This will be particularly noticeable among high-definition immersive content such as VR and AR. Neil Maycock, CCO, Pebble: The main area of innovation in content delivery infrastructure is enabling broadcasters to leverage the infrastructure that best meets their operational requirements while optimizing costs. Providing a common playout solution that seamlessly operates across hybrid infrastructures is becoming increasingly important, offering broadcasters the flexibility to adapt while ensuring operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Steven Edwards, VP, broadcast distribution, Rohde & Schwarz: We are seeing an acceleration in applications around datacasting and using broadcast networks to deliver more than just media. Applications include software updates to automotive platforms or even positioning and timing data with increased accuracy. This data needs to be planned and orchestrated, so scheduling becomes important, and we are providing solutions further behind the transmitter, both on-premises and in the cloud. Sanjay Duda, CEO, Planetcast Media Services: Expect advancements in platform as a service (PaaS) offerings, server-side ad insertion (SSAI), AI-driven localization, and metadata-enhanced workflows. Tools like Planetcast’s NexC platform simplify multi-channel processing, delivery, and monetization while enhancing agility and cost efficiency. Innovations in unified media services will help broadcasters handle the complexity of modern distribution landscapes​​. Michael Demb, VP, product strategy, TAG Video Systems: Expect to see a rise in edge computing for reduced latency and personalized content delivery, along with wider adoption of new low latency ABR technologies for efficient streaming to large audiences. AI and machine learning will also play a greater role in optimizing content delivery and predicting network congestion. Nick Anderson, product manager, DigitalGlue: Support for SRT will continue to progress across vendors and organizations, hopefully catching up to NDI to provide a more open standard for delivery. With both cameras and video editing applications supporting transmission, organizations will need to revisit a tape-like mentality for media handling to properly leverage the benefits over file-based delivery. Instead of point to point file transfers, a SRT can multicast content on the network for multiple systems to receive in real-time and record to a file. Suzana Brady, SVP, worldwide sales and marketing, Cobalt Digital: A general increase in available transmission bandwidth, coupled with advances in compression technology. The technologies to watch for are anything that provides ubiquitous high bandwidth (5G, fiber access everywhere, etc.), transport protocols with high security and low latency, such as RIST, and low latency CODECs such as JPEG-XS, HTJ2K, and special HEVC modes. 5G is great for on-the-spot transmission of high-quality live material, and advances in 5G will make the bandwidth more reliably available. How will IP-based workflows continue to shape content production in the future? Economic & Business Impact Thorsten Sauer, CEO, Pixel Power: The halcyon world of real-time live production in the cloud hasn’t really materialized yet. Cloud storage is a stubbornly expensive proposition (especially as camera technology evolves and file sizes keep growing), and much of the world still wants the security of on-premise solutions (that have already been bought and paid for). IP-based workflows look great in theory – who doesn’t like the idea of sharing/collaborating/producing and delivering content remotely? – but the truth is that hybrid models will persist for many years to come until the process of moving content around in the cloud becomes cheaper, faster and safer. Philip Grossman, VP, business development and solutions architecture, DigitalGlue: One of the greatest values in an IP-based workflow is the ability to reduce location based workflows meaning that IP allows for more location independent operations. IP-based workflows will allow talent to remain in larger metropolitan areas where overall employment cost are higher, but will allow for production teams to be located in lower cost locations in the countries. This will also allow for technology and its support personnel also to be located in lower cost areas of the country. Steve Reynolds, CEO, Imagine Communications: IP increasingly makes economic sense for operations of all sizes and is helping accelerate the move toward remote and cloud-based production thanks to SMPTE ST 2110 and the native IP protocols used for contribution to cloud. The natural synthesis between 2110 and JPEG XS was proven on the world stage at the Paris Games, and we’ve also seen extensive use of H.264 via SRT in cases where the cost vs. bandwidth trade-off favors higher compression. These advancements not only exceeded expectations, but also established valuable proof points and case studies, which will help drive broader industry adoption. Vincent Noyer, director of product marketing, Lynx Technik: IP-based workflows open the door for improved lower-tier sport leagues coverage by eliminating the need for a full production unit. The live audio commentary, graphic overlays, and even full production can often be managed remotely. The flexibility and reduced entry cost make live broadcasts of niche market events more competitive. Technical Standards & Implementation Russell Johnson, director, Hitomi Broadcast: While IP adoption was initially held back by complexity and fear factors, we’ve now reached a tipping point where expertise has grown and the benefits are clear. The challenge has shifted from ‘should we adopt IP?’ to managing the increased complexity of timing and synchronization in IP environments. Sid Stanley, general manager, Calrec: IP has proved to be the main enabler for flexibility across the entire broadcast industry, and the uptake of IP technology is allowing broadcasters to stay ahead of the game. Cost effective to install and providing the ability to move many hundreds of signals down a single cable at low latency, the widespread adoption of SMPTE 2110 and NMOS is encouraging interoperability between multiple manufacturers, as well as the potential to create scalable workflows, enable remote working and deliver continuous development. With most broadcasters making the switch to IP at a pace that suits their unique workflows, Gateway products have helped bridge the gap to hybrid environments generating an increase in high-quality content in more cost-effective ways. Tsviako Jongov, product manager, MainConcept: As broadcasters adopt IP technology, they gain enhanced flexibility, scalability, and efficiency. One key enabler of this transformation is JPEG XS, a pioneering low-compression video codec designed for live IP transmission. Its ability to deliver high-quality video with minimal latency makes it an essential tool in today’s broadcast environments. Costa Nikols, executive-team strategy advisor for media and entertainment, Telos Alliance: The advancement and adoption of IP standards like SMPTE ST2110 and AoIP simplify production architectures by removing the need for proprietary hardware. This transition allows broadcasters to reduce costs while increasing flexibility, scalability, and collaboration across geographically dispersed teams. IP-based systems also make it easier to achieve remote and cloud-based production, enabling broadcasters to scale operations efficiently. Anupama Anantharaman, VP, product management, Interra Systems: On the content production side, the move to all-IP will require broadcasters to make upfront investments in new hardware and software — such as ST 2110 systems and live and VOD stream monitoring tools — while prioritizing security, low latency, and interoperability. These considerations are expected to enhance production quality and streamline operations through AI-driven tools. Remote Production Benefits Sergio Ammirata, founder and chief scientist, SipRadius: Remote production of live content is transformative. Sending only minimal crews to an event and streaming all sources back to a central production base slashes the cost and carbon footprint, and massively boosts the utilization of expensive production technology. To be successful, production technologists need to add to their skillsets network and transport stream skills, aided by highly automated systems. Ciro Noronha, president, The RIST Forum: IP transport allows broadcasters and content providers to work entirely remotely if needed. There are a few advantages to this, including less need to transport staff and less power-down time leading to better equipment utilization. Many broadcasters are already seeing advances in compression and bandwidth availability, not to mention the rise of sophisticated transport protocols, allowing remote production to become a reality. Sergio Brighel, EVP, robotics and prompting technology, Videndum: IP workflows allow media assets to be managed, distributed, and edited from anywhere, facilitating remote collaboration. Distributed production models will allow broadcasters to scale across interconnected studios over any distance, improving adaptability and reducing environmental impact. Fundamental parts of this model are growth in cloud base production and 5G streaming. Robin Kirchhoffer, CMO, Dalet: Building upon the success of the Paris Olympics, IP-based workflows will continue to revolutionize content production by unlocking new programming opportunities and enhancing operational flexibility. These workflows enable broadcasters to capture and produce news, sports, and other live events at scale and on the fly (e.g. editing growing files), accelerating the delivery of content and the reach of new audiences. Additionally, the elasticity in operations allows for scalable and efficient resource management, adapting to varying demands. This allows for TCO reduction, avoiding large investments in hardware and infrastructure based on peak usage. Operational Flexibility & Scalability Andy Rayner, CTO, Appear: IP-based workflows will drive faster, more collaborative, and geographically dispersed production models, breaking free from the limitations of traditional hardware. They offer greater scalability, lower latency, and cost savings, especially when paired with advanced compression and security technologies. Appear’s hardware-accelerated SRT (Secure Reliable Transport) ensures ultra-low latency and robust, secure content delivery, even in unpredictable network conditions. Increasingly, broadcasters and operators are looking to slash cap-ex and reduce op-ex through spin-up/down pay-as-you-use workflows and functionality, further solidifying the role of IP as the backbone of modern production environments. Sanjay Duda, CEO, Planetcast Media Services: The adoption of IP-based workflows will accelerate in 2025, driven by cloud-first technologies for content management, playout, distribution, and monetization. IP-based setups offer unparalleled flexibility and scalability, allowing seamless integration across live, linear, and on-demand channels. These workflows foster real-time collaboration, enable dynamic content customization, and reduce latency and operational costs​​. Michael Demb, VP, product strategy, TAG Video Systems: The transition to IP-based workflows represents a significant leap forward but comes with a complexity that can be daunting. Comprehensive tools that address diverse operations and can handle different requirements are necessary, whether it’s handling a wide variety of media formats and integrations or tackling different methods and objectives. While recent innovations and demand for more high-quality content (HDR, 4K) have overcome common challenges to efficient IP-based workflows. Richard Rees, CEO, QuickLink: IP-based workflows will continue to shape content production, because it allows for streamlined operations, increased flexibility and remote integration. It also provides cost-efficiency, increased-quality, interoperability and cross-platform capabilities.

YouTube alone now features over one billion hours of watched content every day. The world of video production is evolving rapidly, with an ever-changing audience. Keeping up with the latest trends will help ensure that your video content reaches your target audience. In this article, we reveal the latest trends in video production for 2025. Trend 1: The Rise Of AI & Machine Learning Artificial Intelligence offers a new level of automation in video editing. By utilizing advanced algorithms and machine learning, AI offers several new developments, including: Automated Film Editing Video footage can now be automatically analyzed, and repetitive tasks can be handled quickly. This means that video producers can save time and effort when it comes to their post-production services. AI can also enhance your video quality by making precise adjustments that the human eye may miss. Personalized Video Content AI algorithms can create personalized video content based on analyzing viewer data. This is beneficial to target your required audience with gripping content. It’s important to note that although AI offers some useful benefits, it can’t replace the professionalism of professional video production services. Experienced film producers will also carry the experience, skill, and creative objectivity that are required for engaging video content. Trend 2: Augmented Reality In Video Production Is Growing Augmented reality (AR) can take video production to a whole new level. By combining the beauty of video with the magic of a real-life experience, AR is set to play a considerable role in cinema going forward. Virtual Production Sets These enable producers to create realism in their environments without the reliance on physical sets. Digital backgrounds reduce the cost and time taken in set production. Virtual Scouting AR allows filmmakers to scout locations virtually. They’re also able to overlay digital elements onto locations to see how they will all fit in. Real-Time Effects AR enables real-time CGI integration for live shots. Producers can see how digital elements will appear, lightening the load on post-production. Trend 3: Short-Form Content Dominance Research has shown that attention spans are dropping, which makes short-form content more appealing. Currently, approximately 90% of all internet is focused on short films. This reveals a growing trend towards engaging, quick content. Finding the right Chicago video production company that understands the short video market will help increase your reach. Here are the latest short-form trends. TikTok & Instagram Reels Platforms such as Instagram and TikTok are shaping the way people view video content. With reels becoming increasingly popular, video producers will need to continue to adapt to this trend. With the majority of video content consumed on mobile devices, there is a growing utilization of vertical video format. Optimizing your content for vertical viewing will help garner increased viewing traffic. Fast Cutting Short-form video content requires what is known as fast-cutting editing. This is the process of cutting several shots in quick succession. Fast cutting helps to retain the viewer’s attention for longer with quick cut storytelling. Getting fast cutting right should always be entrusted to a Chicago video production company. Shoppable Videos These allow viewers to buy products directly from a short video. Customers are able to see products being used or worn in real-time video, with the ability to add them to their cart instantly. Unboxing and review videos are helping to shape the way that consumers are shopping. Trend 4: Live Streaming Live-streaming brings real-time action onto the viewer’s screen. With more live-streaming platforms available, live-streaming is becoming more accessible. It offers a faster turnaround time with authentic, real-time viewer interaction. Interactions can include polls, real-time chat, and Q & A Sessions. Trend 5: The Rise Of Influencers Social media influencers are becoming increasingly dominant in the use of media. Younger people are participating more in online reviewing, trends, and challenges, all in the hope of going viral. Influencers who rise to fame engage in paid partnerships and sponsorships to help promote products. Finding a connected Chicago video production company could mean that you find the right influencer to take your project forward. Trend 6: Growth In Audio-less Videos The majority of videos are watched without audio. With many people relying on public transport, and viewing content with people around, they are doing so without audio. With others experiencing hearing difficulties, it’s best to avoid the risk of your video being skipped. Videos with captions will therefore be accessible to a wider range of people. In many videos, subtitles are becoming more of a norm than the exception. Trend 7: Sustainability & Ethical Video Production The rise of sustainable practice throughout the world is also apparent within filmmaking. Producers are giving increasingly more attention to how they can reduce energy consumption and utilize sustainable materials. Ethical considerations such as fair labor practices and diversity are also being increasingly adopted. Be sure to ask your video production company about the sustainable practices they’re incorporating.

      "content": "How AI is Shaping Media & Entertainment in 2025 - VideoNuze VideoNuze Close Posts News Roundup Podcasts Perspectives Events Categories How AI is Shaping Media & Entertainment in 2025 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Friday, December 20, 2024, 10:33 AM ET Posted by: Albert Lai Global Director for Media & Entertainment, Google Cloud The media and entertainment industry was abuzz with excitement over generative AI in 2023. Companies, driven by curiosity and a sense of urgency, began experimenting with this new technology, exploring its potential to disrupt the industry and transform themselves. This period of exploration and innovation quickly yielded tangible results, and by 2024, many companies successfully implemented AI solutions with measurable ROI and turned the AI conversation from “if” to “when”. This rapid progress paves the way for 2025, where we anticipate a significant shift towards deeper AI integration. Leading media and entertainment companies are expected to establish dedicated AI Centers of Excellence, embedding AI capabilities directly into their workflows from the start, orienting to an “AI-first” approach rather than “AI-after”. This strategic move will enable companies to fully harness AI's potential, driving innovation, efficiency, and growth across all aspects of their businesses. This journey from initial experimentation to the establishment of dedicated AI centers highlights the industry's adaptability and commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancement. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more transformative changes, solidifying its role as a driving force in the future of media and entertainment. The future of personalized, interactive, and accessible media experiences is powered by multimodal AI models Multimodal AI models are redefining our interaction with media by enabling a new level of creative assistance. The integration of text, audio, images, video, and music understanding into AI will empower both professionals and everyday users to understand, generate, and modify content like never before. This democratization of AI-driven tools will personalize and enrich media from creation to consumption. Behind the scenes, content creators will harness the power of multimodal AI to optimize production workflows and explore new artistic avenues. Imagine video editing becoming intuitive and effortless by leveraging your voice in a conversational interface along with your gestures. AI will also play an important role in enhancing accessibility. The ability to seamlessly caption, translate, and dub content and to create audio descriptions will break down barriers. Content will become universally available and globally monetizable. Multimodal AI will be key in transforming media from passive consumption to being an interactive, personalized, and inclusive experience for all. From movie recommendations tailored to individual tastes to interactive narratives that evolve based on user input, content will become dynamic and adaptable. AI agents empower M&E with AI-driven insights and decision-making The emergence of AI-powered content agents will bring new capabilities to the entire media supply chain. These intelligent agents will empower companies and creatives to streamline content creation, reducing both costs and time to market, while also extracting valuable insights from content for search and monetization purposes. By leveraging data-driven decision-making, AI agents will identify workflow bottlenecks, enhance content moderation efforts, and personalize content distribution to reach global audiences effectively. And through deep analysis of audience preferences and market trends, these agents will enable creators to craft timely and relevant content, tailor marketing campaigns for maximum impact, and equip leadership with the information needed to make informed investment decisions. In a landscape defined by increasing competition for consumer attention, AI-powered content agents will serve as a strategic advantage, driving growth and success across the media and entertainment sector. AI-powered experiences transform keywords into context, and transform passive into personalized AI will unlock the value of siloed data within the enterprise, enabling a more intuitive search experience. By harnessing the power of AI, employees can go beyond traditional approaches dependent on text keywords and structured query languages. Using a variety of input modalities, employees can search, understand, and visualize the vast set of information across their entire company and effortlessly activate business insights. Need to communicate the information or update colleagues – leverage AI to help generate the documents, emails, images, graphs, slides, and even video. Customer experiences in the media and entertainment industry will transform, evolving from passive consumption into personalized conversations, thanks to the power of AI. Imagine AI-powered assistants readily available to answer queries in multiple languages, proactively engaging consumers before technical problems arise to suggest next best action to minimize future problems, and anticipating needs and recommending new services or content based on previous viewing habits. AI's semantic understanding will enable it to decode the true intent behind each consumer action, taking into account nuances of language, contextual factors, and user preferences to deliver highly personalized and relevant content search and recommendations. Whether it's finding the perfect movie for a Friday night, discovering new music to match your current mood, or highlighting the most relevant financial articles based on your interests over the past week, AI-powered search and recommendations will make it easier than ever to find the information you need, when you need it, and on any device. By leveraging AI's ability to understand and anticipate consumer needs, companies can foster deeper engagement and loyalty with real-time feedback and analysis that enables companies to adapt content and experiences on the fly, ensuring every interaction is seamless and enjoyable. Reshaping how media is created – responsibility – with human creativity at the core 2025 promises to be a year of transformative change in media and entertainment, driven by advancements in AI. From multimodal experiences and AI agents to enhanced search capabilities and deepfake technologies, AI will reshape how content is created, consumed, and experienced. For the media industry, AI is described as revolutionary, and it’s incumbent on all of us to revolutionize, responsibly. Human creativity and ingenuity are essential. The ability to connect with audiences on an emotional level, to tell compelling stories, and to inject unique perspectives into content are qualities that AI cannot replicate. Companies leading this transformation will use AI to augment creativity with new tools and capabilities, allowing creatives to push the boundaries of their craft and bring their visions to life in exciting new ways. This collaborative approach, where human creativity is supported and amplified by AI, will be crucial to unlocking the full potential of media and entertainment in the years to come.

Ethical Considerations: Navigating the AI Landscape When it comes to AI in marketing, we can’t just dive in headfirst without thinking about the ethical waters we’re swimming in.

Ethics committees: Some companies are forming committees to oversee AI practices. It’s like having a watchdog for your data. Consumer feedback: Listening to what customers think about AI practices can help brands improve and build trust. Balancing Efficiency with Human Touch Job displacement: While AI can make things easier, it can also take jobs. Companies should think about reskilling their workforce to adapt to these changes. Human oversight: Many people believe that AI needs a human touch to ensure ethical practices. After all, machines don’t have feelings. Consumer demand for realness: People want authentic interactions, so brands need to find a balance between automation and the human experience. As we move into 2025, the focus will be on how brands can build trust and confidence in AI while navigating the tricky waters of ethics and regulations.

This allows marketers to allocate resources to more strategic initiatives. In 2025, expect to see a world where AI handles the heavy lifting of content creation, freeing up marketers to focus on what really matters: connecting with their audience. So, buckle up! The future of content creation is not just about speed; it’s about creating meaningful connections with your audience, all thanks to the wonders of generative AI. Get ready to embrace this change, or risk being left behind! AI in Crisis Management: Proactive Protection In today’s fast-paced digital world, a single tweet can spark a full-blown PR disaster. By 2025, AI will be your brand’s best friend in crisis management. Imagine having an AI system that’s always on the lookout, monitoring online chatter and spotting potential crises before they blow up. If things start to go south, the AI can whip up responses faster than you can say “oops!” and tailor them to fit the situation. Monitoring Online Sentiment Real-time tracking: AI keeps an eye on social media and online reviews, so you know what people are saying about your brand. Early warning system: It alerts you to negative trends before they escalate, giving you a chance to act. Data-driven insights: AI analyzes patterns in customer feedback to help you understand the root of the problem. Rapid Response Strategies Instant response plans: When a crisis hits, AI can suggest ready-made responses that fit the tone of the situation. Adaptable messaging: The AI can tweak the message based on the audience and the nature of the crisis. Continuous learning: It learns from past crises to improve future responses. Maintaining Consumer Trust In a world where trust is everything, being proactive can save your brand from a meltdown. With AI in your corner, you can tackle issues head-on, minimizing damage and keeping your audience’s trust intact. Imagine a scenario where your AI spots a spike in negative comments after a product launch. Within minutes, it identifies the issue and has a response plan ready to go. Talk about being prepared! So, as we gear up for 2025, remember: AI isn’t just about making things easier; it’s about making sure your brand stays strong, even when the going gets tough. Crisis management will never be the same again! The Battle for Authenticity: AI vs. Human Content AI-Generated Visuals and Videos In 2025, the line between human and AI-generated content will be so blurred that you might not even know if that influencer you’re following is real or just a super-smart algorithm. AI can whip up lifelike images and videos that look like they were made by a human. It’s like having a digital twin that can do all the cool stuff without needing a coffee break! Consumer Demand for Realness But here’s the kicker: while AI is getting better at creating content, people are craving authenticity. They want the real deal—the behind-the-scenes footage, the unpolished vlogs, and the content that feels genuine. It’s like the difference between a perfectly staged photo and a candid shot of your friend making a goofy face. Balancing Efficiency with Human Touch Marketers are going to have to juggle this new reality. Here are some things to keep in mind: Embrace imperfections: Sometimes, a little messiness makes content relatable. Use AI wisely: Let AI handle the heavy lifting, but don’t forget to sprinkle in some human creativity. Engage with your audience: Real conversations can’t be replaced by algorithms. In a world where everything is polished and perfect, the real stuff stands out. Don’t underestimate the power of being human in a sea of AI-generated content! So, as we head into 2025, the challenge will be finding that sweet spot between the efficiency of AI and the warmth of human connection. It’s a balancing act, but hey, that’s what makes marketing fun! AI’s Impact on Visual and Graphic Design AI as a Creative Partner In 2025, AI isn’t just a tool; it’s like having a creative buddy who never sleeps. Imagine an AI that can analyze your brand’s vibe and whip up a whole set of marketing materials in no time. This means faster designs and more time for you to sip coffee and brainstorm ideas. Instant Visual Concepts With AI, you can generate a bunch of visual concepts in minutes. Think about it: a brand launching a new product can have multiple design options ready to go, all tailored to their style. This collaboration between AI and human designers is pushing the limits of creativity, making marketing campaigns more eye-catching and memorable. Enhancing Brand Identity AI is also a game-changer for brand identity. It helps ensure that every visual element aligns perfectly with your brand’s message. Here’s a quick list of how AI can enhance your visual design: Consistency: Keeps your visuals aligned with your brand’s voice. Speed: Generates designs faster than you can say “deadline.” Innovation: Offers fresh ideas that you might not have thought of. In a world where everyone is fighting for attention, having AI on your side can make your brand stand out like a neon sign in a blackout. Conclusion So, whether you’re a small business or a big brand, embracing AI in your graphic design process can lead to innovative results. Just remember, while AI can do a lot, it’s the human touch that adds the soul to your designs. And let’s not forget, the graphic design trends for 2025 are all about AI collaboration, so hop on this train before it leaves the station! Ethical Considerations: Navigating the AI Landscape When it comes to AI in marketing, we can’t just dive in headfirst without thinking about the ethical waters we’re swimming in. Data privacy is a big deal—like, really big. Companies are collecting tons of data to personalize your experience, but how they handle that data is crucial. Here are some key points to consider: Data Privacy and Consumer Rights Transparency is key: Brands need to be upfront about how they collect and use your data. No one likes surprises when it comes to their personal info. Regulations matter: Laws like GDPR are here to protect you. Companies must comply or face serious consequences. Trust is everything: A breach in data privacy can lead to a loss of consumer trust, and let’s be honest, nobody wants to be the brand that loses its customers over a data scandal. Transparent AI Practices Clear guidelines: Companies should have clear policies on how they use AI. This includes everything from data collection to how AI makes decisions. Ethics committees: Some companies are forming committees to oversee AI practices. It’s like having a watchdog for your data. Consumer feedback: Listening to what customers think about AI practices can help brands improve and build trust. Balancing Efficiency with Human Touch Job displacement: While AI can make things easier, it can also take jobs. Companies should think about reskilling their workforce to adapt to these changes. Human oversight: Many people believe that AI needs a human touch to ensure ethical practices. After all, machines don’t have feelings. Consumer demand for realness: People want authentic interactions, so brands need to find a balance between automation and the human experience. As we move into 2025, the focus will be on how brands can build trust and confidence in AI while navigating the tricky waters of ethics and regulations. In short, while AI can make marketing feel like magic, it’s essential to keep an eye on the ethical implications. After all, nobody wants to be the villain in this story! As we explore the world of artificial intelligence, it’s crucial to think about the ethical choices we make. Understanding these issues helps us use AI responsibly.

While traditional TV still holds some ground, streaming platforms are defining how and where viewers tune in, as well as what content resonates most. For anyone looking to understand where streaming is headed, this article breaks down seven key streaming trends for 2025 that will help you keep up with changing viewer demands and position your content for success. 1. Growth of Localized Content: Think Global, Stream Local You’ve probably noticed that local shows are becoming big business. Viewers are increasingly choosing content that feels personal—whether that’s through language, culture, or local context. Netflix is a great example of this. They’ve invested heavily in producing shows and films in multiple languages and regional formats across the globe. From Money Heist in Spain to Squid Game in South Korea, Netflix has tapped into the value of local stories with universal appeal. The reason? Localized content often feels more relatable and authentic, making it a magnet for loyal viewers. Whether you’re broadcasting local news, sports, or even cooking shows with regional flavours, there’s an audience eager to engage with content that feels like “home”. To make this work, consider collaborating with local producers or offering dubbing and subtitling options to reach multiple language audiences. At Jet-Stream, we support multilingual streaming, so if you need help making your content accessible across regions, we’ve got you covered. 2. The Rise of Sports Streaming: Going Beyond Traditional TV Sports fans are moving online, and the rise of sports streaming is something you can’t afford to overlook. Younger audiences, especially, are no longer glued to cable TV; they’re finding their favourite teams and matches through digital platforms. It’s not just the major leagues like the NFL or Premier League that are benefiting—there’s a growing appetite for regional and niche sports, too. This opens up a big opportunity for sports organizations. If you are in charge of a sports club or league, consider launching your own digital streaming channels. Take Ajax, for example—they launched Ajax TV, which offers fans access to behind-the-scenes content, interviews, and more. Owning your channel not only gives you full control over your content but also opens up new revenue streams. 3. Ad-Supported Streaming Gains Traction: A Cost-Friendly Option Subscription fatigue is real. With so many paid services, more people are reconsidering how much they’re willing to spend on streaming. This is where ad-supported models are making a comeback. Platforms like Amazon Freevee (formerly IMDb TV), Peacock, and even Disney+ are proving that viewers are more than willing to watch a few ads if it means a lower bill. For you, this is a chance to tap into a wider audience by offering both ad-supported and premium options. Many viewers are already familiar with ad breaks from traditional TV, so the transition to ad-supported streaming feels natural. Consider combining this model with other monetization options, such as premium subscriptions or pay-per-view, to capture different segments of your audience. 4. Content Personalization: Keeping Audiences Hooked Another trend to keep on your radar is content personalization. As more platforms collect viewer data (with consent… or so we hope), they’re able to recommend shows, movies, and even news articles tailored to individual tastes. This is no longer just for the Netflixes of the world. You can use the same personalization tactics to engage your viewers. As a broadcaster, you can use personalization to recommend relevant content to your viewers based on their preferences, habits, or region. By showing your audience the right content at the right time, you can keep them coming back for more. This approach can increase engagement, grow your audience, and keep your viewers watching longer. 5. DRM for Content Protection: Keeping Content Secure As you increase your digital presence, piracy becomes a bigger concern. That’s where Digital Rights Management (DRM) comes in. Whether it’s movies, sports, or premium shows, keeping your content secure is crucial. We advise you not to overlook this aspect. In 2025, content protection will be just as important as the content itself. Securing your streaming rights ensures you protect your revenue and keep your assets safe from digital piracy. At Jet-Stream, we’ve automated the DRM process to make it easier for you to safeguard your content, so you can focus on growing your audience while we handle the security side. 6. Workflow Automation: Saving Time and Money Time is money, and the more content you produce or stream, the more complex your workflow gets. This is where automation comes into play. Instead of relying on expensive engineers to custom-build and manage cloud services, there are now standardized solutions available that allow you to create advanced workflows without all the hassle. For instance, with Jet-Stream Mix, you can easily set up and manage your streaming workflows—no need to build custom technology from scratch. This saves you both time and money, while also making your streaming operations more efficient. If you’re looking to streamline your workflows, get in touch with our experts or check out our Mix platform for more details. 7. Multi-Vendor Strategy: Freedom from Vendor Lock-In As recent years have shown, relying heavily on a single tech vendor can leave you vulnerable when services are discontinued. For example, when StackPath shut down its content delivery network (CDN) services in 2022, many companies were left scrambling for alternatives. Similarly, Microsoft’s Azure Media Services retired its platform in early 2024, affecting countless broadcasters who had to transition to a new provider to avoid disruptions. To avoid this kind of situation, it’s smart to adopt a multi-vendor strategy. By spreading your services across multiple providers, you reduce the risk of service outages and gain more flexibility in managing costs and features. With Jet-Stream Mix, you can modularly pick, use, and tune different services—integrating your own transcoders, origins, multi-CDNs, players, and analytics—all while staying in control. This ensures you’re not dependent on any single provider, giving you better uptime, cost control, and independence. In Conclusion Streaming is more dynamic than ever, and 2025 looks to bring even more opportunities for growth. Staying ahead means being open to change—whether that’s by offering more localized content, exploring ad-supported options, or building a more flexible tech setup. At Jet-Stream, we’re here to support your journey. As you plan for the year ahead, consider how these trends might fit into your strategy to expand your reach and engage your audience. There’s still time to reach out to us this year and start the next one with the right tools and strategies to make 2025 your best year yet. Let’s work together to get you ready for what’s ahead!

As a result, streaming is making incredible progress in becoming a multitrillion-dollar industry over the next decade. Looking ahead, 2025 will be a pivotal year that shapes the trajectory of the streaming ecosystem and who the likely winners and losers will be along the way. Here are my top three predictions for the trends defining streaming in 2025. The Rise Of Independent Creators On Streaming Platforms Independent content creators dominate studios on YouTube, TikTok and other online platforms. They produce authentic, spontaneous and innovative content that appeals to the unique sensibilities of Gen Z audiences in a way studio-led content companies just can’t match. To meet the demands of this influential audience, streaming platforms will increasingly partner with independent creators to feature their content alongside traditional studio productions. FAST platforms can offer independent creators and influencers a vehicle for experimenting with more “produced” content alongside studio-created productions. While this helps creators finance their projects and find new audiences, it also allows FAST platforms to demonstrate their commitment to providing audiences with the best content, regardless of its origins. Expect independent-focused FAST channels and creator-driven hubs to become more mainstream over the next year. These will give viewers a curated collection of high-quality independent content. It will also help advertisers capture more eyeballs and generate more revenue to invest in creator and studio content—a win for all parties. More Ad Spending But Continued Pricing Pressure The rise of FAST channels has redefined how viewers access content by providing a free, accessible alternative to cable and subscription-based streaming services. According to Digital TV Research (via Media Play News), FAST revenue is expected to reach $16.5 billion by 2029, up from $7.6 billion in 2023. With Amazon, Netflix, Paramount, Disney and others entering the connected TV ad market in 2024, the supply curve shifted dramatically to the right, resulting in a decrease in CPMs of 25% to 30%. Everyone in the space felt the pressure. Although CTV now has more viewers than broadcast, the entrenched habits of media buyers mean that until now, broadcast has still received the majority of the ad dollars. The shift to CTV from broadcast is inevitable as advertisers follow audiences, but how quickly this happens remains to be seen. Although there isn’t another Amazon, Netflix, Paramount or Disney to enter the space in 2025, growth in ad supply from these new players will likely continue to put pressure on pricing. However, I believe we will see ad spend rapidly migrate from broadcast to CTV, along with advertisers increasing their use of premium ad segments, which will offset broader pressure on CPMs. In 2025, I believe we will see CPMs in the CTV space bottom out 5% to 10% below where they were in 2024, with stabilization and growth starting in late 2025 and into 2026. 2025 will continue to see internet and social media usage fracture across different services that cater to specific interests. For FAST platforms, this will mean introducing new features to help make content feeds more personalized so content is more discoverable and shareable. By letting watchers share their favorite TV shows and movies just like they share links and viral videos, these platforms can tap into the power of today’s fractured social media experience to amplify the reach of their content, serve a desire for personalized content recommendations and improve the user experience. Consolidation And Conversion To FAST As streaming matures, the industry’s largest players will shift gears in 2025. Due to falling interest rates, pent-up demand for M&A and the incoming administration, I believe the industry will likely see more consolidation as the major studios and streaming platforms pursue acquisitions to bolster their content libraries, extend their reach and secure their positions in a crowded market. Smaller entities may become acquisition targets, while deregulation will create opportunities for mergers that may have been previously off the table due to antitrust concerns. Acquirers will prioritize accretive deals rather than aggressive growth strategies. While some major studios will continue to write down the value or spin off their cable networks, talk of studios selling their networks seems speculative due to the lack of potential buyers. Instead, studios may analyze their portfolios and convert viable niche channels into pure-play FAST channels. This will align with growing customer demand for free, accessible content while giving networks the opportunity to capitalize on the significant advertising revenue FAST platforms can offer. After big sports swings in 2024 by Peacock, Amazon Prime, Netflix and Apple, 2025 should be more of a transitional year as streamers take stock, build the financial case and continue to scoop up media rights. While it won’t happen in 2025, I believe the streamers will eventually dominate live sports programming—marking another critical shift away from the traditional broadcast/cable media model. Looking Ahead Streaming is displacing cable as the dominant mode of content delivery. As the industry expands its content offerings, experiments with new business models and refines its approach, 2025 will set the tone for what the next decade of streaming looks like.
