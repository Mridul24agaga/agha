Imagine software that can edit your footage, slap on some snazzy subtitles, throw in sound effects, and even spruce up the visuals – all while you’re brainstorming your next big idea. That’s automated video creation in a nutshell. It’s all about using smart tools to handle the nitty-gritty tech stuff, so you can focus on what really matters – bringing your creative vision to life. The best part? You don’t need to be a tech wizard to use these tools. They’re designed to help creators like us pump out quality content faster, without getting bogged down in editing software. Ready to see how it can transform your workflow? Why Video Automation is Essential in 2025 In 2025, video automation is not just a luxury—it’s a necessity. With over 500 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, standing out requires more than just creativity; it requires efficiency and scale. According to CalCalistech, internet traffic is projected to increase by 190 times this year​​. This highlights the growing demand for video content and the importance of producing high-quality videos consistently to capture and retain audience attention. Video automation allows creators to generate more content without sacrificing quality. By automating repetitive tasks, creators can focus on what truly matters: storytelling and engagement. Automation tools help streamline video production, reduce costs, and eliminate the need for extensive teams or resources. Additionally, businesses and brands are leveraging video automation to maintain a competitive edge. A survey by Wyzowl reported that 91% of businesses use video as a marketing tool, with 88% of marketers considering video an important part of their strategy​​. With the demand for video content rising, automation tools enable creators to keep up with the pace without burning out. Top 7 Software for Automated Video Creation 1.

ElevenLabs Add Automated Voice-Overs You know how sometimes you need a voiceover for your video but don’t want to record it yourself? That’s where ElevenLabs comes in handy. It’s this cool tool that turns your script into speech, and let me tell you, it sounds pretty darn realistic. Here’s the neat part – you’ve got a ton of voices to choose from. Want a British accent?

ToolBaz Automate Video Scriptwriting ToolBaz’s AI Script Generator is a free tool that can be a game-changer for content creators. Unlike some other tools, this one doesn’t just give you an outline – it writes the entire script for you.

It’s designed to save you time and effort in the writing process, especially when you’re stuck for ideas or running short on time. While it’s free, which is great for creators on a budget, remember that the AI-generated script is a starting point. You’ll likely want to review and tweak it to match your personal style and ensure it accurately represents your message. It’s a powerful tool to jumpstart your content creation, but your unique voice and perspective are still crucial to making the script truly your own. 4. Opus Clip Automate Video Editing for Interviews Opus Clip is a specialized tool designed to streamline the process of editing long-form interviews into engaging short clips.

The tool’s AI is trained to recognize important elements such as changes in tone, emphasis, and subject matter, ensuring that the most impactful parts of your interview are captured. This can save hours of manual editing time, allowing creators to focus more on content creation and less on post-production. 5. Buffer Automate Posting Ever feel like you’re spending too much time juggling your social media posts? Buffer’s got your back. This handy tool lets you schedule posts across different platforms, so you can plan your content in advance and keep your social media presence consistent.

Vidyo.ai 10 tips for maximizing efficiency with AI video toolsCreate impactful videos effortlessly with the right AI tools Share this article: Humans have always been visual creatures. From cave paintings to the latest viral TikTok trend, visuals have been our go-to mode of communication. Creating engaging videos can still seem daunting with the hours required for scripting, filming, and editing. Luckily, AI is here to change that. Imagine entering a text-based script, and moments later, a professional-looking video appears, complete with voiceovers, background music, and engaging visuals. Or picture yourself removing awkward pauses from a video clip with just a click of a button. These are not futuristic concepts—they’re the capabilities many AI-powered video tools like Loom’s screen recorder and Synthesia’s text-to-speech tools offer today. Explore the best AI video tools for content creation and discover what features to consider when selecting one. What to look for in an AI video tool When choosing an AI (artificial intelligence) video tool, consider factors like ease of use, AI-powered video editing, and automatic caption and transcription generation. All these elements help you create high-quality video content, including explainer videos, social media posts, and tutorials, without extensive editing or technical expertise. Here’s a closer look at the features to look for in an AI video creation tool: User-friendly interface In a world where time is money, AI video tools automate editing and make the video creation process seamless and quick. They allow you to focus on the creative side of production rather than worrying about complex tasks or software features.

AI-powered video editing features You just finished recording a video presentation for your team. As you’re watching it, you notice a few awkward pauses, some “ums” and “ahs,” and a couple of lengthy segments that could be trimmed. In the past, this meant spending hours sifting through footage to make those edits. Today, AI video tools like Loom have AI-powered video editing features that automatically detect and remove awkward pauses, improve audio quality, and trim unnecessary sections, reducing considerable editing time. Loom’s AI video tools automatically remove filler words from your video It’s equally important to look for features like automatic transcription and caption generation to make your videos more engaging and accessible. Customization options While AI tools automate editing, look for ample customization options to tweak elements like text, colors, and transitions to maintain creative control, including your branding and style. AI tools like Pictory and Descript even offer editable templates to accelerate the content creation process while still giving you control over your content and branding. Collaboration features Collaboration features are essential when working with a team to streamline communication and feedback. Consider tools that allow multiple users to edit videos in real time, provide feedback directly on specific moments, and offer cloud-based storage for easy access and sharing, especially in remote or hybrid work workspaces. With Loom, teams can react to videos with emojis, add time-stamped comments, and share video content with a single click across platforms like Slack, Gmail, and more. 1.

Understanding what role videos play in your business is key to choosing the right AI video maker for the job. If you’re focused on internal communications and personalized outreach, a tool like Loom is best. But if your goal is to create quick clips for social media, you might prefer Opus Clip. Brainstorm scripts. Even if you’re using an AI-generated video script, customization is essential for keeping your videos focused and cohesive. Keep it concise. The Sprout Social Index Report found that two-thirds of consumers find short-form videos to be the most engaging form of content on social media. Keep your content short and sweet to maintain attention. Use high-quality visuals. Look for video creation tools that record in at least high definition (HD). For example, the Loom free plan records in HD, while paid plans record in up to 4K resolution. If you use AI video generators, look for libraries of professional-level stock footage or high-quality, AI-generated videos that look realistic. Add a CTA. Make it clear what you want your viewers to do after they watch your video by adding a CTA. Some AI video editors, like Loom, allow you to embed auto-CTA links directly into your videos to make it even easier for viewers to take the next step. Track your results. Keep an eye on how your videos perform and adjust as necessary. Measuring video engagement is also important for training videos and team updates. Tools like Loom allow you to see who hasn’t watched your video yet, giving you a chance to follow up. Start small. You don’t need to overhaul your entire video strategy or team collaboration workflow overnight. Start with small steps to gradually integrate AI tools into your process, gain confidence, and experiment with different ways to use AI to your advantage. Create impactful videos effortlessly with the right AI tools You post an engaging video on your social media channels. The next thing you know, everyone’s sharing, commenting, and creating their own interpretations. This is the kind of buzz that great video content generates—captivating, memorable, and, most importantly, shareable. With AI video tools in your tool kit, your video marketing strategy can produce that level of excitement effortlessly, and within a few minutes. You can streamline your video creation process and turn recording and editing into a seamless, one-click task. To create high-quality videos with realistic AI avatars and voiceovers, Synthesia is a suitable option. Pictory and Lumen5 are solid text-to-video AI video makers. For those seeking a tool that lets you add a personal touch to your content, Loom stands out from the rest. The AI screen recorder captures your webcam, your screen, or both simultaneously, making it perfect for adding cues, gestures, and a level of engagement that feels personalized and authentic. When you’re finished recording, Loom’s AI-powered features handle the editing, adding speech-to-text captions and transcriptions, removing filler words and pauses, and adding other enhancements to make your video polished and ready to share.

Understanding what role videos play in your business is key to choosing the right AI video maker for the job. If you’re focused on internal communications and personalized outreach, a tool like Loom is best. But if your goal is to create quick clips for social media, you might prefer Opus Clip. Brainstorm scripts. Even if you’re using an AI-generated video script, customization is essential for keeping your videos focused and cohesive. Keep it concise. The Sprout Social Index Report found that two-thirds of consumers find short-form videos to be the most engaging form of content on social media. Keep your content short and sweet to maintain attention. Use high-quality visuals. Look for video creation tools that record in at least high definition (HD). For example, the Loom free plan records in HD, while paid plans record in up to 4K resolution. If you use AI video generators, look for libraries of professional-level stock footage or high-quality, AI-generated videos that look realistic. Add a CTA. Make it clear what you want your viewers to do after they watch your video by adding a CTA. Some AI video editors, like Loom, allow you to embed auto-CTA links directly into your videos to make it even easier for viewers to take the next step. Track your results. Keep an eye on how your videos perform and adjust as necessary. Measuring video engagement is also important for training videos and team updates. Tools like Loom allow you to see who hasn’t watched your video yet, giving you a chance to follow up. Start small. You don’t need to overhaul your entire video strategy or team collaboration workflow overnight. Start with small steps to gradually integrate AI tools into your process, gain confidence, and experiment with different ways to use AI to your advantage. Create impactful videos effortlessly with the right AI tools You post an engaging video on your social media channels. The next thing you know, everyone’s sharing, commenting, and creating their own interpretations. This is the kind of buzz that great video content generates—captivating, memorable, and, most importantly, shareable. With AI video tools in your tool kit, your video marketing strategy can produce that level of excitement effortlessly, and within a few minutes. You can streamline your video creation process and turn recording and editing into a seamless, one-click task. To create high-quality videos with realistic AI avatars and voiceovers, Synthesia is a suitable option. Pictory and Lumen5 are solid text-to-video AI video makers. For those seeking a tool that lets you add a personal touch to your content, Loom stands out from the rest. The AI screen recorder captures your webcam, your screen, or both simultaneously, making it perfect for adding cues, gestures, and a level of engagement that feels personalized and authentic. When you’re finished recording, Loom’s AI-powered features handle the editing, adding speech-to-text captions and transcriptions, removing filler words and pauses, and adding other enhancements to make your video polished and ready to share.

questions I've been getting on our channel about drywall and repairs and home maintenance and I have a simple message to tell you don't worry about it it's just drywall so in today's video I'm gonna show you all the tips and tricks that learn from my past years of working on the construction site now to fix messes like this messes like this gaps and cracks unevenness holes oil paint transition when you put your drywall in backwards how to cover up stucco ceilings and different kinds of scenarios where you've got texture on the roof there is a lot of information out there that can be really simply applied to solve your problems but if you're intimidated with touching your drywall that you're gonna be too creative and do something risky for instance if you want to know if you have a leaking plumbing valve don't be afraid to open a huge hole in the back of the closet take a look it's so easy to replace and repair drywall we're gonna show you all the steps today to take the fear out of been opening up your walls and solving your problems number one if you have a hole and you've got to repair it the easiest way to do it without damaging your house cutting your electrical circuits cutting a hole in your plumbing take your often knife okay you can get on Amazon just follow our link in the description you set it to just a little bit more than 1/2 inch okay and you want to cut the hole wider than the damage because impact damage always is bigger on the back side of the drywall than the front it's kind of like a hollow-point bullet it doesn't look too bad up front but it's not designed to make a big mess on the front right here we go all right and you want to just run a couple of passes until you're all the way through piece of cake because once you've got a square hole it's easy to patch it now if you've seen some of our other videos you've probably seen this already but this is such a great technique it's worth revisiting this is called the California patch and what I'm doing is I'm just eyeballing to cut a piece of drywall a couple inches wider in both directions so that'll cover my hole okay what I'm gonna do line it up take my knife just inside the cut and I'm gonna score the brown paper from the backside it's both sides and we're gonna do the same here and we're gonna try to give ourselves a little bit of room to work with cuz you only want to do this once it's okay if it's a little smaller than the hole break it and then hold them and then peel it from the paper leaving the paper on the front this makes the perfect patch one of the most amazing benefits is at the white paper on the front of the drywall is thinner than the drywall tape that you would buyer to patch it with so it actually creates a lot less work when you go to finish you're gonna take your drywall compound and you can buy this in a variety of different ways if you're a homeowner you're just doing one repair you can get in a little tub if you're gonna buy just a little bit I would recommend buying the powder by the 45 or the 90 mix up for yourself because then you'll always have it on hand you get real good value it's only ten bucks for a huge bag and the other stuff that you buy in the little tubs generally is really difficult to sand it's gonna drive you crazy now you take a little bit of mud and the idea here is to leave it on the inside of that framing that of the cut okay doesn't work too well in the top ever but here we go here we go alright and then all the way around take it and we're gonna put a little bit on the inside edges of all the rope as well and we're just gonna press it in if you find it not going in all the way maybe there's a little bit of restriction just use your knife to level off the corners and then press the tape in you're just embedding the drywall tape and you want to do this just once okay if you work it too much it's gonna wrinkle because of the moisture and it'll cause you all kinds of pain so get it in wipe off the extra mud and walk away after that's dry you can come back and do another coat and it should be done with a four by ten knife like this alright and I know it's not dry yet so bear with me okay and use outward pressure on the top pull it nice and tight and then come through the middle at the end all right if you let it dry between coats sometimes a second application with this knife is all you're gonna need so you don't have to do it over and over and over again you don't have to sand it between coats just let it set up less is more pull it tight and flat and you'll be happy every single time the second situation I see a lot of people commenting about is they need to check their and do an inspection on their valve or they want to change the valve from the backside if you want to do an inspection anywhere in your house let's say there's sharkbite valves and maybe you think might be dripping or something like that you can buy one of these spring-loaded trap door okay they work great and the idea is the hole that you have on the wall needs to be as big as this framework here plus some distance for this to tie in and put some compression on so what I generally try to do this isn't 8x8 but I'll try to cut the hole so that it's about that big nice and square so here we go not I'm not big enough here and you can use a drywall saw for this and you can cut the hole bigger than you need okay [Music] it only cost six bucks and all we do to set this in is put pressure on the single tab first because it will slide and you push it over and you rest this in and it's snaps back in place now if this is down on the wall by the toilet or if this is in the ceiling of your basement or if this is in the closet on the back wall nobody cares you can put these in all day long you can even paint them the same color as the wall or the ceiling it's very standard you can also use the same trapdoor in the ceiling in the basement for shutoff valves and pipes in different situations or clean outs for your sink island whatever have you so don't be intimidated if you need to have access to the area behind drywall cut a hole stick in a cover because it's that easy to take off and it looks just pretty good the next the next trick I'm going to show you is actually it answers a few different questions what do I do to fill big gaps what about if I'm going from a new wall to an old wall and there's lots of damage or it's lath and plaster and there's lots of damage okay or if the old wall is a different thickness these situations are all taken care of if you own one of these guns having a foam gun gives you lots of control I'm going to just get this started here here we go turn the trigger really low and you can feel just about any gap or crack exactly the amount of foam that you're going to need now if it's really nasty you can overfill it it doesn't matter because what this does this sets up in about 15 or 20 minutes okay and you might find that this is a great alternative to using 45-minute drywall compound all right if you already have this tool it's really handy it does a great job and it becomes the backing remember we're just adding mud and the surface this becomes the backing it also is an adhesive between the different material so you don't get cracks you don't need to apply any paper that's amazing so one of the questions I get is a lot of people their first time renovators they've done all the installation they're down to their last piece of drywall it's not quite big enough to fit or you've got a big gap in the ceiling because you're in an old house like mine and the ceiling has a bit of a ball to it and you can't install everything square and level so again take about the foam open it up pretty healthy shoot it at the corner so it has something to hit and it'll expand in and out of that corner and don't worry about how much of a mess it makes remember the goal here is that when that's done drying its expanded in behind got solid so you can trim off the face and have a backing to do your taping now we're gonna go up to the top of the ceiling where I did this yesterday and I'll show you how it looks so the secret here is we're trading backing right so open up your blade so I this tough to boat where do you think the depth is all right and we've been sawing action and then just gently trim it across there okay and then you can clean it up nice and tight all right now I'm only gonna demonstrate just a little bit less I'll go right into the corners I actually do need this to be finished today okay I'm happy with that it's not looks pretty nasty but it's ready to be worked with so I'm just gonna tape out the joint here a little bit real quick now when you've got a scenario like this I've actually got about an inch gap from where the drywall finished till the ceiling and the ceiling doesn't make it all the way into the corner it's a nasty mess and I made it a nasty mess on purpose to show you how easy it is to fix there we go run your mud off the side of this knife here no this foam does not react to the compound this isn't gonna melt it or affect it at all okay yeah got to keep the dirt out of your mud yeah I'm just gonna go what I call flat taping flat taping flat taping is the process of just going on one surface I'm not going around the corner and you can push that up as nice tight as you want okay and then we'll press it in now that we've got that pressed in you don't have to wait till tomorrow to come back to fix it here's one other trick when you're taping with much you can do multiple layers of mud and paper it's okay you can sandwich it as long as you give it time to dry before you come back the next time to fiddle around with it okay try to keep your mud in the middle of your hock the whole time you're working all right now we're gonna apply them under the ceiling catch your drips try to work as clean as possible okay there we go and then again off the side of the knife we're gonna snowplow it right in there okay just pretend that that paper and bud there it wasn't a tear of previously and I measure off a piece of tape gonna get a nice straight edge pre fold it there we go we have a nice flat surface up top so I'm gonna use that to trust my line gentle pressure all the way across okay painting the edge one more pass that's good now hold the knife flat against the wall cuz if you are ain't too loosey-goosey with it you'll just push everything in and make a mess there we go IMAX zoom in there and tell me if that corner doesn't look perfect now if you want to save even more time and you're comfortable with using your knife you can go back over top and you can apply the inside corner of the forage application right over that paper tape alright and then the next time you come back all you'll need to do is a six inch knife just to make sure that it's perfectly smooth and feathered oh all right done it's not that tricky anybody can do this the next issue you're gonna run into is I get questions like this all the time hey I got a rusty nail or a rusty staple or residue from tape or oops I was doing a weird angle and I installed the drywall backwards and I see the brown paper can i tape over that and the answer is yes of course but you have to prep it first you need to use a Primus so here we go I've got tape let's get this out of here okay well the tapes gone but I still got that red stuff left got broke a poor showing I've got dark pencil I don't care even if it's marker there is one solution for all your problems and if you're taping your house you've got to have this can on you at all times pom pom yeah if you're a fan of the channel you've seen me use it before I put this on everything okay brown paper no problem oil-based primer red tape no problem oil-based primer marker no problem oil-based primer with the pigment look at that this just disappearing I'm doing an infomercial here oil-based primer works on everything let's say you have an old house with laughs and plaster and oil paint kills you can buy it in a can and roll it on the wall they even have an odorless formula of an oil primer just for transitioning from oil to latex so that you don't have your paint peeling off over time if you're ever stuck and you were in trouble and you don't know how to solve a problem think oil-based primer and then all of your new muds and compounds will bond to it if you use oil-based primer over plaster new drywall compound will bond to that so you don't have to go to the buy plaster and mix it up yourself saves a lot of time and money this is money in the bank and before anybody starts putting it in the comment section no kills did not sponsor this video I just love the stuff okay let's move on I don't need the tape here anymore now we're gonna get away from the traditional drywall compound we're gonna get into the quick-set mud we're gonna show you everything that it can do here's another one of the most popular questions out there I can't find sheetrock for five anywhere what do I get this is a CGC company that means Canadian gypsum corporation trade from the United States you're gonna find a u.s. G which is United States gypsum okay they make a forty five mix as well this is not proprietary technology all right it's really basic stuff so 45 here is 45 there it's the same stuff just a different supplier we have border issues right so okay I'll just get along all right then what we're gonna do with the powder of course and a lot of you might have seen this alright so we're gonna just do a quick short version of this we're gonna make a lot of volcano on the hawk and I don't know sometimes it's easier to move the hawk than the knife all right volcano time here we go the higher the walls the easier it is to control everything okay now I'm using hot water if you want your coat 45 minute mud to set super fast so you can keep on working use hot water throw a little salt in it right this is a chemical reaction we're dealing with now so basic science grade eight heat plus salt changes all the chemical reactions and speeds things up so we're gonna go add my hot water Oh making a mess this is not the way the demonstrations supposed to work better close that up got a dam up the hole alright got it to do to do I'm gonna sprinkle it in of course and try not to have another dam break on us but it happens here we go doesn't have to go over the top sometimes it start leaking from underneath if you want to you can go with a little bit less water until you know you've got it under control but I found with this hot water and you've really just got to be able to move and manage the mess and it's worth paying for here we go ready now we're gonna go for it we're gonna go making a mess that's okay construction site yeah that's okay we're not gonna worry about it because this reaction happens so fast that if I don't move and get it done by the time I'm done fiddling around it'll ought to be red rock hard try to mix it somewhat smooth this is a race against time here we go and it's already turning into a hard pace now just for fun we're gonna come back after this brief brief word from our sponsors we don't have a sponsor or am I talking about I'm just saying it's not yet yeah I know it's gonna happen that quick give it about 60 seconds okay so now we're back we have only been a couple minutes and to be honest it's not completely hard but it is setup okay it's stiff enough that I can work with and I'm just gonna cover this now with my regular compound and it won't end up blending together and peeling out of the hole and when this is dry it's not gonna shrink or expand or do anything crazy like that on you you can do all this at the same time all right I mean is this mud my goodness it's a little loosey-goosey what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put paper tape majority on the old wall all right and I'm pressing it on the original hard surface and now I'm just gonna set it into the soft with a little bit of pressure and then I'll watch the mud just rising away from the tape and that's how I know that I've embedded it I don't have a ridge from the mud I haven't embedded it and it will bubble there we go you remember earlier we talked about that we can use expansion foam and it bridges the gap and it seals it together so you don't need the paper tape you should use the tape anyway if you're using the 45 you have to use the tape all right again we're just gonna come down and set this up with a nice new layer mud and we're gonna embed it on the surface here now nice force here on the original drywall okay and what we're trying to do is eliminate the action of having too much blood stuck in behind the basement we don't want to raise the surface off too much now we're going to just press those two pieces of paper together that are floating over that mud in the middle okay look at that it used to be a nasty mess is now really well embedded together and if you see any areas where the paper tape looks like it's coming apart just get your knife in there put a little mud follow it up make sure the surface is nice and wet so that it doesn't bubble so okay while you're working you can always use the pail as a table okay so we're getting close to the end of all of the questions I've still got one two I got three more things to show you but before I do my floor is creaky I've got to screw that down oh yeah let me just address this one issue if you have dents remember drywall is just dust compressed between papers so if you have a dent if it's dented on the surface it's also dented on the backside it doesn't get compressed it gets moved and that's fine because dents can be adjusted simply like that you don't even think twice about them just fill them and go unless they're big enough that they've actually broken through the backside my rule is this if it's not bigger than one and a half inches it's not concerned about all right you don't need tape you don't have to fuss with it just fill it and you'll be fine now getting back to this all right once this is filled you got to treat this like a butt joint you want to fill this side and then you want to fill this side okay and by Phil meaning pressure on the outside here and pressure on the outside here I think it'd take a little bit of mud and run it right down the middle with a fair amount of pressure and here's a secret will be even it be don't touch it again let that's right completely what we've done now is we've set the depth of the wall to this point this Ridge simply means that I have to fill a little bit here and a little bit here to get this nice and smooth this Ridge actually becomes your guide line now tomorrow when it's dry I can come back and I can use my four inch knife just scrape off that Ridge all right and I'll start in the middle with a thin coat and I'll be using pressure going the outside if you want to know how to actually finish a butt joint properly you can click the link to this video here we've done some information on this series previously and it'll go through all of you how to fill corners and do it all that sort of thing when to use the 45 minute mud versus the other it's a great video I think you're gonna like it and one other thing I'm not going to cover today is nail pops we've got a great video on nail pops we call them nail pops if it's a nail or a screw so don't get offended if you have one or the other it's all the same business and it's all dealt with in the same manner if it's a nail hammered in a little bit if it's a screw you screw it in a little bit but follow all that information in the card up in the corner okay yeah let's get on to the next two things that are going to be life savers on your job site so the next thing that people get intimidated about dealing with drywall is the mess and rightly so because drywall dust is actually lighter than air it seems right it goes everywhere there are two things you can do to manage your mess well actually three one you can clean as you go resist the temptation to sweep unless you but this this is what we call drywall sweeping compound all right and there are a couple of different companies that make this stuff one of them makes it green one of them makes it red I buy this stuff because it's available on my local Home Depot and the truth is I've been shopping Home Depot forever because Raya grew up we didn't have options it was Home Depot or no Depot so I'm just really used to their store and products what you do is you just sprinkle it just like as if you're raking your grass right you throw it up against the wall and this step is formulated it instantly bonds with that light drywall compound okay and it will bond to it and then you can sweep so it doesn't go up in the air all right if I sweep compound regular you see all the dust floating around did you see it if I sweep it with the red dust you're not kicking anything up in the air all right that whole bag will last the entire job so 15 20 bucks whatever it is to not be kicking that dust up brilliant invention the other thing you can do is you're gonna open your window and you can shove a fan in it okay the best defense you have against dust in your house - putting a fan in your window like this you can get these at home table for 40 bucks and they blow a ton of air that's what I do without a doubt the most intimidating project in everybody's house is the stucco ceilings everybody's worried about and we get comments every day how do I deal with my stipple ceiling what if I have asbestos should I remove it should I take it down should I go over top should I skim coat it dear Lord no skim coating that ceiling will take you more time to energy and money than doing this take your piece of drywall get yourself a lift or a couple friends okay throw some mud on it and the thicker the texture the more mud you're gonna want to have I'm just doing a quick demonstration so I think for purpose of demonstration I'm gonna cut this down to size you're gonna want to use these to install these are called drywall laminating screws and it's just like it sounds it's for sticking one sheet of drywall into another sheet of drywall when you have no idea where the framework is here's our worse you take your sheet with your compound okay you stick it under your ceiling yeah that easy and you throw these in all right now these screws will not tighten up and be pretty okay what they will do is they'll hold that sheet in place until the drywall compound dries then the next day you come back you guess it um removed the screws tape your joints fill your little holes you can put in one of these screws every couple of feet it's not necessary to put a ton of them in just make sure you're holding it in place till it's dry and you can put a brand new ceiling over top of any textured ceiling in just a couple of hours no mess no worry about asbestos mwah perfect every time and if you want to know how good that drywall mud holds trust me when I say it's not going anywhere it creates like a vacuum so here is my secret for what to do with my mud at the end of the day you've already mixed it in a pail clean down the sides okay and if you like you can even use a sponge the closer you get to the bottom the more you're going to want to have a sponge clean all the mud off okay you know nothing's perfect in this world this mud has been exposed to the air the whole time you're working and drying it you're going to put your hock on top of it as a lid and it's going to dry out a little bit more so what you do just put a layer of water on there here's your lid there's your tools okay and you're good to go the next day now the next day when you get here you don't have crusty dry mud on the pail so when you're taking your compound on you're not gonna have those hard chunks in the mud which will wreck your finish this is how you protect it so it's silky smooth all the time soapy smooth like Zohan now one of the questions we get all the time is should I buy the small tubs no I always buy it buy a big box or big pail it's not a lot of money and if you don't use it all it'll only last three or four weeks after you've opened it up and started using it okay it's not a big deal you can make your own compound and put it in a pail and store it like this in the last three weeks bottom line is you want to make sure that your mud is in perfect condition for doing the job now listen guys we've got other great drywall videos that help you with a

questions I've been getting on our channel about drywall and repairs and home maintenance and I have a simple message to tell you don't worry about it it's just drywall so in today's video I'm gonna show you all the tips and tricks that learn from my past years of working on the construction site now to fix messes like this messes like this gaps and cracks unevenness holes oil paint transition when you put your drywall in backwards how to cover up stucco ceilings and different kinds of scenarios where you've got texture on the roof there is a lot of information out there that can be really simply applied to solve your problems but if you're intimidated with touching your drywall that you're gonna be too creative and do something risky for instance if you want to know if you have a leaking plumbing valve don't be afraid to open a huge hole in the back of the closet take a look it's so easy to replace and repair drywall we're gonna show you all the steps today to take the fear out of been opening up your walls and solving your problems number one if you have a hole and you've got to repair it the easiest way to do it without damaging your house cutting your electrical circuits cutting a hole in your plumbing take your often knife okay you can get on Amazon just follow our link in the description you set it to just a little bit more than 1/2 inch okay and you want to cut the hole wider than the damage because impact damage always is bigger on the back side of the drywall than the front it's kind of like a hollow-point bullet it doesn't look too bad up front but it's not designed to make a big mess on the front right here we go all right and you want to just run a couple of passes until you're all the way through piece of cake because once you've got a square hole it's easy to patch it now if you've seen some of our other videos you've probably seen this already but this is such a great technique it's worth revisiting this is called the California patch and what I'm doing is I'm just eyeballing to cut a piece of drywall a couple inches wider in both directions so that'll cover my hole okay what I'm gonna do line it up take my knife just inside the cut and I'm gonna score the brown paper from the backside it's both sides and we're gonna do the same here and we're gonna try to give ourselves a little bit of room to work with cuz you only want to do this once it's okay if it's a little smaller than the hole break it and then hold them and then peel it from the paper leaving the paper on the front this makes the perfect patch one of the most amazing benefits is at the white paper on the front of the drywall is thinner than the drywall tape that you would buyer to patch it with so it actually creates a lot less work when you go to finish you're gonna take your drywall compound and you can buy this in a variety of different ways if you're a homeowner you're just doing one repair you can get in a little tub if you're gonna buy just a little bit I would recommend buying the powder by the 45 or the 90 mix up for yourself because then you'll always have it on hand you get real good value it's only ten bucks for a huge bag and the other stuff that you buy in the little tubs generally is really difficult to sand it's gonna drive you crazy now you take a little bit of mud and the idea here is to leave it on the inside of that framing that of the cut okay doesn't work too well in the top ever but here we go here we go alright and then all the way around take it and we're gonna put a little bit on the inside edges of all the rope as well and we're just gonna press it in if you find it not going in all the way maybe there's a little bit of restriction just use your knife to level off the corners and then press the tape in you're just embedding the drywall tape and you want to do this just once okay if you work it too much it's gonna wrinkle because of the moisture and it'll cause you all kinds of pain so get it in wipe off the extra mud and walk away after that's dry you can come back and do another coat and it should be done with a four by ten knife like this alright and I know it's not dry yet so bear with me okay and use outward pressure on the top pull it nice and tight and then come through the middle at the end all right if you let it dry between coats sometimes a second application with this knife is all you're gonna need so you don't have to do it over and over and over again you don't have to sand it between coats just let it set up less is more pull it tight and flat and you'll be happy every single time the second situation I see a lot of people commenting about is they need to check their and do an inspection on their valve or they want to change the valve from the backside if you want to do an inspection anywhere in your house let's say there's sharkbite valves and maybe you think might be dripping or something like that you can buy one of these spring-loaded trap door okay they work great and the idea is the hole that you have on the wall needs to be as big as this framework here plus some distance for this to tie in and put some compression on so what I generally try to do this isn't 8x8 but I'll try to cut the hole so that it's about that big nice and square so here we go not I'm not big enough here and you can use a drywall saw for this and you can cut the hole bigger than you need okay [Music] it only cost six bucks and all we do to set this in is put pressure on the single tab first because it will slide and you push it over and you rest this in and it's snaps back in place now if this is down on the wall by the toilet or if this is in the ceiling of your basement or if this is in the closet on the back wall nobody cares you can put these in all day long you can even paint them the same color as the wall or the ceiling it's very standard you can also use the same trapdoor in the ceiling in the basement for shutoff valves and pipes in different situations or clean outs for your sink island whatever have you so don't be intimidated if you need to have access to the area behind drywall cut a hole stick in a cover because it's that easy to take off and it looks just pretty good the next the next trick I'm going to show you is actually it answers a few different questions what do I do to fill big gaps what about if I'm going from a new wall to an old wall and there's lots of damage or it's lath and plaster and there's lots of damage okay or if the old wall is a different thickness these situations are all taken care of if you own one of these guns having a foam gun gives you lots of control I'm going to just get this started here here we go turn the trigger really low and you can feel just about any gap or crack exactly the amount of foam that you're going to need now if it's really nasty you can overfill it it doesn't matter because what this does this sets up in about 15 or 20 minutes okay and you might find that this is a great alternative to using 45-minute drywall compound all right if you already have this tool it's really handy it does a great job and it becomes the backing remember we're just adding mud and the surface this becomes the backing it also is an adhesive between the different material so you don't get cracks you don't need to apply any paper that's amazing so one of the questions I get is a lot of people their first time renovators they've done all the installation they're down to their last piece of drywall it's not quite big enough to fit or you've got a big gap in the ceiling because you're in an old house like mine and the ceiling has a bit of a ball to it and you can't install everything square and level so again take about the foam open it up pretty healthy shoot it at the corner so it has something to hit and it'll expand in and out of that corner and don't worry about how much of a mess it makes remember the goal here is that when that's done drying its expanded in behind got solid so you can trim off the face and have a backing to do your taping now we're gonna go up to the top of the ceiling where I did this yesterday and I'll show you how it looks so the secret here is we're trading backing right so open up your blade so I this tough to boat where do you think the depth is all right and we've been sawing action and then just gently trim it across there okay and then you can clean it up nice and tight all right now I'm only gonna demonstrate just a little bit less I'll go right into the corners I actually do need this to be finished today okay I'm happy with that it's not looks pretty nasty but it's ready to be worked with so I'm just gonna tape out the joint here a little bit real quick now when you've got a scenario like this I've actually got about an inch gap from where the drywall finished till the ceiling and the ceiling doesn't make it all the way into the corner it's a nasty mess and I made it a nasty mess on purpose to show you how easy it is to fix there we go run your mud off the side of this knife here no this foam does not react to the compound this isn't gonna melt it or affect it at all okay yeah got to keep the dirt out of your mud yeah I'm just gonna go what I call flat taping flat taping flat taping is the process of just going on one surface I'm not going around the corner and you can push that up as nice tight as you want okay and then we'll press it in now that we've got that pressed in you don't have to wait till tomorrow to come back to fix it here's one other trick when you're taping with much you can do multiple layers of mud and paper it's okay you can sandwich it as long as you give it time to dry before you come back the next time to fiddle around with it okay try to keep your mud in the middle of your hock the whole time you're working all right now we're gonna apply them under the ceiling catch your drips try to work as clean as possible okay there we go and then again off the side of the knife we're gonna snowplow it right in there okay just pretend that that paper and bud there it wasn't a tear of previously and I measure off a piece of tape gonna get a nice straight edge pre fold it there we go we have a nice flat surface up top so I'm gonna use that to trust my line gentle pressure all the way across okay painting the edge one more pass that's good now hold the knife flat against the wall cuz if you are ain't too loosey-goosey with it you'll just push everything in and make a mess there we go IMAX zoom in there and tell me if that corner doesn't look perfect now if you want to save even more time and you're comfortable with using your knife you can go back over top and you can apply the inside corner of the forage application right over that paper tape alright and then the next time you come back all you'll need to do is a six inch knife just to make sure that it's perfectly smooth and feathered oh all right done it's not that tricky anybody can do this the next issue you're gonna run into is I get questions like this all the time hey I got a rusty nail or a rusty staple or residue from tape or oops I was doing a weird angle and I installed the drywall backwards and I see the brown paper can i tape over that and the answer is yes of course but you have to prep it first you need to use a Primus so here we go I've got tape let's get this out of here okay well the tapes gone but I still got that red stuff left got broke a poor showing I've got dark pencil I don't care even if it's marker there is one solution for all your problems and if you're taping your house you've got to have this can on you at all times pom pom yeah if you're a fan of the channel you've seen me use it before I put this on everything okay brown paper no problem oil-based primer red tape no problem oil-based primer marker no problem oil-based primer with the pigment look at that this just disappearing I'm doing an infomercial here oil-based primer works on everything let's say you have an old house with laughs and plaster and oil paint kills you can buy it in a can and roll it on the wall they even have an odorless formula of an oil primer just for transitioning from oil to latex so that you don't have your paint peeling off over time if you're ever stuck and you were in trouble and you don't know how to solve a problem think oil-based primer and then all of your new muds and compounds will bond to it if you use oil-based primer over plaster new drywall compound will bond to that so you don't have to go to the buy plaster and mix it up yourself saves a lot of time and money this is money in the bank and before anybody starts putting it in the comment section no kills did not sponsor this video I just love the stuff okay let's move on I don't need the tape here anymore now we're gonna get away from the traditional drywall compound we're gonna get into the quick-set mud we're gonna show you everything that it can do here's another one of the most popular questions out there I can't find sheetrock for five anywhere what do I get this is a CGC company that means Canadian gypsum corporation trade from the United States you're gonna find a u.s. G which is United States gypsum okay they make a forty five mix as well this is not proprietary technology all right it's really basic stuff so 45 here is 45 there it's the same stuff just a different supplier we have border issues right so okay I'll just get along all right then what we're gonna do with the powder of course and a lot of you might have seen this alright so we're gonna just do a quick short version of this we're gonna make a lot of volcano on the hawk and I don't know sometimes it's easier to move the hawk than the knife all right volcano time here we go the higher the walls the easier it is to control everything okay now I'm using hot water if you want your coat 45 minute mud to set super fast so you can keep on working use hot water throw a little salt in it right this is a chemical reaction we're dealing with now so basic science grade eight heat plus salt changes all the chemical reactions and speeds things up so we're gonna go add my hot water Oh making a mess this is not the way the demonstrations supposed to work better close that up got a dam up the hole alright got it to do to do I'm gonna sprinkle it in of course and try not to have another dam break on us but it happens here we go doesn't have to go over the top sometimes it start leaking from underneath if you want to you can go with a little bit less water until you know you've got it under control but I found with this hot water and you've really just got to be able to move and manage the mess and it's worth paying for here we go ready now we're gonna go for it we're gonna go making a mess that's okay construction site yeah that's okay we're not gonna worry about it because this reaction happens so fast that if I don't move and get it done by the time I'm done fiddling around it'll ought to be red rock hard try to mix it somewhat smooth this is a race against time here we go and it's already turning into a hard pace now just for fun we're gonna come back after this brief brief word from our sponsors we don't have a sponsor or am I talking about I'm just saying it's not yet yeah I know it's gonna happen that quick give it about 60 seconds okay so now we're back we have only been a couple minutes and to be honest it's not completely hard but it is setup okay it's stiff enough that I can work with and I'm just gonna cover this now with my regular compound and it won't end up blending together and peeling out of the hole and when this is dry it's not gonna shrink or expand or do anything crazy like that on you you can do all this at the same time all right I mean is this mud my goodness it's a little loosey-goosey what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put paper tape majority on the old wall all right and I'm pressing it on the original hard surface and now I'm just gonna set it into the soft with a little bit of pressure and then I'll watch the mud just rising away from the tape and that's how I know that I've embedded it I don't have a ridge from the mud I haven't embedded it and it will bubble there we go you remember earlier we talked about that we can use expansion foam and it bridges the gap and it seals it together so you don't need the paper tape you should use the tape anyway if you're using the 45 you have to use the tape all right again we're just gonna come down and set this up with a nice new layer mud and we're gonna embed it on the surface here now nice force here on the original drywall okay and what we're trying to do is eliminate the action of having too much blood stuck in behind the basement we don't want to raise the surface off too much now we're going to just press those two pieces of paper together that are floating over that mud in the middle okay look at that it used to be a nasty mess is now really well embedded together and if you see any areas where the paper tape looks like it's coming apart just get your knife in there put a little mud follow it up make sure the surface is nice and wet so that it doesn't bubble so okay while you're working you can always use the pail as a table okay so we're getting close to the end of all of the questions I've still got one two I got three more things to show you but before I do my floor is creaky I've got to screw that down oh yeah let me just address this one issue if you have dents remember drywall is just dust compressed between papers so if you have a dent if it's dented on the surface it's also dented on the backside it doesn't get compressed it gets moved and that's fine because dents can be adjusted simply like that you don't even think twice about them just fill them and go unless they're big enough that they've actually broken through the backside my rule is this if it's not bigger than one and a half inches it's not concerned about all right you don't need tape you don't have to fuss with it just fill it and you'll be fine now getting back to this all right once this is filled you got to treat this like a butt joint you want to fill this side and then you want to fill this side okay and by Phil meaning pressure on the outside here and pressure on the outside here I think it'd take a little bit of mud and run it right down the middle with a fair amount of pressure and here's a secret will be even it be don't touch it again let that's right completely what we've done now is we've set the depth of the wall to this point this Ridge simply means that I have to fill a little bit here and a little bit here to get this nice and smooth this Ridge actually becomes your guide line now tomorrow when it's dry I can come back and I can use my four inch knife just scrape off that Ridge all right and I'll start in the middle with a thin coat and I'll be using pressure going the outside if you want to know how to actually finish a butt joint properly you can click the link to this video here we've done some information on this series previously and it'll go through all of you how to fill corners and do it all that sort of thing when to use the 45 minute mud versus the other it's a great video I think you're gonna like it and one other thing I'm not going to cover today is nail pops we've got a great video on nail pops we call them nail pops if it's a nail or a screw so don't get offended if you have one or the other it's all the same business and it's all dealt with in the same manner if it's a nail hammered in a little bit if it's a screw you screw it in a little bit but follow all that information in the card up in the corner okay yeah let's get on to the next two things that are going to be life savers on your job site so the next thing that people get intimidated about dealing with drywall is the mess and rightly so because drywall dust is actually lighter than air it seems right it goes everywhere there are two things you can do to manage your mess well actually three one you can clean as you go resist the temptation to sweep unless you but this this is what we call drywall sweeping compound all right and there are a couple of different companies that make this stuff one of them makes it green one of them makes it red I buy this stuff because it's available on my local Home Depot and the truth is I've been shopping Home Depot forever because Raya grew up we didn't have options it was Home Depot or no Depot so I'm just really used to their store and products what you do is you just sprinkle it just like as if you're raking your grass right you throw it up against the wall and this step is formulated it instantly bonds with that light drywall compound okay and it will bond to it and then you can sweep so it doesn't go up in the air all right if I sweep compound regular you see all the dust floating around did you see it if I sweep it with the red dust you're not kicking anything up in the air all right that whole bag will last the entire job so 15 20 bucks whatever it is to not be kicking that dust up brilliant invention the other thing you can do is you're gonna open your window and you can shove a fan in it okay the best defense you have against dust in your house - putting a fan in your window like this you can get these at home table for 40 bucks and they blow a ton of air that's what I do without a doubt the most intimidating project in everybody's house is the stucco ceilings everybody's worried about and we get comments every day how do I deal with my stipple ceiling what if I have asbestos should I remove it should I take it down should I go over top should I skim coat it dear Lord no skim coating that ceiling will take you more time to energy and money than doing this take your piece of drywall get yourself a lift or a couple friends okay throw some mud on it and the thicker the texture the more mud you're gonna want to have I'm just doing a quick demonstration so I think for purpose of demonstration I'm gonna cut this down to size you're gonna want to use these to install these are called drywall laminating screws and it's just like it sounds it's for sticking one sheet of drywall into another sheet of drywall when you have no idea where the framework is here's our worse you take your sheet with your compound okay you stick it under your ceiling yeah that easy and you throw these in all right now these screws will not tighten up and be pretty okay what they will do is they'll hold that sheet in place until the drywall compound dries then the next day you come back you guess it um removed the screws tape your joints fill your little holes you can put in one of these screws every couple of feet it's not necessary to put a ton of them in just make sure you're holding it in place till it's dry and you can put a brand new ceiling over top of any textured ceiling in just a couple of hours no mess no worry about asbestos mwah perfect every time and if you want to know how good that drywall mud holds trust me when I say it's not going anywhere it creates like a vacuum so here is my secret for what to do with my mud at the end of the day you've already mixed it in a pail clean down the sides okay and if you like you can even use a sponge the closer you get to the bottom the more you're going to want to have a sponge clean all the mud off okay you know nothing's perfect in this world this mud has been exposed to the air the whole time you're working and drying it you're going to put your hock on top of it as a lid and it's going to dry out a little bit more so what you do just put a layer of water on there here's your lid there's your tools okay and you're good to go the next day now the next day when you get here you don't have crusty dry mud on the pail so when you're taking your compound on you're not gonna have those hard chunks in the mud which will wreck your finish this is how you protect it so it's silky smooth all the time soapy smooth like Zohan now one of the questions we get all the time is should I buy the small tubs no I always buy it buy a big box or big pail it's not a lot of money and if you don't use it all it'll only last three or four weeks after you've opened it up and started using it okay it's not a big deal you can make your own compound and put it in a pail and store it like this in the last three weeks bottom line is you want to make sure that your mud is in perfect condition for doing the job now listen guys we've got other great drywall videos that help you with a

https://dream-machine.lumalabs.ai/ https://hailuoai.video/ https://klingai.com/ https://haiper.ai/ 471 comments in this video we're going to take a look at the best AI video generators of 2025 I'll take a look at each tool talk about the pros and cons and rank them based on my super scientific french fry scale with curly fries being at the top and floppy crinkle cut fries being at the bottom let's get started the first tool that we're going to take a look at is Sora Sora is an incredible tool developed by open AI when it was announced in 2024 our Jaws dropped it looked incredible but now we have access to the tool and the question is does it stand up well let's find out so during this testing process I'm going to basically lay out a pretend scene so that we can have some variety to see the Cinematic potential of each AI video generator so we have this establishing shot here it's basically this kind of like abandoned factory setting we have this shot of this man looking over a computer he's just kind of worried right like something's going on and then we have the shot here of basically kind of a SWAT team maybe they're about to uh get to that researcher and attack him or something and so we're just building tension from just a few shots here and basically I'm going to use each one of those images to test the Cinematic potential of each of these generators so let's get to it to create a video and Sora all you have to do is go to their website click on the plus icon at the bottom and you can upload an image or a video which is pretty cool I'll use this video of a SWAT guy walking towards the door and we'll go ahead and click open once the image is loaded up now you can type in your prompt for our prompt I'll say a soldier walks down a hallway the camera tracks with the soldier as they approach a door handheld camera so the cool thing about using Sora is you have the ability to adjust quite a few different settings that aren't available other tools so for example you can select different aspect ratios we'll say 16 by9 of course uh you can also change the resolution so you can go all the way to 1080p which is great because most of the AI video generators can only do 720p you can also change the duration with some of the resolution settings you can go all the way up to 20 seconds it's pretty cool and then finally you can change the number of variations now with the 1080p version you can only create one variant but with 720 you can do two and with 480 you can do four which is really powerful so when you're ready to render go ahead and click create video I went ahead and rendered out the other two clips as well and combined them together into a scene with some sound effects let's go ahead and take a look copy that okay so as you can see it does look fairly cinematic the establishing shot looks pretty good I like the the dynamic movement I like that the clouds in the background are billowing and it really does feel like an establishing shot we also have the shot here of the soldier walking to the door which is pretty good I should note that we had to edit around a spot where the soldier in the background actually just kind of disappeared so that's just kind of part of working with Sora it sometimes takes your image that you uploaded and changes it a bit whenever it starts to render but you know looks pretty good the alarm you know kind of Clicks in a little late there but it's not bad and then finally we have the shot of the guy looking up and yeah there's like anxiety on his face looks like he's kind of in a hurry the camera Shake looks very very natural so I think it did a pretty good job now of course the problem with working with Sora is because it tends to be one of the more creative tools it can also get the strangest whenever you get into your generation so for example here's one clip that we had and you can see that the background character like disappears behind some random door and then that door closes and then he is approaching this door and same thing over here he just kind of covers up the guy and then a huge door appears which is uh just kind of weird so a lot of times when you're working inside of Sora that type of stuff can happen and it can really eat into your generation credits the strangeness that you get from Sora can be extra annoying sometimes because the tools also pretty expensive the most expensive version is $200 a month which is definitely cost prohibitive for a lot of Independent Artists on the positive side Sora makes it super easy to upload images and videos and you do have the ability to key frame your videos using a storyboard feature which is very helpful when Sora hits it hits incredibly well and the video quality can be incredible so it's definitely an amazing tool for getting really good results and the fact that you can render 1080p natively is really nice of course you probably want to upscale that using an outside tool but the fact that you can render the core video in 1080 is really awesome now the cont to using Sora is exactly like I said it's really expensive which is cost prohibitive for a lot of folks and then the fact that it can tend to cut to random shots and really just waste a lot of time that can be a challenge you also don't have the ability to upload photos of people if you aren't on the most expensive plan so again that makes it really challenging if you're an independent artist using the tool so for all of these AI video generators I'm going to rate them based on three categories the first is realism the second is camera and character physics and the third is workflow and ease of use so for realism inside of Sora I would say eight out of 10 it does a really good job it's not perfect and even the best generations of Sora if you really begin to examine them there can be some strangeness that you begin to uncover but it does a really good job now for character and Camera physics I will say that because Sora can get really strange really quickly and it tends to want to change your scene again and again I have to give it just a 4 out of 10 and for workflow and ease of use I'm going to give it a 5 out of 10 because while the platform is incredibly easy to use and intuitive the fact is the content moderation filters are too extreme with Sora and it makes it really challenging when you're working on a film project so that gives Sora a total score of 17 out of 30 putting them into the sweet potato fry level next up we have Google vo so VO2 was announced recently and the quality of the results that we've seen from the tool are incredible let me show you how to use it so this is what VO2 looks like I'm in Early Access so this isn't publicly available so I'll move quickly here weird thing about using vo is the fact that you don't have the ability to upload your own images at this time you have to create the image on their platform and then you create the video so that can be really tricky especially if you're looking for character consistency lighting consistency color all of those things so you should definitely know about that limitation and it is going to make it incredibly hard to create films with the tool in its current capacity but that being said let me show you the workflow here so I have basically a prompt where I'm going to create an image of a soldier walking down the abandoned hallway let's go ahead and create that image okay we have an image here if you wanted to you could start over I'm just going to go ahead and move forward we'll go to motion here and I'm going to say a soldier walks down a hallway the camera tracks as the soldier approaches the door and we'll go ahead and create that video I did the same thing for the other three shots let's take a look at our result copy that it's pretty wild I mean the establishing shot looks great that shot with the SWAT guy looks amazing and then this is probably one of the more expressive AI videos that I've seen up to this point but the problem that I'm sure you're noticing here is the three shots feel completely different they feel like they're from three completely different films and really no matter how much prompting you do it's really tricky to get the consistency without more advanced tools for doing style consistency location characters all of those things so that's a huge limitation to using vo however the physics engine that's powering vo is probably the best out of any AI video generator so for overall realism I would say with vo 10 out of 10 it is the best AI video tool for creating realistic videos for character and Camera physics again I would say 10 out of 10 I think it does an amazing job not only with camera Shake tracking shots all of those things but also with the actual expression of the characters directing the movement all of those things come through when you're working with vo and it's incredible all of that being said for workflow and ease of use people really don't have access to vo right now so that's not very helpful and then it's also very tricky to work on a scaled up project inside of VO especially because you're going to want consistency you're going to want that film to feel like it lives in these same world and universe and that's just really tricky so that gives vo a score of 23 out of 30 and they are now in the waffle fry level all right good job moving on let's take a look at Runway Runway is an incredible company that really supports the AI film making community and they have a ton of tools outside of just AI generative video alone you can use runway for lip syncing in painting there's a ton of tools that are really interesting to create a video inside a Runway all you have to do is go to generative session and you can upload your image or video and of course we can type in a prompt here I'm just going to say camera tracking shot Soldier walks down the hallway and you can of course change the model that you're using gen 3 Alpha is their best model at the time and you can change it from 5 Seconds to 10 seconds we can just do 5 seconds for now and go ahead and click generate so let's watch your scene copy that okay so you can see there are things to like and also things not to like with this overall scene here uh so if we kind of go to the beginning here the first thing you're probably going to notice is a severe loss in resolution now it's really interesting because a lot of the AI video generators produce results that are around 720p but for some reason the Fidelity of the generations from Runway really don't look great A lot of times uh for example there's a lot of really fuzzy areas you see here with this establishing shot that if an audience was watching this they would really uh not be very forgiving uh for those uh changes in resolution there you also have some really weird physics so you see this character here he's kind of gliding in a weird way this guy in the background he looks pretty good although he's not in much of a hurry but that's okay uh but this guy he kind of seems like he's gliding and a bit like connected to the camera as opposed to his like natural footsteps so that's a little weird and then the final shot here of the guy looking up I I like that Dynamic camera movement obviously there's not a lot of expression on his face it is kind of flat so you'd probably need to use Runway act one to like get a little more expression there uh but it it did an okay job the thing to like about Runway is the fact that it's really quick you can generate like 20 video clips in the time it would take you to generate one inside of cing or minia Max and you also have the ability to use all of those features that I talked about that go Way Beyond just the video generation alone so I really recommend using Runway if you are a filmmaker but let's get to the score for overall realism with Runway I would say that it's kind of just a five out of 10 I was really thinking that the results would be better but it seems like the algorithm has really stagnated recently hope hopefully there will be new announcements soon but at this point it's really beginning to fall behind some of the competitors for character in camera physics again I have to give it a five out of 10 the characters inside of our scene some of them looked good others the physics just didn't look right and the overall camera movement just didn't really make a lot of sense especially with that second shot and for workflow and ease of use I'll say eight out of 10 giving Runway a total of 18 out of 30 putting them strongly inside of that sweet potato category next up we have Luma Luma dream machine released in summer 2024 and it really was one of the first AI video generators that existed in this kind of gen 3 era the results that we got from Luma far exceeded the other results that we were getting from other AI video generators but the question is how does the Luma hold up today Luma is incredibly easy to use all you have to do is click the plus icon on their website go to the image and upload load your image you also have the ability to set an inframe so you can interpolate between the first frame and the last frame and it'll basically animate between them which is pretty cool all we have to do is type in our prompt and go ahead and click render I put all the clips from Luma together let's go ahead and take a look copy that okay so as you can see it's not super real istic an audience would not fully buy the scenes that we're getting from Luma I do think the establishing shot looks pretty good but that second shot with the soldiers here I mean it just looks like this guy in the background is being the creepiest little creepy SWAT guy ever and this guy while the initial turn looks good it just it it's coming across a slow motion which a lot of the AI video generators will give you slow motion footage and that's not really helpful if you're working on a project that's supposed to have realistic Dynamic physics and then the final shot here of the guy his eyes looks weird it looks like he's like a weird skeleton guy uh I think was it X-Men where the guy like blinked in two different ways it kind of looks like he has like a weird blink going on right now so it really just did not do an amazing job so while Luma is fast and easy to use and their API is also incredibly quick the fact is that realism is really bad you tend to get a lot of slow motion video clips from Luma and the physics just aren't really that realistic so for overall realism I'm going to give Luma a two out of 10 for character in camera physics again a two out of 10 and then for workflow and ease of use I'm going to say five out of 10 the actual interface is incredibly easy to use but when you actually get into the resolution that you're getting from Luma the overall Fidelity the quality of the generations and then also just the feasibility of the tools that are there the first frame and last frame feature is great in theory in actuality it doesn't actually work out so good most of the time so I'm actually only going to give that a five out of 10 so that means that the total score for Luma is 9 out of 10 putting it in the steak fry category although some french fries with some A1 that would probably be pretty solid next up is minia Max also known as hilu it is a chinese-based video generator that popped up in 2024 and the results are pretty impressive let me show you how to use it to use Minimax all you have to do is go to the hilu AI video website and go ahead and click quick create from here you can drag in an image and we'll paste in our prompt and the cool thing is you do have the ability to generate up to three video clips at a time which is pretty cool and go ahead and click generate so let's watch back our results from Minimax copy [Music] that so as you can see there's some things to like and some things not to like about this the first is the overall movement of the camera especially on the establishing shot it's not super Dynamic and the things that should be moving for example the clouds in the background there's really just not a lot of movement it it's okay but it's not the best you also have the second shot here and let's just note this guy who is just being a like a sneak King over here he's just like sneaking around creeping in the weirdest possible way and I should also note that we prompted for the soldier to basically be walking towards the door and he really just kind of like checks his gun and like looks around there's really just not a lot of movement there so not the best result from that shot and then finally we have this shot here and you can see that the man he's kind of talking here I don't really know what he's saying we didn't prompt in for talking but for some reason Minimax really likes making everyone talk so again minia Max is incredibly easy to use and the physics are decent especially if you have shots that aren't getting enough movement from some of the other video platforms Minx tends to give you the most overall movement and so it can really just add life to your animation just think about it as H giving your subject some coffee that's kind of what you're doing whenever you use minia max now the con to using Minx is the fact that it the overall realism is just not amazing compared to the AI video generators that are now available it used to be amazing just a few months ago it really was one of the best tools but as it stands right now it's not giving us the best results and the overall resolution is also a bit lower from miniac so you're going to have to upres the result and then also probably do a little bit of sharpening because it does tend to be a little soft so for overall realism from minia Max I'm going to say seven out of 10 for character in camera physics we're going to do 6 out of 10 and for workflow and ease of use it's incredibly easy to use we're going to say8 out of 10 which gives Mini Max a score of 21 out of 30 and they are officially a sweet potato next up we have cing like minia Max clling is a Chinese video model but they have many more features that are interesting you have the ability to train models on someone's face so that you can have them in the video again and again there's a lot more control over the videos that you generate and there's just more settings that can adjust including negative prompting to get exactly what you're looking for to create a video inside of cing all you have to do is go to the AI videos button and you can drag and drop your image and I'm using the latest version of cing that's 1.6 again you type in a prompt you can also change the duration the number of generations and then also the creativity strength which is pretty cool and then they do have a spot down here to type in negative prompts so things like Blurry Distortion weird all of those words that you typically would want to include in a negative prompt you can paste down here and when you're ready of course you can click generate so let's take a look at the results here copy [Music] that okay I got to say I'm really impressed from the result from cling here I think that it really embodies a lot of the Cinematic Aesthetics and elements that I would want to see from a video generator for example if we go back to the beginning here you can see that the smoke is billowing from this Factory and we have that nice movement of the overall scene which is cool we also have this second clip here it's pretty interesting because you have the soldier that holds up the gun and then it rack focuses on this guy in the background and his movement if you compare that to some of the other tools the guy in the background's movement is very realistic it really looks like there's a lot of weight behind it steps obviously we'd probably want to prompt in a little more urgency from the way he's approaching that door but it is what we prompted and the actual added camera movement looks good and I should also note that on the edges here you're seeing some chromatic aberration it's taking on Lind Dynamics like that's really uh a very cinematic and uh a much more detailed result that we're getting from cing versus other tools like Luma you couldn't even begin to think about chromatic aberration like that because the resolution is already so soft that that's that's a something to focus on in the future whenever their model gets as good as clean and then we have the shot here of the guy anxiously looking at his computer and I should note that when we prompted in for you know someone anxiously at their computer the system actually understood what anxiety is when it's captured on camera there's usually a pushing in feels like the world is closing in around them and uh really the overall uh cinematic result helps to reinforce the story that we're trying to tell so it's kind of like having a bit of an AI Director of Photography helping you out during the production process here so for overall realism I would say eight out of 10 for cing it does a really good job most of the time character in character physics again I would say eight out of 10 and then for workflow and ease of use again eight out of 10 so eights across the board that gives cing a total of 24 out of 30 putting it in the waffle fry category and then finally we we have hyper 2.5 hyper is a super fast and easy tool to use but can it stand up to the other tools let's find out so I'm on Hyper's website and all you have to do is go to image to video and let's go ahead and upload our image so our image is uploaded and then we have our prompt here so you do have the ability to change the resolution if you want and also the duration up to 6 seconds long and go ahead and click create let's take a look at our final result [Music] here copy [Music] that okay so as you can see the result from hyper is not amazing the first shot is just incredibly static there's just no movement whatsoever the second shot I don't know what's happening this guy's not even moving and this guy the the weight behind the guy's steps is just strange he's like floating and then it just like randomly Zooms in for some reason at the end so no idea what's going on there and then finally we have the shot of the guy kind of rising up and I suppose it's okay the only problem is when he blinks it is like it's like too fast and too robotic it's like it didn't blink for enough frame so it looks like he's I don't know some sort of like robot character that's been programmed to Blink as opposed to a real uh video clip here so I just don't think it did an amazing job so while I definitely think hyper is a very fast and easy tool to use the truth is it's very unrealistic and the physics are honestly pretty bad at this point so for overall realism I'm going to give hyper a one out of 10 for character and Camera physics I'll give it a two out of 10 I think that last shot was okay but not the best and for workflow and ease of use I'm going to say two out of 10 mainly because the overall Fidelity and resolution of those final videos that you get they're not amazing and there's not a ton of advanced features on their platform so that gives hyper a total of five out of 30 putting it unfortunately in

to it to create a video and Sora all you have to do is go to their website click on the plus icon at the bottom and you can upload an image or a video which is pretty cool I'll use this video of a SWAT guy walking towards the door and we'll go ahead and click open once the image is loaded up now you can type in your prompt for our prompt I'll say a soldier walks down a hallway the camera tracks with the soldier as they approach a door handheld camera so the cool thing about using Sora is you have the ability to adjust quite a few different settings that aren't available other tools so for example you can select different aspect ratios we'll say 16 by9 of course uh you can also change the resolution so you can go all the way to 1080p which is great because most of the AI video generators can only do 720p you can also change the duration with some of the resolution settings you can go all the way up to 20 seconds it's pretty cool and then finally you can change the number of variations now with the 1080p version you can only create one variant but with 720 you can do two and with 480 you can do four which is really powerful so when you're ready to render go ahead and click create video I went ahead and rendered out the other two clips as well and combined them together into a scene with some sound effects let's go ahead and take a look copy that okay so as you can see it does look fairly cinematic the establishing shot looks pretty good I like the the dynamic movement I like that the clouds in the background are billowing and it really does feel like an establishing shot we also have the shot here of the soldier walking to the door which is pretty good I should note that we had to edit around a spot where the soldier in the background actually just kind of disappeared so that's just kind of part of working with Sora it sometimes takes your image that you uploaded and changes it a bit whenever it starts to render but you know looks pretty good the alarm you know kind of Clicks in a little late there but it's not bad and then finally we have the shot of the guy looking up and yeah there's like anxiety on his face looks like he's kind of in a hurry the camera Shake looks very very natural so I think it did a pretty good job now of course the problem with working with Sora is because it tends to be one of the more creative tools it can also get the strangest whenever you get into your generation so for example here's one clip that we had and you can see that the background character like disappears behind some random door and then that door closes and then he is approaching this door and same thing over here he just kind of covers up the guy and then a huge door appears which is uh just kind of weird so a lot of times when you're working inside of Sora that type of stuff can happen and it can really eat into your generation credits the strangeness that you get from Sora can be extra annoying sometimes because the tools also pretty expensive the most expensive version is $200 a month which is definitely cost prohibitive for a lot of Independent Artists on the positive side Sora makes it super easy to upload images and videos and you do have the ability to key frame your videos using a storyboard feature which is very helpful when Sora hits it hits incredibly well and the video quality can be incredible so it's definitely an amazing tool for getting really good results and the fact that you can render 1080p natively is really nice of course you probably want to upscale that using an outside tool but the fact that you can render the core video in 1080 is really awesome now the cont to using Sora is exactly like I said it's really expensive which is cost prohibitive for a lot of folks and then the fact that it can tend to cut to random shots and really just waste a lot of time that can be a challenge you also don't have the ability to upload photos of people if you aren't on the most expensive plan so again that makes it really challenging if you're an independent artist using the tool so for all of these AI video generators I'm going to rate them based on three categories the first is realism the second is camera and character physics and the third is workflow and ease of use so for realism inside of Sora I would say eight out of 10 it does a really good job it's not perfect and even the best generations of Sora if you really begin to examine them there can be some strangeness that you begin to uncover but it does a really good job now for character and Camera physics I will say that because Sora can get really strange really quickly and it tends to want to change your scene again and again I have to give it just a 4 out of 10 and for workflow and ease of use I'm going to give it a 5 out of 10 because while the platform is incredibly easy to use and intuitive the fact is the content moderation filters are too extreme with Sora and it makes it really challenging when you're working on a film project so that gives Sora a total score of 17 out of 30 putting them into the sweet potato fry level next up we have Google vo so VO2 was announced recently and the quality of the results that we've seen from the tool are incredible let me show you how to use it so this is what VO2 looks like I'm in Early Access so this isn't publicly available so I'll move quickly here weird thing about using vo is the fact that you don't have the ability to upload your own images at this time you have to create the image on their platform and then you create the video so that can be really tricky especially if you're looking for character consistency lighting consistency color all of those things so you should definitely know about that limitation and it is going to make it incredibly hard to create films with the tool in its current capacity but that being said let me show you the workflow here so I have basically a prompt where I'm going to create an image of a soldier walking down the abandoned hallway let's go ahead and create that image okay we have an image here if you wanted to you could start over I'm just going to go ahead and move forward we'll go to motion here and I'm going to say a soldier walks down a hallway the camera tracks as the soldier approaches the door and we'll go ahead and create that video I did the same thing for the other three shots let's take a look at our result copy that it's pretty wild I mean the establishing shot looks great that shot with the SWAT guy looks amazing and then this is probably one of the more expressive AI videos that I've seen up to this point but the problem that I'm sure you're noticing here is the three shots feel completely different they feel like they're from three completely different films and really no matter how much prompting you do it's really tricky to get the consistency without more advanced tools for doing style consistency location characters all of those things so that's a huge limitation to using vo however the physics engine that's powering vo is probably the best out of any AI video generator so for overall realism I would say with vo 10 out of 10 it is the best AI video tool for creating realistic videos for character and Camera physics again I would say 10 out of 10 I think it does an amazing job not only with camera Shake tracking shots all of those things but also with the actual expression of the characters directing the movement all of those things come through when you're working with vo and it's incredible all of that being said for workflow and ease of use people really don't have access to vo right now so that's not very helpful and then it's also very tricky to work on a scaled up project inside of VO especially because you're going to want consistency you're going to want that film to feel like it lives in these same world and universe and that's just really tricky so that gives vo a score of 23 out of 30 and they are now in the waffle fry level all right good job moving on let's take a look at Runway Runway is an incredible company that really supports the AI film making community and they have a ton of tools outside of just AI generative video alone you can use runway for lip syncing in painting there's a ton of tools that are really interesting to create a video inside a Runway all you have to do is go to generative session and you can upload your image or video and of course we can type in a prompt here I'm just going to say camera tracking shot Soldier walks down the hallway and you can of course change the model that you're using gen 3 Alpha is their best model at the time and you can change it from 5 Seconds to 10 seconds we can just do 5 seconds for now and go ahead and click generate so let's watch your scene copy that okay so you can see there are things to like and also things not to like with this overall scene here uh so if we kind of go to the beginning here the first thing you're probably going to notice is a severe loss in resolution now it's really interesting because a lot of the AI video generators produce results that are around 720p but for some reason the Fidelity of the generations from Runway really don't look great A lot of times uh for example there's a lot of really fuzzy areas you see here with this establishing shot that if an audience was watching this they would really uh not be very forgiving uh for those uh changes in resolution there you also have some really weird physics so you see this character here he's kind of gliding in a weird way this guy in the background he looks pretty good although he's not in much of a hurry but that's okay uh but this guy he kind of seems like he's gliding and a bit like connected to the camera as opposed to his like natural footsteps so that's a little weird and then the final shot here of the guy looking up I I like that Dynamic camera movement obviously there's not a lot of expression on his face it is kind of flat so you'd probably need to use Runway act one to like get a little more expression there uh but it it did an okay job the thing to like about Runway is the fact that it's really quick you can generate like 20 video clips in the time it would take you to generate one inside of cing or minia Max and you also have the ability to use all of those features that I talked about that go Way Beyond just the video generation alone so I really recommend using Runway if you are a filmmaker but let's get to the score for overall realism with Runway I would say that it's kind of just a five out of 10 I was really thinking that the results would be better but it seems like the algorithm has really stagnated recently hope hopefully there will be new announcements soon but at this point it's really beginning to fall behind some of the competitors for character in camera physics again I have to give it a five out of 10 the characters inside of our scene some of them looked good others the physics just didn't look right and the overall camera movement just didn't really make a lot of sense especially with that second shot and for workflow and ease of use I'll say eight out of 10 giving Runway a total of 18 out of 30 putting them strongly inside of that sweet potato category next up we have Luma Luma dream machine released in summer 2024 and it really was one of the first AI video generators that existed in this kind of gen 3 era the results that we got from Luma far exceeded the other results that we were getting from other AI video generators but the question is how does the Luma hold up today Luma is incredibly easy to use all you have to do is click the plus icon on their website go to the image and upload load your image you also have the ability to set an inframe so you can interpolate between the first frame and the last frame and it'll basically animate between them which is pretty cool all we have to do is type in our prompt and go ahead and click render I put all the clips from Luma together let's go ahead and take a look copy that okay so as you can see it's not super real istic an audience would not fully buy the scenes that we're getting from Luma I do think the establishing shot looks pretty good but that second shot with the soldiers here I mean it just looks like this guy in the background is being the creepiest little creepy SWAT guy ever and this guy while the initial turn looks good it just it it's coming across a slow motion which a lot of the AI video generators will give you slow motion footage and that's not really helpful if you're working on a project that's supposed to have realistic Dynamic physics and then the final shot here of the guy his eyes looks weird it looks like he's like a weird skeleton guy uh I think was it X-Men where the guy like blinked in two different ways it kind of looks like he has like a weird blink going on right now so it really just did not do an amazing job so while Luma is fast and easy to use and their API is also incredibly quick the fact is that realism is really bad you tend to get a lot of slow motion video clips from Luma and the physics just aren't really that realistic so for overall realism I'm going to give Luma a two out of 10 for character in camera physics again a two out of 10 and then for workflow and ease of use I'm going to say five out of 10 the actual interface is incredibly easy to use but when you actually get into the resolution that you're getting from Luma the overall Fidelity the quality of the generations and then also just the feasibility of the tools that are there the first frame and last frame feature is great in theory in actuality it doesn't actually work out so good most of the time so I'm actually only going to give that a five out of 10 so that means that the total score for Luma is 9 out of 10 putting it in the steak fry category although some french fries with some A1 that would probably be pretty solid next up is minia Max also known as hilu it is a chinese-based video generator that popped up in 2024 and the results are pretty impressive let me show you how to use it to use Minimax all you have to do is go to the hilu AI video website and go ahead and click quick create from here you can drag in an image and we'll paste in our prompt and the cool thing is you do have the ability to generate up to three video clips at a time which is pretty cool and go ahead and click generate so let's watch back our results from Minimax copy [Music] that so as you can see there's some things to like and some things not to like about this the first is the overall movement of the camera especially on the establishing shot it's not super Dynamic and the things that should be moving for example the clouds in the background there's really just not a lot of movement it it's okay but it's not the best you also have the second shot here and let's just note this guy who is just being a like a sneak King over here he's just like sneaking around creeping in the weirdest possible way and I should also note that we prompted for the soldier to basically be walking towards the door and he really just kind of like checks his gun and like looks around there's really just not a lot of movement there so not the best result from that shot and then finally we have this shot here and you can see that the man he's kind of talking here I don't really know what he's saying we didn't prompt in for talking but for some reason Minimax really likes making everyone talk so again minia Max is incredibly easy to use and the physics are decent especially if you have shots that aren't getting enough movement from some of the other video platforms Minx tends to give you the most overall movement and so it can really just add life to your animation just think about it as H giving your subject some coffee that's kind of what you're doing whenever you use minia max now the con to using Minx is the fact that it the overall realism is just not amazing compared to the AI video generators that are now available it used to be amazing just a few months ago it really was one of the best tools but as it stands right now it's not giving us the best results and the overall resolution is also a bit lower from miniac so you're going to have to upres the result and then also probably do a little bit of sharpening because it does tend to be a little soft so for overall realism from minia Max I'm going to say seven out of 10 for character in camera physics we're going to do 6 out of 10 and for workflow and ease of use it's incredibly easy to use we're going to say8 out of 10 which gives Mini Max a score of 21 out of 30 and they are officially a sweet potato next up we have cing like minia Max clling is a Chinese video model but they have many more features that are interesting you have the ability to train models on someone's face so that you can have them in the video again and again there's a lot more control over the videos that you generate and there's just more settings that can adjust including negative prompting to get exactly what you're looking for to create a video inside of cing all you have to do is go to the AI videos button and you can drag and drop your image and I'm using the latest version of cing that's 1.6 again you type in a prompt you can also change the duration the number of generations and then also the creativity strength which is pretty cool and then they do have a spot down here to type in negative prompts so things like Blurry Distortion weird all of those words that you typically would want to include in a negative prompt you can paste down here and when you're ready of course you can click generate so let's take a look at the results here copy [Music] that okay I got to say I'm really impressed from the result from cling here I think that it really embodies a lot of the Cinematic Aesthetics and elements that I would want to see from a video generator for example if we go back to the beginning here you can see that the smoke is billowing from this Factory and we have that nice movement of the overall scene which is cool we also have this second clip here it's pretty interesting because you have the soldier that holds up the gun and then it rack focuses on this guy in the background and his movement if you compare that to some of the other tools the guy in the background's movement is very realistic it really looks like there's a lot of weight behind it steps obviously we'd probably want to prompt in a little more urgency from the way he's approaching that door but it is what we prompted and the actual added camera movement looks good and I should also note that on the edges here you're seeing some chromatic aberration it's taking on Lind Dynamics like that's really uh a very cinematic and uh a much more detailed result that we're getting from cing versus other tools like Luma you couldn't even begin to think about chromatic aberration like that because the resolution is already so soft that that's that's a something to focus on in the future whenever their model gets as good as clean and then we have the shot here of the guy anxiously looking at his computer and I should note that when we prompted in for you know someone anxiously at their computer the system actually understood what anxiety is when it's captured on camera there's usually a pushing in feels like the world is closing in around them and uh really the overall uh cinematic result helps to reinforce the story that we're trying to tell so it's kind of like having a bit of an AI Director of Photography helping you out during the production process here so for overall realism I would say eight out of 10 for cing it does a really good job most of the time character in character physics again I would say eight out of 10 and then for workflow and ease of use again eight out of 10 so eights across the board that gives cing a total of 24 out of 30 putting it in the waffle fry category and then finally we we have hyper 2.5 hyper is a super fast and easy tool to use but can it stand up to the other tools let's find out so I'm on Hyper's website and all you have to do is go to image to video and let's go ahead and upload our image so our image is uploaded and then we have our prompt here so you do have the ability to change the resolution if you want and also the duration up to 6 seconds long and go ahead and click create let's take a look at our final result [Music] here copy [Music] that okay so as you can see the result from hyper is not amazing the first shot is just incredibly static there's just no movement whatsoever the second shot I don't know what's happening this guy's not even moving and this guy the the weight behind the guy's steps is just strange he's like floating and then it just like randomly Zooms in for some reason at the end so no idea what's going on there and then finally we have the shot of the guy kind of rising up and I suppose it's okay the only problem is when he blinks it is like it's like too fast and too robotic it's like it didn't blink for enough frame so it looks like he's I don't know some sort of like robot character that's been programmed to Blink as opposed to a real uh video clip here so I just don't think it did an amazing job so while I definitely think hyper is a very fast and easy tool to use the truth is it's very unrealistic and the physics are honestly pretty bad at this point so for overall realism I'm going to give hyper a one out of 10 for character and Camera physics I'll give it a two out of 10 I think that last shot was okay but not the best and for workflow and ease of use I'm going to say two out of 10 mainly because the overall Fidelity and resolution of those final videos that you get they're not amazing and there's not a ton of advanced features on their platform so that gives hyper a total of five out of 30 putting it unfortunately in

Blog Tools Best Video Editing Software in 2025 — 15 Free + Paid Tools A comprehensive list of both paid and free video editors, breaking down what makes them unique and who they're a good fit for. Jan 15, 2025 12 min readTools Kirsti LangSenior Content Writer @ Buffer There’s no two ways about it: video is the way people prefer to consume content in 2025. Buffer’s data shows that when it comes to social media platforms video outperforms every other type of content by a landslide — and that’s on all platforms. Whether you’re a social media marketer, content creator, or influencer, video content should be a key part of your growth and marketing strategy. Of course, that’s easier said than done. Video creation requires a lot more input (though the proof really is in the pudding). Often, the biggest hurdle to overcome is video editing — but in 2025, there’s really no reason to let this block you. Thanks to the incredible variety of free video editing software options on the market, editing your videos is now easier than ever. Thanks to templates, transcript editing, AI, and a host of other nifty features, editing your videos can now be — dare I say it? — fun! With all that in mind, here’s a guide to the best video editing software for creators, marketers, and small business owners. I've curated separate lists of paid and free video editors, though, in many cases, the tools offer both limited free versions and more feature-rich paid versions. Only the tools with substantial free offerings are included in the free video editing software list. Many of these tools also come with advanced features that cater to both beginners and professionals, so there's a suitable option here no matter your skill level. Let's dig in. 🚀 Give your videos the best possible chance of success — schedule them videos across multiple platforms, including TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, in one go with Buffer. Here's how → Best free video editing software Most of the video editors in this list do have paid plans that come with additional benefits, but they made this list because their free plans are comprehensive and powerful — so you don’t need to spend a cent to use them. Some of these tools are completely free, offering a full suite of features without any restrictions or watermarks. 1. CapCut It still breaks my brain a little that most of CapCut’s best features are 100 percent free. With both a powerful app, browser, and desktop version that it’s relatively easy to toggle between, CapCut is a no-brainer if you’re creating videos for social media. In my experience, it’s the best video editing software for beginner to intermediate editors. The mostly free video editor is especially handy for TikTok. The two apps pair beautifully, thanks to the fact that they’re both owned by ByteDance. You can even add some trending TikTok sounds right in CapCut before exporting or sharing directly to TikTok (you’ll just need to save the audio in TikTok and log into CapCut with your TikTok account). As far as I know, it's the only free video editor that allows this. When it comes to editing itself, CapCut is intuitive and easy to learn. It offers an eye-popping variety of fonts, effects, stickers, and transitions to choose from, along with a superb caption auto generator. More advanced users will love CapCut, too, thanks to some really in-depth editing options like voice isolation and enhancements, color adjustments, and more. Note that some of these features are only available on the paid plan, but at $7.99 per month, it’s still one of the more affordable options out there. Pro tip: I find video editing a little easier to do on my computer than on my phone, but if you go that route, do go the extra mile and download the desktop version of CapCut to access all the best features. CapCut’s online video editor isn’t quite as powerful and user-friendly. Price: Free, with paid plans starting at $9.99 per month 2. Clipchamp Create Clipchamp Create, which replaced Windows Movie Maker, is one of the most generous free online video editing tools I’ve found in my research. If you have a Windows PC, you’ll find the free video editing software pre-downloaded on your computer. If you’re a Mac user, fear not — you can use it in your browser. The free plan lets you create unlimited video projects, gives you access to all basic editing tools, and allows you to export your videos in 480p output resolution without a watermark. (A watermark will be present if you use stock footage, though.) You could upgrade to Premium or higher to gain access to its stock library and download your videos at better resolutions. If you’re recording voiceovers or filming yourself, Clipchamp’s Speaker Coach is a unique plus. It’ll help you track your pace, pitch, and filler words and offer tips and tricks to improve your presentation skills. Price: Free, with paid plans starting at $9 per month. 3. Canva For simple edits, Canva is one of the best free video editing software options out there. What the video editor lacks in editing capabilities, it makes up for in beautiful, ready-made video templates. The clip editing itself in Canva is basic — you can trip, cut, and rearrange videos, but not layer things over each other (if, say, you wanted to split the audio from your video track and use it as a voiceover). Still, there’s probably a template ready and waiting in their vast template library that will be a good fit for your project. Adding your own photos or clips is as simple as dragging and dropping them into the editor. This tool is great, a fuss-free option for beginner video editors, and is particularly handy if you’re looking to turn some photos into a video. Price: Free plan, with paid options starting at $15 per user per month. 4. DaVinci Resolve If you’re looking for a tool to create great TikToks, Shorts, or Reels, DaVinci Resolve is probably not for you. But if you’re looking to create super slick, high-production videos for YouTube or even create your own documentary (why not?), DaVinci Resolve is tough to beat. There’s a reason this free video editor is a favorite of both professional YouTubers and Hollywood producers — or rather, many reasons: it combines editing, color correction, visual effects, motion graphics, and audio post-production in a single tool. While this particular free video editing software is not as easy to learn as, say, Canva, DaVinci Resolve is relatively user-friendly. If you’re a marketer or creator looking to add ‘professional video editing’ to your skillset, a couple of hours playing around with Resolve will be time well spent. And yes, I did say free. Some DaVinci Resolve features are exclusive to their paid ‘Studio’ plan, though most will only be necessary for entire production teams. Also, you’ll only be able to export videos in Ultra HD for free. Still, that means a whopping 3840 x 2610 — much higher than most of the free video editors on this list. That said, DaVinci Resolve is a hefty program and will require a decent computer to run. For Windows, that means at least Windows 10, 16GB of memory, and an integrated GPU. On Mac, that’s MacOS 11 or higher, 8GB system memory, and an integrated GPU. Price: Free. The more advanced paid version, Davinci Resolve Studio, costs $295. 5. Adobe Creative Cloud Express Photo: Adobe.com Adobe Express (formerly Adobe Spark) provides multiple storyboards, layouts, and themes to help you create amazing videos. The largely free video editor is a powerful Canva alternative (and it pairs well with one of my favorite free AI image generators, Adobe Firefly, which is a point in its favor). Like Canva, templates are the name of the game here, and video layering options are limited. However, the template options are varied and unique and won’t have that tell-tale “I made this in Canva” feel some folks will know all too well. Some premium templates, stock photos, and videos will only be available on the paid plan (though you can use them if you don’t mind exporting with a watermark). Price: Free, with paid plans starting at $11.99 monthly. 6. Descript Descript is the video editing tool that works like a text editor (seriously, if you hate editing videos, give this one a bash.) Descript was one of the first video editing software options to market with transcript-based editing. In a nutshell, this means Descript auto-generates a transcript for your video, which you can then edit as if you were working on a text document. Whatever text you delete, trim, or move around reflects in the video file, too. Neat, right? It can take a bit of practice to get right, but it’s great when it comes to editing chatter-heavy videos and audio files, this can be a huge time-saver. In my opinion, Descript is one of the best video editing software for podcasts. Technically, you can use some of Descript’s best features for free. With its $0 per month starter plan, you can edit up to 60 minutes of content and remove filler words, but you’ll only be able to export one video without a watermark per month. Price: Limited free plan, with paid options starting at $19 per month. 7. iMovie iMovie is Apple’s native video editor, available for free on Macs, iPhones, and iPads. It’s a great entry-level option, and what it lacks in advanced editing capabilities, it makes up for with pure ease of use. ‘Storyboards’ mode offers a selection of templates with styles based on your use case — think things like “Gaming,” Makeover,” or “Q&A” — and even a Magic Movie mode, which will automatically turn your photos into a movie in seconds. If you’re a complete beginner and a bit intimidated by video editing tools, it might be worthwhile to play around with iMovie before moving on to one of the more robust options on this list. Price: Free on Mac and iOS. ⚡ On the hunt for more AI features? Check out our list of the best AI video editors. Best paid video editing software Once again, you'll find some options on this list that do have free plans, though I found their paid options worth paying for. 1. CapCut Pro Capcut again? Sorry, I just had to. Capcut's Pro plan makes it one of the best video editing software options. The paid version of the video editor grants users access to an expanded library of fonts, animations, and other effects, plus handy features like retouching effects (helpful if you don’t fancy applying a full face of makeup to look put-together in your videos), enhanced background removal tools, and vocal enhancements. Price: Paid plans start at $9.99 per month. 2. Veed.io Veed is a fast and easy online video editor that boasts the power of templates and some robust video editing tools. It’s also brilliant for auto-generating captions and has a handy library of sound effects and music to help you add a little extra pizazz to your work. Veed's features set it apart from other similar video editors on this list, including in-app screen and webcam recording and (rather terrifyingly) realistic AI avatars that will read your script for you. There is a free plan available, but once again you’ll only be able to export videos with a Veed watermark. Price: Paid plans start at $19 per month. 3. Capsule Capsule is one of the newer video editors on the block, and offers similar tools to the likes of Veed and Kapwing. Its USP, however, is making it easy for marketing teams — even those without pro video editing skills — to collaborate and stick to brand guidelines. The online video editor features all the bells and whistles of other popular tools, with things like transcript-based editing, auto-resizing, and lightweight animations. There’s also an AI co-producer that will create auto-jump cuts, clean up dialogue, and more. That said, it’s on the pricier end at $99 per month. There is a free plan you can use to put it to the test, which will allow you to use pretty much all the tools in their professional plan, though you’re limited to three videos (in total, not per month). Price: You'll need to speak to a sales consultant for pricing, though there is a limited free plan. 4. InShot InShot is an app that allows you to trim, speed up, or add music, filters, and fun effects to video. The mobile app is pretty simple and features are limited, but seriously easy to use. It also allows users to edit videos, photos, and create image collages. If you’re creating videos exclusively for social and mostly just want to string clips together and make them look fun and interesting, InShot is a solid option. You can do neat things like create video collages, remove backgrounds, add doodles, and loads more. One could technically count InShot among the free video editing apps, as you can download and use it to edit videos without paying. However, your videos will be exported with a watermark. Perhaps more frustrating in the free version, though, is the unskippable ads. Price: Limited free plan with paid plans starting at $3.99 per month. 5. Kapwing Kapwing is another simple drag-and-drop video editor that offers much of the same thing already mentioned above — templates, transcript editing, filler word remover, AI, more. It’s perhaps best described as a leveled-up version of Canva or a slicker version of CapCut. One notable feature is a content repurposing tool that automatically finds key moments in long-form videos and repurposes them into highlight clips. There’s also the ability to work together on a project with your teammates in real-time, a bit like you can in design tool Figma. Almost all of Kapwing’s best features are available for free, but you can only export watermarked videos. Pricing: Free with watermarks, with plans starting at $24 per month. 6. Adobe Premiere Pro Adobe Premier Pro is one of the video editor heavyweights, boasting the kind of feature set that will help you edit everything from TV series to documentaries (should you feel so inclined). Available for Windows and Mac users, Premier Pro comes with a steep learning curve and is not for the casual creator. It’s more regularly updated and integration-friendly than its Mac-only counterpart, FinalCut Pro (below). Price: $22.99 per month, though there are bundle options available with other Adobe products that may give you more bang for your buck. FinalCut Pro FinalCut Pro is another professional tool, once lauded as the gold standard of video editors. It’s likely the tool used to edit your favorite blockbuster movies, thanks to its special effects features and faster rendering times. It comes with a caveat, though — it’s exclusive Mac video editing software, and only available to users in the Apple ecosystem. Price: $299.99 to own. 8. FilmoraGo Wondershare FilmoraGo is one of the OG simple video editing tools. It’s been around for years, but has kept pace with new tech and trends to make it a strong contender on this list. Besides the usual features such as themes, text, and transitions, it also offers a range of video editing features — trim/split, ratio/crop, speed control, reverse, voice-over, audio mixer, and picture-in-picture. The AI tools are fun to play around with, too — there’s an AI image generator, AI text-based editing, and an AI Copilot to guide you as you edit video, among others. Another handy point in Filmora’s favor is that it’s easy to work on projects both on your computer and phone — the online video editor, app, and desktop versions make it easy to toggle between the two. You can use some of the video editor features for free, but you can only export videos with a watermark. Price: Starts at $29.99 quarterly, though there is a limited free version. Maximize your video reach No matter how simple the video editor is, creating and editing social media videos takes a lot of time and effort — which is why it makes sense to ensure they have the highest impact possible.

Blog Tools Best Video Editing Software in 2025 — 15 Free + Paid Tools A comprehensive list of both paid and free video editors, breaking down what makes them unique and who they're a good fit for. Jan 15, 2025 12 min readTools Kirsti LangSenior Content Writer @ Buffer There’s no two ways about it: video is the way people prefer to consume content in 2025. Buffer’s data shows that when it comes to social media platforms video outperforms every other type of content by a landslide — and that’s on all platforms. Whether you’re a social media marketer, content creator, or influencer, video content should be a key part of your growth and marketing strategy. Of course, that’s easier said than done. Video creation requires a lot more input (though the proof really is in the pudding). Often, the biggest hurdle to overcome is video editing — but in 2025, there’s really no reason to let this block you. Thanks to the incredible variety of free video editing software options on the market, editing your videos is now easier than ever. Thanks to templates, transcript editing, AI, and a host of other nifty features, editing your videos can now be — dare I say it? — fun! With all that in mind, here’s a guide to the best video editing software for creators, marketers, and small business owners. I've curated separate lists of paid and free video editors, though, in many cases, the tools offer both limited free versions and more feature-rich paid versions. Only the tools with substantial free offerings are included in the free video editing software list. Many of these tools also come with advanced features that cater to both beginners and professionals, so there's a suitable option here no matter your skill level. Let's dig in. 🚀 Give your videos the best possible chance of success — schedule them videos across multiple platforms, including TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, in one go with Buffer. Here's how → Best free video editing software Most of the video editors in this list do have paid plans that come with additional benefits, but they made this list because their free plans are comprehensive and powerful — so you don’t need to spend a cent to use them. Some of these tools are completely free, offering a full suite of features without any restrictions or watermarks. 1. CapCut It still breaks my brain a little that most of CapCut’s best features are 100 percent free. With both a powerful app, browser, and desktop version that it’s relatively easy to toggle between, CapCut is a no-brainer if you’re creating videos for social media. In my experience, it’s the best video editing software for beginner to intermediate editors. The mostly free video editor is especially handy for TikTok. The two apps pair beautifully, thanks to the fact that they’re both owned by ByteDance. You can even add some trending TikTok sounds right in CapCut before exporting or sharing directly to TikTok (you’ll just need to save the audio in TikTok and log into CapCut with your TikTok account). As far as I know, it's the only free video editor that allows this. When it comes to editing itself, CapCut is intuitive and easy to learn. It offers an eye-popping variety of fonts, effects, stickers, and transitions to choose from, along with a superb caption auto generator. More advanced users will love CapCut, too, thanks to some really in-depth editing options like voice isolation and enhancements, color adjustments, and more. Note that some of these features are only available on the paid plan, but at $7.99 per month, it’s still one of the more affordable options out there. Pro tip: I find video editing a little easier to do on my computer than on my phone, but if you go that route, do go the extra mile and download the desktop version of CapCut to access all the best features. CapCut’s online video editor isn’t quite as powerful and user-friendly. Price: Free, with paid plans starting at $9.99 per month 2. Clipchamp Create Clipchamp Create, which replaced Windows Movie Maker, is one of the most generous free online video editing tools I’ve found in my research. If you have a Windows PC, you’ll find the free video editing software pre-downloaded on your computer. If you’re a Mac user, fear not — you can use it in your browser. The free plan lets you create unlimited video projects, gives you access to all basic editing tools, and allows you to export your videos in 480p output resolution without a watermark. (A watermark will be present if you use stock footage, though.) You could upgrade to Premium or higher to gain access to its stock library and download your videos at better resolutions. If you’re recording voiceovers or filming yourself, Clipchamp’s Speaker Coach is a unique plus. It’ll help you track your pace, pitch, and filler words and offer tips and tricks to improve your presentation skills. Price: Free, with paid plans starting at $9 per month. 3. Canva For simple edits, Canva is one of the best free video editing software options out there. What the video editor lacks in editing capabilities, it makes up for in beautiful, ready-made video templates. The clip editing itself in Canva is basic — you can trip, cut, and rearrange videos, but not layer things over each other (if, say, you wanted to split the audio from your video track and use it as a voiceover). Still, there’s probably a template ready and waiting in their vast template library that will be a good fit for your project. Adding your own photos or clips is as simple as dragging and dropping them into the editor. This tool is great, a fuss-free option for beginner video editors, and is particularly handy if you’re looking to turn some photos into a video. Price: Free plan, with paid options starting at $15 per user per month. 4. DaVinci Resolve If you’re looking for a tool to create great TikToks, Shorts, or Reels, DaVinci Resolve is probably not for you. But if you’re looking to create super slick, high-production videos for YouTube or even create your own documentary (why not?), DaVinci Resolve is tough to beat. There’s a reason this free video editor is a favorite of both professional YouTubers and Hollywood producers — or rather, many reasons: it combines editing, color correction, visual effects, motion graphics, and audio post-production in a single tool. While this particular free video editing software is not as easy to learn as, say, Canva, DaVinci Resolve is relatively user-friendly. If you’re a marketer or creator looking to add ‘professional video editing’ to your skillset, a couple of hours playing around with Resolve will be time well spent. And yes, I did say free. Some DaVinci Resolve features are exclusive to their paid ‘Studio’ plan, though most will only be necessary for entire production teams. Also, you’ll only be able to export videos in Ultra HD for free. Still, that means a whopping 3840 x 2610 — much higher than most of the free video editors on this list. That said, DaVinci Resolve is a hefty program and will require a decent computer to run. For Windows, that means at least Windows 10, 16GB of memory, and an integrated GPU. On Mac, that’s MacOS 11 or higher, 8GB system memory, and an integrated GPU. Price: Free. The more advanced paid version, Davinci Resolve Studio, costs $295. 5. Adobe Creative Cloud Express Photo: Adobe.com Adobe Express (formerly Adobe Spark) provides multiple storyboards, layouts, and themes to help you create amazing videos. The largely free video editor is a powerful Canva alternative (and it pairs well with one of my favorite free AI image generators, Adobe Firefly, which is a point in its favor). Like Canva, templates are the name of the game here, and video layering options are limited. However, the template options are varied and unique and won’t have that tell-tale “I made this in Canva” feel some folks will know all too well. Some premium templates, stock photos, and videos will only be available on the paid plan (though you can use them if you don’t mind exporting with a watermark). Price: Free, with paid plans starting at $11.99 monthly. 6. Descript Descript is the video editing tool that works like a text editor (seriously, if you hate editing videos, give this one a bash.) Descript was one of the first video editing software options to market with transcript-based editing. In a nutshell, this means Descript auto-generates a transcript for your video, which you can then edit as if you were working on a text document. Whatever text you delete, trim, or move around reflects in the video file, too. Neat, right? It can take a bit of practice to get right, but it’s great when it comes to editing chatter-heavy videos and audio files, this can be a huge time-saver. In my opinion, Descript is one of the best video editing software for podcasts. Technically, you can use some of Descript’s best features for free. With its $0 per month starter plan, you can edit up to 60 minutes of content and remove filler words, but you’ll only be able to export one video without a watermark per month. Price: Limited free plan, with paid options starting at $19 per month. 7. iMovie iMovie is Apple’s native video editor, available for free on Macs, iPhones, and iPads. It’s a great entry-level option, and what it lacks in advanced editing capabilities, it makes up for with pure ease of use. ‘Storyboards’ mode offers a selection of templates with styles based on your use case — think things like “Gaming,” Makeover,” or “Q&A” — and even a Magic Movie mode, which will automatically turn your photos into a movie in seconds. If you’re a complete beginner and a bit intimidated by video editing tools, it might be worthwhile to play around with iMovie before moving on to one of the more robust options on this list. Price: Free on Mac and iOS. ⚡ On the hunt for more AI features? Check out our list of the best AI video editors. Best paid video editing software Once again, you'll find some options on this list that do have free plans, though I found their paid options worth paying for. 1. CapCut Pro Capcut again? Sorry, I just had to. Capcut's Pro plan makes it one of the best video editing software options. The paid version of the video editor grants users access to an expanded library of fonts, animations, and other effects, plus handy features like retouching effects (helpful if you don’t fancy applying a full face of makeup to look put-together in your videos), enhanced background removal tools, and vocal enhancements. Price: Paid plans start at $9.99 per month. 2. Veed.io Veed is a fast and easy online video editor that boasts the power of templates and some robust video editing tools. It’s also brilliant for auto-generating captions and has a handy library of sound effects and music to help you add a little extra pizazz to your work. Veed's features set it apart from other similar video editors on this list, including in-app screen and webcam recording and (rather terrifyingly) realistic AI avatars that will read your script for you. There is a free plan available, but once again you’ll only be able to export videos with a Veed watermark. Price: Paid plans start at $19 per month. 3. Capsule Capsule is one of the newer video editors on the block, and offers similar tools to the likes of Veed and Kapwing. Its USP, however, is making it easy for marketing teams — even those without pro video editing skills — to collaborate and stick to brand guidelines. The online video editor features all the bells and whistles of other popular tools, with things like transcript-based editing, auto-resizing, and lightweight animations. There’s also an AI co-producer that will create auto-jump cuts, clean up dialogue, and more. That said, it’s on the pricier end at $99 per month. There is a free plan you can use to put it to the test, which will allow you to use pretty much all the tools in their professional plan, though you’re limited to three videos (in total, not per month). Price: You'll need to speak to a sales consultant for pricing, though there is a limited free plan. 4. InShot InShot is an app that allows you to trim, speed up, or add music, filters, and fun effects to video. The mobile app is pretty simple and features are limited, but seriously easy to use. It also allows users to edit videos, photos, and create image collages. If you’re creating videos exclusively for social and mostly just want to string clips together and make them look fun and interesting, InShot is a solid option. You can do neat things like create video collages, remove backgrounds, add doodles, and loads more. One could technically count InShot among the free video editing apps, as you can download and use it to edit videos without paying. However, your videos will be exported with a watermark. Perhaps more frustrating in the free version, though, is the unskippable ads. Price: Limited free plan with paid plans starting at $3.99 per month. 5. Kapwing Kapwing is another simple drag-and-drop video editor that offers much of the same thing already mentioned above — templates, transcript editing, filler word remover, AI, more. It’s perhaps best described as a leveled-up version of Canva or a slicker version of CapCut. One notable feature is a content repurposing tool that automatically finds key moments in long-form videos and repurposes them into highlight clips. There’s also the ability to work together on a project with your teammates in real-time, a bit like you can in design tool Figma. Almost all of Kapwing’s best features are available for free, but you can only export watermarked videos. Pricing: Free with watermarks, with plans starting at $24 per month. 6. Adobe Premiere Pro Adobe Premier Pro is one of the video editor heavyweights, boasting the kind of feature set that will help you edit everything from TV series to documentaries (should you feel so inclined). Available for Windows and Mac users, Premier Pro comes with a steep learning curve and is not for the casual creator. It’s more regularly updated and integration-friendly than its Mac-only counterpart, FinalCut Pro (below). Price: $22.99 per month, though there are bundle options available with other Adobe products that may give you more bang for your buck. FinalCut Pro FinalCut Pro is another professional tool, once lauded as the gold standard of video editors. It’s likely the tool used to edit your favorite blockbuster movies, thanks to its special effects features and faster rendering times. It comes with a caveat, though — it’s exclusive Mac video editing software, and only available to users in the Apple ecosystem. Price: $299.99 to own. 8. FilmoraGo Wondershare FilmoraGo is one of the OG simple video editing tools. It’s been around for years, but has kept pace with new tech and trends to make it a strong contender on this list. Besides the usual features such as themes, text, and transitions, it also offers a range of video editing features — trim/split, ratio/crop, speed control, reverse, voice-over, audio mixer, and picture-in-picture. The AI tools are fun to play around with, too — there’s an AI image generator, AI text-based editing, and an AI Copilot to guide you as you edit video, among others. Another handy point in Filmora’s favor is that it’s easy to work on projects both on your computer and phone — the online video editor, app, and desktop versions make it easy to toggle between the two. You can use some of the video editor features for free, but you can only export videos with a watermark. Price: Starts at $29.99 quarterly, though there is a limited free version.
