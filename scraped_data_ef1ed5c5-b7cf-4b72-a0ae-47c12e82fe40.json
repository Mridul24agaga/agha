  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, let’s pour a cold one and dive into this URL you dropped, https://getmorebacklinks.org/. Right off the bat, the name kinda gives it away, huh? It’s all about backlinks, which means it’s probably geared toward folks looking to boost their website’s SEO game. You know, the stuff that helps you climb those Google rankings so you can finally snag those sweet, sweet organic clicks. So, picture this: you’re a small business owner or a blogger who’s passionate about something—maybe it’s artisanal pickles or indie music reviews. You’ve got great content, but it’s like shouting into the void with zero visitors. That’s where backlinks come in. They’re like little votes of confidence from other sites saying, “Hey, this guy knows his stuff!” The more legit backlinks you score, the better your chances of being seen online. The site is likely packed with tips and tricks on how to gather these golden links. You might find articles on guest blogging, where you write for someone else’s site and sneak in a link to your own. There could be resources on building relationships with other webmasters or creating content that naturally attracts links because it’s just that good—infographics, studies, or some wild how-to guide on making the perfect cocktail. And let’s not overlook the tools! I’d bet you a crisp five-dollar bill there are some tools or services offered on the site to help you analyze your current backlinks or maybe find new opportunities. Imagine entering your URL and getting a rundown of where you're at, or discovering sites that would make great partners for link exchanges. But here’s the kicker: they probably also emphasize the importance of quality over quantity. Not all backlinks are created equal. A link from a respected industry site is worth way more than a random blog that nobody reads. So, you can probably expect some sage advice on how to avoid those sketchy tactics that could get your site in hot water with search engines. Think of it as the \"no black hat\" zone, where the good vibes and clean strategies flow. And let’s keep it real—everyone who’s trying to navigate the digital space is looking for community. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’ve got forums or a blog where peeps can share their experiences, challenges, and maybe even successes. Networking with like-minded folks can be a game-changer, adding a social element to the whole backlink hustle. So, if I had to guess, visiting this site feels like walking into a cozy bar where everyone’s swapping stories about how they got their website to take off. You get the feeling that they genuinely want to help you succeed in the online jungle. Just a bunch of digital entrepreneurs huddled together, sharing tips and keeping the spirits high. All in all, I’d say https://getmorebacklinks.org/ is probably a goldmine for anyone looking to improve their site’s visibility and make some real connections. So whether you’re here for solid strategies, community vibes, or just some sound advice, it sounds like it’s got you covered. Cheers to climbing that SEO ladder one backlink at a time!",

The best backlinks come from being genuinely helpful and creating content people actually want to link to. I'll share the exact strategies that helped one of my student build over 500 high-quality backlinks in just 12 months - no manipulation required. First, let's get something straight. Gone are the days when you could just spam blog comments or buy links in bulk. Google's gotten scary good at spotting artificial links. I have always used white-Hat SEO techniques but once tried the shortcut route and watched my site tank overnight. Here's what actually works: 1. The Skyscraper Method (with a twist) I find content that's already popular in my niche using tools like Ahrefs or BuzzSumo. But instead of just making something \"better,\" I add unique data or original research. For example, when I turned an existing article about remote work into a data-driven study with real numbers from 50 companies, it earned backlinks from 23 industry blogs in one month. 2. The Broken Link Strategy I regularly scan relevant websites in my industry for broken links using Check My Links. Then I reach out to let them know about the broken link and offer my similar content as a replacement. Around 15% of site owners actually take me up on this - way higher than cold outreach. 3. Create Free Tools This is my secret weapon. I built a simple domain tool that helps bloggers to quickly type in their niche and get hundreds of great possible domain names for free. It costs me $200+ to develop, but it's earned hundreds of natural backlinks because it solves a real problem. People love linking to useful tools. 4. HARO (Help a Reporter Out) You can spend 15 minutes each morning scanning HARO emails and responding to relevant queries. It takes consistent effort, but I've landed backlinks from major news sites this way. To be successful, only respond when you have unique insights to share, and keep your responses short and quotable. Here's the uncomfortable truth. Building quality backlinks takes time. But would you rather spend six months building lasting relationships and creating link-worthy content, or waste years trying to recover from a Google penalty? Note: The best backlink is one that would make sense even if Google didn't exist. Focus on creating value first, and the links will follow naturally. But in the mean time, you can use these strategies I have laid out here to start growing your backlinks profile. Upvote · 93 9953 Sponsored by Fisher Investments Unlock 7 Wealth-Building Tips.

      "content": "Skyscraper Link Building: A 2025 Guide Updated On: February 4, 2025 The principle behind the Skyscraper link-building technique is simple: you find popular articles that people link to, improve on the content, and ask the webmasters to link to it instead. Brian Dean coined the term, first writing about it in his 2013 case study, and it became an instant hit in the SEO community. Ten years on, many SEOs still swear by it. But does the Skyscraper method still work in 2024? That's one of the questions we discuss in the article. You will also learn about its benefits and how to execute it for the best results. Let's get started. What Is The Skyscraper Link Building Technique? The Skyscraper link-building technique involves creating content that's longer and more thorough than similar articles. Such superior content stands out from the competition, just like a skyscraper from the skyline. And that's how it attracts backlinks from writers who want to add value to their content. This happens either organically or as a result of outreach campaigns, in which you contact editors, bloggers, or website owners who are already linking to similar articles.. Key Benefits of Skyscraper Technique There were a few reasons for the immense popularity of the Skyscraper tactic. First, it's a white-hat technique that allows you to earn backlinks naturally. And I mean lots of them. When Brian Dean first used it in 2013, he sent 160 emails and secured 17 quality backlinks. That's an 11% success rate! And they boosted the organic search traffic to his article by 110%. What's more, the outreach campaigns are an excellent chance to expand your network and build new relationships, which can lead to more link-building opportunities and exciting projects. And it pushes you to create the best content possible. To catch the attention of prospective partners, yours needs to be the tallest skyscraper in the area. And this helps you establish yourself as an authority in your niche, which often translates into more business opportunities. Is The Skyscraper Method Still Effective in 2024? Brian's original post about the Skyscraper method has been updated a few times but it still describes it as \"a technique that almost guarantees that you get high-quality backlinks from every blog post or any other piece of content that you publish.\" Does it still guarantee those backlinks, though? Last year, Ahrefs asked this question across its social media. 61% of the LinkedIn respondents and 57% of the X respondents said 'Yes'. When you think about it, the psychological premise it's based on hasn't changed. As Brian explained in an episode of Tommy Walker's The Cutting Room, it's human nature to be attracted to the best of the best: It still works relatively well because people are always going to be attracted to the best. There’s always some wow factor with something that’s really comprehensive, really over the top, amazing that they’re more likely to link to and share. And there’s psychological reasons for that that don’t go away after ten years. CEO at Exploding Topic However, certain things have changed, and only 6.2% of the experts we interviewed for our State of Link-building Report believed Skyscraper was an effective link-building strategy in 2024. One thing that often comes up is that people need an incentive to link to your content, no matter how good it is. Mark Mars of Niche Website Builders talked about the changing expectations back in 2020: When I was first doing it two years ago, I happily say that you get 70 or 80% they’ve linked in the home niche for free just because they like the content enough… In the last couple of years… people are just more savvy. They know a link’s got value, it’s worth something, and we’ll want you to pay for it. of Niche Website Builders Elena Dyulergova, the Senior SEO at Scalerrs, who used the Skyscraper tactic in 2021, was able to get only about 5% of links for free: The purpose of the skyscraper is to obtain links for free, so even though I did obtain plenty of links, they were 95% paid. So, I suppose this would be classified as not successful. the Senior SEO at Scalerrs Another thing that's making Skyscraper link-building harder these days is content saturation. It's easier than ever to create tons of content on any imaginable topic. And the tactic is well-known now, so everybody is trying to create Skyscraper content by default. This makes it difficult for your content to stand out and stay on the top, especially if you're only starting to build your audience. Brian himself mentioned it in an episode of Search Live Talk (2018): It’s not 2007 anymore. You have to promote your stuff or else people aren’t going to see it. There’s just too much content out there already, especially if you don’t have an audience already. You have to work ten times harder to get the word out about your content. CEO at Exploding Topics This takes us to the next point: Established brands, like Semrush, will find it much easier to get lots of backlinks organically. Neil Patel will get way more responses to his emails than an average outreach specialist or blogger. So, the tactic might still work for them, but not necessarily for the majority of creators and SEOs out there. Overall, the tactic may still work for certain content types, but it requires more footwork, and the ROI is likely to be less spectacular than in the early days. Step-by-Step Guide How to Use Skyscraper Technique If you're not discouraged and think the Skyscraper method is worth trying, here's our step-by-step guide on how to execute the strategy and increase your success chances. Step 1: Find link-worthy content The first step in the process is finding popular content relevant to your niche that a) has lots of links you could inherit and b) you can improve dramatically. I stress the word 'dramatically' because marginal improvement won't cut it. What type of content works best for the Skyscraper technique? Look for: There are 2 ways to do it. Competitor analysis The easiest way to find content that attracts links is by spying on your competitors. Here's how to do it in Ahrefs Site Explorer (Semrush's Backlink Analytics tool offers similar capabilities): In Site Explorer, navigate to the Best by links report. Here's what it looks like for one of our competitors, uSERP. You can see that the 2 resources with the most backlinks are about Link-building Stats and their State of Backlinks report. That's the kind of content you need to replicate and improve on. And that's exactly what we did with our State of Link-Building 2024 report. Target keyword research Another way is by searching for content in your niche. Which you can do in Content Explorer. Here's how: Step 2: Create superior content The next step is creating content that delivers more punch than the existing articles. You can achieve it in a few ways: Now, of course, it can get ridiculous. Like if there’s something that has 100 tips, you create 500 tips, and then it’s just stupid at that point, actually doesn’t add any value CEO at Exploding Topics Step 3: Reach out to the right people Creating great content isn't enough to gain links—it hasn't been for a while. So, the final step in the Skyscraper process is promoting your content via email outreach. Find prospects Prospecting is the extension of the process you used to find linkable content to replicate: 1) In the Best by links report in Ahrefs, click on the number of referring domains. This opens a window listing all referring domains. Click Open in a new tab for convenience. 2) Set the filters for Dofollow links, DR30-70, and traffic 1K+. 3) Click Links to target to display the pages that link to the content. 4) Visit each of the pages, evaluate their quality, and assess your chances of securing the link. Here are some questions that can help: Let's be honest: link building is about volume. The more outreach emails you send, the more backlinks you get. The catch is that you won't have enough prospects if you limit yourself to the pages linking to the original article. Instead, target all the pages linking to all the articles ranking for the relevant keywords. You can find them via the Ahrefs Keywords Explorer: search for the keyword and scroll down to the SERP overview. Check out the Domains column for all the websites linking to the articles. Segment your prospects Pages may link to the content you're trying to replace for different reasons. For example, they find different statistics or sections of the text relevant. Identifying the reason and segmenting users can increase the effectiveness of your outreach efforts. A quick way to do it is by looking at the anchor texts used in the linking articles, which you can find in the Anchors report. Below, you can see that pages refer to specific numbers, like 69% or 92%. Check what the figures refer to, and if you have more current data in your article, you can mention it in the outreach email to make it more relevant. And increase your success rate. Find their contact details Once you have the list of prospective websites to target, it's time to find their contact details. Do you want to do it the easy way or the effective way? The easy way would be through the contact forms and 'Contact us' sections. This may work for smaller sites, where the webmaster also has editorial control of the content. For larger organisations, try a more targeted approach and look for the decision-makers. Use LinkedIn. Search for the company and head to the People tab. Search for content-related roles: SEO and marketing managers, and editors. There's nothing wrong with messaging them directly via LinkedIn. However, don't rush it. Start following their account and engaging with their content to create a foundation for a future relationship. If you prefer contacting them via email, you can find their details using an outreach tool like Hunter.io. Which also allows you to save the prospects, segment them, and create personalized campaigns. Compose the right message Let's face it: Webmasters have been getting flooded with emails based on the template developed by Brian Dean for years now. And as a result, they usually ignore them. The solution? Develop your own templates and test them. In the email, focus on highlighting the benefits of adding the link to your site. Here's one such template developed by Antonio Gabric, the outreach manager at Hunter.io. As you've got about 9 seconds to capture the attention of the reader, here are a few more things you can do to increase your outreach success rate: Follow up You can increase the response rates considerably by creating sequences of emails. Woodpecker data shows that sending 1-3 emails will get you a 9% response rate, and you can triple it by sending 4-7 emails. Bear in mind, though, that longer sequences increase the risk of getting labeled as a spammer. And sending good follow-up emails requires considerably more effort. It's not enough to regurgitate the same message again and again. Gradually build up on the previous ones and add value. For example, by highlighting the benefits you haven't mentioned before. So 2-3 follow-ups might be a good balance. Final Thoughts Although immensely popular and successful to start with, the Skyscraper link-building technique isn't likely to bring you tons of backlinks anymore. Not for free, anyway. It might work for well-established brands that have the capacity to create excellent content at scale. If you're only starting to build your authority, it's much more difficult to break through. Every link builder knows the importance of creating high-quality content, so standing out is a challenge. And you have to do way more work to get your content in front of other people. And when you do, expect to be asked for money. In this context, the Skyscraper method may not be the best link building strategy, and you shouldn't rely on it exclusively.

      "title": "Skyscraper Link Building: A 2025 Guide Updated On: February 4, 2025 The principle behind the Skyscraper link-building technique is simple: you find popular articles that people link to, improve on the content, and ask the webmasters to link to it instead. Brian Dean coined the term, first writing about it in his 2013 case study, and it became an instant hit in the SEO community. Ten years on, many SEOs still swear by it. But does the Skyscraper method still work in 2024? That's one of the questions we discuss in the article. You will also learn about its benefits and how to execute it for the best results. Let's get started. What Is The Skyscraper Link Building Technique? The Skyscraper link-building technique involves creating content that's longer and more thorough than similar articles. Such superior content stands out from the competition, just like a skyscraper from the skyline. And that's how it attracts backlinks from writers who want to add value to their content. This happens either organically or as a result of outreach campaigns, in which you contact editors, bloggers, or website owners who are already linking to similar articles.. Key Benefits of Skyscraper Technique There were a few reasons for the immense popularity of the Skyscraper tactic. First, it's a white-hat technique that allows you to earn backlinks naturally. And I mean lots of them. When Brian Dean first used it in 2013, he sent 160 emails and secured 17 quality backlinks. That's an 11% success rate! And they boosted the organic search traffic to his article by 110%. What's more, the outreach campaigns are an excellent chance to expand your network and build new relationships, which can lead to more link-building opportunities and exciting projects. And it pushes you to create the best content possible. To catch the attention of prospective partners, yours needs to be the tallest skyscraper in the area. And this helps you establish yourself as an authority in your niche, which often translates into more business opportunities. Is The Skyscraper Method Still Effective in 2024? Brian's original post about the Skyscraper method has been updated a few times but it still describes it as \"a technique that almost guarantees that you get high-quality backlinks from every blog post or any other piece of content that you publish.\" Does it still guarantee those backlinks, though? Last year, Ahrefs asked this question across its social media. 61% of the LinkedIn respondents and 57% of the X respondents said 'Yes'. When you think about it, the psychological premise it's based on hasn't changed. As Brian explained in an episode of Tommy Walker's The Cutting Room, it's human nature to be attracted to the best of the best: It still works relatively well because people are always going to be attracted to the best. There’s always some wow factor with something that’s really comprehensive, really over the top, amazing that they’re more likely to link to and share. And there’s psychological reasons for that that don’t go away after ten years. CEO at Exploding Topic However, certain things have changed, and only 6.2% of the experts we interviewed for our State of Link-building Report believed Skyscraper was an effective link-building strategy in 2024. One thing that often comes up is that people need an incentive to link to your content, no matter how good it is. Mark Mars of Niche Website Builders talked about the changing expectations back in 2020: When I was first doing it two years ago, I happily say that you get 70 or 80% they’ve linked in the home niche for free just because they like the content enough… In the last couple of years… people are just more savvy. They know a link’s got value, it’s worth something, and we’ll want you to pay for it. of Niche Website Builders Elena Dyulergova, the Senior SEO at Scalerrs, who used the Skyscraper tactic in 2021, was able to get only about 5% of links for free: The purpose of the skyscraper is to obtain links for free, so even though I did obtain plenty of links, they were 95% paid. So, I suppose this would be classified as not successful. the Senior SEO at Scalerrs Another thing that's making Skyscraper link-building harder these days is content saturation. It's easier than ever to create tons of content on any imaginable topic. And the tactic is well-known now, so everybody is trying to create Skyscraper content by default. This makes it difficult for your content to stand out and stay on the top, especially if you're only starting to build your audience. Brian himself mentioned it in an episode of Search Live Talk (2018): It’s not 2007 anymore. You have to promote your stuff or else people aren’t going to see it. There’s just too much content out there already, especially if you don’t have an audience already. You have to work ten times harder to get the word out about your content. CEO at Exploding Topics This takes us to the next point: Established brands, like Semrush, will find it much easier to get lots of backlinks organically. Neil Patel will get way more responses to his emails than an average outreach specialist or blogger. So, the tactic might still work for them, but not necessarily for the majority of creators and SEOs out there. Overall, the tactic may still work for certain content types, but it requires more footwork, and the ROI is likely to be less spectacular than in the early days. Step-by-Step Guide How to Use Skyscraper Technique If you're not discouraged and think the Skyscraper method is worth trying, here's our step-by-step guide on how to execute the strategy and increase your success chances. Step 1: Find link-worthy content The first step in the process is finding popular content relevant to your niche that a) has lots of links you could inherit and b) you can improve dramatically. I stress the word 'dramatically' because marginal improvement won't cut it. What type of content works best for the Skyscraper technique? Look for: There are 2 ways to do it. Competitor analysis The easiest way to find content that attracts links is by spying on your competitors. Here's how to do it in Ahrefs Site Explorer (Semrush's Backlink Analytics tool offers similar capabilities): In Site Explorer, navigate to the Best by links report. Here's what it looks like for one of our competitors, uSERP. You can see that the 2 resources with the most backlinks are about Link-building Stats and their State of Backlinks report. That's the kind of content you need to replicate and improve on. And that's exactly what we did with our State of Link-Building 2024 report. Target keyword research Another way is by searching for content in your niche. Which you can do in Content Explorer. Here's how: Step 2: Create superior content The next step is creating content that delivers more punch than the existing articles. You can achieve it in a few ways: Now, of course, it can get ridiculous. Like if there’s something that has 100 tips, you create 500 tips, and then it’s just stupid at that point, actually doesn’t add any value CEO at Exploding Topics Step 3: Reach out to the right people Creating great content isn't enough to gain links—it hasn't been for a while. So, the final step in the Skyscraper process is promoting your content via email outreach. Find prospects Prospecting is the extension of the process you used to find linkable content to replicate: 1) In the Best by links report in Ahrefs, click on the number of referring domains. This opens a window listing all referring domains. Click Open in a new tab for convenience. 2) Set the filters for Dofollow links, DR30-70, and traffic 1K+. 3) Click Links to target to display the pages that link to the content. 4) Visit each of the pages, evaluate their quality, and assess your chances of securing the link. Here are some questions that can help: Let's be honest: link building is about volume. The more outreach emails you send, the more backlinks you get. The catch is that you won't have enough prospects if you limit yourself to the pages linking to the original article. Instead, target all the pages linking to all the articles ranking for the relevant keywords. You can find them via the Ahrefs Keywords Explorer: search for the keyword and scroll down to the SERP overview. Check out the Domains column for all the websites linking to the articles. Segment your prospects Pages may link to the content you're trying to replace for different reasons. For example, they find different statistics or sections of the text relevant. Identifying the reason and segmenting users can increase the effectiveness of your outreach efforts. A quick way to do it is by looking at the anchor texts used in the linking articles, which you can find in the Anchors report. Below, you can see that pages refer to specific numbers, like 69% or 92%. Check what the figures refer to, and if you have more current data in your article, you can mention it in the outreach email to make it more relevant. And increase your success rate. Find their contact details Once you have the list of prospective websites to target, it's time to find their contact details. Do you want to do it the easy way or the effective way? The easy way would be through the contact forms and 'Contact us' sections. This may work for smaller sites, where the webmaster also has editorial control of the content. For larger organisations, try a more targeted approach and look for the decision-makers. Use LinkedIn. Search for the company and head to the People tab. Search for content-related roles: SEO and marketing managers, and editors. There's nothing wrong with messaging them directly via LinkedIn. However, don't rush it. Start following their account and engaging with their content to create a foundation for a future relationship. If you prefer contacting them via email, you can find their details using an outreach tool like Hunter.io.

Find competitors’ backlinks and “steal” them Conclusion Building backlinks is still the most effective way to increase SEO rankings and traffic. But you have to be cautious with how to build quality backlinks. We’re now at a point where only “white hat,” or ethical, link building methods still work. It’s basically impossible to beg, borrow, steal, or buy quality backlinks in a way that will boost rankings. For site owners that used to rely on shady link-building tactics, this is bad news. But if you’re willing to put in the time it takes to earn valid links, it’s still entirely possible to boost your credibility (and rankings). I’ll explain six smart ways to earn legitimate, high-quality backlinks that will help show Google and other search engines that your site is worthy of high rankings. Why does backlink quality matter for SEO? Links have always been an important factor in how search engines like Google rank websites in their results, and that still holds true today. Search engines essentially view each link to your site as a vote of confidence in the quality of your content. After all, if another site is willing to cite you as a source or direct their users away from their own site in favor of one of your pages, you must be offering something of value. So the more links you have pointing to your site, the more trustworthy your site will appear. Unfortunately, Google hasn’t released specifics on how it measures credibility, or how reputable it considers your site. But there are plenty of tools that can give you an idea of how trustworthy your site appears. Many of these tools center on domain authority. This metric is based on a site’s link data, age, popularity, size, and trust-related indicators, and is scored on a scale from one to 100. Essentially, the higher your domain authority, the easier it will be for your site to earn high rankings in search results. You can get an idea of your site’s authority using Website Authority Checker. Enter your URL, complete the required CAPTCHA step, and click “Perform check.” Then, you’ll see your site’s domain authority score, as well as the number of total external links pointing to it. As you work to earn links to your site, you can periodically check in on this metric and see how your efforts are impacting your authority. And as you increase your domain authority, you can be confident that you’re boosting your site’s ability to rank in search results. Just take a look at this graph from Backlinko illustrating how high authority correlates with high rankings. The average domain authority of the first few results from this study is a bit confusing, as the sites ranking in the first position had, on average, a lower domain authority than the sites ranking in the second position for any given search query. Even so, it’s clear that the sites ranking in the top half of the first page had a higher average domain authority than those ranking in the bottom half. It’s important to keep the focus on quality as you build links to your site. This can be challenging in the face of evidence showing that the total number of unique referring domains also correlates with high rankings. You might think that the more links, the better. And that’s true! But only if your links are coming from trustworthy sites. [tweet_box design=”default”]That’s because link quality is much more important than quantity when it comes to earning credibility with search engines.[/tweet_box] A handful of rightfully-earned links from authoritative sites will have a much more positive impact on your rankings than dozens of purchased links from spammy sites. And it’s not just that links from low-quality sites won’t help your visibility in search results — they can actually harm your chances of ranking well. In 2012, Google started penalizing site owners who were using link schemes to manipulate its algorithm. This included buying or selling links, excessive link exchanges, large-scale “article marketing” campaigns, and using automated programs to create links. The search engine started issuing manual penalties, which are instances in which a human reviewer determines that a site is violating Google’s quality guidelines. These penalties can still be issued today, but Google’s algorithm has also become more sophisticated in detecting unethical link practices. This started with the release of their first “Penguin” update, which was designed to automatically identify link spam and manipulative link building practices. Before this update, the total number of links pointing to a site played a much larger role in that site’s ability to rank well. But after it was released, and as it continues to be updated, Google has become better at ensuring that natural, authoritative, and relevant links are given more weight. And on the flip side, these algorithm updates are designed to make sure that sites with manipulative and spammy links aren’t rewarded for their actions. So as you build links to your site, make sure that you’re doing so in a way that doesn’t involve violating Google’s Webmaster Guidelines. Don’t pay for links, participate in link schemes, or attempt to game the system in any other way. As search engine algorithms continue to develop and become more advanced, these tactics are more likely to harm your rankings than to improve them. And even if Google’s algorithm doesn’t pick up on your attempts immediately, you could still be hit with a manual penalty in the future. So even if they boost your rankings in the short term, these methods simply aren’t worth your time. Instead, focus on building natural and getting quality backlinks that provide value to users. How to Get Backlinks for SEO in 2018 (The Best Link Building Techniques) As you may have guessed, establishing a solid number of this type of link is a bit more challenging than paying a few other site owners to cite one of your pages. But with the following six strategies, it’s entirely possible to build a backlink profile that will help you improve your rankings and have a lasting, positive impact on your search visibility. Read all the best link building techniques and find out how to get high quality backlinks to your website: 1. Guest posts “Guest posting” is the practice of contributing free content to another website or blog in exchange for a link back to your own site. These links can either be placed in the author bio section or used to cite information within the body of the post. This has long been a popular link building method since it’s a win-win for both sites: One gets free content to share with their audience, while the other earns a high-quality link. Or at least that’s how it’s supposed to work. Unfortunately, some site owners have taken advantage of this tactic by using poorly-written, unhelpful content to earn links to their site. They hire article writers with little to no experience in the topics they’re writing about, then pitch these low-quality articles to a variety of sites, whether the content is relevant to their audience or not. As a result, Google has issued warnings about guest posts. This discouraged lots of site owners from wanting to use this link building strategy — and understandably so. But high-quality, relevant guest posts are different from the mass-produced, low-value posts that were a staple of many SEO strategies a few years ago. When done right, with a focus on providing helpful, high-quality content, guest posts can still be an effective link building tool. So, how can you use this tactic correctly? The first step is to identify appropriate sites to which you can contribute. The seemingly obvious choices here are well-known industry publications. If there are any within your niche that accept article submissions, that’s a good starting point. But traditional editorial sites are by no means your only option — or even your best option. And one of the easiest ways to uncover those other options is by scoping out your competitors’ guest posts. If a site was willing to publish a post from a business similar to yours, there’s a strong chance they’ll be open to accepting a contribution from you, too. And uncovering those sites is easier than it might sound. To demonstrate this process, I’ll use Neil Patel. Since he’s been contributing guest posts to various sites for years, we’ll have plenty of search results to work with. First, you’ll want to use advanced search operators to narrow in on the type of pages you’re looking for. In this example, we want to find all of the places Neil’s name has been published along with the phrase “guest post,” since most sites use this phrase to let their readers know when a post was contributed from an outside source. We’ll also want to exclude results from his own website and company websites. To find pages that match this description, we can search for his name and “guest post” in quotation marks, then the domains we want to exclude preceded by a minus sign, like this: “Neil Patel” + “guest post” -neilpatel.com -quicksprout.com -kissmetrics.com In this case, the HubSpot and Forbes results are the only ones that are actually guest posts by Neil Patel. The others simply mention him in pieces about guest posting. This is an issue that’s fairly unique to guest contributors within the digital marketing industry. Still, the solution is another search operator that can be helpful to anyone researching their competitors’ guest posts. In addition to the operators we used to get this first set of results, we can search specifically for pages that name Neil Patel as the author — so we won’t get anything that’s about or just mentions him. We can do this by searching for his name in quotation marks and using the search parameter “inurl:author.” The results of this search are more in line with what we’re looking for, and more helpful for identifying possible guest post opportunities. If you were a direct competitor of Neil Patel’s, any of the sites in the screenshot above could be valid guest post targets. You can also use Ahrefs’ Content Explorer tool to identify content written by a certain author, too. Just enter the author’s name as a search term using this format: Author:“Author’s Name” Make sure there’s no space between the colon and the first quotation mark, and click “Explore.” This is much better than the results we got from Google. Not only are we seeing more of what we’re looking for, but we have sharing and backlink data right there in the sidebar. This provides a list of all of the sites that have been willing to publish content from a specific author, along with metrics that let you evaluate those sites at a glance. Repeat this process for any other competitors you want to research. Then, it’s time to start pitching. For each site you want to pitch, do a site search for phrases like “write for us” or “contribute.” This will help you determine the best way to get in touch about contributing a guest post. But before you submit a pitch, make sure to review any guidelines each site has. Every established site owner and editor is familiar with this link building strategy, and many of them get dozens of pitches per day. Take the time to follow their pitch requirements, and you’ll be much more successful in your guest posting efforts. Then, once an editor accepts your pitch, create content that’s genuinely valuable to their audience. Spammy, low-quality posts won’t help your link building efforts — and many site owners won’t even publish them in the first place. That being said, it’s in your best interest to look for opportunities to link to your site within the body of your post. Most blogs and publications will include a link to your site within your author bio. But beyond that, incorporate a link of two within the main text if you can. Google values contextual links more than those in less prominent places and will reward you accordingly. [tweet_box design=”default”]The best way to incorporate a natural contextual link is to treat the resource you’re linking to on your site exactly as you would if it were someone else’s.[/tweet_box] Place it where it makes sense, and use anchor text that refers to its content, not to your brand. This way, it’s clear that you’re not attempting to deceive readers — because they’ll know exactly what you’re linking to within your post. 2. Public relations To some digital marketers, “public relations” might sound more like a traditional marketing strategy. And in a technical sense, it is. But in the context of link building, the term simply refers to the practice of using the same methods to get backlinks that you might use to get press. One of the best ways to do this is to get cited as a source in a news article or other online content. In the past, the only way to do this was to hire a publicist with connections to journalists and prominent publications. Today, you can eliminate the need for this third-party help by signing up for Help A Reporter, or HARO. This service allows journalists to put out calls for sources within their daily newsletter. Indicate which areas you have expertise in, and you’ll get a daily list of journalist needs that are related to your skills directly in your inbox on a daily basis. Then, you can reach out to these journalists — and if they’re interested in what you have to say, they’ll cite you as a source. You might also consider classic PR moves like press releases. Bloggers and journalists are constantly looking for new information, so whenever your business accomplishes something significant, make the announcement and details easy to find. Though this doesn’t guarantee press coverage, it means you’re more likely to be linked to in articles related to the subject than companies who don’t make their accomplishments easily accessible online. Press releases can also be added to directories and databases, making them an even better SEO tool. But if you choose to use this strategy, remember that where most people get press releases wrong is over-optimization of anchor text. This is the practice of stuffing keywords into anchor text unnaturally — and it’s one of the factors most likely to trigger a Penguin penalty. So as you write press releases, only incorporate links where they make sense, and write your anchor text in a way that flows naturally. It’s also important to note that even when your company gets mentioned as the result of a press release, there’s no guarantee that the people referencing you will give you a link. Sometimes, they’ll simply mention your brand. When that happens, you’ll want to reach out and ask the author or editor to add a link to your company’s site. You can stay on top of this by setting alerts for your brand name and any other prominent names within your company. There are many tools you can use to set these alerts, but one of the easiest is Ahrefs. Navigate to Alerts > Mentions > Add Alert > Search Query > Daily > Add. Add the term you want to monitor, along with your email address. Then, whenever a site publishes a new page mentioning your tracked term, you’ll get a notification — so that if they forgot to cite you as a source, you can get in touch as quickly as possible. You can also use this to track your competitors. If you’re looking to expand your link building strategy, this is a great way to stay on top of how others in your industry are earning publicity and links. You’ll essentially be notified each time one of your competitors earns a link — giving you the opportunity to dig into their strategy and possibly replicate their success. 3. Broken link building Even reputable, well-maintained websites suffer from broken links. Each link on a site originally links to another page online. But because websites often move their content around, some of those links will eventually “break,” or point to pages that no longer exist. When a user clicks on a broken link, they’ll arrive on a 404 error page telling them that the content they’re looking for no longer exists. This not only provides a poor user experience but also makes it difficult for search engines to efficiently crawl and index websites. Broken link building fixes this — and is a great way to build valuable links. This strategy involves finding broken links on other websites, identifying the content they originally referred to, then offering the site the chance to replace their broken link with a valid link to relevant content. That content, of course, will be on your site. With this strategy, everyone wins. The site owner will have fewer broken links. Their visitors will see more up-to-date, useful content and fewer 404s. And you’ll get a high-quality backlink. If you approach this strategy correctly, it’s an effective way to get the same results you’d see from a guest post, but with much less effort. Instead of creating brand new content and giving it away, you use the content you already own to earn a link. And if you don’t already have content that meets your target site’s needs, it could also be worth your time to create something new. Unlike a guest post, you’ll have complete ownership over whatever you create. So even after your target site uses it to fix their broken link, other sites can cite it as a resource, too. So, the worst case scenario? Even if your target site doesn’t add a link to your new content, you’ll have a new blog post on your site. But I’m getting ahead of myself. First, you’ll need to start by identifying a site that you’d like a backlink from. If you already know which sites you’d like to earn links from, check out those sites in Ahrefs and identify the pages on which they have broken links. You can use Ahrefs Broken Link Checker tool to identify backlinks that aren’t working. For example, let’s look at Copyblogger, a popular copywriting blog. If we wanted to locate broken links on their site, we’d simply enter their URL into the tool’s search bar. As you use this tool, remember to focus on the outgoing links section. Otherwise, you’ll be looking at broken backlinks that lead to Copyblogger, not from it. You’ll also want to make sure that the links you find are dofollow links, as these pass the most value to their targets. Select “Dofollow” from the drop-down under Broken Links, and you’ll only see links that meet the criteria. Once you identify a broken link that looks like its subject is relevant to your business, click on it to visit the page. You should see a 404 error page on the target site’s domain. For example, from the screenshot above, I followed the third broken link under “21 Ways to Create Compelling Content When You Don’t Have a Clue.” The anchor text, “why interviews are great for blog content” gives me a pretty good idea of what the subject will be. The URL, “http://clevermarketer.com/interviews-blog-content.html,” tells me the same story. And it’s a 404. This means that the post on Copyblogger is likely citing a source that explains why interviews make for great blog content. Or at least a source that used to cover that topic. But now, if I follow that link, I see an error page. If I have content on my site about this topic, this could be an easy win. All I’d have to do is double check the Copyblogger post to make sure that the content on my site is in line with the point they’re making. Then, I could reach out and offer it as an easy fix for their broken link. And if I didn’t have any content on the subject, but wanted to go after this opportunity anyway, I could start by checking out what the original target was about. Then, I could craft something that replaces it and surpasses it. Fortunately, just because the content isn’t there now doesn’t mean we can’t see it. The easiest way to access this information is to use Internet Archive, which will let you search for what was located at a given URL in the past. Simply enter the URL of the broken link target you want to check out, and you’ll see its history. Using the same page about interviews and blog posts from above, entering this URL will show the following graph: It looks like the post went up in 2011 and stopped working in 2013. Next, we’ll navigate back to 2013 and select one of the crawl dates highlighted in blue on the calendar. This might take a while to load. But once it does, we can see the original article: Now, we have everything we need to write a better, more comprehensive, more detailed version of the original. And one that doesn’t deliver an error message. If I decided to write this content, I could post it on my blog, then contact the website and let them know about their broken link — and my solution. That might look something like this: “Hey, you have a broken link! I just wrote a piece of content that would fit with the link. Do you want to change the destination of the link so it links out to my content?” If they like my content, I earn a new link. 4. Skyscraper content Skyscraping is the process of finding content in your space that’s already awesome, and then out-awesoming it. This concept was originally popularized by Brian Dean of Backlinko and is still a great way to come up with valuable content ideas that will earn links to your site. In fact, after executing this process on an already-popular post about Google’s ranking factors, Dean dramatically improved the page’s backlink profile. So, how can you achieve similar results for your site? A simplistic way to do this might be to think, “Hmmm, 101 Ways to Improve Your Email Marketing is doing incredibly well. I’ll do 1,001 Ways and clean up!” It might work. Or you might create something that’s bigger without being better. More points, more words, and more pictures don’t always mean more value for the user. Instead, look at the content you’re skyscraping and ask yourself: Which questions go unanswered? Which instructions are hard to follow? Who isn’t getting served here? Shoot for quality, even though it’s the toughest thing to quantify, and you’re more likely to come out ahead. If you have a specific competitor in mind, you can start skyscraping by using Ahrefs’ Site Explorer to look for pieces in your niche that are doing particularly well. We’ll use Copyblogger again to illustrate how this works. Enter your target domain and select Site Explorer > Pages > Best by Links. This report will show the most linked-to pages on the entire domain. The idea here is that if lots of other sites are willing to link to these pages, they’ll be willing to link to similar pages on your site, too. But many of the top pages in these reports won’t work. In the screenshots above, for example, many of the pages directly reference Copyblogger, or they’re generic, or there’s not much to be done with them. But keep scrolling down, and you’ll see some with potential. One of these could be a skyscraper candidate: #49, How to Write Interesting Content for a “Boring” Topic. Next, we can evaluate the page by dropping the URL for that page into Site Explorer and selecting URL: Then, check out the search data… … as well as backlink data (including referring domains)… … and anchor text clouds. All of this data will give more insight into how valuable each page is to its domain, as well as how other sites are linking to it. Then, once you’ve identified the page you want to skyscrape and have created content that outdoes the original, go back to Ahrefs and check out the referring domains for the original piece of content. Here, you’ll see all of the backlinks that link to the page. In this case, those links are from Moz.com, Entrepreneur.com, and SearchEngineJournal.com. These are the sites you’ll want to reach out to in order to let them know that your content exists and suggest it as a resource for their readers. 5. Compile a resource Many of the links you build to your site will be to blog posts and other informational pages. These are typically made up entirely of your own original content and are an effective way to build credible links. But the content you create to earn links doesn’t always have to be 100% original. Of course, I’m not advocating for plagiarizing or re-publishing other sites’ content. Instead, you can look for ways to compile research and other information that’s relevant to your industry in a helpful, user-friendly way. Essentially, your goal here is to create something of value, then give it away for free. For example, how often do you think people link back to Content Marketing Institute’s B2B Content Marketing 2016 report? We can take a look using Ahrefs. As you can see in the screenshot, there are 1,516 unique domains linking to that one piece of content. And the content essentially a compilation of statistics and survey data. If you want to replicate this strategy, the key is to create resources that are useful to people in your space. This way, they’ll want to link back to you when they use them in blog posts or other content. And your resources don’t have to be entirely original research, either. You can start by creating a compendium of information from different places, gathered together, and presented with one group of people’s needs in mind. You can build resources by using the same methods you’d use to create any other kind of content on your site. Find out what people in your space want to know by looking at the content they’re consuming, identify any information gaps, then look for ways to address those gaps. 6. Find competitors’ backlinks and “steal” them I mentioned above that if a site links to a competitor, they’ll probably link to you, too. And while we’ve looked at ways to figure out which sites are linking to specific competitors’ domains, you can also use tools to identify additional sites that are ranking for your target keywords and determine how they’ve achieved their level of authority. [tweet_box design=”default”]Start by identifying the top ten sites for each keyword you want to rank for. Do a Google search and pick the top ten domains.[/tweet_box] For example, let’s say we want to rank for “Halloween email marketing.” The first thing we’d see after searching for this term is some truly appalling puns. “Sanity check” these results for relevance, duplication, and, well, sanity. Make sure you remove any duds. In this case, GetResponse, Pure360, and Adestra all make sense. But Tax.ThomsonReuters.com? Probably not. Then, take those domains over to Ahrefs and drop them into the Link Intersect tool. Leave “But doesn’t link to” blank and click “Show link opportunities.” This will show you a list of sites that link to all the domains you entered. If you get a list like this, with generic stuff that’s not of much use to you, you’ll need to shrink the number of domains a little. Go back through and remove some of the less likely candidates, then try again. This time, the results are much more useful. There are domains like TheEmailGuide.com, CustomerThink.com, and OnlineMarketingandSEO.com here. They would make good backlink targets. Then, you can look for opportunities to contribute to these sites in the form of guest posts or replacements for broken links. Alternatively, you can take a more in-depth approach by analyzing the backlinks to the specific URLs that are ranking for each of your target keywords, instead of the domains as a whole. This approach involves a lot more work, but it’s a highly effective way to get a natural backlink profile that will help you achieve the rankings you want. Start by collecting URLs, rather than domains, for each keyword. Keeping with the same “Halloween email marketing” example, we’d pick up the top ten organic results and take them over to Ahrefs. Then we’d drop them into Site Explorer and select Backlinks. When I did this, several of the top search results had just one or two backlinks, but GetResponse’s infographic had ten from unique domains. The next step is to go through the links and figure out how the competitor acquired each link. Then, you can determine whether their approach is something you can replicate for your own site. For example, if you determine that one of the links is from a guest post, that might be the way to earn a link from that site. If they scored the link by adding the site to a directory, that could work, too — as long as it’s specific to your space and the quality is high. Here’s a checklist of the strategies to get the best backlinks to your website: 1. Guest posts 2. Public relations 3. Broken Link building 4. Skyscraper content 5. Compile a resource 6.

Find competitors’ backlinks and “steal” them Conclusion Building backlinks is still the most effective way to increase SEO rankings and traffic. But you have to be cautious with how to build quality backlinks. We’re now at a point where only “white hat,” or ethical, link building methods still work. It’s basically impossible to beg, borrow, steal, or buy quality backlinks in a way that will boost rankings. For site owners that used to rely on shady link-building tactics, this is bad news. But if you’re willing to put in the time it takes to earn valid links, it’s still entirely possible to boost your credibility (and rankings). I’ll explain six smart ways to earn legitimate, high-quality backlinks that will help show Google and other search engines that your site is worthy of high rankings. Why does backlink quality matter for SEO? Links have always been an important factor in how search engines like Google rank websites in their results, and that still holds true today. Search engines essentially view each link to your site as a vote of confidence in the quality of your content. After all, if another site is willing to cite you as a source or direct their users away from their own site in favor of one of your pages, you must be offering something of value. So the more links you have pointing to your site, the more trustworthy your site will appear. Unfortunately, Google hasn’t released specifics on how it measures credibility, or how reputable it considers your site. But there are plenty of tools that can give you an idea of how trustworthy your site appears. Many of these tools center on domain authority. This metric is based on a site’s link data, age, popularity, size, and trust-related indicators, and is scored on a scale from one to 100. Essentially, the higher your domain authority, the easier it will be for your site to earn high rankings in search results. You can get an idea of your site’s authority using Website Authority Checker. Enter your URL, complete the required CAPTCHA step, and click “Perform check.” Then, you’ll see your site’s domain authority score, as well as the number of total external links pointing to it. As you work to earn links to your site, you can periodically check in on this metric and see how your efforts are impacting your authority. And as you increase your domain authority, you can be confident that you’re boosting your site’s ability to rank in search results. Just take a look at this graph from Backlinko illustrating how high authority correlates with high rankings. The average domain authority of the first few results from this study is a bit confusing, as the sites ranking in the first position had, on average, a lower domain authority than the sites ranking in the second position for any given search query. Even so, it’s clear that the sites ranking in the top half of the first page had a higher average domain authority than those ranking in the bottom half. It’s important to keep the focus on quality as you build links to your site. This can be challenging in the face of evidence showing that the total number of unique referring domains also correlates with high rankings. You might think that the more links, the better. And that’s true! But only if your links are coming from trustworthy sites. [tweet_box design=”default”]That’s because link quality is much more important than quantity when it comes to earning credibility with search engines.[/tweet_box] A handful of rightfully-earned links from authoritative sites will have a much more positive impact on your rankings than dozens of purchased links from spammy sites. And it’s not just that links from low-quality sites won’t help your visibility in search results — they can actually harm your chances of ranking well. In 2012, Google started penalizing site owners who were using link schemes to manipulate its algorithm. This included buying or selling links, excessive link exchanges, large-scale “article marketing” campaigns, and using automated programs to create links. The search engine started issuing manual penalties, which are instances in which a human reviewer determines that a site is violating Google’s quality guidelines. These penalties can still be issued today, but Google’s algorithm has also become more sophisticated in detecting unethical link practices. This started with the release of their first “Penguin” update, which was designed to automatically identify link spam and manipulative link building practices. Before this update, the total number of links pointing to a site played a much larger role in that site’s ability to rank well. But after it was released, and as it continues to be updated, Google has become better at ensuring that natural, authoritative, and relevant links are given more weight. And on the flip side, these algorithm updates are designed to make sure that sites with manipulative and spammy links aren’t rewarded for their actions. So as you build links to your site, make sure that you’re doing so in a way that doesn’t involve violating Google’s Webmaster Guidelines. Don’t pay for links, participate in link schemes, or attempt to game the system in any other way. As search engine algorithms continue to develop and become more advanced, these tactics are more likely to harm your rankings than to improve them. And even if Google’s algorithm doesn’t pick up on your attempts immediately, you could still be hit with a manual penalty in the future. So even if they boost your rankings in the short term, these methods simply aren’t worth your time. Instead, focus on building natural and getting quality backlinks that provide value to users. How to Get Backlinks for SEO in 2018 (The Best Link Building Techniques) As you may have guessed, establishing a solid number of this type of link is a bit more challenging than paying a few other site owners to cite one of your pages. But with the following six strategies, it’s entirely possible to build a backlink profile that will help you improve your rankings and have a lasting, positive impact on your search visibility. Read all the best link building techniques and find out how to get high quality backlinks to your website: 1. Guest posts “Guest posting” is the practice of contributing free content to another website or blog in exchange for a link back to your own site. These links can either be placed in the author bio section or used to cite information within the body of the post. This has long been a popular link building method since it’s a win-win for both sites: One gets free content to share with their audience, while the other earns a high-quality link. Or at least that’s how it’s supposed to work. Unfortunately, some site owners have taken advantage of this tactic by using poorly-written, unhelpful content to earn links to their site. They hire article writers with little to no experience in the topics they’re writing about, then pitch these low-quality articles to a variety of sites, whether the content is relevant to their audience or not. As a result, Google has issued warnings about guest posts. This discouraged lots of site owners from wanting to use this link building strategy — and understandably so. But high-quality, relevant guest posts are different from the mass-produced, low-value posts that were a staple of many SEO strategies a few years ago. When done right, with a focus on providing helpful, high-quality content, guest posts can still be an effective link building tool. So, how can you use this tactic correctly? The first step is to identify appropriate sites to which you can contribute. The seemingly obvious choices here are well-known industry publications. If there are any within your niche that accept article submissions, that’s a good starting point. But traditional editorial sites are by no means your only option — or even your best option. And one of the easiest ways to uncover those other options is by scoping out your competitors’ guest posts. If a site was willing to publish a post from a business similar to yours, there’s a strong chance they’ll be open to accepting a contribution from you, too. And uncovering those sites is easier than it might sound. To demonstrate this process, I’ll use Neil Patel. Since he’s been contributing guest posts to various sites for years, we’ll have plenty of search results to work with. First, you’ll want to use advanced search operators to narrow in on the type of pages you’re looking for. In this example, we want to find all of the places Neil’s name has been published along with the phrase “guest post,” since most sites use this phrase to let their readers know when a post was contributed from an outside source. We’ll also want to exclude results from his own website and company websites. To find pages that match this description, we can search for his name and “guest post” in quotation marks, then the domains we want to exclude preceded by a minus sign, like this: “Neil Patel” + “guest post” -neilpatel.com -quicksprout.com -kissmetrics.com In this case, the HubSpot and Forbes results are the only ones that are actually guest posts by Neil Patel. The others simply mention him in pieces about guest posting. This is an issue that’s fairly unique to guest contributors within the digital marketing industry. Still, the solution is another search operator that can be helpful to anyone researching their competitors’ guest posts. In addition to the operators we used to get this first set of results, we can search specifically for pages that name Neil Patel as the author — so we won’t get anything that’s about or just mentions him. We can do this by searching for his name in quotation marks and using the search parameter “inurl:author.” The results of this search are more in line with what we’re looking for, and more helpful for identifying possible guest post opportunities. If you were a direct competitor of Neil Patel’s, any of the sites in the screenshot above could be valid guest post targets. You can also use Ahrefs’ Content Explorer tool to identify content written by a certain author, too. Just enter the author’s name as a search term using this format: Author:“Author’s Name” Make sure there’s no space between the colon and the first quotation mark, and click “Explore.” This is much better than the results we got from Google. Not only are we seeing more of what we’re looking for, but we have sharing and backlink data right there in the sidebar. This provides a list of all of the sites that have been willing to publish content from a specific author, along with metrics that let you evaluate those sites at a glance. Repeat this process for any other competitors you want to research. Then, it’s time to start pitching. For each site you want to pitch, do a site search for phrases like “write for us” or “contribute.” This will help you determine the best way to get in touch about contributing a guest post. But before you submit a pitch, make sure to review any guidelines each site has. Every established site owner and editor is familiar with this link building strategy, and many of them get dozens of pitches per day. Take the time to follow their pitch requirements, and you’ll be much more successful in your guest posting efforts. Then, once an editor accepts your pitch, create content that’s genuinely valuable to their audience. Spammy, low-quality posts won’t help your link building efforts — and many site owners won’t even publish them in the first place. That being said, it’s in your best interest to look for opportunities to link to your site within the body of your post. Most blogs and publications will include a link to your site within your author bio. But beyond that, incorporate a link of two within the main text if you can. Google values contextual links more than those in less prominent places and will reward you accordingly. [tweet_box design=”default”]The best way to incorporate a natural contextual link is to treat the resource you’re linking to on your site exactly as you would if it were someone else’s.[/tweet_box] Place it where it makes sense, and use anchor text that refers to its content, not to your brand. This way, it’s clear that you’re not attempting to deceive readers — because they’ll know exactly what you’re linking to within your post. 2. Public relations To some digital marketers, “public relations” might sound more like a traditional marketing strategy. And in a technical sense, it is. But in the context of link building, the term simply refers to the practice of using the same methods to get backlinks that you might use to get press. One of the best ways to do this is to get cited as a source in a news article or other online content. In the past, the only way to do this was to hire a publicist with connections to journalists and prominent publications. Today, you can eliminate the need for this third-party help by signing up for Help A Reporter, or HARO. This service allows journalists to put out calls for sources within their daily newsletter. Indicate which areas you have expertise in, and you’ll get a daily list of journalist needs that are related to your skills directly in your inbox on a daily basis. Then, you can reach out to these journalists — and if they’re interested in what you have to say, they’ll cite you as a source. You might also consider classic PR moves like press releases. Bloggers and journalists are constantly looking for new information, so whenever your business accomplishes something significant, make the announcement and details easy to find. Though this doesn’t guarantee press coverage, it means you’re more likely to be linked to in articles related to the subject than companies who don’t make their accomplishments easily accessible online. Press releases can also be added to directories and databases, making them an even better SEO tool. But if you choose to use this strategy, remember that where most people get press releases wrong is over-optimization of anchor text. This is the practice of stuffing keywords into anchor text unnaturally — and it’s one of the factors most likely to trigger a Penguin penalty. So as you write press releases, only incorporate links where they make sense, and write your anchor text in a way that flows naturally. It’s also important to note that even when your company gets mentioned as the result of a press release, there’s no guarantee that the people referencing you will give you a link. Sometimes, they’ll simply mention your brand. When that happens, you’ll want to reach out and ask the author or editor to add a link to your company’s site. You can stay on top of this by setting alerts for your brand name and any other prominent names within your company. There are many tools you can use to set these alerts, but one of the easiest is Ahrefs. Navigate to Alerts > Mentions > Add Alert > Search Query > Daily > Add. Add the term you want to monitor, along with your email address. Then, whenever a site publishes a new page mentioning your tracked term, you’ll get a notification — so that if they forgot to cite you as a source, you can get in touch as quickly as possible. You can also use this to track your competitors. If you’re looking to expand your link building strategy, this is a great way to stay on top of how others in your industry are earning publicity and links. You’ll essentially be notified each time one of your competitors earns a link — giving you the opportunity to dig into their strategy and possibly replicate their success. 3. Broken link building Even reputable, well-maintained websites suffer from broken links. Each link on a site originally links to another page online. But because websites often move their content around, some of those links will eventually “break,” or point to pages that no longer exist. When a user clicks on a broken link, they’ll arrive on a 404 error page telling them that the content they’re looking for no longer exists. This not only provides a poor user experience but also makes it difficult for search engines to efficiently crawl and index websites. Broken link building fixes this — and is a great way to build valuable links. This strategy involves finding broken links on other websites, identifying the content they originally referred to, then offering the site the chance to replace their broken link with a valid link to relevant content. That content, of course, will be on your site. With this strategy, everyone wins. The site owner will have fewer broken links. Their visitors will see more up-to-date, useful content and fewer 404s. And you’ll get a high-quality backlink. If you approach this strategy correctly, it’s an effective way to get the same results you’d see from a guest post, but with much less effort. Instead of creating brand new content and giving it away, you use the content you already own to earn a link. And if you don’t already have content that meets your target site’s needs, it could also be worth your time to create something new. Unlike a guest post, you’ll have complete ownership over whatever you create. So even after your target site uses it to fix their broken link, other sites can cite it as a resource, too. So, the worst case scenario? Even if your target site doesn’t add a link to your new content, you’ll have a new blog post on your site. But I’m getting ahead of myself. First, you’ll need to start by identifying a site that you’d like a backlink from. If you already know which sites you’d like to earn links from, check out those sites in Ahrefs and identify the pages on which they have broken links. You can use Ahrefs Broken Link Checker tool to identify backlinks that aren’t working. For example, let’s look at Copyblogger, a popular copywriting blog. If we wanted to locate broken links on their site, we’d simply enter their URL into the tool’s search bar. As you use this tool, remember to focus on the outgoing links section. Otherwise, you’ll be looking at broken backlinks that lead to Copyblogger, not from it. You’ll also want to make sure that the links you find are dofollow links, as these pass the most value to their targets. Select “Dofollow” from the drop-down under Broken Links, and you’ll only see links that meet the criteria. Once you identify a broken link that looks like its subject is relevant to your business, click on it to visit the page. You should see a 404 error page on the target site’s domain. For example, from the screenshot above, I followed the third broken link under “21 Ways to Create Compelling Content When You Don’t Have a Clue.” The anchor text, “why interviews are great for blog content” gives me a pretty good idea of what the subject will be. The URL, “http://clevermarketer.com/interviews-blog-content.html,” tells me the same story. And it’s a 404. This means that the post on Copyblogger is likely citing a source that explains why interviews make for great blog content. Or at least a source that used to cover that topic. But now, if I follow that link, I see an error page. If I have content on my site about this topic, this could be an easy win. All I’d have to do is double check the Copyblogger post to make sure that the content on my site is in line with the point they’re making. Then, I could reach out and offer it as an easy fix for their broken link. And if I didn’t have any content on the subject, but wanted to go after this opportunity anyway, I could start by checking out what the original target was about. Then, I could craft something that replaces it and surpasses it. Fortunately, just because the content isn’t there now doesn’t mean we can’t see it. The easiest way to access this information is to use Internet Archive, which will let you search for what was located at a given URL in the past. Simply enter the URL of the broken link target you want to check out, and you’ll see its history. Using the same page about interviews and blog posts from above, entering this URL will show the following graph: It looks like the post went up in 2011 and stopped working in 2013. Next, we’ll navigate back to 2013 and select one of the crawl dates highlighted in blue on the calendar. This might take a while to load. But once it does, we can see the original article: Now, we have everything we need to write a better, more comprehensive, more detailed version of the original. And one that doesn’t deliver an error message. If I decided to write this content, I could post it on my blog, then contact the website and let them know about their broken link — and my solution. That might look something like this: “Hey, you have a broken link! I just wrote a piece of content that would fit with the link. Do you want to change the destination of the link so it links out to my content?” If they like my content, I earn a new link. 4. Skyscraper content Skyscraping is the process of finding content in your space that’s already awesome, and then out-awesoming it. This concept was originally popularized by Brian Dean of Backlinko and is still a great way to come up with valuable content ideas that will earn links to your site. In fact, after executing this process on an already-popular post about Google’s ranking factors, Dean dramatically improved the page’s backlink profile. So, how can you achieve similar results for your site? A simplistic way to do this might be to think, “Hmmm, 101 Ways to Improve Your Email Marketing is doing incredibly well. I’ll do 1,001 Ways and clean up!” It might work. Or you might create something that’s bigger without being better. More points, more words, and more pictures don’t always mean more value for the user. Instead, look at the content you’re skyscraping and ask yourself: Which questions go unanswered? Which instructions are hard to follow? Who isn’t getting served here? Shoot for quality, even though it’s the toughest thing to quantify, and you’re more likely to come out ahead. If you have a specific competitor in mind, you can start skyscraping by using Ahrefs’ Site Explorer to look for pieces in your niche that are doing particularly well. We’ll use Copyblogger again to illustrate how this works. Enter your target domain and select Site Explorer > Pages > Best by Links. This report will show the most linked-to pages on the entire domain. The idea here is that if lots of other sites are willing to link to these pages, they’ll be willing to link to similar pages on your site, too. But many of the top pages in these reports won’t work. In the screenshots above, for example, many of the pages directly reference Copyblogger, or they’re generic, or there’s not much to be done with them. But keep scrolling down, and you’ll see some with potential. One of these could be a skyscraper candidate: #49, How to Write Interesting Content for a “Boring” Topic. Next, we can evaluate the page by dropping the URL for that page into Site Explorer and selecting URL: Then, check out the search data… … as well as backlink data (including referring domains)… … and anchor text clouds. All of this data will give more insight into how valuable each page is to its domain, as well as how other sites are linking to it. Then, once you’ve identified the page you want to skyscrape and have created content that outdoes the original, go back to Ahrefs and check out the referring domains for the original piece of content. Here, you’ll see all of the backlinks that link to the page. In this case, those links are from Moz.com, Entrepreneur.com, and SearchEngineJournal.com. These are the sites you’ll want to reach out to in order to let them know that your content exists and suggest it as a resource for their readers. 5. Compile a resource Many of the links you build to your site will be to blog posts and other informational pages. These are typically made up entirely of your own original content and are an effective way to build credible links. But the content you create to earn links doesn’t always have to be 100% original. Of course, I’m not advocating for plagiarizing or re-publishing other sites’ content. Instead, you can look for ways to compile research and other information that’s relevant to your industry in a helpful, user-friendly way. Essentially, your goal here is to create something of value, then give it away for free. For example, how often do you think people link back to Content Marketing Institute’s B2B Content Marketing 2016 report? We can take a look using Ahrefs. As you can see in the screenshot, there are 1,516 unique domains linking to that one piece of content. And the content essentially a compilation of statistics and survey data. If you want to replicate this strategy, the key is to create resources that are useful to people in your space. This way, they’ll want to link back to you when they use them in blog posts or other content. And your resources don’t have to be entirely original research, either. You can start by creating a compendium of information from different places, gathered together, and presented with one group of people’s needs in mind. You can build resources by using the same methods you’d use to create any other kind of content on your site. Find out what people in your space want to know by looking at the content they’re consuming, identify any information gaps, then look for ways to address those gaps. 6. Find competitors’ backlinks and “steal” them I mentioned above that if a site links to a competitor, they’ll probably link to you, too. And while we’ve looked at ways to figure out which sites are linking to specific competitors’ domains, you can also use tools to identify additional sites that are ranking for your target keywords and determine how they’ve achieved their level of authority. [tweet_box design=”default”]Start by identifying the top ten sites for each keyword you want to rank for. Do a Google search and pick the top ten domains.[/tweet_box] For example, let’s say we want to rank for “Halloween email marketing.” The first thing we’d see after searching for this term is some truly appalling puns. “Sanity check” these results for relevance, duplication, and, well, sanity. Make sure you remove any duds. In this case, GetResponse, Pure360, and Adestra all make sense. But Tax.ThomsonReuters.com? Probably not. Then, take those domains over to Ahrefs and drop them into the Link Intersect tool. Leave “But doesn’t link to” blank and click “Show link opportunities.” This will show you a list of sites that link to all the domains you entered. If you get a list like this, with generic stuff that’s not of much use to you, you’ll need to shrink the number of domains a little. Go back through and remove some of the less likely candidates, then try again. This time, the results are much more useful. There are domains like TheEmailGuide.com, CustomerThink.com, and OnlineMarketingandSEO.com here. They would make good backlink targets. Then, you can look for opportunities to contribute to these sites in the form of guest posts or replacements for broken links. Alternatively, you can take a more in-depth approach by analyzing the backlinks to the specific URLs that are ranking for each of your target keywords, instead of the domains as a whole. This approach involves a lot more work, but it’s a highly effective way to get a natural backlink profile that will help you achieve the rankings you want. Start by collecting URLs, rather than domains, for each keyword. Keeping with the same “Halloween email marketing” example, we’d pick up the top ten organic results and take them over to Ahrefs. Then we’d drop them into Site Explorer and select Backlinks. When I did this, several of the top search results had just one or two backlinks, but GetResponse’s infographic had ten from unique domains. The next step is to go through the links and figure out how the competitor acquired each link. Then, you can determine whether their approach is something you can replicate for your own site. For example, if you determine that one of the links is from a guest post, that might be the way to earn a link from that site. If they scored the link by adding the site to a directory, that could work, too — as long as it’s specific to your space and the quality is high. Here’s a checklist of the strategies to get the best backlinks to your website: 1. Guest posts 2. Public relations 3. Broken Link building 4. Skyscraper content 5. Compile a resource 6. Find competitors’ backlinks and “steal” them Do you want more strategies to build unique links to improve your SEO rankings? Take a look at the video bellow: Conclusion Link building remains one of the most effective ways to rank better and drive more traffic that’s also more accurately targeted. But how to get backlinks in 2018? As older methods become useless or actively harmful, “white hat” techniques will become all but indistinguishable from content marketing. This means that the winning edge in search results will go to marketers who know how to implement advanced link building techniques that tie their domain to the right sites.

Can you please suggest a list of good websites and blogs from where I can get quality backlinks and how to do that. I have one person at my disposal full time to do manual commenting or any manual tasks for getting backlinks but how should i approach this problem (of getting backlinks). Where do I start. For information, my website provides online services (its an ecommerce site) and also has a blog in subdirectory. refer to www.geekwik.com www.geekwik.com/blog Would like to become top ranker on search for these services (eg 'logo design services', 'website programming', 'content writing', 'hire virtual assistant' etc) Also anyone interested to become our SEO consultant or SEO service provider (of course paid) is most welcome Thanks in Advance! 1 Reply Last reply Reply Quote 0 geekwik @WhoWuddaThunk last edited by Thanks again Jerry. Would focus more on quality articles in blog from now on 1 Reply Last reply Reply Quote 0 WhoWuddaThunk @geekwik last edited by The short answer is yes, it will help your whole site. As for the long answer: Every page that is included in the structure of your website, has internal links pointing to it, or has external links pointing at it will have some amount of authority/page rank. Of that authority, a page is able to pass 85+% of it's total authority on to other pages. So, if you have 10 links on that page it will pass around 8.5% of its total authority on to other pages. So, let's say you have a blog post about the \"50 Best Logos Ever.\" From there you would want to link back to your logo service to try drive authority back to those pages. That way if your post gets links you will be able to drive more authority back to your pages that make you money. 1 Reply Last reply Reply Quote 0 WilliamCarr last edited by One place to start would be to run an analysis of your competitors, see where they've earned links from & how.

The best kind are naturally earned with great content, but you can supplement this process with a great guest blogging process. To do this you will want to find blogs in your niche, which would be anything about advertising really, and build a relationship with them so that they will accept your guest blog posts. There's awesome resources out there for best initial emails to start this process, but I don't have any saved off hand. The ideal option is actually getting links naturally.

Members Online • Character_Ad_1990 Top 1% Poster Link Building in 2025 - Strategies for success, and what's changed? Tips Hi - I wrote something similar last year, and it garnered some good response along with a lot of questions regarding different elements of link building and how to go about it as a business owner. The reality is that we don’t 100% know all the elements the HCU entailed or changed. But In my experience, links have become a bit more impactful from what I've seen since the HCU and early 2024 updates, and are still an incredibly powerful ranking factor. Again, the sub is full of bad and nonsensical advice and commentary in regards to link building (elements of good, too) - its an incredibly (in my experience) logical process that people oftentimes overthink - however, it's time consuming to do it properly which is why so many people (agencies AND business owners) cut corners and get subpar results. Below, I’m sharing some information I mainly wrote in response to questions from business owners that could potentially benefit others. If you know link building well, this may not be useful to you but hopefully this can help some business owners create a more powerful profile of links. There’s a mixture of strategy and discourse. Again, if you’re right at the start of your journey, my earlier posts outline some of the more general aspects of link building. Each of these are essentially strategies and changes we’ve used over the last year. It’s important to note with all things that this is what worked for me and my clients - there are other views and methodologies that might have worked just as well for others - and that these are my own opinions based on what I’ve seen rather than universally accepted concepts. Stopped Using Link Inserts For this client, they’d been using link inserts for a long period of time with mixed results. Every now and then they’d get a small bump followed by a retraction. The strategy just wasn’t working. One of the issues was that, as a large B2B machinery seller in the financial sector, the weak link inserts previously procured just weren't moving the needle for the more difficult keywords. Before we look at the strategy - I just wanted to run through link inserts in a bit more detail… They’ve always been a cheaper option - and can sometimes be effective. However, there’s a way to get the best out of them. A way that the majority of large “link building agencies” don’t use or really care about due to the volume they’re processing. Unfortunately, its led to misinformation in general about what works best for link inserts. I find the best way to look at them is in a kind of tier system. This is just something that's in my own head, but it might help you out. Remember, link inserts, in my opinion, rarely beat post placements because with a post, you can completely control the breadth of content that sits around the link, allowing you to get the best from it entirely. With a link insert, the content isn’t primed to drive your link in the best possible way. Anyway: Tier one: A link that's thrown into content that isn’t even indexed on google. In our opinion these are the lowest of the low (though some might think otherwise) - and usually what these agencies procure on mass for their clients (or other agencies outsourcing to them). Doesn’t matter if the website is decent, if the page the link is in isn’t indexed, it’s going to do near nothing! If you’re procuring a link insert yourself - check the content you want it inserted into is at least indexed on google! You can do this with a simple site:(webpage) search on google itself. In the case above, upon investigation, these were mainly the links procured for the client up until we started working together. Tier two: A link in a page that’s indexed Its better because its indexed. However, here you have to make sure the content is worthwhile, isn’t terrible, and ties in with your own link. You don’t just want to throw your link into a page just because its indexed. Sure, you might be able to reword some of it, and potentially add in a paragraph that surrounds the link - but it has to be contextually relevant to what the link leads to. The client had a few of these too, some moderately relevant, but no consistency. Tier three: a link in content that ranks on google Now we’re getting somewhere. The content actually ranks on google - it isn’t just indexed…its ranked for terms. This means google is passing the content/page value…its saying that essentially it trusts the page enough to show it to people. A link here is clearly more valuable than the above. Again - the content has to be on point, and you can’t just throw your link into any content…there has to be relevancy. With that said - a link in content that ranks, if done right, will usually pull. The client had none of these… Tier four: A link in content that ranks for industry specific keywords These are great, because the keywords are completely related to you, and to what you do. Difficult to get, but completely worthwhile. Tier five: A link in content that ranks for what you’re trying to rank for A holy grail - but usually out of reach. These work incredibly well usually - but most sites aren’t going to link to a competitor from a page that ranks for a keyword they’re trying to beat them in - but it can be done in certain niches and situations. Remember - the content also has to be right when you’re looking at link inserts, this is just illustrative of the different kinds out there without really looking at assessing the website or content - its a way of highlighting how you can leverage getting a good link insert out of your provider. Most bought are tier 1 - a good agency won’t get you these kind of inserts (a great one will use inserts sparingly anyway - instead curating content that gives your link the best chance of doing well) - but this gives you an idea of how to leverage something out of it if buying them for yourself or assessing a provider. Now - back to the client, they sell large machinery with some pretty tough keywords to crack. The agencies previously primarily were using tier one and two above…so no real efficacy, on pages with weak relevancy. By pivoting to content curation, we were able to write for the target website while really making the most out of the link in the content we’ve written. We focused down on websites in the B2B niche as well as websites within the niches that would use this kind of software - the link inserts previously were just slapped into any kind of weakly relevant content. Remember, with link inserts, the content has been written for another purpose (maybe even for another link) - so you’re usually better off putting content together. The differentiation here got them where they wanted to be within 4 months, and when you think they’d spent years building crappy link inserts it speaks volumes. The main takeaway here is you can’t cut corners. You either need to get GOOD link inserts, or curate the content yourselves and you’ll see results if consistent. It boils down to logic. It also kind of shows how so many do this wrong (either due to lack of knowledge, or because they just can’t be bothered to do it right). Don’t just slap your links into any kind of content - Pivot to placing content written to support your link. Link Velocity: How Many? When a website goes viral or hits the headlines - however old - it accrues a tonne of links and nothing bad happens. The reality is that to an extent and from what we’ve seen - numbers don’t matter, what matters is the quality of the links you’re getting. The more quality links the better. Some do stand by numbers, and may have evidence to back that up - but in my experience quality stands on its own two feet where quantity doesn’t so well. One quality link can be worth hundreds of other links. You can get good links as often as you can. Never pass up a great opportunity because you think you’ve got too many in a month or a year. For a brand new website - it’s good to take a well planned out and measured approach. Different kinds of sites that are all of a certain quality, pertaining to the niche in question always drive value. In this case - We began working with a brand new brand in the B2C niche selling a popular ecom product. Competitors had thousands of links and a lot of business owners will jump to a (logical to be fair) conclusion that they need to match those links. Instead, focus on quality, and focus on making up a solid link profile that makes sense. In doing this, we matched and then surpassed the competitors for primary keywords after 6 months with 20% the amount of links that they had. Quality over quantity. What makes a quality site is the real question - but don’t just look at the number of referring domains, the domains themselves are whats important. Many people focus on the number of referring domains - its the quality level of domains - not the amount! Competitor Sniping? The links may not work in the same way This is an easy one - but worth a mention. The clients were between 4th and 6th for their main keyword - selling a consumer product similar to kids water toy, huge volume etc. Their link building was essentially copying whatever links their main (and leading) competitor was procuring. I’ve seen many clients and individuals who have come to me and said ‘I’ve copied my competitors link profile, but its not really worked and they’re still higher than me etc.” Sometimes links won’t work in the same was as they have for someone else. Sniping a competitors profile can work, and if there are any epic websites in the profile it can be worth trying to secure your own link. However, you’d be better off in the long run simply focusing on procuring your own link profile. Simply because of the quirks of link building, copying a competitor profile may disappoint you if it doesn’t give you a similar boost. Don’t spend all your time on your competitors' profile! There are many variables in play. This is a perfect example of why opinions can and do differ - because sometimes the same methodology works differently from one site to the next. Competitor link sniping can work as part of a wider link acquisition strategy, but it shouldn’t be all you do. Try out the first person (in Content) The majority of articles are written in the third person. It’s logical, easier, makes more sense. Sometimes it can also make sense to vary things as best possible and push out some first person posts. There was a single product ecom client in a really niche industry, but the keyword was nails. They were getting the right kind of link profile bit by bit, but every single bit of content they put out there on other sites (which held the link) was super similar. In fairness - it's hard to make each article unique with their one product store that fits a very slim user profile. However, we varied the content and made 70% of new posts 1st person - this works well for a few reasons: It really looks like the owner of the website/blog etc., has written the content - it feels more immediate and real. It stands out - if done well, it breaks the monotony of the same posts going to similar websites - meaning there could be more chance of ranking (especially if the “author” is recognised as an expert. If it ranks, the link will be more powerful instantly.) There are some drawbacks - if not done right, the article can read too promotional. It needs to be as neutral as possible. In this case, changing a load of link placements so that they’re in first person written content worked really well and pushed them into a gaining position. Vary the voice, tone, and person of the articles you’re placing on other websites. In the real world, the articles wouldn’t be too similar if it were happening naturally - again, create a believable link profile and use varied content to achieve this. You’re not just creating single links - you’re creating a varied profile, first person content can be part of this. Write for the Website or the link? People get confused with this - do you write for the link, or the website? The two will tie over slightly because logically the site you’ve targeted will naturally be in the same niche as your business. The best bet is to write for the website - because it gives you more chance of being published - and looks like the website owner has written the content. However, you have to give your link the best chance of success too. So - you curate the content in a certain way that's not promotional, but as if the website author has just naturally linked to it as if it would be a good resource, good product, on point information etc. So what you need to do is write for the theme of the website your publishing on - while focusing the niche/minutiae on your own websites intent. Takes practice but all you need to do is put yourself in the website owners shoes when writing the content. Create Your Own Network PBNs are usually referred to in a negative light, in a lot of cases this is justified. It’s because a lot of PBNs are from spammy link farms with spoofed traffic etc., owned by one person who rarely does things right. However, if you have the time and inclination you can build a logical one of your own. You essentially would build blogs around the service/product you’re selling - then link from the blogs logically to the service. For example say you own an electric bike website, you might build a couple of content sites: A blog on electric bike laws in different states A blog on electric bike reviews A blog on best places to use an electric bike A blog on electric bike maintenance tips etc. If you rank all of these for logical terms, the links from them to your electric bike shop will be pretty powerful. However, its limited by how many blogs you can create. Also, if the keywords you’re targeting are incredibly difficult, you’ll need links from other relevant blogs/websites in any case. Lastly - it is eminently time consuming. However, this is an example of a workable PBN. Again, a decent strategy depending on the use case and KW difficulty you’re going for. Website Traffic: Quality over Quantity Web traffic is a main website assessment metric. However, a lot of people use it in the wrong way. Most people now know (not all) that focusing on DA/DR etc. as a way to assess a website is a one way ticket to at best, a link that does nothing and a quick way to burn through your cash. So, we look at site traffic instead. We often consult on external link campaigns, on one, a client was approving any links (from their internal marketing team) with traffic over 5k - that was their only barometer, traffic over 5k. There are multiple things wrong here. The traffic might be coming from a country that the client business doesn’t even operate in. The traffic might be coming from completely fake/nonsense sources The keywords the site ranks for might also be complete nonsense (meaning the traffic means nothing or is just fake and spoofed). So - instead of focusing on traffic numbers - focus on where the traffic is coming from. Instead of looking at quantity, go for quality. Here - we taught the team to look at what the site is ranking for, and whether or not they’re relevant in the grand scheme of the campaign. By focusing on this instead of the blind numbers, they’re not only getting websites that rank for relevant terms to link to them, but sites with real traffic. In this case - a site with 2k relevant and real traffic is better than one with 50k nonsense anyday! Numbers can be good if you’re assessing two sites with real traffic against each other - obviously then, if you’ve the budget, you go for the larger one as seemingly Google is passing that one more (relevant) traffic (for whatever reason). In the end - remember, you’re trying to create a profile of believable links to your website. You’ll need different kinds of websites (while keeping relevancy and quality in mind.) This is where so many go wrong - because they tend to snatch at links here and there and don’t focus on building a mutually beneficial portfolio of links. Hope this helped with your link building campaign. Again - this is what I've observed and what's worked for me. Other approaches may be just as viable.

Lastly - it is eminently time consuming. However, this is an example of a workable PBN. Again, a decent strategy depending on the use case and KW difficulty you’re going for. Website Traffic: Quality over Quantity Web traffic is a main website assessment metric. However, a lot of people use it in the wrong way. Most people now know (not all) that focusing on DA/DR etc. as a way to assess a website is a one way ticket to at best, a link that does nothing and a quick way to burn through your cash. So, we look at site traffic instead. We often consult on external link campaigns, on one, a client was approving any links (from their internal marketing team) with traffic over 5k - that was their only barometer, traffic over 5k. There are multiple things wrong here. The traffic might be coming from a country that the client business doesn’t even operate in. The traffic might be coming from completely fake/nonsense sources The keywords the site ranks for might also be complete nonsense (meaning the traffic means nothing or is just fake and spoofed). So - instead of focusing on traffic numbers - focus on where the traffic is coming from. Instead of looking at quantity, go for quality. Here - we taught the team to look at what the site is ranking for, and whether or not they’re relevant in the grand scheme of the campaign. By focusing on this instead of the blind numbers, they’re not only getting websites that rank for relevant terms to link to them, but sites with real traffic. In this case - a site with 2k relevant and real traffic is better than one with 50k nonsense anyday! Numbers can be good if you’re assessing two sites with real traffic against each other - obviously then, if you’ve the budget, you go for the larger one as seemingly Google is passing that one more (relevant) traffic (for whatever reason). In the end - remember, you’re trying to create a profile of believable links to your website. You’ll need different kinds of websites (while keeping relevancy and quality in mind.) This is where so many go wrong - because they tend to snatch at links here and there and don’t focus on building a mutually beneficial portfolio of links. Hope this helped with your link building campaign. Again - this is what I've observed and what's worked for me. Other approaches may be just as viable.

What Classifies a High-Quality Backlink? 4 Types of Content That Can Help Generate Backlinks 1. Listicles 2. Infographics 3. Video Content 4. Whitepapers and Reports Conclusion Content marketing is key to presenting your online business as the one and only solution to satisfy the needs of your target audience. As you also know, it’s crucial that when you’re creating content, you utilize highly searched keywords to rank number one across search engine results. But how much thought have you put into your content’s backlinks strategy? Backlinking is when you incorporate links from other websites into your online copy. In addition to boosting your search engine rankings, when link building is done correctly, you’ll also notice higher traffic levels and increased credibility. In this article, we’ll go over four different types of content that will help acquire backlinks to your site naturally. But first, let’s look at why backlinks are so important in the first place. Let's dig in! Why are Backlinks So Important? Most search engines have a citation system embedded into their algorithm. Google uses citations to understand content quality and determine whether it’s worthy to land on the first page of a search result. As you can see in the chart below, your click-through rate (CTR) is highly affected by your search engine rank. Websites positioned as the first result have a significantly higher CTR than even the second or third listed result: Source: Advanced Web Ranking Also, if Google can’t gather usability metrics with your content, it’s nearly impossible to monitor your site performance. Take your bounce rate for example: If a visitor were to click on your content, then return to the search results and choose another resource, that indicates a negative user experience. On the other hand, someone clicking on your result and staying for long periods of time suggests they enjoy your content. This information is vital if you want a fair competition for your search engine optimization (SEO) and overall online presence. Additionally, securing credible citations from other great websites through high-quality backlinks also gives your content a better chance to appear in search results. What Classifies a High-Quality Backlink? When adding backlinks to your content, you should know, not all links come with equal value. While high-quality links can strengthen your content material, low-quality links can have negative effects on your site performance. So, how do you know whether a backlink will benefit your site? A quality backlink will have a high domain authority; meaning, search engines find the link to be trustworthy. There are several online tools you can use to test a website's authority score completely free, including: Ahrefs Website Authority Checker SEO Review Tools Website Authority Checker Moz Domain SEO Analysis Tool Authority score tools are extremely easy to use. All you need to do is copy the backlink in question and paste it into the available search box. According to experts like Neil Patel, a high-quality backlink has an authority score between 60-100. For the health of your website, it's good practice to avoid links with a ranking of 40 or below. 4 Types of Content That Can Help Generate Backlinks Now that you have a better understanding on why backlinks are important, your next goal is to start incorporating these types of links into your content. Ideally, you want to start this process organically, meaning without having to do backlink outreach. The secret to building high-quality backlinks is to create something worth linking to. You need excellent cornerstone content that will help keep your consumers engaged throughout your sales funnel. That content should also help encourage consumers to take a variety of actions. Let’s walk through four examples of content that can help generate backlinks on a more consistent basis. 1. Listicles A listicle is a just silly name for a list post. They are very popular with bloggers, affiliate marketers, and content producers. Here’s why: Straightforward Heading. Listicle headings often use titles such as, “X Best” or “X Top”, indicating a set number of specific products that readers expect to be discussed in the article. Readers Love Numbers. It's been psychologically proven that readers are more likely to click on a search result that begins with a number. According to a Buzzsumo study, 5 is the magic number to use when writing listicle content. Scannable Content. Numbered headings in a listicle also provide a clear, organized structure, making it easy for readers to scan through your copy. More Likey to Read Through Completly. When readers are presented with a title on “5 Best”, they are more likely to review all five of your bulleted points. Listicles also fit the need for a lot of search terms. For example, when you’re considering a purchase, you often search for the “best …”. When you do this search, you are looking for a range of options, preferably with a list of pros and cons for each one. Here’s an example of how our very own Pretty Links listicle article ranks when searching for “Best conversion rate optimization tools”: The great thing about a listicle post is, that you can ask the company that comes at the top of your list for a backlink. Getting a backlink from a site that’s relevant to your content is a big endorsement and can boost your search rankings. 2. Infographics Infographics are one of the most popular link-building types. Incorporating them into your social media marketing strategy can get you more shares and likes than other types of content. Why? According to eye-tracking studies, people pay attention to information that carries images. A study from the Search Engine Journal shows that people are 30x more likely to quick-read an image rather than a written article. For your infographics to draw the attention of readers, you have to make three elements work together: Impressive design Well-researched statistics Well-strategized promotion and outreach Another nice thing about an infographic is the chance to repurpose a great piece of content into another medium. You can then share your content across social media platforms or embed it on your website. Here’s a great infographic example by SPINX Digital: 3. Video Content The internet is flooded with so much video content that it can be challenging to get your brand noticed. However, it’s something you should consider because a great visual campaign can help you go viral. Take this Dollar Shave Club video for example (watch here). This commercial video was produced in 2012 when the Dollar Shave Club made its first appearance on the market. The unique yet minimal approach taken to produce this video produced maximum views and shares across social media platforms. Before this video was released, very few had heard of the Dollar Shave Club. But through social sharing and the smart thinking to place the company URL in the video description, this in turn allowed for excellent link-building opportunities. 4. Whitepapers and Reports A whitepaper is a highly detailed report on a particular topic. Your whitepaper is an opportunity to provide insights into a topic related to your niche. Most importantly, those insights must be valuable and useful. A good example of this type of report is Buffer’s annual State of Remote Work. The report, complete with lots of graphics, provides anyone writing about remote work with lots of valuable insights and data: As seen in the image above, Buffer's report has currently generated 2,0009 backlinks, many of them with great domains, such as Jotform and BBC. Whitepapers typically require a lot of work to write, when you consider the amount of time and research that it takes to complete a thorough report on your subject. Although, the hard work pays off in the number of high-quality backlinks you receive from related sources. Conclusion When it comes to your content strategy, don't forget to consider how your content can invite beneficial backlinks. In this article, we listed four different types of content that are always welcoming of backlink opportunities, including: Listicles Infographics Video Content Whitepages and reports Should you use all the content strategies discussed in this post? Not necessarily. Even though numerous types of content can get significant backlinks, not every source will work for your niche. In other words, not every link will get the same results. Depending on your type of business, you can mix any of these strategies for some months. Then track the outcome and the expense and go with the one that works best.

Picture me pacing like a madman, diving deep into \"Sustainable Business Growth Strategies.\" We’re ripping past the fluff and getting into the raw shit about building a solid foundation for long-term success instead of getting sucked into the whirlwind of quick fixes or trendy tools that promise everything but deliver squat.\n\nI fucked this up so bad once—some random prick at the gas station told me, “You can’t build a house on sand, man.” It hit me like a ton of bricks! That’s exactly what we’re talking about here. There’s a world of challenges that business owners face daily, like limited technical skills and tight budgets. It feels like a never-ending hustle in an online landscape that shifts like sand beneath our feet. But fear not, my fellow entrepreneurs! I’m here to unpack a thoughtful, consistent approach to growth that focuses on practical solutions and support to help us sail through these choppy waters.\n\nNow, let’s strap in, because it’s a rollercoaster—here’s the full damn ride…\n\n## Why Quick Fixes Aren’t Enough\n\nLet’s hit the ground running. Quick fixes are like a sugar rush; they feel great for a hot minute but leave you crashing hard. Picture my buddy Tony, who started an eco-friendly paint company. Dude went viral on social media one day, and boom! Sales spiked to the moon. But here’s the kicker: the next day, sales plummeted back to normal. Why? Tony was riding high on a wave that was just too unpredictable.\n\nI mean, if your strategy hinges on one viral post, you’re playing a dangerous game, my friends. Sure, it feels great to ride that wave for a moment, but we need consistency! Businesses need a foundation that can handle the upticks and downticks without crumbling.\n\nSo, what should we be focusing on instead? \n\n## Common Roadblocks and How to Tackle Them\n\nWhen we zoom in on what keeps entrepreneurs up at night, we see a familiar pattern of common challen",
