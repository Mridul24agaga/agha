  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, dude, let‚Äôs break it down. So you‚Äôve got this URL, https://playpickups.app/. The name \"Play Pickups\" is kinda playful, right? I‚Äôm betting it‚Äôs something to do with gaming or a fun app vibe. It‚Äôs like those apps where you hop in and start playing something cool or maybe even something social. When I hear \"pickups,\" my mind goes straight to gaming, like picking up characters, items, or even loot in a video game. Maybe it‚Äôs a platform where you can discover new games or connect with other players? Like, a hangout spot for gamers to share tips, tricks, and strategies, or even trade gear? The use of ‚Äúapp‚Äù in the URL just screams mobile-friendly. I can totally see it being one of those slick apps designed to make gaming more social. Picture this: you‚Äôre scrolling through your phone, and boom! You find a game that your friends are hyped about, or you‚Äôre joining a community challenge. Everyone‚Äôs in on it, and it‚Äôs all about having a good time and competing or collaborating with your crew. Plus, there‚Äôs the whole ‚Äúpickup‚Äù angle‚Äîwhich could also suggest that maybe there‚Äôs something about grabbing opportunities or quick games. You know, like how in some games, you‚Äôve got to make quick decisions and grab the best gear or the coolest characters before someone else does. And let‚Äôs not forget about the social aspect of modern gaming. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if there are features for connecting with friends, maybe even some chats or forums where you can share your latest wins, losses, or just memes. Everyone‚Äôs looking to vibe with others who get their gaming struggles and triumphs, right? The site could also be featuring some casual games, the kind that you can pick up and play when you‚Äôve got a minute. The games that don‚Äôt require a full-on gaming marathon but are still totally addictive. You know, the ones that keep you coming back for just one more round, like the candy crushes and flappy birds of this world. On a deeper level, maybe the app‚Äôs about fostering a sense of community among gamers. Like, maybe it‚Äôs got some cool features to help you connect with local players or organize events‚Äîlike meetups for gaming nights, tournaments, or even online hangouts. There‚Äôs a ton of potential for cool features‚Äîleaderboards, challenges, or even profile customization. Just imagine logging in and seeing your own little avatar doing its thing, showing off your latest achievements, or competing against your pals. Anyway, the overall vibe I‚Äôm getting is super casual and fun‚Äîa place where both seasoned gamers and newbies can feel at home. It‚Äôs all about grabbing that shared love of gaming, kicking back, and enjoying some quality time, whether that‚Äôs solo or with friends. So that‚Äôs my take, man! I‚Äôm thinking Play Pickups is probably a chill spot for gamers to connect, compete, and just have a blast.",

Published Jan 24, 2025 + Follow Gaming used to be all about beating your friends on the scoreboard, leveling up, and unlocking those sweet achievements. But now? Multiplayer games are transforming into immersive worlds where hanging out with friends, attending live concerts, exploring new realms, and still crushing it on the leaderboards happen all at once. The metaverse is taking over, and gaming is about to become a whole new social experience that combines fun, connection, and adventure in ways we‚Äôve only dreamed of. A New Way to Connect One of the most exciting changes we‚Äôll see by 2025 is how gaming will become an even more interactive, social experience. Right now, when we play multiplayer games, we connect with others online, usually through voice chats or text. But imagine a world where you can walk into a virtual space, meet your friends as if you were in the same room, and do more than just play a game‚Äîyou can chat, hang out, and explore together, all in real time. Platforms like Fortnite, Roblox, and Minecraft have already given us a taste of this by blending play with social interaction. By 2025, virtual worlds will feel even more immersive. You‚Äôll be able to meet your friends at a virtual concert, explore a digital city, or even attend a meeting for work‚Äîall without leaving the game.

In fact, many players will be able to make a living by creating and selling virtual goods. This could mean creating custom clothing for avatars, designing virtual homes, or even hosting events like concerts or meetups that others pay to attend. What‚Äôs even more interesting is how brands will start to get involved. Companies will want to tap into these new digital spaces by selling branded virtual goods or creating immersive experiences for users. This will make virtual worlds not only a space for play, but also a place where business and creativity merge, opening up new opportunities for anyone with a creative streak.

Gaming has often been criticized for being inaccessible to certain groups, but these virtual spaces promise to break down many of those barriers. Whether it‚Äôs designing environments that are easier to navigate for people with disabilities, or offering customizable avatars that reflect a wide range of identities, the future of gaming will be more welcoming to everyone. We expect virtual worlds to feel more inclusive, with diverse communities coming together from all walks of life. These spaces won‚Äôt just be for hardcore gamers but for anyone looking to socialize, learn, create, or just have fun. Gaming will become something for everyone, not just those who fit into traditional gamer stereotypes. The Virtual Reality Experience By 2025, virtual reality (VR) will no longer be a novelty. It will be a part of the everyday gaming experience. With VR headsets becoming lighter and more affordable, more and more players will be able to dive into digital worlds where they can interact with everything around them. Instead of simply watching your character move across the screen, you‚Äôll be physically involved, using your hands and body to shape the world around you. This level of immersion will make games feel more like living inside a story than just playing through it. Imagine being able to walk around a virtual city truly, feel the rush of wind as you race through a digital landscape, or experience the joy of a concert as if you were there. VR will take multiplayer games to a level that‚Äôs almost indistinguishable from reality, adding layers of social interaction and presence that we‚Äôve never seen before.

Silvija Lazanin 2025/01/30 Can you name a popular mobile game with zero social features? Tough task, right? That‚Äôs because social features in mobile games have gone from being just an option to a must-have strategy for boosting player engagement. There is a wide range of social features you can include in your game, depending on the genre, player preferences, and your goals. Let‚Äôs discuss their importance and explore all the different forms they can take. Growing Importance of Social Features in Mobile Games Back in the day, social features were almost exclusive to mid-core games such as shooters and strategy games. However, over time, these features became standard across genres‚Äîfrom casual to puzzle games. While having a guild or PvP feature in a casual game would have been quite weird 7 years ago, today, it‚Äôs a completely normal thing. According to data.ai, today, ‚Öî of top mobile games have at least one social feature. What changed? Nowadays, players expect connection and community features in games, no matter what type of game they are playing. The pandemic also played a role here, as many people turned to games for social interaction during isolation periods. Moreover, with the rise of UA costs, developers are increasingly focused on engaging and retaining players. Impact and Player Preferences Social features in mobile games are a powerful tool for boosting player retention, monetization, and community building. Being social in a game can give players extra reasons to stay active for longer. While some players simply enjoy being a part of a group, others are motivated by competing with others. Just like in everyday life, there are players who are more and less social. Some players are true social butterflies. These are player personas who consider social features essential to their gaming experience and seek games that allow them to communicate, team up, or play against others. They tend to enjoy genres like MOBA and MMORPG games with features like clans, guilds, teams, PvP modes, chat, etc. On the other hand, some players enjoy occasional social interactions without the pressure of constant engagement. Such players often prefer genres like puzzle and casual strategy games. Common Social Features in Mobile Games Which social features can you include in your game? Here are some of your options‚Äîlet‚Äôs go over the most common and trending social features in mobile games. Social Media Integration Social media integration in 8 Ball Pool Whether you install a simulation, sports, strategy game or else‚Äîyou‚Äôll probably find a social media integration feature. By logging in with social media (e.g., Google or Facebook), players unlock a set of social features such as sharing achievements and inviting friends to the game. Oftentimes, players need a little push to do this. To encourage social media connections, games often reward players with a generous amount of currency for linking their accounts. After all, people put a great deal of trust in friend recommendations, creating a powerful strategy for organic growth. Chat Don‚Äôt want players leaving your game to communicate? Give them an in-game chat platform. Chat features are particularly popular in mid-core games like shooters, RPGs, and strategy games where players need to coordinate and strategize in real-time. The most common form of in-game chat is text chat, where players can send text messages, emojis, but also premade phrases for faster communication. In certain genres like MOBAs and multiplayer RPGs, it‚Äôs also common to have voice chats for direct communication, which allows players to react instantly. For example, the mobile version of the popular shooter game Call of Duty allows players to communicate with teammates during matches via both voice and text chat. Leaderboards Country-wide and friend list leaderboards in Subway Surfers The leaderboard is one of the most popular social features in mobile games, and you can find it in almost every genre. Leaderboards rank players based on their performance compared to others. For example, players can check how they stand against the rest of the world, their country, or people from their friends list. This feature is particularly effective among competitive players, motivating them to perform better, climb the ladder, and get the recognition they strive for. Co-Op and PvP Modes Does your game attract players who like to play in teams or compete? Then consider adding a co-op mode to engage players who prefer to work together towards a common goal. For example, complete missions or defeat bosses. However, If you think of your players as a more competitive crowd, think about adding a PvP (player vs. player) mode. Different PvP features in Harry Potter: Magic Awakened There are two types of PvP play‚Äîsynchronous (competing in real-time) and asynchronous (turn-based play). If the US is one of your go-to markets, note that real-time PvP is particularly popular there. According to GameRefinery, 32% to 34% of the top mobile games in the US have a synchronous PvP mode. PvP is commonly found in action, MOBA, and strategy games, boosting engagement and creating additional monetization opportunities. Think about it‚Äîcompetitive players are often willing to invest in upgrades, boosts, or cosmetics to gain an advantage or show off in front of others. Friend Systems Playing with friends can be a great motivation to play a game for a long time. There are different friend systems you can include in your game, and some popular options include: Activity feeds: showing updates on what friends are doing in the game, such as high scores, milestones and completed challenges. Ask/send help: when stuck in the game, players can request or send assistance like extra lives or resources from their friends. Trading and gifting: allowing players to exchange in-game items or send gifts to friends. Friend challenges: giving players the option to directly challenge friends to matches, high-score battles, etc. Spectator mode: some mid-core games allow players to watch their friends play in real-time from their perspective. ‚ÄúAsk for lives‚Äù feature in Candy Crush Saga Guilds/Clans/Teams If there were a popularity contest for social features in mobile games, guilds would be a guaranteed winner. To define, guilds are groups or teams that players can join within a game, allowing them to collaborate, socialize, and compete. Some other expressions for guilds are clans and teams‚Äîthe terms vary from game to game, but the principle is the same. Guilds have seen tremendous popularity in the last few years, evolving from a mid-core staple to a widely adopted feature across game genres. Some popular games that include guilds are, for example, mid-core hits like Clash of Clans and AFK Journey, as well as casual hits like Coin Master and Candy Crush Saga. Finding examples of guilds in games is quite easy. Why? Well, this feature is very widespread. According to GameRefinery, about 70% of the top-grossing games in the US have this feature. Guild (team) feature in Coin Master Social-Based Events and Social Currency Want to add a bit of social spirit to your live events strategy? Consider crafting time-limited events based on social interactions. For example, group missions to defeat a boss or reach a certain goal, or compete in team-based competitions before the event ends. Such events can be very exciting for players, boosting engagement and retention. By making these events temporary, you also build anticipation, encouraging players to log in regularly and participate.

Different from regular currency, players can earn social currency by engaging in activities like time-limited social events, guilds, or competing in PvP modes. Social currency is particularly popular in RPG games, found in 88% of the top RPG apps (Statista). Social Push Notifications Sometimes, players need a little reminder to participate in social activities. With push notifications, you can notify players about different social matters. For example, about chat messages, gifts received from friends, that it‚Äôs their turn to play, reminders that their friends are still playing, etc. However, moderation is key. Sending too many notifications can be overwhelming and annoying for players. To maximize their effectiveness, segment players based on their preferences and behavior. For example, by sending occasional reminders to casual players and more frequent updates to highly engaged players. Closing Words on Social Features in Mobile Games That‚Äôs it‚Äîthese are the key things to know about social features, why they matter, how they shape player engagement, and what their most common types are. As mobile games continue to evolve, social elements will only become more important. As a developer, the key is to find the right mix that fits your game and keeps players coming back.

Silvija Lazanin 2025/01/30 Can you name a popular mobile game with zero social features? Tough task, right? That‚Äôs because social features in mobile games have gone from being just an option to a must-have strategy for boosting player engagement. There is a wide range of social features you can include in your game, depending on the genre, player preferences, and your goals. Let‚Äôs discuss their importance and explore all the different forms they can take. Growing Importance of Social Features in Mobile Games Back in the day, social features were almost exclusive to mid-core games such as shooters and strategy games. However, over time, these features became standard across genres‚Äîfrom casual to puzzle games. While having a guild or PvP feature in a casual game would have been quite weird 7 years ago, today, it‚Äôs a completely normal thing. According to data.ai, today, ‚Öî of top mobile games have at least one social feature. What changed? Nowadays, players expect connection and community features in games, no matter what type of game they are playing. The pandemic also played a role here, as many people turned to games for social interaction during isolation periods. Moreover, with the rise of UA costs, developers are increasingly focused on engaging and retaining players. Impact and Player Preferences Social features in mobile games are a powerful tool for boosting player retention, monetization, and community building. Being social in a game can give players extra reasons to stay active for longer. While some players simply enjoy being a part of a group, others are motivated by competing with others. Just like in everyday life, there are players who are more and less social. Some players are true social butterflies. These are player personas who consider social features essential to their gaming experience and seek games that allow them to communicate, team up, or play against others. They tend to enjoy genres like MOBA and MMORPG games with features like clans, guilds, teams, PvP modes, chat, etc. On the other hand, some players enjoy occasional social interactions without the pressure of constant engagement. Such players often prefer genres like puzzle and casual strategy games. Common Social Features in Mobile Games Which social features can you include in your game? Here are some of your options‚Äîlet‚Äôs go over the most common and trending social features in mobile games. Social Media Integration Social media integration in 8 Ball Pool Whether you install a simulation, sports, strategy game or else‚Äîyou‚Äôll probably find a social media integration feature. By logging in with social media (e.g., Google or Facebook), players unlock a set of social features such as sharing achievements and inviting friends to the game. Oftentimes, players need a little push to do this. To encourage social media connections, games often reward players with a generous amount of currency for linking their accounts. After all, people put a great deal of trust in friend recommendations, creating a powerful strategy for organic growth. Chat Don‚Äôt want players leaving your game to communicate? Give them an in-game chat platform. Chat features are particularly popular in mid-core games like shooters, RPGs, and strategy games where players need to coordinate and strategize in real-time. The most common form of in-game chat is text chat, where players can send text messages, emojis, but also premade phrases for faster communication. In certain genres like MOBAs and multiplayer RPGs, it‚Äôs also common to have voice chats for direct communication, which allows players to react instantly. For example, the mobile version of the popular shooter game Call of Duty allows players to communicate with teammates during matches via both voice and text chat. Leaderboards Country-wide and friend list leaderboards in Subway Surfers The leaderboard is one of the most popular social features in mobile games, and you can find it in almost every genre. Leaderboards rank players based on their performance compared to others. For example, players can check how they stand against the rest of the world, their country, or people from their friends list. This feature is particularly effective among competitive players, motivating them to perform better, climb the ladder, and get the recognition they strive for. Co-Op and PvP Modes Does your game attract players who like to play in teams or compete? Then consider adding a co-op mode to engage players who prefer to work together towards a common goal. For example, complete missions or defeat bosses. However, If you think of your players as a more competitive crowd, think about adding a PvP (player vs. player) mode. Different PvP features in Harry Potter: Magic Awakened There are two types of PvP play‚Äîsynchronous (competing in real-time) and asynchronous (turn-based play). If the US is one of your go-to markets, note that real-time PvP is particularly popular there. According to GameRefinery, 32% to 34% of the top mobile games in the US have a synchronous PvP mode. PvP is commonly found in action, MOBA, and strategy games, boosting engagement and creating additional monetization opportunities. Think about it‚Äîcompetitive players are often willing to invest in upgrades, boosts, or cosmetics to gain an advantage or show off in front of others. Friend Systems Playing with friends can be a great motivation to play a game for a long time. There are different friend systems you can include in your game, and some popular options include: Activity feeds: showing updates on what friends are doing in the game, such as high scores, milestones and completed challenges. Ask/send help: when stuck in the game, players can request or send assistance like extra lives or resources from their friends. Trading and gifting: allowing players to exchange in-game items or send gifts to friends. Friend challenges: giving players the option to directly challenge friends to matches, high-score battles, etc. Spectator mode: some mid-core games allow players to watch their friends play in real-time from their perspective. ‚ÄúAsk for lives‚Äù feature in Candy Crush Saga Guilds/Clans/Teams If there were a popularity contest for social features in mobile games, guilds would be a guaranteed winner.

Whether it‚Äôs communication, shopping, entertainment, or research, mobile and desktop applications have become almost compulsory in the average person‚Äôs life. This shift gradually happened over the last few decades as the internet became more accessible and tech developers designed and published useful applications. Interestingly, communication apps are some of the most popular applications and are used for a wide range of activities. In addition to simple, informal communication between friends or family members, these apps are also used in the corporate environment, as well as for e-commerce and travel. For entertainment, communication apps have evolved to do much more than facilitate text messages and multimedia sharing. Applications like Telegram now have games that can be played between two individual users or a group of people. This significantly increases gaming options available to users and reduces the reliance on conventional games, including standalone gaming applications and video game consoles. Telegram also allows its users to enjoy casino games. Via platforms like tgcasino, anyone can enjoy many of the popular casino game options available in online and physical establishments, bringing more simplicity to the thrill of casino gambling and making iGaming more accessible. With TG Casino, players get attractive incentives, including a rakeback bonus and several free spins. In addition, the platform is a regional partner with the Italian professional football club AC Milan and offers players exciting prizes for participating in games during the football season tournament. Telegram‚Äôs open structure allows developers to create applications built into it, further expanding its purpose beyond simple communication. For instance, Telegram has a cryptocurrency wallet where users can buy and sell a wide range of digital assets. The platform also allows users to initiate and complete peer-to-peer (P2P) trades from within so that an external account with a different trading or exchange platform is unnecessary. Telegram also helps creators earn. In March 2024, Telegram published an official post introducing what it described as ‚Äúone of the most generous reward systems in the history of social media.‚Äù The announcement contained earning specifics, including rewarding owners of public channels with 50% of the revenue from ads displayed in their channels if they have at least 1000 subscribers. Telegram also allows channel owners to withdraw these rewards free of charge or repurpose the rewards toward ads, premium giveaways, or collectible usernames. Away from Telegram is WhatsApp, one of the world‚Äôs most used communication apps. Data specifies that as of April 2024, WhatsApp was the most popular global mobile messenger app, with more than 2 billion users worldwide. In 2018, WhatsApp introduced WhatsApp Business on multiple operating systems on mobile and desktop, designed to help small businesses communicate with their customers. The separate standalone app allows merchants to create business profiles, review metrics surrounding messages received, as well as display goods and services for sale. Businesses can also automate messages, create quick replies, and label chats for efficient operations. While the benefits for the business are endless, the perks are also transferred directly to the average user. For instance, merchants easily display their catalogues on WhatsApp, allowing users to view these items along with price details and descriptions, simplifying the shopping process. In addition, prospective patrons do not require phone calls or emails and can do everything within the app, exposing both parties to increased shopping convenience. WhatsApp also has a payment service called WhatsApp Pay. Already available in select countries like India and Brazil, and gradually introduced to other regions, WhatsApp Pay is an in-built payment service enabling users to send and receive funds within the app. It simplifies business trades and is designed to facilitate P2P transactions, which makes buying and selling seamless because neither the buyer nor the seller has to leave the app before concluding a transaction. The service requires users to perform a few verification steps, such as linking bank accounts and verifying phone numbers. After registering, payments are completed by tapping on a payment icon and specifying an amount. A combination of WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Pay offers customers several benefits, including seamless transactions and much faster payments. In addition, unlike several other third-party wallets and payment platforms, there are no extra charges, which may charge a percentage of the total amount as a processing fee. In addition to playing, working, and shopping, communication apps also significantly improve travel, with easier trip planning and coordination. Firstly, travel groups can use them to communicate and coordinate related activities. Also, travelers can use messaging apps to chat with hotels, short-let apartment operators, tour guides, and airlines to fine-tune details before the trip. Bookings, confirmations, and payments may also be made using these apps so that everything from airport pickup to accommodation plans is concluded in-app. At unfamiliar locations, communication apps can help with free calls so that travelers do not incur the cost of international roaming charges. This makes communicating with friends, family members, fellow travelers, and local businesses easy. In addition, some communication apps come with translation features for regions where the predominant language is unfamiliar. These apps can translate messages in real-time so that everything from ordering breakfast to taking cabs around a town or city is possible despite the language barrier. Finally, with travel, communication apps offer live location sharing in real-time to improve holiday safety and allow travelers to easily find related groups and forums where they can connect with like-minded people, find local events and meetups, and also facilitate cultural exchange, which helps newbies understand the culture and way of life in their destination cities or regions. As communication apps evolve in 2025 and beyond, their utility will continue to expand, so that many of the functions people need from other apps will be integrated. This way, nearly every online activity can be initiated and concluded from a communication app without a third-party service needed.

Blog From 'Why Gaming' to 'How Gaming': Evolving Narratives at CES 2025 Tous les blogs Share Claire Nance, Head of Gaming Business Success Strategy, Activision Blizzard Media January 17, 2025 7 Articles lus CES has long served as the advertising industry‚Äôs unofficial kickoff to the year, and as such it is ripe with trends, predictions and new ideas as we think about the year ahead. This year however, the conversation around gaming was different. While in previous years it often found itself referenced in relation to future trends, in 2025 the focus was firmly planted in the here and now‚Äîand how brands and advertisers should be thinking about gaming today, so they can also be part of its future tomorrow. Learn more about the biggest gaming takeaways from CES 2025. From left to right: Michelle Kim (UTA), Chirag Ambwami (Sensor Tower), Gabrielle Heyman (Zynga), and Claire Nance (Activision Blizzard Media) How we think about gaming platforms is evolving Gaming audience behavior has changed. They‚Äôre no longer playing just on one platform, they‚Äôre playing multiple games across multiple devices. As such, how we think about gaming platforms is set to evolve. Increasingly there is a need to meet players where they are, providing them with gaming experiences that they can enjoy in a style and format that suits their entertainment habits, not restricted by a specific platform. At its core, this idea is about providing gamers with greater access to games, so it‚Äôs easier than ever for them to play. For brands, they too should start to think of gaming more holistically‚Äîboth in terms of cross-platform gaming activations that capture the full spectrum of gaming behaviors and also how they consider gaming within their broader media strategy. Gaming can no longer be viewed in a silo as it isn‚Äôt consumed that way by audiences. By incorporating gaming within an integrated media strategy, advertisers are able to align gaming with other entertainment consumption behaviors to drive great impact and results. The narrative is shifting from ‚Äòwhy gaming‚Äô to ‚Äòhow to buy gaming‚Äô For a long time, the conversation around gaming was heavily focused on its scale, helping brands better understand gaming‚Äôs impact as a form of entertainment. Today, brands understand gaming‚Äôs power; so the question now turns to how they can best maximize it. With so many ways to activate within gaming, it can at times be intimidating for brands, especially those that aren‚Äôt sure where to start. They key lies in understanding their objectives and audiences, and then finding the right gaming execution to match. The easier that we‚Äîas an industry‚Äîcan make it for brands to both understand the different gaming opportunities and how to be part of them, the further gaming advertising will grow. From left to right: Claire Nance (Activision Blizzard Media), Natasha Henderson (Annalect), Karl Boyce (McDonald's), and Jonathan Stringfield (Microsoft Advertising) The attention remains on attention Attention was one of the buzz words of 2024 and that looks set to continue in 2025, with brands continuing to look for ways to capture audience attention in an increasingly crowded and fragmented media landscape. Gaming continues to find itself at the center of the discussion around attention, with its immersive environments providing a captivating environment for audiences. Gaming outperforms online video and social media when it comes to both attention and immersion, and brand experiences that are seamlessly integrated into gaming environments provide an opportunity to capitalize on these engagement-rich environments. By not disrupting the player experience, audience attention is maintained leading to outsized results for brands. The road ahead: Building on gaming‚Äôs momentum CES 2025 underscored that gaming is no longer a conversation about the future‚Äîit‚Äôs a critical part of the present. For brands and advertisers, the opportunity lies in embracing gaming as an essential piece of the media mix. Those who take action now with strategies that reflect evolving player behaviors, such as engaging with cross-platform play, will be well-positioned to forge meaningful connections and achieve measurable impact in the years ahead. As gaming continues to push creative and technological boundaries, it‚Äôs offering brands new ways to captivate audiences and stand out in an increasingly competitive media environment. The question isn‚Äôt whether to invest in gaming but how to do so with purpose and precision. About the Author An award-winning business and marketing leader, Claire Nance has over 15 years‚Äô experience driving global strategic initiatives within the advertising, technology, entertainment and media industries. As Head of Gaming Business Success Strategy at Activision Blizzard Media, Claire serves as the connection point between the gaming and advertising industries, providing strategic guidance to Activision Blizzard‚Äôs advertising revenue-facing support functions and owning its market-facing approach and industry presence.

Do I need to bring any equipment? Not at all! We provide the balls and most of our games have pinnies. Just keep an eye on the games chat and description in case that specific facility has requirements (i.e. no cleats). Do I need to be at a specific level to join a game? Unless clearly stated in the game title and description, our games are open to all levels! HAVE ANY QUESTIONS? Everything you need to know to join a game JOIN THE GOODREC FAMILY AND START PLAYING TODAY Our hope is that GoodRec brings people together. We love hearing that best friends have met, relationships have started, and group chats have been born through our soccer games. We're excited to have you join us.
