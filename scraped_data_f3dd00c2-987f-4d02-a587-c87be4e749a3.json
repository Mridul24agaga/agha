How do you find a sports buddy? Everyone knows that exercising is important, but if you go to the gym alone every time it is difficult to sustain. You can solve this by finding a buddy, rather a sports buddy. But how do you find a sports buddy? You would like someone to exercise with, but of course you don't ask the first passer-by if he wants to go to the gym with you. That needs to be approached differently. We'll give you a few tips to get you started! Where can you find someone who does the same sport as you? Especially in the gym or at the sports club where you train! You probably strike up a conversation with someone during a short break or in the dressing room. If you meet more often and are interested in the same training, you can easily suggest working out together. You have a big stick behind the door and you have a buddy. If you have plans to exercise, you can also ask your friends, neighbors, family and colleagues who would like to exercise with you. Certainly if you want to take up an accessible sport such as walking or running, there may be people who would like to join you. If you are not yet sporting, but you do have a sport or sports club in mind, you can check whether a page has been created via Facebook, for example. This way you can check if there are friends of your sports and that way find a new sports buddy. If you are not only looking for a sports buddy, but perhaps a buddy for life, a new partner, there are various sites online where you can register. The sporting activity that you do or want to do is of course leading here. So you might be lucky to not only find a sports buddy, but also a new love. In the worst case scenario, you could also try an old-fashioned but easy method: Put a card on the billboard of your local supermarket. Maybe someone in your area has similar interests and can become your sports buddy. As you can see, there are several ways to find a sports buddy. We won't say it's always easy and sometimes it takes some guts. Because, well, talking to someone in the sports club might not be your thing, but if you click and you like the same sport, why not give it a try. In the worst case, you will be told that he or she prefers to train alone, can happen of course and has nothing to do with you as a person. So just try it and maybe you'll train with a sports buddy in your favorite gym soon.

However, moving to a new city or town may feel a little intimidating if you don’t know very many people. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to make friends in your new location. If you’re looking for some tips on how to do so on your next travel nurse assignment, follow our ideas below. 1. Volunteer in the community As a nurse, there is no doubt you already love to give back. When you have a passion for giving back, it is easy to find others who share that passion. Find the perfect volunteer opportunity for you on VolunteerMatch.org by entering your city and your areas of interest. 2. Join an amateur sports team Whether you are highly athletic or just enjoy having fun, there is a sports league for you. From competitive softball to flag football, to “just for fun” dodgeball leagues, sports leagues create great ways to meet new friends in new cities. 3. Join a gym and try an exercise class Working in patient care, it can be easy to forget about your own health and well-being. Joining a gym and trying a class is a great way to stay fit and get social. You may find something you really enjoy, and a new workout partner could become a friend outside the gym as well. 4. Join a dance class You don’t need to be an experienced dancer to join a class! If you enjoy great music and staying active, dance classes provide one of the best ways to meet new friends. 5. Run a local road race Races and running clubs offer fun ways to meet new friends, see your town from a new perspective, and break a sweat. 6. Join your local Chamber of Commerce or a Professional Networking Group If you own your own business, joining the Chamber of Commerce is a highly effective way to meet new people and build a network of referrals. If you don’t own your own business, networking events are the number one way to meet people in a travel nursing profession. 7. Join a religious group or cultural club Becoming active in a local church, synagogue or mosque will ensure that you engage with a community of like-minded people who will support you. If religion isn’t for you, but you have strong ties to your culture, consider seeking out the local club or chapter that represents your culture in your city. 8. Join a wine club If you enjoy a nice glass of wine and good conversation, it won’t be hard to make new friends in a wine club. Many cities have wine clubs that tour the local wine bars and wineries (where applicable). Learn more about wine and make friends on the journey! 9. Join a book club Unwind with a new book each month and join a club where you can find new friends and enjoy a discussion. Finding the right book club is easy with websites like My Coffee and Book Club. 10. Join a sports team fan club Do you love your team? You aren’t alone!

However, moving to a new city or town may feel a little intimidating if you don’t know very many people. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to make friends in your new location. If you’re looking for some tips on how to do so on your next travel nurse assignment, follow our ideas below. 1. Volunteer in the community As a nurse, there is no doubt you already love to give back. When you have a passion for giving back, it is easy to find others who share that passion. Find the perfect volunteer opportunity for you on VolunteerMatch.org by entering your city and your areas of interest. 2. Join an amateur sports team Whether you are highly athletic or just enjoy having fun, there is a sports league for you. From competitive softball to flag football, to “just for fun” dodgeball leagues, sports leagues create great ways to meet new friends in new cities. 3. Join a gym and try an exercise class Working in patient care, it can be easy to forget about your own health and well-being. Joining a gym and trying a class is a great way to stay fit and get social. You may find something you really enjoy, and a new workout partner could become a friend outside the gym as well. 4.

Join a religious group or cultural club Becoming active in a local church, synagogue or mosque will ensure that you engage with a community of like-minded people who will support you.

Join a wine club If you enjoy a nice glass of wine and good conversation, it won’t be hard to make new friends in a wine club. Many cities have wine clubs that tour the local wine bars and wineries (where applicable). Learn more about wine and make friends on the journey! 9. Join a book club Unwind with a new book each month and join a club where you can find new friends and enjoy a discussion.

You might look at a lack of friends in your life and think that it is a personal shortcoming of some kind. You may even be wondering if it is normal for adults not to have friends. Before you start criticizing yourself too harshly, we have some encouragement for you! Forming long-lasting friendships as an adult is a struggle for many adults in their 20s, 30s and even 40s. You aren’t alone. According to the Mayo Clinic, it can be difficult for adults to find and keep good friends close by. After graduating, many adults go on to the workforce, where they might meet a lot of people, but their professional duties keep them from being able to engage with their peers at the necessary level required to develop true friendships. The fact is practicing how to make friends as an adult requires time, effort and a certain level of commitment that can be difficult in those formative years when you’re getting your career started strong or raising a family. via Canva The Importance of Adult Friendships Even though it might be difficult to start learning how to make friends as an adult, it is certainly worth it. Friendship can deepen your life in many ways, from giving you an emotional outlet to helping strengthen you mentally. Plus, it is always nice to have someone you can depend on when things get tough or you just need a laugh. Making friends at work is always an option, but often those workplace friendships do not translate well to the world outside the office. Spending plenty of unstructured time together is one key way to make a friendship stick. It is also important to note that the process of learning how to make friends as an adult might take some time, and some of the steps along the way might be a little uncomfortable. While it might be scary to push yourself outside of your comfort zone as you learn how to make friends as an adult, the resulting friendships will be relationships that can last a lifetime.

FIND CLASSES Jump to Section Why is it Hard to Make Friends as an Adult? The Importance of Adult Friendships 17 Ideas for Making Friends as an Adult Why is it Hard to Make Friends as an Adult? You might look at a lack of friends in your life and think that it is a personal shortcoming of some kind. You may even be wondering if it is normal for adults not to have friends. Before you start criticizing yourself too harshly, we have some encouragement for you! Forming long-lasting friendships as an adult is a struggle for many adults in their 20s, 30s and even 40s. You aren’t alone. According to the Mayo Clinic, it can be difficult for adults to find and keep good friends close by. After graduating, many adults go on to the workforce, where they might meet a lot of people, but their professional duties keep them from being able to engage with their peers at the necessary level required to develop true friendships. The fact is practicing how to make friends as an adult requires time, effort and a certain level of commitment that can be difficult in those formative years when you’re getting your career started strong or raising a family. via Canva The Importance of Adult Friendships Even though it might be difficult to start learning how to make friends as an adult, it is certainly worth it. Friendship can deepen your life in many ways, from giving you an emotional outlet to helping strengthen you mentally. Plus, it is always nice to have someone you can depend on when things get tough or you just need a laugh. Making friends at work is always an option, but often those workplace friendships do not translate well to the world outside the office. Spending plenty of unstructured time together is one key way to make a friendship stick. It is also important to note that the process of learning how to make friends as an adult might take some time, and some of the steps along the way might be a little uncomfortable. While it might be scary to push yourself outside of your comfort zone as you learn how to make friends as an adult, the resulting friendships will be relationships that can last a lifetime. If you’re wondering how to make friends as a young adult, or if you've recently moved and are wondering how to meet people in a new city, we’ve gathered 17 great ideas of ways to branch out, meet new people and start developing real, long-lasting friendships, no matter what stage of life you are in. 17 Ideas for Making Friends as an Adult 1.

Game Nights Some local bars and coffee shops host weekly events like trivia or open mic night, which are great options for meeting new people! Events like these are a little easier for extroverts, and you might be wondering “How do introverts make friends?” If being in social situations makes you feel drained and tired, give fun virtual events a try.

From amateur volleyball and softball to flag football and pickleball, there’s sure to be an active way for you to join a team and learn how to make friends as an adult. If there are no community recreational leagues in your area, sometimes local churches offer leagues, too! In no time your teammates will become some of your best friends. 13.

This is a real win-win situation for anyone learning how to make friends as an adult! 15. College Alumni Associations One way to learn how to make friends as an adult in a new city is to look up your college or university’s alumni association.

This is an easy way to get connected with people you already have something in common with your alma mater! Who knows? You may even reconnect with a college friend and reminisce over your shared experiences. 16.

In the meantime, the learning process can feel daunting: You want to get your meaning across correctly and smoothly, but putting your ideas into writing comes with the pressure of their feeling more permanent. This is why consistent, tailored suggestions are most helpful for improving your English writing abilities. Seeing specific writing suggestions based on common grammatical mistakes multilingual speakers make in English is key to improving your communication and English writing fluency. Regular feedback is powerful because writing in a language that isn’t the first one you learned poses extra challenges. It can feel extra frustrating when your ideas don’t come across as naturally as in your primary language. It’s also tough to put your writing out there when you’re not quite sure if your grammar and wording are correct. For those communicating in English in a professional setting, your ability to write effectively can make all the difference between collaboration and isolation, career progress and stagnation. Grammarly Pro helps multilingual speakers sound their best in English with tailored suggestions to improve grammar and idiomatic phrasing. Especially when you’re writing for work, where time often is in short supply, you want your communication to be effortless. In addition to offering general fluency assistance, Grammarly Pro now includes tailored suggestions for writing issues common among Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, French, and German speakers, with more languages on the way. Features for all multilingual speakers Grammarly’s writing suggestions will catch the most common grammatical errors that multilingual speakers make in English. For example, if you drop an article or misuse a preposition (such as “on” instead of “in”), our sidebar will flag those mistakes within the Fix spelling and grammar category with the label Common issue for multilingual speakers. Most importantly, it will provide suggestions for fixing them. While these errors seem small, one right after another can make sentences awkward and more difficult to absorb. Eliminating them all in one fell swoop is a powerful way to put a more fluent spin on your document. Features for speakers of specific languages With Grammarly Pro, speakers of French, German, Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish can get suggestions specifically tailored to their primary language, unlocking a whole other level of preciseness in written English. For speakers of those languages, our sidebar will flag “false friends,” or cognates, which are words or phrases that have a similar form or sound in one’s primary language but don’t have the same meaning in English. But now Grammarly Pro’s writing suggestions will catch these types of errors for you and provide suggestions on how to fix them. You can find these suggestions in the Sound more fluent category in our floating sidebar.

But now Grammarly Pro’s writing suggestions will catch these types of errors for you and provide suggestions on how to fix them. You can find these suggestions in the Sound more fluent category in our floating sidebar. Simply click on the suggestion highlighted in green, and voila, your English will be more polished and accurate. PS: Tailored suggestions for other language backgrounds are on the way!
