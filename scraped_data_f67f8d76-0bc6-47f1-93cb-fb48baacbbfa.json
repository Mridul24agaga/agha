Jodie Cook covers ChatGPT prompts & AI for coaches and entrepreneurs. Follow Author Feb 05, 2025, 12:00pm EST Save ArticleComment How to start a business with no money in 2025 getty Starting a business doesn't require cash in the bank. You read that right. Plenty of business owners started with zero money down, because they got paid before they built anything. Your customers become your investors when you do this properly. First-time entrepreneurs without heaps of capital hit their stride this way. No business loans, no savings spent, no credit card debt. In 2025, all you need is an internet connection, plenty of enthusiasm, and pure value creation that people want to buy. If you’re thinking about starting up but money has held you back, here’s your master plan. Building A Business Without Cash Talk To Successful People Get out and about and strike up conversations everywhere you go. Chat with business owners about their journey. Ask them what businesses their friends run. Talk to people who look successful and find out how they made it happen. Skip the business books and learn straight from people winning the game. Pick up the phone. Visit your local business district. Say “hi” first and ask a good question, then add them on LinkedIn and start building your network. Repeat this daily until speaking to strangers about business feels normal. Real experience beats theory every time. MORE FOR YOU Google Warns My Old Gmail And Photos To Be Deleted April 3—How To Save Yours Trump Reveals U.S. ‘Crypto Reserve’ Price Bombshell—Sending XRP, Solana, Cardano And Bitcoin Soaring Today’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Sunday, March 2nd Pick Your Customer Type Smart business owners know exactly who their customer is. They've chosen their crowd and they stick to them. Having a business coach at age 21 changed everything about how I thought about work. Since then, I've been fascinated by this field, and I created my new business specifically to work with coaches. Your story guides your choice and makes the work more enjoyable. Write down who you want to serve. Be specific about their job, their life stage, their dreams. Ask Perplexity or ChatGPT to help you nail the description, to keep you focused when building your offer. It’s easier to attract the right people when you know who they are. Find Problems Worth Solving People tell you their problems if you ask. They share what keeps them awake, what frustrates them most, what they wish they could change. Your job is to listen and take notes. Their complaints become your business plan. In 2025, LinkedIn is busier than ever. Find your dream customer there. DM them, comment on their posts. More people, more problems, more clients for you. Ask deep, probing questions about their struggles. Write down exact phrases they use, so you understand how they think. Notice which problems they mention multiple times. The best ones to solve are those they bring up a lot. Link Problems To Money Not every complaint equals a paying customer. You need proof they'll spend money to make the problem disappear. Smart founders verify this before building anything. They ask directly about pricing and payment preferences. Test different offers in conversation. Ask what they've paid for similar solutions before. Find out if they prefer one-off fees or monthly payments. Get specific numbers they'd happily pay. Only proceed when you know the money's there. Secure Paying Customers Fast Get commitment before you build. Agree on a price and payment terms up front. In 2025 people are used to paying in advance for services, even remote ones. Charge by the hour or charge for a result. Tell them exactly what they'll receive and when, then do exceptional work that exceeds their expectations. Your first customer's success creates your entire future. Ask for testimonials right after delivering the goods, then use their words to attract your next customer. Each new sign-up builds your confidence and reputation. Keep standards high and watch your empire grow. One happy customer brings three more through referrals. Start Your Business Today Building a business with zero money works when you follow these steps. Remove all the risk by actually selling before you spend a dime. You don’t need a big team or fancy office. A back-to-basics approach will start you off, and you can get assistance from AI as you sign your first clients. Talk to successful people, choose your audience, understand their problems, verify they'll pay, then deliver amazing work. There’s no excuse not to give this a try, and you’ll be forever grateful you did. Don’t leave your first customer waiting. Start conversations and find them fast. Follow me on LinkedIn.

Entrepreneurship continues to fuel growth, with 5.5 million new business applications filed in 2023, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Aspiring business owners have access to numerous entrepreneur resources for guidance on starting and scaling their ventures. Education is a key tool for success, and programs like a bachelor’s degree in entrepreneurship offer valuable knowledge and skills to help individuals fast-track their entrepreneurial journeys. What Do You Need to Start a Business? Starting a business requires a mix of planning, research, and legal compliance. While each venture is different, the following are some key elements that can help a prospective entrepreneur get started. From defining a business concept to registering a company, here are some essential steps needed to launch a business. Determine Your Business Concept A business concept outlines what a company will do, who it will serve, and how it will meet market needs. It defines the problems the company aims to solve and its unique strengths to achieve its aims. Individuals determining a business concept go through exploratory processes, such as identifying their passions and finding market opportunities where they can make an impact. Conduct Market Research Market research is a valuable entrepreneur resource. It allows individuals to evaluate the viability of their idea by gathering insights into potential customers and competitors. Primary research, such as surveys and interviews, can provide direct feedback, while secondary research uses existing data, such as census reports. The elements of a SWOT analysis—strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats— are all useful in business planning. Create Your Business Plan A business plan is essential whether a business is self-funded or investor backed. It helps outline goals and address challenges. Traditional plans are comprehensive, while lean startup plans focus only on key points. Both types of plans should include an executive summary, company description, market analysis, goals, products or services, marketing strategy, and financial plan. Choose Your Business Structure The structure of a business affects registration, taxes, and liability. A limited liability company (LLC) limits personal liability and can have multiple owners. Licensed professionals, such as lawyers, commonly use a limited liability partnership (LLP) structure. A sole proprietorship is a simple structure, but it places full liability on the owner. Corporations limit liability and can be taxed as C corporations or S corporations, with S corporations offering pass-through taxation for smaller businesses. Register Your Business Registering a business at the federal and sometimes state level, establishes its legal identity and protects the business’s brand. Upon registering, a business is issued an employer identification number (EIN) by the Internal Revenue Service; this unique identifier functions like a social security number and is required for opening a bank account and handling taxes. Some states may also require a separate tax ID for state tax purposes. 10 Entrepreneurial Resources Here are some entrepreneur resources that can help individuals grow their entrepreneurial vision into a successful business. 1. U.S. Small Business Administration The SBA provides loans, grants, and free mentorship to support businesses from launch to growth. It also offers industry guides and resources. 2. Small Business Development Centers Personalized consulting and training are available through small business development centers (SBDCs). These centers are located throughout the U.S. and can help individuals with business plans, financial management, and more. 3. Grants.gov Entrepreneurs can search and apply for federal grants on Grants.gov. Federal grants are funding options that don’t require business equity. 4. IRS Small Business and Self-Employed Tax Center The IRS Tax Center serves as a hub for tax tools and expert advice for small business owners. Guidance on deductions and tax credits is also available to help maximize savings. 5. National Association for the Self-Employed The National Association for the Self-Employed (NASE) supports self-employed individuals by offering benefits, expert advice, and educational tools. Discounts on key products and services are also available to members. 6. National Women’s Business Council Female entrepreneurs can find support and guidance through the National Women’s Business Council (NWBC). Research and insights specific to women in business are regularly published to encourage growth. 7. U.S. Chamber of Commerce The U.S. Chamber of Commerce works to promote business-friendly policies. Membership includes networking events and growth opportunities for small business owners. 8. Online Publications Print and online publications, such as Entrepreneur, Inc., and Small Business Trends, deliver business news, expert advice, and inspiring success stories. These publications also include how-to guides and case studies that offer practical strategies for entrepreneurs. 9. Networking Tools A business profile can enhance visibility and reach. Networking tools, such as LinkedIn, enable entrepreneurs to connect with mentors, peers, and potential partners. 10. Website Creation Resources Website building platforms, such as Wix, Squarespace, and WordPress, provide easy solutions for creating professional websites. E-commerce features and templates are available to suit various business needs. Benefits of Starting Your Own Business Launching a new venture can begin with starting a side business . For some, the side business may grow, creating an opportunity to leave a full-time job to start a full-time business. However, it comes with risks. Financial loss is one of the biggest concerns, along with the uncertainty and stress of managing a new venture. Personal liability and the extensive time commitment required can also be overwhelming. However, starting a business has many benefits. For example, being your own boss offers control over your destiny and an opportunity to create a work schedule that suits your lifestyle. Starting a business can also bring personal fulfillment. Entrepreneurs often pursue their passions, leading to increased motivation and happiness. The financial rewards can be substantial. For some businesses, more risk can translate into more money. Prepare for a Career in Entrepreneurship Entrepreneur resources, coupled with an understanding of business principles, help entrepreneurs make smarter financial decisions and gain a competitive business edge.

From defining a business concept to registering a company, here are some essential steps needed to launch a business. Determine Your Business Concept A business concept outlines what a company will do, who it will serve, and how it will meet market needs. It defines the problems the company aims to solve and its unique strengths to achieve its aims. Individuals determining a business concept go through exploratory processes, such as identifying their passions and finding market opportunities where they can make an impact. Conduct Market Research Market research is a valuable entrepreneur resource. It allows individuals to evaluate the viability of their idea by gathering insights into potential customers and competitors. Primary research, such as surveys and interviews, can provide direct feedback, while secondary research uses existing data, such as census reports. The elements of a SWOT analysis—strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats— are all useful in business planning. Create Your Business Plan A business plan is essential whether a business is self-funded or investor backed. It helps outline goals and address challenges. Traditional plans are comprehensive, while lean startup plans focus only on key points. Both types of plans should include an executive summary, company description, market analysis, goals, products or services, marketing strategy, and financial plan. Choose Your Business Structure The structure of a business affects registration, taxes, and liability. A limited liability company (LLC) limits personal liability and can have multiple owners. Licensed professionals, such as lawyers, commonly use a limited liability partnership (LLP) structure. A sole proprietorship is a simple structure, but it places full liability on the owner. Corporations limit liability and can be taxed as C corporations or S corporations, with S corporations offering pass-through taxation for smaller businesses. Register Your Business Registering a business at the federal and sometimes state level, establishes its legal identity and protects the business’s brand. Upon registering, a business is issued an employer identification number (EIN) by the Internal Revenue Service; this unique identifier functions like a social security number and is required for opening a bank account and handling taxes. Some states may also require a separate tax ID for state tax purposes. 10 Entrepreneurial Resources Here are some entrepreneur resources that can help individuals grow their entrepreneurial vision into a successful business. 1. U.S. Small Business Administration The SBA provides loans, grants, and free mentorship to support businesses from launch to growth. It also offers industry guides and resources. 2.

Grants.gov Entrepreneurs can search and apply for federal grants on Grants.gov. Federal grants are funding options that don’t require business equity. 4. IRS Small Business and Self-Employed Tax Center The IRS Tax Center serves as a hub for tax tools and expert advice for small business owners. Guidance on deductions and tax credits is also available to help maximize savings. 5.

Networking tools, such as LinkedIn, enable entrepreneurs to connect with mentors, peers, and potential partners. 10. Website Creation Resources Website building platforms, such as Wix, Squarespace, and WordPress, provide easy solutions for creating professional websites. E-commerce features and templates are available to suit various business needs. Benefits of Starting Your Own Business Launching a new venture can begin with starting a side business . For some, the side business may grow, creating an opportunity to leave a full-time job to start a full-time business. However, it comes with risks. Financial loss is one of the biggest concerns, along with the uncertainty and stress of managing a new venture. Personal liability and the extensive time commitment required can also be overwhelming. However, starting a business has many benefits. For example, being your own boss offers control over your destiny and an opportunity to create a work schedule that suits your lifestyle. Starting a business can also bring personal fulfillment. Entrepreneurs often pursue their passions, leading to increased motivation and happiness. The financial rewards can be substantial. For some businesses, more risk can translate into more money.

You will be asked to tap into a range of resources that might be unfamiliar to you. However, the good news is that as you progress, you will gain the proficiency and insight to identify and effectively leverage these resources regularly. Financial Resources, Physical Resources, Intellectual Resources, Human Resources, and Digital Resources are the top five crucial resources that small business owners need to focus on. 1. Financial Resources Gaining access to funding is a significant hurdle for any business owner. While veteran entrepreneurs may have the advantage of being eligible for specialized financial resources, such as loans, grants, and tax incentives, they must keep in mind that free money does not exist. To secure funding, it is crucial to have a solid business plan and reliable financial reports, which can be prepared with the assistance of a trusted financial advisor. Thankfully, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers various financial resources tailored to veteran entrepreneurs. As a veteran or military spouse entrepreneur, you can benefit from the Veteran Business Outreach Centers ( Office of Veterans Business Development VBOC), which provide training, counseling, and other essential resources to help you establish and expand your business. 2. Physical Resources Physical resources refer to the tangible assets needed to run a business, such as equipment, inventory, and office space. Veterans may be eligible for surplus military equipment or discounted office space through government programs or partnerships with private companies. (Learn more here.) It is important to carefully evaluate the needs of the business and plan for the necessary physical resources to ensure smooth operations. 3. Intellectual Resources Intellectual resources encompass the knowledge, abilities, and proficiency essential for running a business. As an entrepreneur, it is crucial to continuously expand your knowledge base. There are numerous programs that cater to veteran and military spouse entrepreneurs to help you advance professionally. Grow with Google provides a vast array of professional development webinars that can assist you in enhancing your digital skillset. It is vital to develop a growth mindset by leveraging your military training and experience to acquire valuable skills in areas like leadership, project management, and logistics. Take advantage of as many resources as possible. Attend professional conferences, stay up to date on networking events in your area, and join community-building organizations. If you have limited free time, you can listen to podcasts, watch YouTube tutorials, or read articles. There are also various resources available to aid veteran entrepreneurs in developing their business skills, including workshops, mentorship programs, and online training courses. These resources can equip veteran business owners with the necessary knowledge and skills to thrive in their new ventures. Remember to explore your local library as it can provide a wealth of small business resources!

Human Resources Human resources refer to the people who work for a business, including employees, contractors, and consultants. Veterans may be able to find and hire other veterans who bring a similar work ethic and commitment to their businesses. Additionally, veteran-owned businesses can participate in government programs that prioritize the hiring of veterans, such as the Veterans Employment Opportunity Act (VEOA). Effective human resources management is key to building a strong team and maintaining a healthy work environment. 5. Digital Resources In today's digital age, having a strong online presence is critical for any business. Digital resources can include website hosting and design, social media management, email marketing platforms, and other tools that help businesses connect with customers and promote their brands. Veterans can take advantage of free or low-cost digital resources, such as the SBA's free business tools, to help them get started. Digital resources can help veteran business owners reach new customers and grow their businesses. In conclusion, starting a business as a veteran requires careful planning and access to the right resources. By leveraging the financial, physical, intellectual, human, and digital resources available, veteran business owners can increase their chances of success. There are numerous resources available to veteran entrepreneurs, and with careful planning and execution, they can turn their dreams into reality.

You will be asked to tap into a range of resources that might be unfamiliar to you. However, the good news is that as you progress, you will gain the proficiency and insight to identify and effectively leverage these resources regularly. Financial Resources, Physical Resources, Intellectual Resources, Human Resources, and Digital Resources are the top five crucial resources that small business owners need to focus on. 1. Financial Resources Gaining access to funding is a significant hurdle for any business owner. While veteran entrepreneurs may have the advantage of being eligible for specialized financial resources, such as loans, grants, and tax incentives, they must keep in mind that free money does not exist. To secure funding, it is crucial to have a solid business plan and reliable financial reports, which can be prepared with the assistance of a trusted financial advisor. Thankfully, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers various financial resources tailored to veteran entrepreneurs. As a veteran or military spouse entrepreneur, you can benefit from the Veteran Business Outreach Centers ( Office of Veterans Business Development VBOC), which provide training, counseling, and other essential resources to help you establish and expand your business. 2. Physical Resources Physical resources refer to the tangible assets needed to run a business, such as equipment, inventory, and office space. Veterans may be eligible for surplus military equipment or discounted office space through government programs or partnerships with private companies. (Learn more here.) It is important to carefully evaluate the needs of the business and plan for the necessary physical resources to ensure smooth operations. 3. Intellectual Resources Intellectual resources encompass the knowledge, abilities, and proficiency essential for running a business. As an entrepreneur, it is crucial to continuously expand your knowledge base. There are numerous programs that cater to veteran and military spouse entrepreneurs to help you advance professionally. Grow with Google provides a vast array of professional development webinars that can assist you in enhancing your digital skillset. It is vital to develop a growth mindset by leveraging your military training and experience to acquire valuable skills in areas like leadership, project management, and logistics. Take advantage of as many resources as possible. Attend professional conferences, stay up to date on networking events in your area, and join community-building organizations. If you have limited free time, you can listen to podcasts, watch YouTube tutorials, or read articles. There are also various resources available to aid veteran entrepreneurs in developing their business skills, including workshops, mentorship programs, and online training courses. These resources can equip veteran business owners with the necessary knowledge and skills to thrive in their new ventures.

Human Resources Human resources refer to the people who work for a business, including employees, contractors, and consultants. Veterans may be able to find and hire other veterans who bring a similar work ethic and commitment to their businesses. Additionally, veteran-owned businesses can participate in government programs that prioritize the hiring of veterans, such as the Veterans Employment Opportunity Act (VEOA). Effective human resources management is key to building a strong team and maintaining a healthy work environment. 5. Digital Resources In today's digital age, having a strong online presence is critical for any business. Digital resources can include website hosting and design, social media management, email marketing platforms, and other tools that help businesses connect with customers and promote their brands. Veterans can take advantage of free or low-cost digital resources, such as the SBA's free business tools, to help them get started. Digital resources can help veteran business owners reach new customers and grow their businesses. In conclusion, starting a business as a veteran requires careful planning and access to the right resources. By leveraging the financial, physical, intellectual, human, and digital resources available, veteran business owners can increase their chances of success. There are numerous resources available to veteran entrepreneurs, and with careful planning and execution, they can turn their dreams into reality.
