If you want to write better essays, it’s helpful to understand the criteria teachers use to score them.

Development of Your Thesis A thesis is the essence of your paper—the claim you are making, the point you are trying to prove.

Instead of solely focusing on the grade you are given, focus on how you are being graded and how you can improve, even if you are already getting a high grade. Development of Your Thesis A thesis is the essence of your paper—the claim you are making, the point you are trying to prove. All the other paragraphs in your essay will revolve around this one central idea. Your thesis statement consists of the one or two sentences of your introduction that explain what your position on the topic at hand is. Teachers will evaluate all your other paragraphs on how well they relate to or support this statement. Strong Form A good essay presents thoughts in a logical order. The format should be easy to follow. The introduction should flow naturally to the body paragraphs, and the conclusion should tie everything together. The best way to do this is to lay out the outline of your paper before you begin. After you finish your essay, review the form to see if thoughts progress naturally. Ensure your paragraphs and sentences are in a logical order, the transitions are smooth so that the paragraphs are coherently connected, and that your body paragraphs relate to the thesis statement. Style Just as your clothes express your personality, the style of your essay reveals your writing persona. You demonstrate your fluency by writing precise sentences that vary in form. A mature writer uses various types of sentences, idiomatic phrases, and demonstrates knowledge of genre-specific vocabulary, all the while ensuring the writing reflects your authentic voice. Conventions Conventions include spelling, punctuation, sentence structure, and grammar. Having lots of mistakes suggests carelessness and diminishes the credibility of your arguments. Furthermore, because most essays are written on computers these days, there is a lower tolerance for spelling mistakes, which can easily be avoided with spell-checking tools such as Grammarly. Beyond spelling, Grammarly can also help to weed out other major grammatical errors. Follow up with a close reading of your entire paper. Support and References Finally, your teacher will examine your resources. Select information from reliable websites, articles, and books. Use quotes and paraphrases to support your ideas, but be sure to credit your sources correctly. Also, always remember that copying five consecutive words or more from any source constitutes plagiarism. If you are concerned about unintentionally quoting your sources, Grammarly Pro offers a plagiarism detector so you can always double-check your work. The grades you get on your essays are important, but you can never improve your writing if they are the only things you consider. Focus on improving your essays’ overall structure—the thesis development, form, style, conventions, and support. Learning to master these five elements will cause your scores to soar!

Instead of solely focusing on the grade you are given, focus on how you are being graded and how you can improve, even if you are already getting a high grade. Development of Your Thesis A thesis is the essence of your paper—the claim you are making, the point you are trying to prove. All the other paragraphs in your essay will revolve around this one central idea. Your thesis statement consists of the one or two sentences of your introduction that explain what your position on the topic at hand is. Teachers will evaluate all your other paragraphs on how well they relate to or support this statement. Strong Form A good essay presents thoughts in a logical order. The format should be easy to follow. The introduction should flow naturally to the body paragraphs, and the conclusion should tie everything together. The best way to do this is to lay out the outline of your paper before you begin. After you finish your essay, review the form to see if thoughts progress naturally. Ensure your paragraphs and sentences are in a logical order, the transitions are smooth so that the paragraphs are coherently connected, and that your body paragraphs relate to the thesis statement. Style Just as your clothes express your personality, the style of your essay reveals your writing persona. You demonstrate your fluency by writing precise sentences that vary in form. A mature writer uses various types of sentences, idiomatic phrases, and demonstrates knowledge of genre-specific vocabulary, all the while ensuring the writing reflects your authentic voice. Conventions Conventions include spelling, punctuation, sentence structure, and grammar. Having lots of mistakes suggests carelessness and diminishes the credibility of your arguments. Furthermore, because most essays are written on computers these days, there is a lower tolerance for spelling mistakes, which can easily be avoided with spell-checking tools such as Grammarly. Beyond spelling, Grammarly can also help to weed out other major grammatical errors. Follow up with a close reading of your entire paper. Support and References Finally, your teacher will examine your resources. Select information from reliable websites, articles, and books. Use quotes and paraphrases to support your ideas, but be sure to credit your sources correctly. Also, always remember that copying five consecutive words or more from any source constitutes plagiarism. If you are concerned about unintentionally quoting your sources, Grammarly Pro offers a plagiarism detector so you can always double-check your work. The grades you get on your essays are important, but you can never improve your writing if they are the only things you consider. Focus on improving your essays’ overall structure—the thesis development, form, style, conventions, and support. Learning to master these five elements will cause your scores to soar!

Why High-Quality Backlinks Matter More Than Ever in 2025 In the ever-evolving landscape of digital marketing, backlinks have consistently stood as a cornerstone of search engine optimization (SEO). As we step into 2025, the significance of high-quality backlinks not only still matter, they have magnified. Let’s dive deep into why backlinks are critical, how they impact your online visibility, and how Marketing Illumination can help you harness their full potential. The Evolution of Backlinks in SEO Backlinks, also known as inbound links, are links from one website to another. They act as a vote of confidence, signaling to search engines that your content is valuable and trustworthy. While quantity was once the gold standard, today, quality reigns supreme. Google’s algorithms have evolved to prioritize relevance, authority, and user intent when assessing backlinks. In 2025, low-quality, spammy links are not just ineffective—they’re detrimental. Instead, link building from authoritative sites can skyrocket your rankings, enhance credibility, and drive sustainable traffic. What Makes a Backlink High-Quality? Relevance: The linking site should be contextually aligned with your content. Authority: Links from established domains hold more weight. Diversity: A mix of sources—blogs, news sites, forums—signals a natural link profile. Placement: Links embedded within relevant content are more valuable than those in footers or sidebars. Why High-Quality Backlinks Matter More in 2025 1. Enhanced Search Engine Rankings Google’s core updates continue to focus on rewarding quality content supported by authoritative backlinks. A robust backlink profile can catapult your site to the top of search engine results pages (SERPs). With fierce competition in every niche, securing these links can mean the difference between obscurity and top rankings. For instance, businesses leveraging the power of backlinks in conjunction with modern SEO strategies, like those offered by Marketing Illumination, are seeing unprecedented results. Such results emphasize the power of combining link-building with a solid content and technical SEO foundation. 2. Increased Organic Traffic High-quality backlinks not only improve your search rankings but also drive referral traffic from credible sources. When a respected site links to your page, users are more likely to trust and click on the link, leading to a direct influx of potential customers. Furthermore, these visitors are often more engaged, as they’ve arrived through trusted recommendations. By attracting targeted traffic, you can boost conversions and achieve higher ROI on your digital marketing efforts. The compound effect of quality backlinks means every new link adds exponential value to your overall traffic and engagement metrics. 3. Building Brand Authority Earning backlinks from industry leaders positions your brand as an authority in your niche. It’s not just about SEO—it’s about creating trust and credibility. Whether it’s through strategic collaborations, featured mentions, or guest posts, high-quality backlinks validate your expertise. By integrating services like website design, Marketing Illumination ensures that your site not only attracts links but also retains visitors with a seamless user experience. The synergy between content excellence and technical design strengthens your brand’s authority. 4. Improved User Experience Backlinks are more than just an SEO metric—they’re a tool for providing value. Relevant, high-quality links guide users to complementary content, enhancing their journey. By connecting users to related information, you create a cohesive and satisfying browsing experience. This aligns perfectly with Google’s focus on user-centricity, as discussed in our blog on search intent. Ensuring users find what they need efficiently not only boosts satisfaction but also increases dwell time, a key ranking factor. Strategies for Acquiring High-Quality Backlinks in 2025 1. Content That Commands Attention Creating shareable, engaging, and authoritative content is the foundation of any successful backlink strategy. Exceptional content naturally attracts links from others who want to reference your insights. Types of content that perform well include in-depth guides, original research, infographics, and thought leadership pieces. Tools like pay-per-click marketing can amplify your content’s reach, ensuring it gains visibility with the right audience. Paid promotion combined with organic content marketing forms a potent strategy for gaining traction. 2. Outreach and Relationship Building Building relationships with influencers, bloggers, and industry leaders is essential. Personalized outreach—rather than generic requests—increases the likelihood of earning backlinks. Show genuine interest in their work and demonstrate how linking to your content adds value to their audience. Over time, these relationships can evolve into partnerships, leading to ongoing collaborations that benefit both parties. Networking within industry forums and attending relevant events can also open doors to backlink opportunities. 3. Leverage Local SEO Local backlinks are invaluable for businesses targeting regional audiences. Partnerships with local businesses, sponsorships of community events, and directory listings are just a few ways to secure such links. Explore our guide on how to rank higher on Google Maps for more insights into optimizing local visibility. Incorporating location-specific keywords and content further enhances the effectiveness of your local backlink strategy. 4. Digital PR Campaigns Press releases, guest blogging, and participation in industry forums can generate high-quality backlinks. Press releases about product launches or company milestones, when distributed to credible outlets, can earn valuable links from news sites. Guest blogging remains a tried-and-true tactic, but it’s crucial to prioritize quality over quantity. Contributing unique insights to authoritative publications not only earns backlinks but also builds your reputation. Be sure your contributions are well-researched and align with the publication’s audience. 5. Competitor Analysis Analyze your competitors’ backlink profiles to uncover opportunities. Tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush can provide insights into where they’re earning links and how you can replicate their success. Look for broken link-building opportunities, unlinked brand mentions, and gaps in their content strategy. By targeting these areas, you can attract backlinks while staying one step ahead in the competitive landscape. Why Partner with Marketing Illumination?

They are your website’s \"references\" at the Google grad school. In the same way, rave reviews get you the job of your dreams, and the right backlinks take your site to the top of the search results pages (SERPs). According to a report by Backlinko, linking domains to a page is one of the most powerful ranking signals in Google’s algorithm. 3.8 times more likely to reach the first page on Google when you have a good backlink profile. It shows how powerful backlinks are to SEO rankings and website performance. In this article, we will explain why backlinks are essential for SEO success and how they can take your website to page-one status. Well, now let’s get down to business with the backlinks and how they can change your online identity. Why Do Backlinks Matter? Backlinks aren’t just hyperlinks linking you to another site. Understanding the importance of backlinks is key to improving your website's visibility and authority. Authority Building Backlinks are like testimonials for your website. Links from quality, authoritative sites show search engines that you are an authority. Let’s say you were mentioned by a top authority in your field, and that’s what a good backlink does for your site. Such testimonials are taken into consideration by search engines like Google, which consider your domain authority, which determines your rank opportunities. The more authority you have, the higher up your website will appear on the SERPs. Enhanced Rankings A well-built backlink profile can make a major difference in your search engine rank. The 3 ranking factors Google considers most important are backlinks, content, and RankBrain. Without them, even optimized content will be unable to appear. Quality backlinks show the search engines that your content is valuable, thus ranking it higher and faster than your competitors. Increased Visibility Backlinks not only get your content found by search engines but also help users discover your site. The more links you have from trusted sites, the bigger your audience. Imagine your website getting picked up on a popular blog post or newspaper article. These backlinks are like digital waymarkers – they guide visitors to your content and also promote your brand. Traffic Magnet Besides rank, backlinks drive a lot of referral traffic. Referral traffic is different than organic search traffic as it comes directly from visitors who click on links to your website from other websites. These are very specialized types of traffic as the user is coming from a related content or industry. So, for instance, if a top tech blog mentions your software review, then you are bound to get people with an interest in your field. The result? More traffic, conversions, and (hopefully) customers. 😂 Improved Content Discoverability Backlinks are paths search engines use to crawl your pages. It’s like a treasure hunt with no map when you don’t have backlinks for your site. Backlinks also help your content get indexed faster and better so that it can be found by users who are looking for it. Backlinks increase authority, rank, visibility, and targeted traffic on your site in general. They’re the lifeblood of an SEO strategy. To make them go to full capacity, ensure that you get quality, relevant backlinks that match your niche and add value to your followers. Different Kinds of Backlinks: Strategies For SEO Profitability. Backlinks are more than mere links; they are technical, subtle, and crucial to your website’s SEO. However, not all backlinks are created equal. To really get the most out of them, you must know what type of backlinks are, what effects they have, and how to use them efficiently. Let’s see the two most common types: Do-follow vs. No-follow and Natural vs. Artificial links. Do-Follow vs. No-Follow Links What Are Do-Follow Links? A do-follow link is your ally in backlink life. The majority of links are do-follow unless otherwise specified. If someone does do-follow (a website links to you from their site), it’s like, \"Hey, this content is good, give credit!\" To search engines. For Example: Suppose that you get a mention in an industry blog on \"The Best Marketing Tools for 2024\" and that the do-follow link is your blog. That link distributes \"link juice,\" or we can say that it benefits your site by increasing its authority and, if not, its SERPs. Link juice is a term used in SEO to describe authority passed from one webpage to another through links. When a high-quality webpage links to another page, it shares some of its authority, helping the linked page rank better in search results. Link Juice What Are No-Follow Links? No-follow links, meanwhile, have an HTML attribute ( rel=\"nofollow\") that tells search engines not to transmit link juice. They’re more of a tip of the hat than an affirmation. Example: You drop your website URL in the comments on a popular blog. The majority of websites do not bother to mark these links as no-follow in order to avoid being spammed. The SEO Effect Of Both Kinds. 1. Do-Follow Links: It is an effective ranking factor: Do-follow links are the easiest way to rank higher in your search results because they pass authority and trust. Faster Crawling: These links let the crawlers find your pages faster. Domain Authority Boost: Getting do-follow links from high-authority sites can really increase your domain authority (DA). 2. No-Follow Links: Referral Traffic: While no-follow links don’t provide link juice, they can bring you tons of referral traffic when embedded on popular sites. Brand Awareness: Getting mentioned on the right sites (even if it is just a no-follow link) will make your brand more trusted. Diversity of Backlink Profile: Do follow links and no follow links are both part of a healthy backlink profile. If there are too many do-follow links, it can seem cheesy to search engines. Natural vs. Artificial Links What Are Natural Links? Natural links are the best of all backlinks. They are links you’re paid for automatically when someone likes your content and decides to share it without you asking. For Example: An author of healthy recipes could link to your article about the health benefits of quinoa. They do this because you actually have some worth to their post. Why Natural Links Matter SEO Gold Standard: Natural links are valued by search engines as they indicate authenticity and reliability. Zero Penalty: Natural links don’t break Google’s policy since they come from natural sources. Traffic: Natural Links from Popular websites will get a lot of referral traffic. How to Encourage Natural Links Write Great Content: Great, shareable content is the foundation of natural link-building. Think deep dives, demos, and eye-catching infographics. Be in the Community: Join your community in forums, social media, and collaborations. The more prominent you are, the more naturally linked you will be. Provide Extra Special Metrics: Provide unique information, studies, or resources that others can’t resist linking to. What Are Artificial Links? Artificial links are link creation manually created for the purposes of SEO. Some of them (like reciprocal links) are fine, but other things will make you the next target of search engines. Examples of Artificial Links: Directory Submissions: Listing your website on web directories. Paid Links: You are not allowed to pay for backlinks, which is illegal (in Google's eyes). Reciprocal links: Reciprocal links are when two websites agree to link to each other. For example, one website links to another, and the second website links back. It's a way to help both sites get more visitors and improve their search engine rankings. Risks of Artificial Link-Building Practices Artificial links might be instantaneous, but they are dangerous if used wrong: Google Penalties Google’s algorithms, such as Penguin, target and punish manipulative link building. A penalty will get you knocked down rankings or out of search results. For Example One little e-commerce site paid for hundreds of backlinks from irrelevant, spammy sites. Within weeks, they lost their search engine rankings in a Google penalty. 1. Loss of Credibility: The reputation of your brand could suffer if the users or industry professionals learn of poor link-building techniques. 2. Wasted Resources: Artificial links cost money and time. But if those links aren’t great or they’re spammy, then your work is wasted. The Score: A Balanced Backlink Profile A good backlink strategy is a combination of natural and artificial links, but not all links count. The way to keep your backlink profile fresh and clean here: Relevance Matters: Obtain links from pages related to your niche. : It’s better to have one backlink from a trustworthy and relevant website than dozens from irrelevant ones. Monitor Your Backlinks On A Regular Basis: Use backlink tracking software, such as Ahrefs, Moz, or SEMrush. Identify and eliminate any negative links that can damage your SEO. Diversify Link Types: Don’t get caught up in one type of link. Do-follow/No-follow, natural/advertised links make a more organic profile. Knowing what kinds of backlinks you should create and what SEO affects these backlinks is very important for a successful link-building campaign. The key to do-follow, no-follow link use, or whether you're linking to sites artificially, according to Google’s policy, is balance and truth. Just remember: Backlinks are not just statistics. Every link tells a story about your website’s worth, authority, and value. Get links that actually help your brand reputation, and the SEO will come. Understanding Backlink Quality It is not all backlinks are created equal. Some will make your website’s SEO skyrocket, but some will bring it way down faster than you can say \"Google penalty.\" Let’s dive into the quality of backlinks and why they’re better than the others. Quality Backlinks Think of these as the backlink-lovers of the web. Good backlinks are from quality, legitimate, relevant websites. They’re more like an earful from someone you know in your field. For instance, a backlink from Forbes or the New York Times not only increases your trust but also sends signals of trust to search engines. Research has revealed that pages that have backlinks from authoritative websites are ranked far better on Google. Ahrefs says that 90% of pages never receive any organic traffic, and it’s usually because they aren’t getting the proper backlinks. Bad Backlinks Secondly, Bad Backlinks are like those inbox spammers, annoying and even harmful. They are links from random, low-ranked, or spammy websites. Think of clicks from arbitrary directories or amateur websites with no real function. Worse, if you have too many of these on your website, Google’s algorithm could detect that as an attempt to cheat rankings. The result? The rankings for your site may go crashing, and you may even get penalized. Buying backlinks or link scams may look like an easy fix, but trust me, Google penalties are real. In 2012, Google’s Penguin update hit SEO and black hat backlinking practices. Scores of websites fell rank in an hour, and it took months for them to come back. So stick to the plan and get links as they come. What Makes a Backlink High-Quality? If you want to make sure you’re producing the right kind of backlinks, consider the following characteristics: Relevance: Your industry/node should be of the linking site. Authority: Very strong domain authority suggests trust. Natural Positioning: Links should be embedded naturally in the article. Diversification: An assortment of backlinks profiles with a variety of links from various sources is best. Simply put, if you want quality backlinks, then never have too many. Be more involved with good sites and write articles that will get you links. Long game, but the end result is well worth it. What Do Backlinks Do To SEO Rankings? Link Building: Yes, it's one of the major factors in ranking your website. But why do they work so well? Your website is about gaining authority, value, and readability from the search engines. Let’s break it down. Domain Authority and Trust Flow Think of search engines as the talent show judges. Backlinks are like the words of the professionals: \"This site has got it!\" — Good-quality backlinks boost your site’s domain authority (DA) and trust flow (two of the key ranking factors for search engines). According to research conducted by SEMrush, domain authority is one of the most stable-run drivers. The more reliable your backlinks are, the more search engines are going to believe you’re a credible site, which can push you up the SERPs. Relevance Criteria Not all endorsements are equal. For backlinks, relevance is king. Links from niche websites do much more than general or irrelevant websites. If you have a fitness blog, for example, then an organic backlink to a health website is SEO-heavy compared to a random travel site backlink. Why? Search engines prioritize context for the best relevant results for the user. Relevant backlinks, basically, are recommendations curated for your article. Anchor Text Knowledge Anchor text is the link-type text that you click on in a link; it’s a quiet SEO tool. Descriptive anchor text signals to search engines and describes the content of the page linked. For instance, if a gym website opens your page with the link \"best home workout tips,\" then search engines know that your page is about home workouts. But anchor text is absolutely essential naturally. If you optimize too much, for example, by adding keywords in the anchor text, you’ll get penalized. According to Ahrefs, profiles with more variety and natural anchor text equate to stronger backlink profiles and rankings. Confluence of Elements: If these three factors (authority, relevancy, anchor text) are put together, it can make a giant difference in rankings. And backlinks are basically just saying, \"This is valuable, legitimate, and related.\" The result? More exposure, organic traffic, and digital presence. In short, backlinks are the bedrock of SEO success. You can make full use of quality, relevancy, anchor text, and all of them to swoop up the rankings. So now go out there and make those connections well! Factors Of Good Quality Backlinks Backlinks are your website’s endorsement in SEO. But all endorsements are not created equal — some are far more important than others. The formula for an effective backlink profile is about high-quality backlinks. These links can make a huge difference in terms of your site’s reach, authority, and rankings. But what is a \"quality\" backlink? Let’s break it down. 1. Connection to Your Niche/Business (If Any) The most important quality of the best backlink is relevance. In SEO, relevance is king. You can’t get a backlink from a site that’s not related to yours for the same amount of money. Why Relevance Matters Search engines like Google put the user first. If a backlink comes from a site with a good fit with your niche, this will tell Google that the link is organic and that your post is of interest in that space. Example: Quality Link: Backlink to your fitness blog from an authority health and wellness website. Vacuous Link: A link to your fitness blog from some random car blog. How to Ensure Relevance To get the best backlinks, look for websites that are specific to your industry. Go through and check out blogs, forums, or directories that are relevant to your niche or industry. You can also team up with industry professionals, write guest posts for relevant blogs, or connect with influencers in your field. An Ahrefs study shows that relevance is the number one factor when it comes to backlink value. Source 2. Credibility and Strength of Linking Domain - Authority and Trustworthiness. Suppose you get an Oprah endorsement, and your neighbor doesn’t. Both are lovely, but Oprah’s has far more weight. This goes with backlinks, too: high-authority, high-trust links make a lot more sense. What Is Domain Authority? Domain authority (DA) is the statistic Moz uses to evaluate the ranking of a site in search engines. And on a scale of 1 to 100. The higher DA the more SEO juice that gets sent back via the links. Examples of High-Authority Sites: • News websites such as BBC, Forbes, or The New York Times. • The biggest industry blogs, for example, Healthline for medical topics or TechCrunch for technology. Trustworthiness Matters Inbound links from spammy or shady websites will hurt rather than help your SEO. Google’s algorithms aren’t supposed to reward cheating link building, so get links from credible places. How to Identify Trustworthy Domains: Determine their Domain Authority (DA) or Domain Rating (DR) with a site like Ahrefs, Moz, or SEMrush. Check their content, traffic, and industry fit. Don’t go to sites that have a lot of ads, are not well-designed, or have poor content. 3 . Links in Content vs Footer Links Contextual Links vs Footer Links Position In Content: Where your backlink is placed on a page matters as much as the page itself, it’s a fact that search engines like contextual links — those in the body of an article — way more than links in the footer or sidebar. What Are Contextual Links? Contextual links are hyperlinks in the body of the page. They are also highlighted with content around them and will be more likely clicked and trusted by the user. Example: Link-to-Context: Link to your \"Top 10 Marketing Strategies\" post in a marketing tactics paragraph. Footer Link: The same link you can hide in the site's footer among other dozen links. Why Placement Matters Better Click-Through Rates: Contextual links are seen and clicked by users. Stronger SEO Signals: Links in content of interest weigh more because they are deemed natural. User Experience Enhancement: Contextual links improve the reader experience by providing more pertinent information. Tip: Always try to have the backlinks buried naturally in the body of quality, targeted content. Don’t over-rely on footer/sidebar links, which look spammy. 4. Diversity of Linking Domains Diversification is another sign of a good backlink profile. The page with links coming from a variety of domains is likely to rank higher than one with only some sources of links. Why Diversity Is Crucial Google traces natural patterns in your backlink profile. If all your backlinks come from the same few sites, it will seem like spam. A varied backlink profile, however, also tells them that your material is of value across platforms. What Does Diversity Look Like? Domain Types: Backlinks from blogs, news portals, forums, directories, and social networks. Domain Authority diversity: Various links coming from top authority and mid-ranking sites make for a natural profile. Geographic Diversification: Links to sites outside your country will be an addition to your SEO efforts abroad if you have an international business. Example: Say you’re an e-commerce company and you sell eco-friendly items. A diversified backlink profile could be something like: An entry on an environmental blog about your sustainability project. An email from an environmentally friendly store in a local business directory. An affiliate link from an international media company mentioning your brand in a green project article. How to Get Great Backlinks for Your Website Link building is a bit of a treasure hunt: it takes planning, work, and maybe a little bit of magic. Let’s take a look at some ways to get some good quality backlinks for SEO benefit. Natural Link Building: Great content creates backlinks of its own and this is the most natural and long-term link profile builder. And if your writing is relevant, interesting, and useful, then other people will link back to it. Evergreen pieces such as \"how-to\" tutorials, industry white papers, and infographics for instance, can garner more links because they’re valuable and shareable. Did you know 91% of content receives no Google Traffic at all? And that’s because it’s not special. Make your content distinctive by solving a problem, by adding something new, or by offering practical advice — and the backlinks will come. Outreach like an Expert: Every once in a while, you have to go the extra mile and request backlinks. It is by contacting bloggers, influencers, and leaders who may have an interest in your content. The more personal the email, the better the relationships and link-building will be. It all boils down to being curious about what they’re producing and why you are a good fit for them. Tip: Share information or takeaways from their work in your posts to get a link. Outreach is a skill, and, done well, it can be fantastic. The Force of Guest Blogging: Guest blogging is still a forceful technique for building backlinks. You create backlinks, but you also become a master expert when you post your knowledge on good sites. For instance, if you are a digital marketer, then investing in something like HubSpot or Moz will really make you look credible. Guest posts have to be great, valuable content that is worth the audience’s time (not a place for self-promotion). According to SEMrush, guest post backlinks generally provide steady referral traffic and build domain authority over time. Use Broken Links: Broken Link building is like looking for gold under the bed. It’s about spotting the broken links on other websites and replacing them with your content. Whether it is Ahrefs or SEMrush that can point you in the right direction. So, for example, if one of the popular blogs in your field links to an outdated resource, message the webmaster and offer your content instead. This not only gets you a backlink but also gives the website owner the benefit of a high-quality user experience. Participate in Industry Forums and Communities: Involvement in forums and community forums can also create backlinks. By giving valuable feedback and, if it’s applicable,, linking to your content, you will get backlinks naturally. Just make sure to keep your contributions constructive and not too salty, or you will be marked as spam. All in all, building backlinks takes some creativity, work, and thinking. Natural link building, outreach, guest blogging, broken link replacement, the most important thing is quality and not quantity. Always keep in mind that each backlink is a stage on your SEO treasure hunt, so take your time and be perseverant. Final Thought Having a decent backlink profile is not a numbers chase. It’s about securing quality testimonials that increase the trust, exposure, and authority of your website. With relevancy, authority, placement, and diversity, we can help you develop a long-term plan to move your site up the SERPs — one quality backlink at a time.

They are your website’s \"references\" at the Google grad school. In the same way, rave reviews get you the job of your dreams, and the right backlinks take your site to the top of the search results pages (SERPs). According to a report by Backlinko, linking domains to a page is one of the most powerful ranking signals in Google’s algorithm. 3.8 times more likely to reach the first page on Google when you have a good backlink profile. It shows how powerful backlinks are to SEO rankings and website performance. In this article, we will explain why backlinks are essential for SEO success and how they can take your website to page-one status. Well, now let’s get down to business with the backlinks and how they can change your online identity. Why Do Backlinks Matter? Backlinks aren’t just hyperlinks linking you to another site. Understanding the importance of backlinks is key to improving your website's visibility and authority. Authority Building Backlinks are like testimonials for your website. Links from quality, authoritative sites show search engines that you are an authority. Let’s say you were mentioned by a top authority in your field, and that’s what a good backlink does for your site. Such testimonials are taken into consideration by search engines like Google, which consider your domain authority, which determines your rank opportunities. The more authority you have, the higher up your website will appear on the SERPs. Enhanced Rankings A well-built backlink profile can make a major difference in your search engine rank. The 3 ranking factors Google considers most important are backlinks, content, and RankBrain. Without them, even optimized content will be unable to appear. Quality backlinks show the search engines that your content is valuable, thus ranking it higher and faster than your competitors. Increased Visibility Backlinks not only get your content found by search engines but also help users discover your site. The more links you have from trusted sites, the bigger your audience. Imagine your website getting picked up on a popular blog post or newspaper article. These backlinks are like digital waymarkers – they guide visitors to your content and also promote your brand. Traffic Magnet Besides rank, backlinks drive a lot of referral traffic. Referral traffic is different than organic search traffic as it comes directly from visitors who click on links to your website from other websites. These are very specialized types of traffic as the user is coming from a related content or industry. So, for instance, if a top tech blog mentions your software review, then you are bound to get people with an interest in your field. The result? More traffic, conversions, and (hopefully) customers. 😂 Improved Content Discoverability Backlinks are paths search engines use to crawl your pages. It’s like a treasure hunt with no map when you don’t have backlinks for your site. Backlinks also help your content get indexed faster and better so that it can be found by users who are looking for it. Backlinks increase authority, rank, visibility, and targeted traffic on your site in general. They’re the lifeblood of an SEO strategy. To make them go to full capacity, ensure that you get quality, relevant backlinks that match your niche and add value to your followers. Different Kinds of Backlinks: Strategies For SEO Profitability. Backlinks are more than mere links; they are technical, subtle, and crucial to your website’s SEO. However, not all backlinks are created equal. To really get the most out of them, you must know what type of backlinks are, what effects they have, and how to use them efficiently. Let’s see the two most common types: Do-follow vs. No-follow and Natural vs. Artificial links. Do-Follow vs. No-Follow Links What Are Do-Follow Links? A do-follow link is your ally in backlink life. The majority of links are do-follow unless otherwise specified. If someone does do-follow (a website links to you from their site), it’s like, \"Hey, this content is good, give credit!\" To search engines. For Example: Suppose that you get a mention in an industry blog on \"The Best Marketing Tools for 2024\" and that the do-follow link is your blog. That link distributes \"link juice,\" or we can say that it benefits your site by increasing its authority and, if not, its SERPs. Link juice is a term used in SEO to describe authority passed from one webpage to another through links. When a high-quality webpage links to another page, it shares some of its authority, helping the linked page rank better in search results. Link Juice What Are No-Follow Links? No-follow links, meanwhile, have an HTML attribute ( rel=\"nofollow\") that tells search engines not to transmit link juice. They’re more of a tip of the hat than an affirmation. Example: You drop your website URL in the comments on a popular blog. The majority of websites do not bother to mark these links as no-follow in order to avoid being spammed. The SEO Effect Of Both Kinds. 1. Do-Follow Links: It is an effective ranking factor: Do-follow links are the easiest way to rank higher in your search results because they pass authority and trust. Faster Crawling: These links let the crawlers find your pages faster. Domain Authority Boost: Getting do-follow links from high-authority sites can really increase your domain authority (DA). 2. No-Follow Links: Referral Traffic: While no-follow links don’t provide link juice, they can bring you tons of referral traffic when embedded on popular sites. Brand Awareness: Getting mentioned on the right sites (even if it is just a no-follow link) will make your brand more trusted. Diversity of Backlink Profile: Do follow links and no follow links are both part of a healthy backlink profile. If there are too many do-follow links, it can seem cheesy to search engines. Natural vs. Artificial Links What Are Natural Links? Natural links are the best of all backlinks. They are links you’re paid for automatically when someone likes your content and decides to share it without you asking. For Example: An author of healthy recipes could link to your article about the health benefits of quinoa. They do this because you actually have some worth to their post. Why Natural Links Matter SEO Gold Standard: Natural links are valued by search engines as they indicate authenticity and reliability. Zero Penalty: Natural links don’t break Google’s policy since they come from natural sources. Traffic: Natural Links from Popular websites will get a lot of referral traffic. How to Encourage Natural Links Write Great Content: Great, shareable content is the foundation of natural link-building. Think deep dives, demos, and eye-catching infographics. Be in the Community: Join your community in forums, social media, and collaborations. The more prominent you are, the more naturally linked you will be. Provide Extra Special Metrics: Provide unique information, studies, or resources that others can’t resist linking to. What Are Artificial Links? Artificial links are link creation manually created for the purposes of SEO. Some of them (like reciprocal links) are fine, but other things will make you the next target of search engines. Examples of Artificial Links: Directory Submissions: Listing your website on web directories. Paid Links: You are not allowed to pay for backlinks, which is illegal (in Google's eyes). Reciprocal links: Reciprocal links are when two websites agree to link to each other. For example, one website links to another, and the second website links back. It's a way to help both sites get more visitors and improve their search engine rankings. Risks of Artificial Link-Building Practices Artificial links might be instantaneous, but they are dangerous if used wrong: Google Penalties Google’s algorithms, such as Penguin, target and punish manipulative link building. A penalty will get you knocked down rankings or out of search results. For Example One little e-commerce site paid for hundreds of backlinks from irrelevant, spammy sites. Within weeks, they lost their search engine rankings in a Google penalty. 1. Loss of Credibility: The reputation of your brand could suffer if the users or industry professionals learn of poor link-building techniques. 2.

The page with links coming from a variety of domains is likely to rank higher than one with only some sources of links. Why Diversity Is Crucial Google traces natural patterns in your backlink profile. If all your backlinks come from the same few sites, it will seem like spam. A varied backlink profile, however, also tells them that your material is of value across platforms. What Does Diversity Look Like? Domain Types: Backlinks from blogs, news portals, forums, directories, and social networks. Domain Authority diversity: Various links coming from top authority and mid-ranking sites make for a natural profile. Geographic Diversification: Links to sites outside your country will be an addition to your SEO efforts abroad if you have an international business. Example: Say you’re an e-commerce company and you sell eco-friendly items. A diversified backlink profile could be something like: An entry on an environmental blog about your sustainability project. An email from an environmentally friendly store in a local business directory. An affiliate link from an international media company mentioning your brand in a green project article. How to Get Great Backlinks for Your Website Link building is a bit of a treasure hunt: it takes planning, work, and maybe a little bit of magic. Let’s take a look at some ways to get some good quality backlinks for SEO benefit. Natural Link Building: Great content creates backlinks of its own and this is the most natural and long-term link profile builder. And if your writing is relevant, interesting, and useful, then other people will link back to it. Evergreen pieces such as \"how-to\" tutorials, industry white papers, and infographics for instance, can garner more links because they’re valuable and shareable. Did you know 91% of content receives no Google Traffic at all? And that’s because it’s not special. Make your content distinctive by solving a problem, by adding something new, or by offering practical advice — and the backlinks will come. Outreach like an Expert: Every once in a while, you have to go the extra mile and request backlinks. It is by contacting bloggers, influencers, and leaders who may have an interest in your content. The more personal the email, the better the relationships and link-building will be. It all boils down to being curious about what they’re producing and why you are a good fit for them. Tip: Share information or takeaways from their work in your posts to get a link. Outreach is a skill, and, done well, it can be fantastic. The Force of Guest Blogging: Guest blogging is still a forceful technique for building backlinks. You create backlinks, but you also become a master expert when you post your knowledge on good sites. For instance, if you are a digital marketer, then investing in something like HubSpot or Moz will really make you look credible. Guest posts have to be great, valuable content that is worth the audience’s time (not a place for self-promotion). According to SEMrush, guest post backlinks generally provide steady referral traffic and build domain authority over time. Use Broken Links: Broken Link building is like looking for gold under the bed. It’s about spotting the broken links on other websites and replacing them with your content. Whether it is Ahrefs or SEMrush that can point you in the right direction. So, for example, if one of the popular blogs in your field links to an outdated resource, message the webmaster and offer your content instead. This not only gets you a backlink but also gives the website owner the benefit of a high-quality user experience. Participate in Industry Forums and Communities: Involvement in forums and community forums can also create backlinks. By giving valuable feedback and, if it’s applicable,, linking to your content, you will get backlinks naturally. Just make sure to keep your contributions constructive and not too salty, or you will be marked as spam. All in all, building backlinks takes some creativity, work, and thinking. Natural link building, outreach, guest blogging, broken link replacement, the most important thing is quality and not quantity. Always keep in mind that each backlink is a stage on your SEO treasure hunt, so take your time and be perseverant. Final Thought Having a decent backlink profile is not a numbers chase. It’s about securing quality testimonials that increase the trust, exposure, and authority of your website. With relevancy, authority, placement, and diversity, we can help you develop a long-term plan to move your site up the SERPs — one quality backlink at a time.

Doing this has led me to learn a lot of things about: Leadership, Making managerial-level decisions SEO, in its entirity. Wordpress Building and managing a community Marketing Project management and a host of other things. Today, however, I want to share about a part of SEO that, although it is something I already knew, I feel like I have struck goldmine with! What Are Backlinks? Backlinks, also known as inbound or incoming links, are hyperlinks from external domains that point to pages on your website. They are a component of off-page SEO, serving as signals of trust and authority to search engine algorithms. High-quality backlinks from authoritative and relevant websites can enhance your site's domain authority, improve its search engine rankings, and increase organic traffic by influencing factors like PageRank and anchor text relevance. I asked chatGPT to give me two definitions of backlinks to aid understanding, and this is what I got. Why Are Backlinks Important For SEO? Improved Rankings: Search engines like Google view backlinks as votes of confidence. The more high-quality backlinks a site has, the higher it is likely to rank in search results. Increased Visibility: Backlinks help search engines discover your site faster and index it. When reputable sites link to you, it improves your website's chances of appearing in relevant searches. Referral Traffic: Backlinks can bring visitors directly to your site from the linking website, especially if the link is on a high-traffic page. Authority Building: When authoritative and relevant websites link to your content, it signals to search engines that your site is credible and valuable. Enhanced Brand Reputation: Backlinks from trusted sources boost your brand’s visibility and reputation in your industry or niche. Backlink Strategies For Your SEO Ideally, these backlink strategies ought to help you build out the online presence of your blog or page: Define Your Goals Research Your Competitors Create Link-Worthy Content Leverage Outreach Utilize Broken Link Building Get Listed in Directories Repurpose Content Engage in Community Participation Monitor Your Backlinks Focus on Consistency While these strategies are good and have proven very valuable to me and a lot of teams out there, I will be sharing my eureka discovery about backlinks shortly. The Best Backlink Strategy For Blogs and SEO In my experience with SEO and building out THDG, I have seen that the best way to add (credible?) backlinks to your website is by adding your links to your Dev Community (dev.to) posts. This can come in the way of cross-posting, or just handling your entire blog here but inputting the link(s) to your product in your blogposts. Why This Backlink Strategy Is The Best I didn't know until I went on my Google Search Console account for THDG and discovered the \"Links\" tab did I know the full weight of my backlinks. The thing with posting content on dev.to, especially developer/coding content, is that your content is going to be picked up by a lot of blogs. These blogs (I don't know how they do it) seem to feed Devto posts directly to their blogs or repost them, especially if they fall under a specific language. From this image, you can see that my blog has been reposted a staggering 1612 times without any effort of ours. You can also see that the most reposted content is the start of our Devtools series on THDG: Devtools Startup Ideas: Building an AI-Powered Debugging Assistant With Code Samples!! When I first saw this, I thought to myself, \"no womder my content has been ranking higher on Google's SERPs.\" Whether you set your original blog link as the canonical link for your devto posts or you (like I am doing in this post) distribute your blog link generously through the post, these devto affiliate blogs will pick up your content; repost it, and build your site's credibility. This image shows that so far, 40 different sites (including devto) have referenced my blog posts. It also shows how many times they've been referenced. Trust me, this is not promotional content for Devto 😅😅 But I just love this platform so much; it keeps getting better and better!! ❤️ In case you missed the dozen or so links I have scattered across this post, check out my blog on The Handy Developers' Guide.

For example, if Site A links to Site B and both sites have great, unique and relevant content, then Site B may rank higher in Google’s index than Sites C and D which don’t have any links pointing at them from high-quality sites like Site A.

For example, if Site A links to Site B and both sites have great, unique and relevant content, then Site B may rank higher in Google’s index than Sites C and D which don’t have any links pointing at them from high-quality sites like Site A. Google (and other search engines) use backlinks as a signal of content quality. Read more about backlinks here: https://direction.com/backlinks-101/ Was this article helpful?

Why is Link Building Important for SEO? How to Build Links? How to Analyze a Site? Link Building Strategies That Work Tools that Help in Link Building Link Building: A Case Study From Stan Ventures Link Building Tactics You Should Avoid Backlinks are a must-have to improve your online visibility, drive more web traffic and position your website at the top of search engine results. In short, backlinks come in handy when you want to increase the authority of your website in the eyes of search engine giants like Google. Search engines discover new content via links and also leverage them as a parameter to determine the content quality. So, how does that work? Google considers a high-quality contextual backlink as a vote of confidence that testifies how worthy the content is. That said, it isn’t a surprise that link building remains one of the crucial search engine ranking factors. A targeted strategy often makes things easier and link building is no exception. Yes, it doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or a pro, you need a definitive link building strategy in place to achieve significant results. If not, your link-building efforts may end up a disaster. Worry not! If you understand the what, why, how, dos and don’ts of link building, it isn’t tough to crack the hard nut. Let me walk you through link building and its aspects one step at a time. What is Link Building? Professional link building is the practice of gaining links from one or more websites to your own. These links help users navigate from one web page to the other to access more information relevant to their search on the internet. As for search engines, links make way for the bots to crawl, index, and rank web pages. Why is Link Building Important for SEO? Link building is one of the most powerful ways to get high-authority, niche-specific websites to vouch for your site. With an effective link acquisition strategy, you can build a bold and illustrative backlink profile. Based on the robustness of the link profile you create, your website can enamor Google’s algorithm and achieve higher rankings. Link building, despite all the rumor-mongering happening, is something you cannot overlook when optimizing your website for SEO. Spoiler Alert: Building a healthy link profile doesn’t happen overnight. White hat link building for SEO takes time, but it is always worth it. When you put in targeted and genuine efforts toward link building, it gets paid off with long-lasting results. That’s the gist of it. The concept of links is cardinal to how Google search works. Its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin came up with the beautiful concept of PageRank. PageRank algorithm helps Google identify new pages and rank them based on quality signals. So, what this means is that Google’s core algorithm weighs backlinks as one of the top-ranking factors, and ignoring it could bring a website’s growth to a standstill. How to Build Links? Now that you know how link building can complement your website’s SEO, it’s time to learn how to build links. So, let’s delve into it. Broadly speaking, link building happens in three ways: 1. Requesting for Links Do you want to link back to your website from a specific website? The best thing to do is request the website owner for a backlink. However, you need to make sure that linking back to the website fetches you benefits in terms of web traffic and authority. Here’s what you need to remember. The website has to be related to your industry/niche. The website should be credible and exhibit great performance. Craft a genuinely compelling email pitch to convenience the website owner to accept a backlink placement to your website. 2. Earning Links Earning links is when other website owners link back to your website without you contacting them regarding backlinks. This often happens when you feature high-quality, user-engaging content on your website that your target audience and industry experts find useful. As per Google Webmaster Guidelines, “Creating good content pays off: Links are usually editorial votes given by choice, and the more useful content you have, the greater the chances someone else will find that content valuable to their readers and link to it.” Earning backlinks to your website is the biggest reward and a clear sign that your link-building efforts are actually working. 3. Buying Links Buying links is yet another way to secure link placements in top-performing sites. When it comes to buying backlinks, you need to be quite choosy about the sites you pick as you are investing some money to make more of it. Make sure you follow a metric-specific approach to narrow down top sites from your niche to build backlinks. Once that’s done, get in touch with the website owner with a well-crafted email to gain backlink placements on a commercial basis. If you find the process time-consuming, you can avail the assistance of a trusted link-building service provider to purchase links from relevant sites on your behalf. Key Elements to Evaluate Link Prospects Before thinking about how to find backlink placements, you need to narrow down sites that suit your link building needs. That’s why you should consider the following elements related to host sites when you invest in link building for SEO. Content: Written and visual content for blogs, web pages, etc. Admin: Do they have advertising policies in place? Link Profile: What do the links pointing to the site look like? Reputation: Does the author have any reputation? Authorship: Who is responsible for the website content? Technical: How do users find and engage with the site? In addition to these metrics, you need to conduct your own manual research and backlink quality analysis to get an even deeper understanding of your link-building prospects. Metric Vs. Quality Understanding metrics and quality can help you set up link-building success. Certain metrics from top SEO tools can help evaluate a site for link-building prospects much easier. They are: Ahrefs Domain Rating. Moz Page Authority. Moz Domain Authority. Moz Page Authority. Majestic Trust Flow. Majestic Citation Flow. Majestic Trust Flow. SEMrushAuthority Score. Verve Link Score. In addition to these metrics, you need to conduct your own manual research to get an even deeper understanding of your link-building prospects. Quality The search quality raters guidelines by Google have dedicated a section for Overall Page Quality Rating that you can follow as well. It can help you cover the purpose of the content, the depth of the content, and find out credible sources for the content. How to Analyze a Site? As you go through the evaluation process, there are two important things to keep in mind: Weight Each Element Some aspects of the site are more important than others. Examine multiple elements that decide the site quality Here are the key elements to consider during the assessment: Content Commercial links: Check if there are links to money pages. Find whether links are not tagged with no follow or sponsor Navigation: Is it too generic for the site? Restricted Keywords: Check if the site uses gambling, payday loan, or pornographic keywords Infrequency: Does the website post infrequently, or are the old posts rarely updated? Admin About Us: Find if the links point to money pages Admin Pages: Find pages that directly advertise dofollow links in guest posts and avoid them at all costs Info: Phone number, address, and email Link Profile Excess links: See if too many links are pointing to a single page Low Authority: Find the site’s Domain Authority and Domain Rating using SEO tools Non-relevant links: Discover if there are links that don’t make sense for the page Authorship Byline: Is the byline set to the site name or the admin? Author Page Info: Is the information about the author incomplete? Nationality: Is the author from your target country or not? If you are dealing with YMYL pages, you have to be more stringent about the author’s reputation. Reputation Online presence: Does the website has a good social media presence Followers: What type of accounts are following the brand Engagement: Does the page have enough engagement? Technical Indexed: Does the website exist in Google’s index with more than just the home page? Geo: What is the focus of the audience’s country? Page Engagement: Does the site have ads and links within pages? Link Building Strategies That Work The strategy you devise is the major driving factor behind your link-building outcomes. So, here is a look at the top white hat link building strategies you can harness to achieve desired results. 1. Ultimate Guides Ultimate Guides usually cover in-depth information about a specific topic and comprise several subheadings, illustrations, and super-long content. Since Ultimate Guides provide users access to massive information in one place, they can be a go-to choice to earn backlinks. 2. Listicles Listicles or list posts are posts that feature a numbered list of facts, techniques, tips, reasons and so much more. Packed in chunks, these posts contain information that delivers value to the users. After analyzing 1 million pieces of content, BuzzSumo has arrived at the conclusion that list posts generate far more backlinks than other forms of content, including infographics, quizzes, and more. 3. Resource Page Link Building So, what are Resource Pages? Resource Pages are pages that contain a curated list of resources that solely link back to informative content from multiple websites. The more the number of backlinks on a page, the more authoritative it is. Resource page link building is a practice where you link back to your website from a resource page. Your chances of gaining link placements in resource pages depend heavily on the quality of your content. You can find resource pages easily by using the following Google search strings. “Keyword” + inurl:links “Keyword” + “helpful resources” “Keyword” + “useful resources” “Keyword” + “useful links” Let’s say your niche is medicine. You can use medicine in the keyword field followed by one of the above Google search strings. Once you have the resource pages, you need to find out if a particular resource page is suitable for your link-building purposes. Not everyone has the same link-building needs. You can use metrics such as page authority, domain authority, the web traffic of the page/domain to decide if a given resource page is the right fit for you. This will give you the ideal site for your resource page link-building process. Look for content that is worth linking back to from the resource page. Finally, draft an email stating how your content can be a valuable addition to the resource page and ask the website owner to link back to your site. 4. Broken Link Building Broken link building is a unique link building strategy. While other link building strategies are about asking people for backlinks, broken link building makes way for you to help add value to somebody’s website. So, how to get backlinks using this strategy? The first step is to identify broken links in a website. Install either Check My Links or LinkMiner chrome extension. Not sure which website to check for broken links? Pick a page with more links. If there are many links, it’s likely that one or more of them are broken. That’s the idea. A resource page from your niche should be the best fit. After all, it is fully loaded with links. You can use the Chrome extension to weed out broken links in the page easily. Finally, send the website owner a mail highlighting the broken links that you identified and suggest replacing the link with yours. 5. Guest Blogging Guest blogging is never out of trend. It is, of course, one of the classic link building methods. Use a search string such as “write for us” + keyword to find blogs and websites that currently accept guest posts in your niche. Run through the search results and shortlist the ones that are right for you. Use the contact form or email address to initiate a formal conversation asking for a guest post opportunity with backlink placement. Unfortunately, guest post opportunities aren’t available just for you but also for your competitors. Make sure you stand out from the crowd every step of the way. Getting professional assistance from a trusted guest blogging service provider can take the burden off your shoulders and help you achieve desired results to outperform the other players in your industry. 6. Blogger Outreach Blogger outreach is one of the best strategies to build your backlink profile. You would have received outreach emails too. Doubt that? Check the spam folder of your mailbox. You will likely find at least a few outreach emails in there, only that they failed to grab your attention. If you’re wondering why these emails are dropped straight into the spam box, it’s because they may not be relevant to you. Suppose you run a website that specializes in e-commerce. An email targeting finance experts and investors is certainly not your cup of tea. That’s why your outreach campaigns should be targeting the right people. Your link success depends on it as well. In fact, outreach emails witness a response rate of only 10%, while the other 90% of them go unanswered. Having said that, if you want your outreach emails answered, you need to keep yourself updated about the latest outreach techniques and master them. Are you still using standard/traditional email templates for your outreach purposes? If your answer is yes, then it’s high time to break away. Let me tell you how to switch to non-conventional email outreach. Draft 100% personalized and original emails. Leverage your unique brand voice. Apart from increasing the response rate for your outreach campaigns, these emails also help you create a positive outlook toward your brand. So, who do you start with? Trustworthiness is the lifeline of blogger outreach. Start with people who trust you and are already aware of your business. They may include Your industry partners. People who have subscribed to your newsletter. People who have mentioned your links or brand name in their content. Bloggers/influencers who are connected with you on social media. Who else do you reach out to? Look for people who share something in common with you. For instance, you can reach out to bloggers who share a similar customer base. Link placement in niche-specific blogs can drive qualified leads and help you achieve more tractions for your business. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and others are also ideal to find people whose interests are similar to yours. Do you think outreach is eating up too much of your time? That’s why Stan Ventures shortlists sites based on 25+ link building metrics and offers a genuine blogger outreach service to help you earn high-quality backlinks seamlessly. 7. Unlinked Brand Mentions Every business gets its brand mentioned somewhere on the internet. These brand mentions need not necessarily be linked back to the corresponding website. Why not use your unlinked brand mentions to your link-building advantage? Yes, you can translate unlinked brand mentions to gain backlink placements across websites with minimal effort in the right direction. Use a brand monitoring tool like Semrush to keep track of your brand mentions across the internet. Once you find people who have mentioned your brand name in their web space, reach out to them and ask for backlink placements. However, you need to ensure that these links add value to the visitors of the corresponding domain. That way, the link juice is rightly passed on, having a positive impact on your website’s authority. 8. Podcast Links Links are everywhere. You just need to have a keen eye for them. What if I told you you could get backlinks without writing content or initiating outreach campaigns? It’s definitely possible. All it takes is one word: Podcasts. You just have to show up and talk about things you know and you get a link just like that. A podcast can be about anything, as long as it adds value to the listeners. Talk about something your target audience wants to learn and you get the job done without lifting your finger. 9. HARO Links HARO or Help A Reporter Out is an ideal place for you to connect with big shots from high authority, trusted websites. Once you sign up, you start receiving emails on a daily basis. Set a time frame, say, 30 to 45 minutes every day and look for queries within your expertise and respond to them. If your answer gets featured, you get a link placement on a high-authority website. It isn’t a sure-shot that your answers will be cited, but when it happens, the impact will be high. That’s how HARO links bolster your SEO efforts. 10. Infographic & Image Link Building Visual assets such as infographics, images, and diagrams make way for seamless link building. They present huge chunks of information in a comprehensive way. Users are fond of visual assets as well. So, how do infographics and images simplify link building? Let’s say you include a graph or chart on one of your web pages. Every time someone shares the graph, you automatically get a link from their website to your own. From this standpoint, visual assets hold greater good for link building than text-based content. 11. Getting competitor’s links using tools like AHREFs Link Intersect feature Did you know your competitors can help you strengthen your backlink profile? Here’s how: If a website links back to one or more of your competitors, chances are they can link back to your site. So, how do you find these sites that link back to your competitors? Ahrefs Link Intersect tool can simplify the process for you. Enter a few of your major competitors in the tool. Choose “all of the below targets” -> Show link opportunities. You will see a list of websites that all of them link back to. Check them out to find the best fit for building links. Make sure you pick sites where your potential prospects are likely to hang out. That’s precisely where you should establish your presence. Is that it? Not yet. I’ll tell you another way to refine your search for domains that link back to your competitors. Link Intersect -> Enter domains -> Click “any of the below targets” -> Show link opportunities. Now, you will get more results based on the number of intersects. Shortlist the websites you are going to contact for link-building opportunities. 12. Content Promotion Creating link-worthy content is important. However, you cannot stop there, especially if your aim is to create a great link profile. People should be able to discover your web pages in order to link back to them. That’s exactly why content promotion is mandatory. So, how do you promote your content? Advertising Outreach Communities/ Forums Advertising Invest in platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and others to improve the visibility of your content. The more the visibility, the greater the chances of someone showing interest to link back to your content. Well-written content can fetch you multiple backlinks in the long run. Investing a small sum of money to advertise your content isn’t a problem when it can fetch you more links and grow your business, right? Outreach Advertising is, of course, a good way to promote your content. Even so, reaching out to people with an email pitch makes the process sound more formal. Also, when it comes to content promotion via outreach, you add more value to the recipients of your mail and their target audience (who are your prospects too). If you can convince the website owners that linking back to your content fetches mutual benefits, it is a win-win scenario. Communities/ Forums You have niche-specific forum sites where you can promote your content among your target audience. Social media groups and communities are also good places for content promotion. However, it isn’t as easy as joining a forum and dropping your content links just like that. You need to become an active member and take part in discussions that happen there. Once you have built a reputation for yourself among the forum members, you can post your content in the community. If the audiences find the content good enough, they will link back to it. Remember, you must not post links in the group every time you publish new content. Doing it frequently can annoy people and they might not check out your content at all. Make your moves wisely when promoting your content across communities. 13. Reverse Image Search Is someone using your visual asset without your knowledge? Don’t worry. I look at it as an opportunity rather than a problem. What if you can use the scenario to build a backlink while fixing the copyright breach? Reverse image search is the key. Reverse image search refers to the practice of searching for all indexed URLs across the internet containing the same or similar image. You can perform a reverse image search using Google Images or Bing Images. Alternatively, you can do it directly from Chrome. So, how do you harness reverse image search to build backlinks? Most website owners do not want to remove copied images because it delivers value to their users. That said, it is a cakewalk to secure a backlink from their website through the image. All you have to do is send them a friendly email asking for a backlink in return. 14. Skyscraper Technique Have you ever thought about creating something better than the top-performing content in your niche? That’s the root of the skyscraper technique. This technique emphasizes improvising on the top-performing content with a great number of backlinks. You do that to steal your competitor’s backlinks so that you can drive more traffic to your website and skyrocket your search engine ranking, all by creating a more enhanced version of the existing content. The first step is to identify the best-performing content loaded with backlinks. Perform a Google search with a broad keyword for top-ranked content and analyze it for backlinks using tools like Ahrefs. The next thing is to create an improved version of the content. Here’s what you should do. Increase the length of the content Add updated information and relevant images Implement a simple and appealing design Provide in-depth information about the topic Once you have created your version of the content, it’s time for email outreach. Now, let’s do some smart work. Instead of reaching out to random bloggers, contact people who have already linked to the content. As they’ve linked to similar content, the chances of them linking to your content are high. That’s the idea. 15. Internal Linking Strategy Link building isn’t just about linking from or to other sites. It is also about linking pages within your website. So, why is internal link building crucial? Your visitors are your top priority. A bad user experience can drive them away as soon as they come in. This includes increased bounce rate and a higher bounce rate, which are a threat to your website’s SEO. The smoother the user experience, the longer the time they spend on your website. With channelized internal link building, you help your visitors navigate across your web pages seamlessly while offering a promising user experience. Your users aren’t the only ones navigating across your site. Search engine spiders do the same and when you link internal pages, you make way for them to understand the context better and rank pages higher. The more the internal links directing to a particular web page, the more important the page is in the eyes of the search engine bots.

Jason, the founder of Kitchenroom, wanted more prospects across Oxfordshire to contact him and also needed to rank on top of the search. Our SEOs rolled up their sleeves to figure out the challenges we will meet going forward. The major challenge we faced was that some of the client’s competitors had a robust online presence with 10x more referring domains compared to Kitchenroom. On the other hand, Kitchenroom was lagging behind in terms of authority due to fewer backlinks. After a thorough competitor analysis, we found that even though the competitors leveraged backlinks to stay at the top of the search, those links lacked authority. And that was our trump card. We figured out that building high-quality backlinks through genuine blogger outreach will help the client’s website rank higher. Proceeding further, our outreach experts started contacting niche-specific bloggers to ensure link placements for Kitchenroom on relevant sites. Once the sites were narrowed down and approved by Jason, our native content writers produced content with the anchor text placed naturally. We shared the content with the bloggers and received the live link shortly. Within two weeks, Jason started receiving more calls while the original traffic was going up. The keywords we wanted Kitchenroom to rank for were in the top 3 positions and the overall traffic of the site increased by 79%. Here’s a look at the numbers. Traffic – 387 +40% Keywords – 111 +107% Traffic Value – $739 +3X Link Building Tactics You Should Avoid It isn’t always about knowing the dos. You also need to know the don’ts so that you dodge or unlearn them in time. This holds true for link building as well. Let me pinpoint some black hat practices you should avoid in the course of your link-building journey. Paying for Links Paid link building manipulates search engine algorithms and is clearly a violation of Google’s webmaster guidelines. So, you may end up with a penalty and that’s very risky. A majority of paid links come from sites with a lot of outbound links and are naturally of low quality. Again, low-quality links can negatively impact your SEO. If you purchase paid links to outdo your competitors, remember they can buy links too. In that case, your investment may bear no fruit. However, if paid marketing isn’t the chief focus for your SEO strategy or if you want to buy links just to boost your brand authority, you can opt for paid links. Remember to include rel=“nofollow” or rel=“sponsored” attributes to your paid links so that they don’t affect your website’s SEO. If you leverage paid links purely to boost your search engine rankings, it is, of course, a red flag. Unnatural Links Are you placing links just because you want to increase your backlink count and rank higher on searches? Don’t do that. The tactic can backfire on you. Low-quality, unnatural backlinks are enlisted as spammy links and you may face a penalty for the same. That said, your backlink has to add value to the users and the website. It should either drive users to a relevant source of information or allow search engine crawlers to comprehend the context better. Want to dig deeper? Check out our extensive blog post covering how to check backlink quality in detail PBN Links Private blog networks (PBN) intend to create lots of links from a cluster of websites (often with no authority) to a money-making website. This is done to pass link juice to the money-making site and improve its ranking unethically. Google hates PBN as it tricks the search engine algorithm into ranking a site higher using unfair means. If you use a PBN to get your site ranked better, the whole strategy will collapse when Google finds and imposes a penalty upon it. Wrapping Up Link building is a consistent process and you can never expect to arrive at a dead-end. While it may seem like demanding more effort than any other SEO strategy, the reward is huge and lasts in the long run. Once you achieve success in link building for SEO, your site will already be generating considerable organic traffic. Then, you may not be required to put in as much effort as you did initially. After all, you don’t have to start from scratch every time. All you need to do is maintain your website’s standard while featuring user-focused content and keeping a constant eye on search engine algorithm updates. Link building is an ocean and I have touched upon all possible aspects of it to give you a 360-degree view of it. Hopefully, all your link building questions have been answered. Stay tuned for more.

Link Building Strategies That Work Tools that Help in Link Building Link Building: A Case Study From Stan Ventures Link Building Tactics You Should Avoid Backlinks are a must-have to improve your online visibility, drive more web traffic and position your website at the top of search engine results. In short, backlinks come in handy when you want to increase the authority of your website in the eyes of search engine giants like Google. Search engines discover new content via links and also leverage them as a parameter to determine the content quality. So, how does that work? Google considers a high-quality contextual backlink as a vote of confidence that testifies how worthy the content is. That said, it isn’t a surprise that link building remains one of the crucial search engine ranking factors. A targeted strategy often makes things easier and link building is no exception. Yes, it doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or a pro, you need a definitive link building strategy in place to achieve significant results. If not, your link-building efforts may end up a disaster. Worry not! If you understand the what, why, how, dos and don’ts of link building, it isn’t tough to crack the hard nut. Let me walk you through link building and its aspects one step at a time. What is Link Building? Professional link building is the practice of gaining links from one or more websites to your own. These links help users navigate from one web page to the other to access more information relevant to their search on the internet. As for search engines, links make way for the bots to crawl, index, and rank web pages. Why is Link Building Important for SEO? Link building is one of the most powerful ways to get high-authority, niche-specific websites to vouch for your site. With an effective link acquisition strategy, you can build a bold and illustrative backlink profile. Based on the robustness of the link profile you create, your website can enamor Google’s algorithm and achieve higher rankings. Link building, despite all the rumor-mongering happening, is something you cannot overlook when optimizing your website for SEO. Spoiler Alert: Building a healthy link profile doesn’t happen overnight. White hat link building for SEO takes time, but it is always worth it. When you put in targeted and genuine efforts toward link building, it gets paid off with long-lasting results. That’s the gist of it. The concept of links is cardinal to how Google search works. Its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin came up with the beautiful concept of PageRank. PageRank algorithm helps Google identify new pages and rank them based on quality signals. So, what this means is that Google’s core algorithm weighs backlinks as one of the top-ranking factors, and ignoring it could bring a website’s growth to a standstill. How to Build Links? Now that you know how link building can complement your website’s SEO, it’s time to learn how to build links. So, let’s delve into it. Broadly speaking, link building happens in three ways: 1. Requesting for Links Do you want to link back to your website from a specific website? The best thing to do is request the website owner for a backlink. However, you need to make sure that linking back to the website fetches you benefits in terms of web traffic and authority. Here’s what you need to remember. The website has to be related to your industry/niche. The website should be credible and exhibit great performance. Craft a genuinely compelling email pitch to convenience the website owner to accept a backlink placement to your website. 2. Earning Links Earning links is when other website owners link back to your website without you contacting them regarding backlinks. This often happens when you feature high-quality, user-engaging content on your website that your target audience and industry experts find useful. As per Google Webmaster Guidelines, “Creating good content pays off: Links are usually editorial votes given by choice, and the more useful content you have, the greater the chances someone else will find that content valuable to their readers and link to it.” Earning backlinks to your website is the biggest reward and a clear sign that your link-building efforts are actually working. 3. Buying Links Buying links is yet another way to secure link placements in top-performing sites. When it comes to buying backlinks, you need to be quite choosy about the sites you pick as you are investing some money to make more of it. Make sure you follow a metric-specific approach to narrow down top sites from your niche to build backlinks. Once that’s done, get in touch with the website owner with a well-crafted email to gain backlink placements on a commercial basis. If you find the process time-consuming, you can avail the assistance of a trusted link-building service provider to purchase links from relevant sites on your behalf. Key Elements to Evaluate Link Prospects Before thinking about how to find backlink placements, you need to narrow down sites that suit your link building needs. That’s why you should consider the following elements related to host sites when you invest in link building for SEO. Content: Written and visual content for blogs, web pages, etc. Admin: Do they have advertising policies in place? Link Profile: What do the links pointing to the site look like? Reputation: Does the author have any reputation? Authorship: Who is responsible for the website content? Technical: How do users find and engage with the site? In addition to these metrics, you need to conduct your own manual research and backlink quality analysis to get an even deeper understanding of your link-building prospects. Metric Vs. Quality Understanding metrics and quality can help you set up link-building success. Certain metrics from top SEO tools can help evaluate a site for link-building prospects much easier. They are: Ahrefs Domain Rating. Moz Page Authority. Moz Domain Authority. Moz Page Authority. Majestic Trust Flow. Majestic Citation Flow. Majestic Trust Flow. SEMrushAuthority Score. Verve Link Score. In addition to these metrics, you need to conduct your own manual research to get an even deeper understanding of your link-building prospects. Quality The search quality raters guidelines by Google have dedicated a section for Overall Page Quality Rating that you can follow as well. It can help you cover the purpose of the content, the depth of the content, and find out credible sources for the content. How to Analyze a Site? As you go through the evaluation process, there are two important things to keep in mind: Weight Each Element Some aspects of the site are more important than others. Examine multiple elements that decide the site quality Here are the key elements to consider during the assessment: Content Commercial links: Check if there are links to money pages. Find whether links are not tagged with no follow or sponsor Navigation: Is it too generic for the site? Restricted Keywords: Check if the site uses gambling, payday loan, or pornographic keywords Infrequency: Does the website post infrequently, or are the old posts rarely updated? Admin About Us: Find if the links point to money pages Admin Pages: Find pages that directly advertise dofollow links in guest posts and avoid them at all costs Info: Phone number, address, and email Link Profile Excess links: See if too many links are pointing to a single page Low Authority: Find the site’s Domain Authority and Domain Rating using SEO tools Non-relevant links: Discover if there are links that don’t make sense for the page Authorship Byline: Is the byline set to the site name or the admin? Author Page Info: Is the information about the author incomplete? Nationality: Is the author from your target country or not? If you are dealing with YMYL pages, you have to be more stringent about the author’s reputation. Reputation Online presence: Does the website has a good social media presence Followers: What type of accounts are following the brand Engagement: Does the page have enough engagement? Technical Indexed: Does the website exist in Google’s index with more than just the home page? Geo: What is the focus of the audience’s country? Page Engagement: Does the site have ads and links within pages? Link Building Strategies That Work The strategy you devise is the major driving factor behind your link-building outcomes. So, here is a look at the top white hat link building strategies you can harness to achieve desired results. 1. Ultimate Guides Ultimate Guides usually cover in-depth information about a specific topic and comprise several subheadings, illustrations, and super-long content. Since Ultimate Guides provide users access to massive information in one place, they can be a go-to choice to earn backlinks. 2. Listicles Listicles or list posts are posts that feature a numbered list of facts, techniques, tips, reasons and so much more. Packed in chunks, these posts contain information that delivers value to the users. After analyzing 1 million pieces of content, BuzzSumo has arrived at the conclusion that list posts generate far more backlinks than other forms of content, including infographics, quizzes, and more. 3. Resource Page Link Building So, what are Resource Pages? Resource Pages are pages that contain a curated list of resources that solely link back to informative content from multiple websites. The more the number of backlinks on a page, the more authoritative it is. Resource page link building is a practice where you link back to your website from a resource page. Your chances of gaining link placements in resource pages depend heavily on the quality of your content. You can find resource pages easily by using the following Google search strings. “Keyword” + inurl:links “Keyword” + “helpful resources” “Keyword” + “useful resources” “Keyword” + “useful links” Let’s say your niche is medicine. You can use medicine in the keyword field followed by one of the above Google search strings. Once you have the resource pages, you need to find out if a particular resource page is suitable for your link-building purposes. Not everyone has the same link-building needs. You can use metrics such as page authority, domain authority, the web traffic of the page/domain to decide if a given resource page is the right fit for you. This will give you the ideal site for your resource page link-building process. Look for content that is worth linking back to from the resource page. Finally, draft an email stating how your content can be a valuable addition to the resource page and ask the website owner to link back to your site. 4. Broken Link Building Broken link building is a unique link building strategy. While other link building strategies are about asking people for backlinks, broken link building makes way for you to help add value to somebody’s website. So, how to get backlinks using this strategy? The first step is to identify broken links in a website. Install either Check My Links or LinkMiner chrome extension. Not sure which website to check for broken links? Pick a page with more links. If there are many links, it’s likely that one or more of them are broken. That’s the idea. A resource page from your niche should be the best fit. After all, it is fully loaded with links. You can use the Chrome extension to weed out broken links in the page easily. Finally, send the website owner a mail highlighting the broken links that you identified and suggest replacing the link with yours. 5. Guest Blogging Guest blogging is never out of trend. It is, of course, one of the classic link building methods. Use a search string such as “write for us” + keyword to find blogs and websites that currently accept guest posts in your niche. Run through the search results and shortlist the ones that are right for you. Use the contact form or email address to initiate a formal conversation asking for a guest post opportunity with backlink placement. Unfortunately, guest post opportunities aren’t available just for you but also for your competitors. Make sure you stand out from the crowd every step of the way. Getting professional assistance from a trusted guest blogging service provider can take the burden off your shoulders and help you achieve desired results to outperform the other players in your industry. 6. Blogger Outreach Blogger outreach is one of the best strategies to build your backlink profile. You would have received outreach emails too. Doubt that? Check the spam folder of your mailbox. You will likely find at least a few outreach emails in there, only that they failed to grab your attention. If you’re wondering why these emails are dropped straight into the spam box, it’s because they may not be relevant to you. Suppose you run a website that specializes in e-commerce. An email targeting finance experts and investors is certainly not your cup of tea. That’s why your outreach campaigns should be targeting the right people. Your link success depends on it as well. In fact, outreach emails witness a response rate of only 10%, while the other 90% of them go unanswered. Having said that, if you want your outreach emails answered, you need to keep yourself updated about the latest outreach techniques and master them. Are you still using standard/traditional email templates for your outreach purposes? If your answer is yes, then it’s high time to break away. Let me tell you how to switch to non-conventional email outreach. Draft 100% personalized and original emails. Leverage your unique brand voice. Apart from increasing the response rate for your outreach campaigns, these emails also help you create a positive outlook toward your brand. So, who do you start with? Trustworthiness is the lifeline of blogger outreach. Start with people who trust you and are already aware of your business. They may include Your industry partners. People who have subscribed to your newsletter. People who have mentioned your links or brand name in their content. Bloggers/influencers who are connected with you on social media. Who else do you reach out to? Look for people who share something in common with you. For instance, you can reach out to bloggers who share a similar customer base. Link placement in niche-specific blogs can drive qualified leads and help you achieve more tractions for your business. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and others are also ideal to find people whose interests are similar to yours. Do you think outreach is eating up too much of your time? That’s why Stan Ventures shortlists sites based on 25+ link building metrics and offers a genuine blogger outreach service to help you earn high-quality backlinks seamlessly. 7. Unlinked Brand Mentions Every business gets its brand mentioned somewhere on the internet. These brand mentions need not necessarily be linked back to the corresponding website. Why not use your unlinked brand mentions to your link-building advantage? Yes, you can translate unlinked brand mentions to gain backlink placements across websites with minimal effort in the right direction. Use a brand monitoring tool like Semrush to keep track of your brand mentions across the internet. Once you find people who have mentioned your brand name in their web space, reach out to them and ask for backlink placements. However, you need to ensure that these links add value to the visitors of the corresponding domain. That way, the link juice is rightly passed on, having a positive impact on your website’s authority. 8. Podcast Links Links are everywhere. You just need to have a keen eye for them. What if I told you you could get backlinks without writing content or initiating outreach campaigns? It’s definitely possible. All it takes is one word: Podcasts. You just have to show up and talk about things you know and you get a link just like that. A podcast can be about anything, as long as it adds value to the listeners. Talk about something your target audience wants to learn and you get the job done without lifting your finger. 9. HARO Links HARO or Help A Reporter Out is an ideal place for you to connect with big shots from high authority, trusted websites. Once you sign up, you start receiving emails on a daily basis. Set a time frame, say, 30 to 45 minutes every day and look for queries within your expertise and respond to them. If your answer gets featured, you get a link placement on a high-authority website. It isn’t a sure-shot that your answers will be cited, but when it happens, the impact will be high. That’s how HARO links bolster your SEO efforts. 10. Infographic & Image Link Building Visual assets such as infographics, images, and diagrams make way for seamless link building. They present huge chunks of information in a comprehensive way. Users are fond of visual assets as well. So, how do infographics and images simplify link building? Let’s say you include a graph or chart on one of your web pages. Every time someone shares the graph, you automatically get a link from their website to your own. From this standpoint, visual assets hold greater good for link building than text-based content. 11. Getting competitor’s links using tools like AHREFs Link Intersect feature Did you know your competitors can help you strengthen your backlink profile? Here’s how: If a website links back to one or more of your competitors, chances are they can link back to your site. So, how do you find these sites that link back to your competitors? Ahrefs Link Intersect tool can simplify the process for you. Enter a few of your major competitors in the tool. Choose “all of the below targets” -> Show link opportunities. You will see a list of websites that all of them link back to. Check them out to find the best fit for building links. Make sure you pick sites where your potential prospects are likely to hang out. That’s precisely where you should establish your presence. Is that it? Not yet. I’ll tell you another way to refine your search for domains that link back to your competitors. Link Intersect -> Enter domains -> Click “any of the below targets” -> Show link opportunities. Now, you will get more results based on the number of intersects. Shortlist the websites you are going to contact for link-building opportunities. 12. Content Promotion Creating link-worthy content is important. However, you cannot stop there, especially if your aim is to create a great link profile. People should be able to discover your web pages in order to link back to them. That’s exactly why content promotion is mandatory. So, how do you promote your content? Advertising Outreach Communities/ Forums Advertising Invest in platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and others to improve the visibility of your content. The more the visibility, the greater the chances of someone showing interest to link back to your content. Well-written content can fetch you multiple backlinks in the long run. Investing a small sum of money to advertise your content isn’t a problem when it can fetch you more links and grow your business, right? Outreach Advertising is, of course, a good way to promote your content. Even so, reaching out to people with an email pitch makes the process sound more formal. Also, when it comes to content promotion via outreach, you add more value to the recipients of your mail and their target audience (who are your prospects too). If you can convince the website owners that linking back to your content fetches mutual benefits, it is a win-win scenario. Communities/ Forums You have niche-specific forum sites where you can promote your content among your target audience. Social media groups and communities are also good places for content promotion. However, it isn’t as easy as joining a forum and dropping your content links just like that. You need to become an active member and take part in discussions that happen there. Once you have built a reputation for yourself among the forum members, you can post your content in the community. If the audiences find the content good enough, they will link back to it. Remember, you must not post links in the group every time you publish new content. Doing it frequently can annoy people and they might not check out your content at all. Make your moves wisely when promoting your content across communities. 13. Reverse Image Search Is someone using your visual asset without your knowledge? Don’t worry. I look at it as an opportunity rather than a problem. What if you can use the scenario to build a backlink while fixing the copyright breach? Reverse image search is the key. Reverse image search refers to the practice of searching for all indexed URLs across the internet containing the same or similar image. You can perform a reverse image search using Google Images or Bing Images. Alternatively, you can do it directly from Chrome. So, how do you harness reverse image search to build backlinks? Most website owners do not want to remove copied images because it delivers value to their users. That said, it is a cakewalk to secure a backlink from their website through the image. All you have to do is send them a friendly email asking for a backlink in return. 14. Skyscraper Technique Have you ever thought about creating something better than the top-performing content in your niche? That’s the root of the skyscraper technique. This technique emphasizes improvising on the top-performing content with a great number of backlinks. You do that to steal your competitor’s backlinks so that you can drive more traffic to your website and skyrocket your search engine ranking, all by creating a more enhanced version of the existing content. The first step is to identify the best-performing content loaded with backlinks. Perform a Google search with a broad keyword for top-ranked content and analyze it for backlinks using tools like Ahrefs. The next thing is to create an improved version of the content. Here’s what you should do. Increase the length of the content Add updated information and relevant images Implement a simple and appealing design Provide in-depth information about the topic Once you have created your version of the content, it’s time for email outreach. Now, let’s do some smart work. Instead of reaching out to random bloggers, contact people who have already linked to the content. As they’ve linked to similar content, the chances of them linking to your content are high. That’s the idea. 15. Internal Linking Strategy Link building isn’t just about linking from or to other sites. It is also about linking pages within your website. So, why is internal link building crucial? Your visitors are your top priority. A bad user experience can drive them away as soon as they come in. This includes increased bounce rate and a higher bounce rate, which are a threat to your website’s SEO. The smoother the user experience, the longer the time they spend on your website. With channelized internal link building, you help your visitors navigate across your web pages seamlessly while offering a promising user experience. Your users aren’t the only ones navigating across your site. Search engine spiders do the same and when you link internal pages, you make way for them to understand the context better and rank pages higher. The more the internal links directing to a particular web page, the more important the page is in the eyes of the search engine bots. Tools that Help in Link Building As you know, link building is a time-consuming process. However, the results are long-lasting if done right. Your link-building toolkit is your magic wand.

Link Building: A Case Study From Stan Ventures Actions speak better than words. Let me give you a practical example of how we helped one of our clients rank #1 in SERPs in just 2 weeks. Kitchenroom, a UK-based website offering fitted kitchen services, found it difficult to generate organic traffic despite having a great website with unique content and being in business since 2017. Jason, the founder of Kitchenroom, wanted more prospects across Oxfordshire to contact him and also needed to rank on top of the search. Our SEOs rolled up their sleeves to figure out the challenges we will meet going forward. The major challenge we faced was that some of the client’s competitors had a robust online presence with 10x more referring domains compared to Kitchenroom. On the other hand, Kitchenroom was lagging behind in terms of authority due to fewer backlinks. After a thorough competitor analysis, we found that even though the competitors leveraged backlinks to stay at the top of the search, those links lacked authority. And that was our trump card. We figured out that building high-quality backlinks through genuine blogger outreach will help the client’s website rank higher. Proceeding further, our outreach experts started contacting niche-specific bloggers to ensure link placements for Kitchenroom on relevant sites. Once the sites were narrowed down and approved by Jason, our native content writers produced content with the anchor text placed naturally. We shared the content with the bloggers and received the live link shortly. Within two weeks, Jason started receiving more calls while the original traffic was going up. The keywords we wanted Kitchenroom to rank for were in the top 3 positions and the overall traffic of the site increased by 79%. Here’s a look at the numbers. Traffic – 387 +40% Keywords – 111 +107% Traffic Value – $739 +3X Link Building Tactics You Should Avoid It isn’t always about knowing the dos. You also need to know the don’ts so that you dodge or unlearn them in time. This holds true for link building as well. Let me pinpoint some black hat practices you should avoid in the course of your link-building journey. Paying for Links Paid link building manipulates search engine algorithms and is clearly a violation of Google’s webmaster guidelines. So, you may end up with a penalty and that’s very risky. A majority of paid links come from sites with a lot of outbound links and are naturally of low quality. Again, low-quality links can negatively impact your SEO. If you purchase paid links to outdo your competitors, remember they can buy links too. In that case, your investment may bear no fruit. However, if paid marketing isn’t the chief focus for your SEO strategy or if you want to buy links just to boost your brand authority, you can opt for paid links. Remember to include rel=“nofollow” or rel=“sponsored” attributes to your paid links so that they don’t affect your website’s SEO. If you leverage paid links purely to boost your search engine rankings, it is, of course, a red flag. Unnatural Links Are you placing links just because you want to increase your backlink count and rank higher on searches? Don’t do that. The tactic can backfire on you. Low-quality, unnatural backlinks are enlisted as spammy links and you may face a penalty for the same. That said, your backlink has to add value to the users and the website. It should either drive users to a relevant source of information or allow search engine crawlers to comprehend the context better. Want to dig deeper? Check out our extensive blog post covering how to check backlink quality in detail PBN Links Private blog networks (PBN) intend to create lots of links from a cluster of websites (often with no authority) to a money-making website. This is done to pass link juice to the money-making site and improve its ranking unethically. Google hates PBN as it tricks the search engine algorithm into ranking a site higher using unfair means. If you use a PBN to get your site ranked better, the whole strategy will collapse when Google finds and imposes a penalty upon it. Wrapping Up Link building is a consistent process and you can never expect to arrive at a dead-end. While it may seem like demanding more effort than any other SEO strategy, the reward is huge and lasts in the long run. Once you achieve success in link building for SEO, your site will already be generating considerable organic traffic. Then, you may not be required to put in as much effort as you did initially. After all, you don’t have to start from scratch every time. All you need to do is maintain your website’s standard while featuring user-focused content and keeping a constant eye on search engine algorithm updates. Link building is an ocean and I have touched upon all possible aspects of it to give you a 360-degree view of it. Hopefully, all your link building questions have been answered. Stay tuned for more.

  "existingPosts": "Content: \"Automated Link Building: The Future of SEO or Just a Fad? # The Wild World of Link Building Alright, let’s grab a beer and dive into this wild world of automated link building. You ever heard about it? It’s the kind of thing that makes your head spin faster than a bar stool after a couple of drinks. Link building has always been a cornerstone of SEO, but with automation now throwing its hat in the ring, we’re looking at something that could change the game forever—or could it? Now, before we get rolling, let’s clear the air. I’m not saying automated link building is the golden ticket to SEO success. I mean, sure, you can use a tool like GetMoreBacklinks and watch the backlinks roll in, but it’s not all rainbows and butterflies. You gotta know the ins and outs, or you might end up knee-deep in a mess of low-quality links. Ever tried this? You might want to think twice if you haven’t. # The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly When it comes to automated link building, let’s break it down into three categories: the good, the bad, and the downright ugly. First, the good: Automated link building can save you a ton of time. Imagine this—you’re out enjoying a night out or, heck, even sleeping, and your automated tool is out there hustling for those coveted backlinks. With platforms like GetMoreBacklinks, you can obtain backlinks quickly and with minimal effort. However, the level of quality can vary significantly, and it’s essential to do your due diligence. Now, onto the bad: Not all backlinks are created equal, my friend. You could end up with links from sites that are about as reputable as that one friend who always borrows money but never pays it back. If you're relying solely on automation, you could inadvertently harm your SEO instead of helping it. Think of it like ordering a pizza and getting a salad—you’re not gonna be satisfied. And then there’s the ugly: Ever heard of Google’s algorithms? They’re like that bouncer at the bar who decides who gets in and who gets",
