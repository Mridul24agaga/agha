  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, so let’s break this down. Moody Tunes, huh? Just from the name, it feels like a place that’s all about vibing out with some good music. You know, the kind of site where you can probably find tracks that fit your mood, whether you’re feeling happy, sad, or somewhere in between. Maybe they’ve got playlists curated for different activities—like chilling on the couch, hitting the gym, or even those late-night drives when you just need the right soundtrack. I’m guessing they might have some slick user interface, something visually appealing that draws you in. Possibly a minimalist design with cool graphics or album covers that pop. And if they’re really on top of their game, they might even offer personalized recommendations. You know, like \"Hey, if you liked that jazz tune, here’s a bunch of similar tracks you might dig!\" It’s all about making the music discovery process smooth and enjoyable—you want to feel like the site understands your vibe. Now, I wouldn’t be surprised if they’ve got some social features too. Maybe a way to share playlists with friends or follow what others are listening to. It could be like the Spotify vibe, but with a more laid-back, community-oriented twist. Picture it: you’re at a party, someone throws on a killer playlist from Moody Tunes, and suddenly everyone’s bonding over their shared love of those tunes. And let’s not forget the potential for some cool editorial content. They might have blog posts or articles that dive into music genres, artist spotlights, or even playlists for specific moments—like the perfect songs for a rainy day or a road trip. If they’re really feeling ambitious, there could be interviews with artists, behind-the-scenes looks at the music creation process, or even reviews of new albums that drop. Accessibility is another key thing I’d expect—maybe they have a mobile app so you can take those tunes on the go. You know, when you’re commuting, or working out, or just trying to drown out the noise of daily life with some sweet background tunes. All in all, I’d say Moody Tunes is probably a chill space where music lovers can gather, discover, and enjoy tracks that resonate with their moods and lives. It’s all about fostering a love for music and making sure everyone can find their perfect soundtrack, no matter where they are or what they’re doing. Sounds like a pretty sweet spot to kick it and explore the soundscape, right?",

What are Spotify Editorial Playlists? Before talking about methods of getting your tracks to the playlists, let's define them and what they stand for. Overall, there are three major types of playlists on the platform. Editorial playlists are managed by the editorial teams that create personalized compilations for each user. Since there are over 600 million users on the platform, it takes a lot of resources to make it happen. User-generated playlists. These sequences are created and edited by users. They usually do it for special occasions, assembling tracks for road trips, parties, etc. Algorithmic playlists are personalized mixes created by users based on data analysis (engagement, preferences, etc.), offering something related to the listener's music taste. The most popular algorithmic playlists are Release Radar and Discover Weekly. In one of our recent articles, we discussed the impact of playlist plays on your Spotify activity. Appearing in any of these playlists will boost your music, giving you organic plays and engagement. Moreover, if your music is played by premium users, it will be more valuable and bring you more royalties. Getting your music on Editorial Playlist: Direct Pitch Now, let's discover how to get your music on Spotify's editorial playlist. The first method is a direct pitch. It means choosing a \"pitch a song\" option in your profile. You choose the \"Music\" tab and select the option \"Pitch a song.\" By doing that, you submit your music without scheduling a release. After doing this, proceed to the page where you have to add personal information about yourself. This includes song metadata (title, genre, artist name, producer name, etc.). Once it's done and your music is on the playlist, you can access the dashboard on Spotify for Artists and receive streaming information, including the number of streams, the source of engagement, etc. How to Find the Right Playlist for Pitching? Find the Right One Pitching tracks to random playlists is not an option because it won't give you the desired effect. The idea is to find a playlist relevant to your genre and style. How to do that? By analyzing playlists using available tools. How to perform an analysis? Try the following methods: Use the search bar and search for preferred playlists. Use keywords associated with these playlists. Words like \"rock\" or \"hard rock\" may give you the needed results. Check algorithmic playlists like Discover Weekly or Release Radar. They both are created considering your preferences, so you can find mixes that represent the same genre. Check the profiles of other artists. Check how other musicians organize their playlists. Some artists share mixes on their pages, so it's not tough to find the right playlists on Spotify. How to Craft a Pitch The best way to get a pitch is to craft one, as it maximizes your chances of getting into the Spotify editorial playlist. Everyone wants their music to be heard, but only the most creative musicians receive the highest engagement and take advantage of the Spotify playlist system. So, how to get an impressive pitch for a Spotify playlist? Make a solid introduction and describe your music activity. Mention major achievements or rewards you received. Identify the genre and music style you are working in. Point out key elements that differentiate your tracks from other music on Spotify. List your recent releases. Add links to recent singles and albums. If your music was used or mentioned in TV shows, commercials, or movies, mention this. Add links to your social media and personal website (if you have one). This information is essential for Spotify playlist curators. They check dozens of pitches daily to find musicians whose music is the most valuable. Your goal is to hook their attention and show why they should choose you instead of someone else. For example, if you mention specific information about your tracks (the message you push with them) or what inspires you when creating music, it will make a difference. Is Playlist Pitch Impactful for Music Promotion? Proper playlist placement plays a major role in artist development. Spotify playlists are streamed by millions of users daily, generating mind-blowing engagement that brings income and improves presence on the platform. This is what new music needs to go through first stages of recognition to appear in charts and be used on Instagram and TikTok. Still, the editorial playlist pitch won't replace promotion. You still need a powerful push to increase engagement, get more listeners, and make your music go viral. With a powerful Spotify promotion package, you will receive engagement from organic users who even may follow you after listening to your tracks.

Here, I’ll share with you some of the most popular Spotify playlist names and themes on Spotify, as well as some tips on coming up with your own unique and catchy titles that can fit your great playlist. Whether you want to make a playlist for a specific mood, some popular genres, an occasion, or a person, there’s a theme for you! Spotify Playlist Names & Themes: What Are They? A playlist theme is a broad idea or concept that connects all the songs. It’s critical to have a specific concept in mind when picking a theme and name for your playlist rather than just slapping songs on there at random. You can select a theme that is motivated by a season, a decade, a film, or anything else that inspires you to be creative. Don’t worry, we’ll talk about this soon! A playlist name is a title you give your playlist in accordance with its theme. If rainbow-themed songs are your focus, you might name your playlist: “Somewhere Over The Rainbow,” “Color Me Happy,” “Rainbow Connection.” As you can see, creating a themed playlist on Spotify is actually quite simple as long as you have a specific idea and, of course, are familiar with the variety of music that is out there.

What distinguishes your playlist from others, and what makes it special? What is your unique take or viewpoint on the music? What are some ways you can express yourself or your creativity? Two things to bear in mind are: An appealing Spotify playlist has a short, simple, and easy-to-remember name. It really won’t work for a lot of people if you use some big, difficult-to-pronounce words or if the title is too long. Use relatable, catchy, and descriptive themes and names. Creativity is the key! Unless you are specifically creating the playlist for yourself, too general or ambiguous terms like “Playlist 1” won’t appeal to other people. It’s important to evoke memories, emotions, and similar associations when creating a theme and the name of your Spotify playlist. How Do You Come Up with Ideas for Good Spotify Playlist Names and Themes? Wondering how to generate innovative ideas for good Spotify playlist names and themes? Here are some insights that could enhance your Spotify playlist-creation prowess, particularly if you’re a beginner: If you’re curating a Spotify playlist for your followers, consider their preferences for inspiration. What type of ambiance do they enjoy? Is your follower base your target audience? This contemplation could aid in fine-tuning your options and identifying the demographics your playlist should cater to. Draw inspiration from other Spotify users who’ve curated popular playlists. By using Spotify’s search feature, you can explore playlists based on keywords, moods, or other criteria. Numerous websites and apps can also be used as Spotify playlist name generators or playlist theme generators derived from your input or preferences. Strive to be unique and inventive. Don’t hesitate to experiment with new words, phrases, puns, or references. Aspire to create a catchy, memorable, and thematically consistent Spotify playlist name that reflects your unique style and personality instead of resorting to generic or uninspiring names. How Do You Create Your Own Playlist Names and Themes? Begin by determining the type of music you wish to share. Subsequently, brainstorm catchy words and phrases that nicely represent the chosen music. Online tools can be employed to find synonyms, rhymes, alliterations, and puns for your words or phrases. Finally, mix together your words or phrases to create enticing playlist titles. For instance, if you wish to curate a playlist of coffee-related songs, commence by listing words like coffee, mug, brew, latte, etc. Next, locate rhymes or synonyms for these words like bean, cup, stew, etc. Finally, combine these words into potential titles such as: “Bean There Done That”, “Cup of Joy”, and “Stew-dio Time”. There’s no wrong way to approach this. Making it enjoyable for yourself ensures that others will also find it engaging. Photo by Andrea Piacquadio. What Are Some Ways to Find Music That Fits Your Theme? There are numerous ways to uncover songs that resonate with your theme, but here are some tips that could assist you: Reflect on the ambiance, message, and genre of the theme. What kind of emotional response do you aim to elicit? What narrative are you attempting to convey? These considerations can help concentrate your search and filter out songs that don’t align with your theme. Leverage online resources and services that recommend songs based on your theme. Various websites and applications, including Spotify, YouTube Music, Pandora, SoundCloud, etc., can offer songs that fit your theme. Search by keywords, genres, artists, and playlists, or even utilize algorithms that generate personalized recommendations based on your preferences and listening history. Look into different musical genres and sources. Avoid limiting yourself to well-known, mainstream songs. Indie music, music of a particular culture, classical music, and even experimental music occasionally contain hidden gems. You might come across brand-new musicians or songs that perfectly suit your theme or unexpectedly move you. Seek out the opinions and advice of others. Sometimes it’s helpful to get a second opinion or a new point of view from someone who is also interested in the same music or theme. When looking for songs that fit your theme, you can consult your friends, family, coworkers, online communities, and even some experts for their opinions and suggestions. You might receive some excellent advice or insights that you wouldn’t have come up with on your own. What Are Some Themes and Names That Make Good Playlists?

You can really display your creativity! You can give your playlist a name to help it stand out and be more easily identified. To help you find the proper way of thinking, I’ll provide you with a few questions to consider: Who are you making this playlist for? Is it for your enjoyment, for your friends and followers, or do you have other unique goals, such as becoming a popular Spotify playlist curator? When creating Spotify playlists for your followers, it’s a good idea to consider their listening preferences and expectations of you as someone they follow. What type of music do you want to incorporate? Think about a certain genre, vibe, specific songs or lyrics with a certain message. What distinguishes your playlist from others, and what makes it special? What is your unique take or viewpoint on the music? What are some ways you can express yourself or your creativity? Two things to bear in mind are: An appealing Spotify playlist has a short, simple, and easy-to-remember name. It really won’t work for a lot of people if you use some big, difficult-to-pronounce words or if the title is too long. Use relatable, catchy, and descriptive themes and names. Creativity is the key! Unless you are specifically creating the playlist for yourself, too general or ambiguous terms like “Playlist 1” won’t appeal to other people. It’s important to evoke memories, emotions, and similar associations when creating a theme and the name of your Spotify playlist. How Do You Come Up with Ideas for Good Spotify Playlist Names and Themes? Wondering how to generate innovative ideas for good Spotify playlist names and themes? Here are some insights that could enhance your Spotify playlist-creation prowess, particularly if you’re a beginner: If you’re curating a Spotify playlist for your followers, consider their preferences for inspiration. What type of ambiance do they enjoy? Is your follower base your target audience? This contemplation could aid in fine-tuning your options and identifying the demographics your playlist should cater to. Draw inspiration from other Spotify users who’ve curated popular playlists. By using Spotify’s search feature, you can explore playlists based on keywords, moods, or other criteria. Numerous websites and apps can also be used as Spotify playlist name generators or playlist theme generators derived from your input or preferences. Strive to be unique and inventive. Don’t hesitate to experiment with new words, phrases, puns, or references. Aspire to create a catchy, memorable, and thematically consistent Spotify playlist name that reflects your unique style and personality instead of resorting to generic or uninspiring names. How Do You Create Your Own Playlist Names and Themes? Begin by determining the type of music you wish to share. Subsequently, brainstorm catchy words and phrases that nicely represent the chosen music. Online tools can be employed to find synonyms, rhymes, alliterations, and puns for your words or phrases. Finally, mix together your words or phrases to create enticing playlist titles. For instance, if you wish to curate a playlist of coffee-related songs, commence by listing words like coffee, mug, brew, latte, etc. Next, locate rhymes or synonyms for these words like bean, cup, stew, etc. Finally, combine these words into potential titles such as: “Bean There Done That”, “Cup of Joy”, and “Stew-dio Time”.

What Are Some Ways to Find Music That Fits Your Theme? There are numerous ways to uncover songs that resonate with your theme, but here are some tips that could assist you: Reflect on the ambiance, message, and genre of the theme. What kind of emotional response do you aim to elicit? What narrative are you attempting to convey? These considerations can help concentrate your search and filter out songs that don’t align with your theme. Leverage online resources and services that recommend songs based on your theme. Various websites and applications, including Spotify, YouTube Music, Pandora, SoundCloud, etc., can offer songs that fit your theme. Search by keywords, genres, artists, and playlists, or even utilize algorithms that generate personalized recommendations based on your preferences and listening history. Look into different musical genres and sources. Avoid limiting yourself to well-known, mainstream songs. Indie music, music of a particular culture, classical music, and even experimental music occasionally contain hidden gems. You might come across brand-new musicians or songs that perfectly suit your theme or unexpectedly move you. Seek out the opinions and advice of others. Sometimes it’s helpful to get a second opinion or a new point of view from someone who is also interested in the same music or theme. When looking for songs that fit your theme, you can consult your friends, family, coworkers, online communities, and even some experts for their opinions and suggestions. You might receive some excellent advice or insights that you wouldn’t have come up with on your own. What Are Some Themes and Names That Make Good Playlists?

Make it clear what kind of music your music playlist consists of and even briefly describe the moods or genres, as well as name some popular songs on your playlist. When it comes to song selection, be thoughtful and update regularly. The best playlists have songs that complement each other and transition smoothly from one track to the next. You could use Spotify’s suggestions or look at similar playlists to find songs that fit your theme or mood. You could also use tools like “Sort Your Music” or “Smarter Playlists” to sort your songs by tempo, energy, danceability, popularity, or other criteria.

Here’s what I learned: 1. Make insurance companies fight for your business Most people just stick with the same insurer year after year, but that’s what the companies are counting on. This guy used tools like Coverage.com to compare rates every time his policy came up for renewal. It only took him a few minutes, and he said he’d saved hundreds each year by letting insurers compete for his business. Click here to try Coverage.com and see how much you could save today. 2. Take advantage of safe driver programs He mentioned that some companies reward good drivers with significant discounts. By signing up for a program that tracked his driving habits for just a month, he qualified for a lower rate. “It’s like a test where you already know the answers,” he joked. You can find a list of insurance companies offering safe driver discounts here and start saving on your next policy. 3. Bundle your policies He bundled his auto insurance with his home insurance and saved big. “Most companies will give you a discount if you combine your policies with them. It’s easy money,” he explained. If you haven’t bundled yet, ask your insurer what discounts they offer—or look for new ones that do. 4. Drop coverage you don’t need He also emphasized reassessing coverage every year. If your car isn’t worth much anymore, it might be time to drop collision or comprehensive coverage. “You shouldn’t be paying more to insure the car than it’s worth,” he said. 5. Look for hidden fees or overpriced add-ons One of his final tips was to avoid extras like roadside assistance, which can often be purchased elsewhere for less. “It’s those little fees you don’t think about that add up,” he warned. The Secret? Stop Overpaying The real “secret” isn’t about cutting corners—it’s about being proactive. Car insurance companies are counting on you to stay complacent, but with tools like Coverage.com and a little effort, you can make sure you’re only paying for what you need—and saving hundreds in the process.

I don't know what kinda playlists you made or what do u feel with your playlists. But if you made playlists, giving you all those positive things I mentioned above, you asked it in question, “what does that say” believe me you're genius because you know, how to control yourself, your mood, your time, your work and ppl around you. If you are listening positive songs which makes you positive charges so definitely you're spreading positivity around you but if you listening negative songs which makes you sad, gives you negative thinking then definitely you're spreading negativity around you. And you're not genius in this situation.

What does that say about my personality? More than anything, it means that people like us are open minded and interested about what makes each person different, and thus the music that they create. We try to understand why other people like the music that they like and we choose to see the ‘glass half full’, i.e., allow the individual/band/artists to reveal their potential, when discovering them for the first time rather than be presumably skeptical about them. Discovering the infinite possibilities of music and being fascinated by how it affects people is how we celebrate the beauty, uncertainty and complexity of life.

I like zesty, dreamy, upbeat EDM/ Indie dance music with exotic and creative spins, and when I’m listening to my playlist, it puts me into a happy, productive spirit, dreaming of futuristic things and imagining all sorts of galactic jungles and space monkeys and superior civilisations and technology.

It also clearly shows I like Great Britain and Argentina, and their vibes, because most of my music is from there. And music transports geographical character like nothing else. It’s not like I choose only British or Argentinian music on pupose, but it seems to be more like “if I like something, it usually turns out to be from there.” I tend to think that that preference for music from Great Britain and Argentina indicates a tendency or liking for “understatement with class” on my part, because these nations are pretty much symbolising it. And they are also rich in demographic variation, complex, and have a hedonistic streak.

What does that say about my personality? I also listen to a wide variety of music and a friend of mine who listened to a very selective kind of music said herself that the music one listens to says a lot about themselves. I think that having a wide variety of what music you listen to says that you have an open mind and that there are many things you can appreciate and that you are more interested in exploring. On the other hand the more selective you get, might suggest that you are very stuck in your ways and dont explore much. But this can also depend on the music itself that you listen to.

I don't know what kinda playlists you made or what do u feel with your playlists. But if you made playlists, giving you all those positive things I mentioned above, you asked it in question, “what does that say” believe me you're genius because you know, how to control yourself, your mood, your time, your work and ppl around you. If you are listening positive songs which makes you positive charges so definitely you're spreading positivity around you but if you listening negative songs which makes you sad, gives you negative thinking then definitely you're spreading negativity around you. And you're not genius in this situation.

What does that say about my personality? More than anything, it means that people like us are open minded and interested about what makes each person different, and thus the music that they create. We try to understand why other people like the music that they like and we choose to see the ‘glass half full’, i.e., allow the individual/band/artists to reveal their potential, when discovering them for the first time rather than be presumably skeptical about them. Discovering the infinite possibilities of music and being fascinated by how it affects people is how we celebrate the beauty, uncertainty and complexity of life.

It also clearly shows I like Great Britain and Argentina, and their vibes, because most of my music is from there. And music transports geographical character like nothing else. It’s not like I choose only British or Argentinian music on pupose, but it seems to be more like “if I like something, it usually turns out to be from there.” I tend to think that that preference for music from Great Britain and Argentina indicates a tendency or liking for “understatement with class” on my part, because these nations are pretty much symbolising it. And they are also rich in demographic variation, complex, and have a hedonistic streak.

What does that say about my personality? I also listen to a wide variety of music and a friend of mine who listened to a very selective kind of music said herself that the music one listens to says a lot about themselves. I think that having a wide variety of what music you listen to says that you have an open mind and that there are many things you can appreciate and that you are more interested in exploring. On the other hand the more selective you get, might suggest that you are very stuck in your ways and dont explore much. But this can also depend on the music itself that you listen to.

It’s also a convenient way to get a ready-to-use playlist for certain occasion or mood. But it’s not always perfect. Sometimes when you listen to these playlist, you realize that they just don’t match the vibe you’re looking for. Maybe the algorithm messed up. Or the songs are form a different music genre. That’s when building your own playlist is the best way to go. Creating your own playlist is easy and fun. You simply pick great songs and put them together to build a personal chart that matches the mood and the vibe you need. It’s also quite practical, because you know that this playlist will be exactly what you want to listen to. If you haven’t built a personal playlist yet, here’s a short step-by-step guide on how to do it effectively. I follow these same steps myself, and I have made countless music collections over the many years. 5-Steps Guide: Pinpoint The Exact Mood & Occasion Choose the Right Opening Track Arrange Songs In Order Mix Familiar Tracks with New Match Song Lyrics to the Theme (If Applicable) Pinpoint The Exact Mood & Occasion Take a moment and think – why exactly you want to create your playlist. What’s the occasion, or what’s the purpose? It may sound insignificant, but identifying the purpose of the music collection will actually make it easier for you to filter songs that don’t really fit the occasion and its vibe. For example you want to create a playlist for a wedding party. But wedding parties can be different. Is it for a bride or the groom? What music genres do they like? What style of a party is it gonna be? It’s just a simple example that shows there might be nuances, that are not necessary obvious right away. So it’s always better to start by zeroing in on the occasion itself. And it will tell you what emotions, and what energy the music should have. You’ll have a clear idea if it’s gonna be an upbeat, angry, sad, chill or something else. Choose the Right Opening Track I highly recommend setting the tone of the entire playlist with a great opening track. Pick a song that you really love, something that you’re familiar with. One of you favorite hits will be a solid choice. You want to start with the track that matches the atmosphere and mood you want for the whole playlist. A strong opening piece will act like a vibe switch. Once it’s on, the mood is set. It’s also easier to pick other songs, ’cause you will try to compare them to this first one. Arrange Songs In Order One thing that separates a really great playlist from a mediocre one is the songs’ order. I get it, simply picking cool tracks and throwing them all together is much easier, than try to re-arrange them in a specific order. But it’s worth doing. If you want your playlist to serve you well, and if you want to squeeze the maximum satisfaction from that music collection, spend another five minutes and place the tracks in some sort of order. Arrange them by their tempo or energy levels, or lyrics. And try to avoid sudden shifts and abrupt changes. This can break the vibe of the set-list. If possible place the songs in a way that creates a nice transition from one track to another. Mix Familiar Tracks with New You might be temped to use only your favorite hits, by your favorite bands and artists. But it’s actually better to mix them with less familiar tracks. Add a group you have discovered just recently. Put in a random song you just heard and enjoyed the other day, even if you don’t know the artist. This way you won’t get tired of your music mix. Because no matter how amazing the songs are, if you listen to them on repeat all the time, eventually you’ll enjoy ’em less. It can take an hour, a day, or a month, but it will happen. And no one wants to loose their favorite music, right? Adding lesser-known songs will make you playlist sound fresh for much longer. Plus you also get to check new songs and discover new stuff along the way. Match Song Lyrics to the Theme (If Applicable) For specific occasions you might want to select songs with lyrics that match that particular atmosphere and the vibe of those occasions. Because lyrics can be as powerful as the melody. With so much music written over the years, you surely can find songs that will match the occasion and its mood. Also, you might be interested in this article: What is More Important in a Song: Lyrics or Melody? A the same time, you’d probably want to avoid songs that have conflicting themes and don’t fit the purpose of the setlist. Even if the melody is cool, it’s better to leave those tracks for other playlists. Bonus Tips If you follow the steps mentioned earlier, you’ll find creating your own playlists to be quite enjoyable. Here are a few extra tips, that can help you even more. Adjust the Playlist Length. Based on the purpose and the occasion of the set list, be sure to make it long enough. Or keep it short, if that’s what you need. No point of wasting time adding tracks that you won’t get to anyway. *Refreshing* the Playlist. Occasionally you should check if some of the songs actually fit the overall mood of the set. If you notice yourself skipping certain songs, or not enjoying them as much, don’t hesitate to remove them. You can always find better ones instead. **Time For a New Set.**** However if you feel like the playlist no longer works for you, or it lost it’s energy boost, there’s no point in trying to redo the entire collection. Just make a new one. It’s nice to have two, three or four separate playlists that you can rotate between. Conclusion That’s pretty much it. As you can see it’s not a rocket science. But these steps do help, and can make your playlist a bit better. Or a lot better, depending if you have created your own set-list or not. I hope you will enjoy your mix even more now.

      "title": "Published Time: 2024-09-27T17:17:29+00:00 How To Build A Perfect Playlist For Any Mood And Occasion | Music To Feel Skip to content Music Discoveries Best Of Playlists Song of the Day Contacts About How to Build a Perfect Playlist for Any Mood And Occasion Written byVince Bradbury Updated onSeptember 27, 2024 Best Songs by Artist | Exploring Music Genres | Folk | Indie | Metal | Pop Music | Rock Music | Top 10 Songs - Custom Playlist / Best Songs by Artist / How to Build a Perfect Playlist for Any Mood And Occasion Exploring playlists created by other people, or by AI (algorithms on platforms like Spotify and YouTube) is one of the easiest ways to find new music. It’s also a convenient way to get a ready-to-use playlist for certain occasion or mood. But it’s not always perfect. Sometimes when you listen to these playlist, you realize that they just don’t match the vibe you’re looking for. Maybe the algorithm messed up. Or the songs are form a different music genre. That’s when building your own playlist is the best way to go. Creating your own playlist is easy and fun. You simply pick great songs and put them together to build a personal chart that matches the mood and the vibe you need. It’s also quite practical, because you know that this playlist will be exactly what you want to listen to. If you haven’t built a personal playlist yet, here’s a short step-by-step guide on how to do it effectively. I follow these same steps myself, and I have made countless music collections over the many years. 5-Steps Guide: Pinpoint The Exact Mood & Occasion Choose the Right Opening Track Arrange Songs In Order Mix Familiar Tracks with New Match Song Lyrics to the Theme (If Applicable) Pinpoint The Exact Mood & Occasion Take a moment and think – why exactly you want to create your playlist. What’s the occasion, or what’s the purpose? It may sound insignificant, but identifying the purpose of the music collection will actually make it easier for you to filter songs that don’t really fit the occasion and its vibe. For example you want to create a playlist for a wedding party. But wedding parties can be different. Is it for a bride or the groom? What music genres do they like? What style of a party is it gonna be? It’s just a simple example that shows there might be nuances, that are not necessary obvious right away. So it’s always better to start by zeroing in on the occasion itself. And it will tell you what emotions, and what energy the music should have. You’ll have a clear idea if it’s gonna be an upbeat, angry, sad, chill or something else. Choose the Right Opening Track I highly recommend setting the tone of the entire playlist with a great opening track. Pick a song that you really love, something that you’re familiar with. One of you favorite hits will be a solid choice. You want to start with the track that matches the atmosphere and mood you want for the whole playlist. A strong opening piece will act like a vibe switch. Once it’s on, the mood is set. It’s also easier to pick other songs, ’cause you will try to compare them to this first one. Arrange Songs In Order One thing that separates a really great playlist from a mediocre one is the songs’ order. I get it, simply picking cool tracks and throwing them all together is much easier, than try to re-arrange them in a specific order. But it’s worth doing. If you want your playlist to serve you well, and if you want to squeeze the maximum satisfaction from that music collection, spend another five minutes and place the tracks in some sort of order. Arrange them by their tempo or energy levels, or lyrics. And try to avoid sudden shifts and abrupt changes. This can break the vibe of the set-list. If possible place the songs in a way that creates a nice transition from one track to another. Mix Familiar Tracks with New You might be temped to use only your favorite hits, by your favorite bands and artists. But it’s actually better to mix them with less familiar tracks. Add a group you have discovered just recently. Put in a random song you just heard and enjoyed the other day, even if you don’t know the artist. This way you won’t get tired of your music mix. Because no matter how amazing the songs are, if you listen to them on repeat all the time, eventually you’ll enjoy ’em less. It can take an hour, a day, or a month, but it will happen. And no one wants to loose their favorite music, right? Adding lesser-known songs will make you playlist sound fresh for much longer. Plus you also get to check new songs and discover new stuff along the way. Match Song Lyrics to the Theme (If Applicable) For specific occasions you might want to select songs with lyrics that match that particular atmosphere and the vibe of those occasions. Because lyrics can be as powerful as the melody. With so much music written over the years, you surely can find songs that will match the occasion and its mood. Also, you might be interested in this article: What is More Important in a Song: Lyrics or Melody? A the same time, you’d probably want to avoid songs that have conflicting themes and don’t fit the purpose of the setlist. Even if the melody is cool, it’s better to leave those tracks for other playlists. Bonus Tips If you follow the steps mentioned earlier, you’ll find creating your own playlists to be quite enjoyable. Here are a few extra tips, that can help you even more. Adjust the Playlist Length. Based on the purpose and the occasion of the set list, be sure to make it long enough. Or keep it short, if that’s what you need. No point of wasting time adding tracks that you won’t get to anyway. *Refreshing* the Playlist. Occasionally you should check if some of the songs actually fit the overall mood of the set. If you notice yourself skipping certain songs, or not enjoying them as much, don’t hesitate to remove them. You can always find better ones instead. **Time For a New Set.**** However if you feel like the playlist no longer works for you, or it lost it’s energy boost, there’s no point in trying to redo the entire collection. Just make a new one. It’s nice to have two, three or four separate playlists that you can rotate between. Conclusion That’s pretty much it. As you can see it’s not a rocket science. But these steps do help, and can make your playlist a bit better. Or a lot better, depending if you have created your own set-list or not. I hope you will enjoy your mix even more now.

If you're not feeling great, you can either decide to sink further into the despair, or turn that feeling around and rise above the way you feel. It's like magic in the way it changes you. But there are certain times when you are feeling... something, and you're not quite sure what it is. Well, these are the playlists for you, designed specifically to feed those needs when you're not entirely certain what those needs are. These are the moods you didn't even know you had. 1. The rain is beating against your window and you feel a sort of mood but don't know what. This playlist is perfect for moments where you don't truly know what's going on. You might be lonely, you might be confused, you might just want to close your eyes and go to a new world. You're chill, but you might not be in the happiest place, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're in a bad place either. You're simply nowhere, and you can stay there when you listen to these tracks. 2. GURL, it's time to get pumped up just before your night out. This playlist is perfect for getting ready or hanging with your gal pals. Scream the tunes, boogie to the beat, and get yourself in the mood to have the best night of your life. Every once in a while you need those cheesy tunes to truly bask in the pleasure of being a female. We all do it: let's rejoice. 3. Grab some wine and ice-cream: You're feeling sad and you want to wallow in self-pity. This playlist is perfect for those imperfect moments. You're sad, and that's okay. It sometimes takes time to feel okay again, so if you want to bathe in a pool of your own tears, this playlist will definitely help. You might even turn that pool into an ocean whilst doing so. 4. You need to lift yourself back up. Here are some cheer you up songs This playlist is perfect for that crucial moment when you finally get a grip and say \"SCREW IT!\" You've been in a bad place but you're not going to let it define you, ruin or life, or change your day. Play this and get your life back on track and enjoy yourself whilst doing so. 5. Something so great has happened that it's the end of your movie and the credits are rolling. You know when everything comes together and you get that feeling of euphoria? This playlist is perfect for those momentous moments in life. Whether you've just got a promotion, kissed that person you've been crushing on for ages, or simply got out of bed, play this playlist and live that moment like you're the star of a movie. You deserve it. 6. You Know, a Playlist for *That* Mood This playlist is perfect for that exciting build up to when you know you're about to be up to no good. Chuck this on, have no regrets, and enjoy yourself. Be naughty. 7. Same as the Last One but You Actually Love the Person, LOL This playlist is perfect for those nights where you feel the love.

This playlist is perfect for the ones who can't keep still, who can't go a couple of months without exploring. Whether it be a road trip 20 miles from where you live, or going halfway around the globe; this is for those of you who are truly a nomad at heart. 10. Songs I can't relate to but hit me right in the feels anyway. This playlist is perfect for... a situation you cannot really describe, but think of it this way: You know when you listen to a certain track and you just get it, even if you can't truly connect with it? Those songs are just that: truly emotional, truly epic, but just that little bit separated that we can't relate just right now. 11. Songs that make you think you're a professional dancer even though you're far from it. This playlist is perfect for those of us who don't take ourselves too seriously. You might be in your house alone or you might be on the dancefloor with a thousand strangers, but whenever these jams beat their way into your brain, you can't help but shake what you got. And in your head... damn, you look FINE doing it. 12. Songs you can scream to when you're angry at that guy you'll 100 percent go back to. This playlist is perfect for when you're so frustrated you want to shake something... ANYTHING. But physical anger is never a good idea, so take the time to belt out these tunes and make your throat raw and rip apart to these songs to take out your anger. Trust me, screaming works. 13. You done with winter? Me too. Let's close our eyes and pretend it's summertime in our minds. This playlist is perfect for those of us who thrive in the hotter seasons, for those who feel happy when drops of sunlight hit their skin, and truly shine in the summertime. Even if the weather is drab, a little listen to this playlist can take you anywhere where you feel that tropical happiness. playlist About the Creator Leah Phillips reader, writer, wanderer. all social media = @leahphillipss Enjoyed the story?
