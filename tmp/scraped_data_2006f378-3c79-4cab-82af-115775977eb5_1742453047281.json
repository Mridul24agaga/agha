An AI video generator is a tool that generates videos from descriptions using artificial intelligence algorithms. These text-to-video generators use AI to create or enhance video content from text inputted by users. AI video generation helps craft high-quality videos without the need for expensive equipment, actors, or even video editing skills. What is the best AI video generator? The text-to-video feature in the AI video creator quickly generates videos from text with AI avatars and voices, making it the best text-to-video generator AI. Choose your ideal avatar, type your script, and generate talking head videos for your product releases, explainer videos, and more in minutes. What is a talking head video? A talking head video is one of the most common types of video used for e-Learning. It features a person, or the “Subject-Matter Expert” (SME), who directly addresses the viewer in an interview-like format. This video type is often shot from the chest or waist upwards, with the presenter either standing or sitting. Because of their human elements, talking head videos are suitable for building trust and connection with the target viewers. What differentiates talking head videos from other video types? What sets talking head videos apart from other video types is they let SMEs or instructors communicate directly through the camera, as if they're having a one-to-one conversation with learners. Talking head videos are ideal for brief and straightforward learning sessions, which users can access on their own time. With tools like an AI video generator from text, you can break down lengthy presentations into a series of shorter clips. Can AI create videos from text? Yes, it can! Type in the script you want the avatar to narrate or speak and choose from 300+ voices available in 40+ languages. Then, watch as AI generates your video in minutes.

Whether it’s a short social media clip or a polished promotional video, businesses of all sizes are leveraging videos to connect with their audience. For small businesses with limited budgets and resources, creating professional-quality videos might seem like a daunting task. However, AI video generators are leveling the playing field by making video creation more accessible, efficient, and cost-effective. Here are eight powerful ways AI video generators empower small businesses to thrive in a competitive market: Cost-Effective Video Production ----------------------------------- Hiring professional videographers, editors, and production teams can be prohibitively expensive for small businesses. AI video generators eliminate the need for large budgets by automating the entire video creation process. With tools like a free AI video generator, small businesses can create high-quality videos without incurring hefty production costs. These tools often come with pre-designed templates, stock footage, and easy-to-use editing features, enabling businesses to produce videos that look professional without breaking the bank. Time-Saving Automation -------------------------- Time is a precious resource for small business owners who are often juggling multiple responsibilities. Traditional video production can take weeks or even months to complete, but AI video generators significantly reduce the time required. By leveraging features like automated scene generation and voiceover creation, tools such as AI text to video allow users to create videos in minutes. This efficiency enables small businesses to keep up with the fast-paced demands of digital marketing. Enhanced Creativity with AI Assistance ------------------------------------------ One of the biggest challenges small business owners face is coming up with creative ideas for video content. AI video generators provide a solution by offering creative suggestions, pre-designed templates, and customization options. For example, an AI tool can analyze your script and suggest visuals, transitions, and background music that align with your message. This creative assistance helps even non-designers produce visually appealing and engaging videos that captivate their audience. Personalized Content for Targeted Marketing ----------------------------------------------- Personalization is key to successful marketing campaigns. AI video generators enable small businesses to create personalized content tailored to their target audience. These tools can analyze customer data, such as demographics, preferences, and past interactions, to generate videos that resonate with specific segments. For instance, a local bakery could use AI to create personalized holiday greeting videos for its loyal customers, strengthening relationships and fostering brand loyalty. Scalability for Growing Businesses -------------------------------------- As small businesses grow, their need for content increases. Manually producing a high volume of videos can strain resources, but AI video generators make scaling effortless. Businesses can create multiple videos simultaneously by repurposing existing content or using AI-powered tools to generate new videos based on templates. Whether it’s creating product demos, customer testimonials, or event highlights, AI ensures that businesses can scale their video production without compromising quality. SEO-Friendly Videos to Boost Visibility ------------------------------------------- Video content is a powerful tool for improving search engine optimization (SEO). Search engines prioritize video content, and having well-optimized videos can increase your website’s visibility. AI video generators help small businesses create SEO-friendly videos by automatically generating captions, transcripts, and keywords. Additionally, they can suggest optimal video lengths and formats for different platforms, ensuring your content reaches the widest audience possible. For example, a small fitness studio could use an AI tool to create workout tutorial videos optimized for YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, driving more traffic to its website and social media pages. Professional-Quality Results Without Expertise -------------------------------------------------- Many small business owners lack the technical skills required for professional video editing. AI video generators bridge this gap by offering user-friendly interfaces and automated features that produce polished results. These tools handle complex tasks such as color correction, audio balancing, and special effects, allowing users to focus on their message. With access to a free AI video generator, small businesses can create videos that rival those of larger companies, enhancing their brand’s image and credibility. Improved Engagement on Social Media --------------------------------------- Social media platforms thrive on video content, making it a vital component of any marketing strategy. AI video generators empower small businesses to create engaging, platform-specific content that drives likes, shares, and comments. From vertical videos for Instagram Stories to bite-sized clips for TikTok, these tools simplify the process of creating content tailored to different platforms. Additionally, AI can analyze engagement data and suggest adjustments to improve future video performance. For instance, a small boutique could use AI to create a series of short videos showcasing its new arrivals, complete with catchy music and captions. These videos can help attract new customers, increase brand awareness, and drive sales. Conclusion AI video generators are transforming the way small businesses approach video content creation. By offering cost-effective, time-saving, and user-friendly solutions, these tools empower businesses to compete in the digital age without requiring extensive resources or expertise. Whether it’s enhancing creativity, personalizing content, or improving social media engagement, AI video generators provide small businesses with the tools they need to succeed. If you’re a small business owner looking to elevate your marketing strategy, consider exploring tools like AI text to video. With the right AI-powered video generator, you can create compelling content that captures your audience’s attention and drives your business forward.

Producing video is not. Planning, writing, hiring, and editing is a painstaking process that can take days, weeks, or even months. And if you need animations or visual effects, it often requires costly post-production and extensive editing skills. This is where generative AI can help. In the past year, AI video generation tools have advanced at a rapid clip, help you slash the time it takes to go from idea to mp4.

After two weeks of testing, here are my picks in 2025 for the best platforms to create and edit stunning videos. The best generative AI video creation tools in 2025 Kling: Best for high-quality, realistic videos Hailuo Minimax: Best for long, complex scenes Sora: Best for speed and realism Runway: Best for cinematic production and editing Pika: Best for personalization and social media Magic Hour: Best for video manipulation and free tools Hunyuan: Best for open-source flexibility Luma Labs: Best for cinematic mood and lighting Domo: Best for anime-style video transformations Genmo: Best for open-source and web app accessibility What makes the best generative AI video platform? How we evaluate products Our best product articles are written by our cofounders, who have spent extensive time building, using, and testing AI tools. For this article, I spent a week testing the top generative AI video platforms on a variety of dimensions, examining how well they handle prompts, quality, and customizability. No company pays for placement here—we choose the best based on features, performance, and who they’re best suited for. What defines a great generative AI video platform? It comes down to a few key factors: Quality outputs. The best AI video platforms produce high-quality visuals that look great on both small screens and big ones. While photorealism is still often hit-or-miss, the top tools can create coherent, accurate sequences consistently. Ease of use. Generative AI video is still new, so a good platform should be simple enough for the average person to pick up. It should offer solid user interfaces, tutorials, and support. Beginners and experienced creators alike should be able get value out of these tools. Customization and creative control. A standout feature of AI video tools is how much you can guide the output. The best platforms let you tweak camera angles, art styles, and use image and video inputs so you get closer to what you imagined. Unique features and specialization. Some platforms have a “wow” factor that sets them apart, whether it’s lightning-fast iteration, artistic style transfers, or niche features. These unique aspects can add a lot of value for certain users and help them reach their goals. Most importantly, these tools should save you time. Instead of animating individua frame or searching large stock libraries for good clips, you can simply type what you need or drag and drop inputs to let AI to do the work. As a result, you can spend less time on the tedious parts of video production and more time on the creative aspects. The best generative AI video tools at a glance | Product | Best for | Modalities | Platforms | Free plan | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Kling | High quality, realistic output | Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video | Web, API | Yes, with daily credits and watermark | | Sora | Realistic, fast, wide-ranging output | Text-to-Video | Web | No | | Hailuo Minimax | Complex and long videos | Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video | Web, API | Yes, with daily credits and watermark | | Runway | Cinematic output and editing | Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video, Video-to-Video, AI editing tools | Web, iOS, API | Yes, with one-time credits and watermark | | Pika | Experimental multi-input videos | Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video, Video-to-Video | Web, iOS, API | Yes, with monthly credits and watermark | | Magic Hour | Video manipulation, animation, and free tools | Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video, Video-to-Video, AI editing tools | Web, API | Yes, with free tools, daily credits, and watermark | | Hunyuan | Open-source, local generation | Text-to-Video, Video-to-Video | Open Source | Yes, if you run it locally or are in China | | Luma Labs | Long image-to-video generations | Image-to-Video | Web, iOS, API | Yes, with monthly credits and watermark | | Domo | Anime video-to-video | Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video, Video-to-Video | Web | No | Best Generative AI Video Platform Overall Kling (Web, API) Kling pros: Consistent high-quality, realistic text-to-video and image-to-video generation Generous daily usage with up to 6 free daily videos (5 seconds each) Advanced features such as motion control and start and end frame options Kling cons: Training data skews towards Asian subjects Restrictive content moderation on both prompts and output API pricing is prohibitively expensive If you’re looking for a generative AI video platform that delivers consistent, high-quality results, Kling is hard to beat. With up to 6 free videos a day and advanced features like motion control and start/end frames, it’s designed for users who want professional-grade videos without the hassle. That said, it’s not without its quirks. The training data leans heavily toward Asian subjects, which can limit diversity in output, and their strict content moderation can feel restrictive. Plus, the API pricing isn’t cheap—so if you’re on a tight budget, it might not be the best fit. But if quality and reliability are your top priorities, Kling’s capabilities make it worth considering. Price: Free for limited previews. Paid plans unlock advanced features and higher limits. Best Generative AI Video Platform for Quality Sora (Web) Sora pros: Free with ChatGPT Plus (50 videos per month) Unlimited videos with ChatGPT Pro ($200 per month) Extremely fast, realistic, and diverse generations Sora cons: ChatGPT Pro is expensive at $200 per month Restrictive when generating videos featuring people Web app is unintuitive, and no API is available If you’re all about speed and quality, Sora is in a league of its own. The platform generates stunningly realistic and diverse videos at an impressive speed, making it ideal for anyone who values fast results without compromising on output quality. However, it’s not for everyone. The $200 monthly cost for unlimited videos with ChatGPT Pro might be a stretch for casual users, and its strict limitations on videos with people can feel limiting. Plus, the web app isn’t exactly user-friendly, and the lack of an API means you’re stuck working within their interface. But for those who need high-quality videos quickly—whether you’re prototyping, storytelling, or creating polished content—Sora delivers exceptional results. Sora price: Free with ChatGPT Plus. Pro plan unlock unlimited videos upon GPU availability. Best Generative AI Video Platform for Long Complex Scenes Hailuo Minimax (Web, API) Hailuo Minimax pros: Excellent at handling long, complex prompts Smoothly transitions between multiple scenes within a single prompt Produces cinematic, visually stunning output Hailuo Minimax cons: Limited feature set compared to other platforms Minimal control options outside of prompt adjustments Motion blur issues during fast movements If you’re working on a project that requires intricate storytelling or seamless transitions between multiple scenes, Hailuo Minimax is the platform to beat. Its ability to interpret long, detailed prompts and generate cinematic-quality videos makes it a standout for creators with ambitious ideas. However, it’s not without its challenges. While the cinematic output is impressive, the feature set is barebones, meaning most adjustments have to be made through prompt refinement.

The platform also includes a robust set of editing features, like background removal, making it a great all-in-one solution for filmmakers. However, Runway isn’t without its challenges.

With features like Ingredients for injecting specific faces or objects and Pikaffects for eye-catching effects, it’s ideal for social media, memes, or quick, engaging content.

Best Generative AI Video Platform for Developers Hunyuan (Open Source) Hunyuan Pros: Completely free Highest-quality open-source text-to-video model available Active community of developers contributing to continuous improvements Hunyuan Cons: Requires developer knowledge and access to sufficient compute resources May lose its edge as the best open-source model as new competitors emerge Not beginner-friendly for those without technical experience For developers and enthusiasts who value open-source flexibility, Hunyuan is the leading option for text-to-video generation. With its active developer community and support for loras, it’s a platform designed for customization and innovation. If you’re looking to tweak, train, or integrate video generation into your own applications, Hunyuan provides the tools and freedom to make it happen. However, it’s not for the faint of heart. Getting the most out of Hunyuan requires a solid technical background and access to adequate compute resources. While its quality is impressive, its position as the top open-source model may be challenged as the space evolves. For those willing to put in the work, Hunyuan is a powerful tool for creating personalized, high-quality video outputs with open-source flexibility. Hunyuan Price: Free to use with open-source access. Paid cloud-based options may vary by provider for enhanced rendering capabilities. Best Generative AI Video Platform for Cinematic Mood and Lighting Luma Labs (Web, iOS, API) Luma Labs Pros: Exceptional handling of atmospheric lighting and mood Capable of creating emotional, cinematic scenes Useful for mood boards and evocative storytelling Luma Labs Cons: Limited to image-to-video functionality Quality and consistency can be unpredictable, often resulting in flat outputs Video features are hard to access, overshadowed by image-generation tools Luma Labs stands out for its ability to craft visually rich, emotionally evocative scenes, making it a strong choice for projects that demand cinematic mood and lighting. Its focus on atmosphere allows creators to bring dramatic storytelling to life, even within the constraints of its image-to-video feature set. However, it requires patience and experimentation due to its inconsistent output and buried video tools. If your primary goal is creating visually striking, atmospheric videos, Luma Labs offers a unique set of strengths. Luma Labs Price: Limited free renders. Paid plans unlock more exports and higher resolution. Best Generative AI Video Platform for Anime Style Video-to-Video Domo (Web) Domo Pros: Consistent and stable video-to-video transformations User-friendly interface makes it accessible for all skill levels Large Discord community with active product integration Domo Cons: Performance is limited outside of video-to-video functionality Quality may not meet the standards of professional production needs Offers limited customization beyond basic style transformations Domo is the go-to platform for anime-style video-to-video editing, delivering reliable transformations that stay true to the original content while applying a distinct anime aesthetic. With a user-friendly interface and a supportive community, it’s an ideal choice for creators looking to explore this niche style without a steep learning curve. While Domo excels at video-to-video work, it falls short when it comes to broader applications like text-to-video or complex customizations. The quality, while consistent, might not meet the demands of high-end professional projects, but it’s more than sufficient for social media, fan content, or creative experimentation. Domo Price: Trial credits available. Paid plans unlock extended features and higher-quality outputs. Best Generative AI Video Platform for Open Source Experimentation Genmo (Web, Open Source) Genmo Pros: Mochi 1 is open-source, enabling local running and full customizability Web app available for quick testing and experimentation Mochi Edit is a strong open-source model for video editing Genmo Cons: Output quality is lower compared to competitors Limited stylistic controls compared to more polished platforms Struggles with prompt adherence, especially for pop culture-related requests Genmo strikes a balance between open-source flexibility and web-based convenience. Whether you’re looking to run models locally for full control or prefer the ease of testing ideas on a web app, Genmo has you covered. Its Mochi Edit tool is particularly noteworthy for video editing, offering a robust option for creators who value open-source tools. However, Genmo’s quality doesn’t quite match that of more advanced competitors, and its stylistic control options are limited. Prompt adherence, especially for pop culture themes, can be hit or miss, making it less reliable for highly specific creative needs. For developers and creators who prioritize customization and accessibility, Genmo provides a unique platform that bridges the gap between open-source flexibility and user-friendly web-based tools. Genmo Price: Limited free credits. Paid plans vary based on usage and features. How we chose these generative AI video tools Just like in our other product reviews, I spent countless hours researching, testing, and comparing these platforms.

Generate Al videos with just text Create AI-Generated Videos Using Simple Prompts Try for free 1. Invideo AI Ready to make pro-level videos without the pro-level stress? Things are about to get easier with invideo AI by your side (even if you’re an absolute beginner). Forget the hefty investment in cameras and gear. With invideo AI, all you need to do is “imagine” what kind of video you want to produce and give a prompt based on that (e.g. create a video on “5 productivity tips and use American male accent”, and voilà – it’ll transform your ideas into stunning videos within minutes! So whether you're a budding entrepreneur, a content creator, or a marketer aiming to build your online presence, invideo AI will be your go-to tool. Best For: Pretty much everything! With invideo AI you can make professional-quality videos for YouTube channel, Instagram reels, TikTok, and other purposes such as social media posts, marketing campaigns, and product demos. Top Features: 1. Extensive Stock Media Library Invideo's artificial intelligence video generator gives you access to more than 16 million stock photos and videos. This helps you easily search and put the right video clips into any part of your video. If you need a specific picture or multiple photos, it quickly looks through this big collection pile and picks the best ones. This makes sure your video looks good and matches the requirements. 2. Text Prompt Video Editing This tool makes video editing easier by letting you fix things with easy words or phrases. It's like telling a human video editor what to do, but it's even easier with a tool. Need to remove a scene, use different stock footage, or change the accent? Just give a prompt, and the AI will do the rest. This makes editing easier, even if you don't know much about editing. 3. AI-Powered Script Generation Invideo's AI script maker helps you make interesting, custom scripts for any video project, which saves you a lot of time in writing scripts. This tool is especially useful for platforms like YouTube, where your content needs to be intriguing enough to engage people & grow your channel. 4. Affordable Voiceover Alternatives The AI voiceover generator is a cheaper option than paying for professional voice actors. It makes a speech that sounds like a human in multiple accents, understanding the feeling, intent, and emotion behind each word. This function makes your videos feel alive, adding a professional look without costing too much. Pros It quickly changes your words into videos, making creating content more manageable. You can spend more time on your work and less on technical stuff. With more than 16 million stock media choices, you have access to a unique selection of pictures. This is perfect if you want to create top-notch quality videos without investing hours in creating them. AI-powered script generation can save you a lot of time in making regular, good-quality video content. It's especially helpful if you often face writer's block or have tight schedules. The AI voiceover generator tool can save money while still giving a good sound experience. This is really helpful if you own a small business or are an individual creator. Cons Initially, you might need some time to learn how to interact with the AI well to get the results you want. However, as you proceed, this eventually gets easier as the interface itself is pretty user-friendly. The free version includes watermarks. But, this is a small worry because the paid version starts at just $25/month and gives you a ton of premium features. Pricing Basic: Free Plus: $25/month Max: $60/month (The yearly plans start as low as $20/month) Sign up for invideo AI and start creating high-quality videos within minutes. Try online AI video maker Create high-quality videos for your business with AI video maker easily Get Started Now 2. Descript Do you need help with problems like evoking human facial expressions and emotional responses or the technical bottlenecks that make the video generation process time-consuming? If yes, Descript can help your creative workflow and enrich the quality of your output, making it more high-end and appealing. Moreover, it also realizes the significance of the human side of video production as it's not designed to replace human creativity but to make it better, to give you a vision, and to let the AI do the heavy lifting. Best For: As such, it's best suited to content creators, podcasters, and filmmakers who need to save time and get things done the right way. Because it is a text-based editing system, even the not-so-tech-savvy can use it. Top Features: 1. Automated Transcription Manually transcribing audio and video is time-consuming. To save time, Descript automatically transcribes all your recordings. Since the transcription is merely a text file, if you edit the transcription content, you can also edit the audio or video file itself. 2. Overdub Voice Cloning With Descript's Overdub function, you can type in the missing or correct text and then artificially generate the new audio in your voice or that of the guest. Creating a voice clone of this type involves using a voice sample to make the process convenient and smooth. 3. Studio Sound Editing Poor audio quality can negatively impact great content. Descript tackles this problem with its Studio Sound feature, which applies state-of-the-art AI to enhance the sound quality of audio files. It eliminates noise, hum, and distortion, giving a cleaner and more professional studio-type sound. 4. Video Green Screen and AI Eye Contact The green screen background editor lets you change the environment behind the video, just like a Zoom feature, so you can have more control over how you present your content. This facilitates the humanizing of the video and adds to its realism. Pros It offers a fantastic transcription tool that can automatically transcribe audio and video files into text in 23 languages. It's a handy platform that lets you cut, rearrange, or alter the contents and simplifies editing. It improves the recorded audio quality by making the spoken words much clearer. This makes your content sound super-smooth without you having to edit out one word at a time. Descript also integrates with other platforms such as Slack (a team communication tool), Podbean (podcast hosting platform), Restream (a LIVE streaming studio), and even Final Cut Pro (a professional video editing application), to name a few. You also get tutorials on using the platform to help you quickly master the features and make the most of it. Cons The learning curve for Descript isn't very gentle for someone used to text-based editing. At first, this may seem patchy, but it is difficult for users of conventional timeline-based editing tools to work. Descript boasts a full range of powerful tools but may not meet the requirements of professional-level video editing. It doesn’t even provide the convenient access to advanced effects and controls that a professional editing package would provide. Pricing is a per-person, per-month fee. This can be costly for teams or organizations with many people, primarily if more than one person uses the software. Pricing Free Tier Creator Tier: $15 per user per month Pro Tier: $30 per user per month Enterprise Tier: Custom 3. Runway Runway is an advanced AI text-to-video generator that challenges how creative content is produced and edited.

This is a valuable feature that lets you produce high-quality images, making it most suitable for tasks needing fine detail work. 4. Noise Reduction and Image Stabilization Noise reduction cleans up noisy or grainy photos, and image stabilization smoothes out shaky videos. Working together, they make your content refined and stylish. 5. Research and Innovation With generative AI, Runway ML will continue to be at the leading edge. As a user, you can enjoy the most advanced and revolutionary developments in this discipline. This means you are always testing the limits of possibility in generative A.I. Pros You can make your creative ideas into reality just by putting them in text. It provides unprecedented freedom of video creation, making it easy to think of and do any style or concept. The platform allows you to apply the style of any one image or prompt to every frame of your video. This is a very important feature in terms of maintaining your visual style consistency across all your video production. Based on mockups, Runway ML can turn out fully stylized and animated renders. This is especially helpful to designers and creators in creating a vibrant, engaging way to present their ideas. It’s easy to cut out subjects in your video and change them as you like with simple text commands. This lets you easily make specific modifications to individual elements in your video. By inputting an image or prompt, Runway ML can increase the realness of untextured renders. This is useful in creating realistic-looking images. Cons You might require a lot of computing resources and time. More complex tasks or high resolutions result in higher resource costs, and this may restrict its availability to users with less powerful hardware. At times, the input prompt is vague or contradictory, whereas Runway ML may produce artifacts or inconsistencies in the generated content. It may still need further smoothing out and cutting. Pricing Basic: Free Standard: $15 per user per month Pro: $35 per user per month Unlimited: $95 per user per month Enterprise: Custom 4. Fliki Fliki is another great free AI text-to-video generator that also has paid versions, letting you create videos as easily as sitting down and writing a few sentences. Aside from its practical aspects, Fliki is also fuelling a larger shift in content culture. It is just the right tool for creators and marketers to keep up with trends towards video over text and attract their audience’s attention. Best For: Fliki AI has become especially popular with bloggers, podcasters, YouTubers, and marketing experts, who use it to create interesting promotional materials. Top Features: 1. Access to Millions of Stock Media Fliki offers millions of photos, videos, and audio to improve your videos with top-notch images and audio. It's great for tasks like making professional presentations or doing personal creative work, as it has many styles and themes. 2. Over 2000 Realistic Text-to-Speech Voices Across 75+ Languages It removes the need for expensive voice samples and recording tools. It provides an easy and affordable way to change text into everyday, professional-sounding speech in multiple languages and accents. 3. Text to Video Fliki's Text to Video tool lets you easily convert text or notes into fascinating visuals using AI sounds and a comprehensive media collection. 4.

This feature is good for making things stand out, personal projects, and adding a special flair to the content. 5. AI Voiceovers Fliki uses AI Voiceovers to change text into realistic voices made by AI. These sounds are human-like, which gives a realistic touch to your videos and doesn’t make them sound mechanical. Pros The tool's interface is quite simple and easy. You won't be distracted by technical difficulties but can focus on your creativity. The audio quality of the voiceover is very natural and professional. This gives your videos a real feel to them, increasing the satisfaction of their viewers. It is also replete with a vast stock library for your creativity, which is one of the tool's real treasures. You'll find a diverse selection of images, video clips, and music alike. This library saves you from the trouble of searching for the right file everywhere by making it easier to track down materials from various places. Cost-wise, the tool is quite economical. You can even get better results with it than hiring professionals to do voice-over work. This reasonably priced special feature makes it ideal for any creators with limited amounts of money but ample amounts of content. Cons It does not offer great variety in pictorial variations. Though many options are there, these still might need to fit exactly your creative vision. You might experience glitches and bugs. These technical fumblings can be a bit of a roadblock to your work but are often just remediable with updates or support services. It provides a limited number of minutes per month at no charge. But that's a limit if you are doing really large projects or creating lots of output. Perhaps you would have to limit yourself and decide when to use it or spend extra for a paid plan. Convert text to video with AI Generate a video with just text Try Text to Video Pricing Free Plan Standard Plan: $21 per month for annual plan Premium Plan: $66 per month for annual plan 5. Visla Looking for the best AI video generator from text? Visla can be your right choice for a storytelling tool powered by AI that makes the entire process simpler. It has been fashioned as an easily accessible and powerful platform for a wide variety of users engaged in marketing, education, and other activities. Its most noteworthy feature is the ability to promote collaboration and improve workflow efficiency to quickly turn your ideas into videos. This lets you use storytelling and communication techniques with greater precision and effectiveness! Best For: Visla is the perfect option for developing and producing videos for marketing and sales, engineering, content creation, social media, team communications, customer service, and even personal branding. This is precisely what makes it so useful for professionals and teams to develop their own strategies for using storytelling to interact with audiences. Top Features: 1. Collaboration and Feedback Visla makes it simple to share your videos with your team or readers. In other words, you can use videos with other people, and you can receive others’ feedback. 2. Versatility for Various Industries Whether you work in marketing, sales, teaching, entertainment, or some other field, it's made to fit in wherever people work. 3. Diverse Use Cases Visla is just good for a variety of these video activities. You can create videos for social media, record personal messages to customers, recap meetings, convert old videos into new uses, or shoot videos for teaching and learning. It's like having one tool to deal with just about any job! 4. AI Summary Visla provides a feature that allows the main points of a text to be immediately grasped. Using AI, it discovers the key points, such as the keywords or main topics, or otherwise makes a long transcript short. 5. Teleprompter Mode Afraid you might have forgotten something or won't do a good job of expressing what is on your mind? This is where the teleprompter mode helps by letting you read from your marks instead of into the lens. This makes you look more confident and you don't lose your audience as you can make eye contact. 6. Community Hub Within the community hub, you can participate in discussions, seek advice, exchange experiences, and even receive ideas from other users. It's a place where you can get to know people using Visla too, help, and learn from one another. Pros Visla gives users the ability to create high-quality videos, working from the most minimal of ideas, perhaps even just a script. The platform can also be used to cover such tasks as writing scripts, narrating in its own voice, choosing the right pieces of video to show, and so on. Its AI-assisted editing functionality can even remove unwanted portions of video with an automatic effect. It has a comprehensible, easy interface, despite its many functions, which means that it can be used by people at every skill level. It allows a first-time user to become proficient with it only really requiring a timer, so that after only 2-3 minutes one can become accustomed. Visla's free subscription plan is particularly generous, as it allows publishers up to 50 minutes of video free of charge every month. This time is longer than most. Of course, there is also a great deal of access to the free version, which offers many of the platform’s main functions. It also comes with all the tools to aid in video production. With narration-assistance features powered by AI, screen recording functions for demonstration videos, text overlays for social media interviews, and so much more. Cons The inability to generate images is one major shortcoming of Visla compared to tools using coherent AI. To make up for this shortcoming, users who want to add this functionality have to feed suitable images to an external AI image generator before importing them into Visla. Exporting videos before downloading them can be very time-consuming. Likewise, the download speeds are quite slow. Even when Visla generates videos itself, it doesn't happen instantaneously, and it can still take a couple of minutes. The computer-generated script might contain mistakes that must be checked and corrected by a human. In addition, since the AI voiceover sometimes pronounces words incorrectly, this might affect the quality of the narrative. Pricing Basic: Free Plan Premium: $24 per month 6. Opus Clip Opus Clip converts full-length videos into short viral videos, and it shines through its comprehensive video content analysis capability. It also determines which parts are most effective and assembles them in easily digestible short clippings. It also employs cutting-edge artificial intelligence-enhanced functions such as AI Curation, AI Virality Score, and AI Emoji Generator to boost the attractiveness and virality of the content. All in all, it provides a great balance between accessibility and advanced, AI-assisted functionality, for newbies and experienced users too! Best For: Converting long-form video content into short clips that can go viral. It uses AI to help you create fun short videos with little effort. Top Features: 1. AI Curation This feature uses GPT-4 Turbo, the most advanced artificial intelligence, to take a long video and pick out the most intriguing segments. The selected parts are then crafted together into an attention-grabbing and compact short clip. Not only can it intelligently choose the segments, but it can also put this into a narrative framework, presenting the video in an organized, entertaining manner. 2. AI Virality Score Using AI and big data analysis of thousands of viral videos, Opus Clip attaches a score for its virality to each clip. With this score, you get a better idea of the potential impact of the cut, and you can use data to make decisions on the best way to maximize reach and engagement. 3. AI Co-Pilot With this feature, you have greater control over the video editing process. You can specify the time frames in your video to clip and make more focused and accurate content. 4. Active Speaker Detection Using predictive AI, Opus Clip analyzes and follows moving faces in the video. This enables you to keep your guests' (or, if you decide to take your own) face in the middle of the video frame. It makes your content more concentrated and professional-looking. 5. AI Keyword Highlighter With this tool, your video captions' important keywords are automatically selected and highlighted which can help to attain higher viewer engagement rates. 6. AI Emoji Generator The power of emojis is not lost on Opus Clip, which automatically adds suitable emojis to your video content. Pros It makes the video production process much faster. In other words, if a video project normally takes an hour, with Opus Clip it could be done in a few minutes. Part of the timesaving potential is especially useful for those who have to produce large amounts of video regularly. With the free trial, you can test the tool without risking any money. You can upload up to 120 minutes of video for free to test its features and determine whether or not it is right for you. This multi-language support makes the tool easier to use in different regions and audiences. This is particularly helpful for creators of content and content generators for whom English is their main language and they’re targeting an international audience or simply working in a multilingual environment. Its useful first paragraph-generating capabilities alone make it a game-changer when it comes to attracting viewers from the start. Cons Opus Clip may be a powerful software, but you would have to invest significant time and effort far beyond just learning how to use the product before you can master its full range of features. This learning curve could be an obstacle for those who need to quickly produce results without going into too much technical detail. Its effectiveness depends on the quality of the input video. If the original content was lousily shot or edited, it might not be able to finely tune it. While customization options are there, they may not meet all requirements or individual preferences of users. For some, this is a drawback, especially if highly personal or unique video styles are needed. The default caption may not be to everyone's tastes and could undermine creative expression.

Small businesses often face resource constraints, making it challenging to produce high-quality content consistently. AI video generation tools like VideoFission and others offer powerful solutions to overcome these obstacles and accelerate marketing efforts. Here are several ways AI-generated videos can benefit small businesses: 1. Cost-Effective Video Production For small businesses, traditional video production (with equipment, editing, and professional help) can be expensive. AI tools remove much of the complexity and high costs by automating the process. Small businesses can create professional-looking videos without the need for expensive equipment or hiring a full production team. AI tools like VideoFission can automatically generate videos from text, images, or raw footage, ensuring the process is streamlined and budget-friendly. Minimal Setup Costs: Many AI video generation platforms offer subscription models with relatively low upfront costs, making them more accessible to small businesses with limited budgets. 2. Speed and Efficiency Creating high-quality video content traditionally requires a lot of time and effort. Small businesses often struggle with meeting deadlines or keeping up with the fast-paced demands of content marketing. AI video creation tools significantly reduce the time spent on video production. Automated Editing: AI tools can automatically cut footage, select the best scenes, and apply transitions and effects, reducing the manual editing process. Instant Video Creation: With AI-powered platforms, small businesses can generate a polished video in minutes instead of hours or days. This allows for rapid content production, ideal for time-sensitive campaigns. 3. Consistency Across Multiple Campaigns Maintaining brand consistency across different marketing channels is crucial, especially for small businesses trying to build recognition. AI video platforms can help businesses create consistent video content that aligns with their brand identity. Custom Templates: Many AI video tools come with customizable templates, allowing small businesses to create videos with consistent visuals, colors, and fonts that align with their branding. Batch Creation: Tools like VideoFission allow users to generate multiple videos at once with the same templates, ensuring consistent quality across all content. 4. Multi-Platform Distribution Small businesses often operate with limited resources, meaning they can't afford to manually upload and optimize videos for every platform. AI tools can make this process much more efficient by providing multi-platform distribution features. One-Click Publishing: AI video generators like VideoFission enable businesses to distribute videos across platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and more, all at once. Auto-Optimization: These tools can automatically adjust the video’s format, resolution, and aspect ratio to fit the specific requirements of each platform, saving time and effort. 5. Improved Engagement Through Personalization AI-generated videos can be tailored to specific audience segments, improving engagement and conversions. Targeted Content: AI tools can analyze customer data and help businesses create videos tailored to specific demographics or buyer personas. For example, businesses can create different videos for social media followers, email subscribers, or website visitors based on their interests and behaviors. Dynamic Elements: Some AI video platforms allow businesses to add personalized elements like customer names or product recommendations directly into the video, creating a more engaging experience. 6. Real-Time Performance Insights For small businesses, measuring the effectiveness of their video marketing efforts is crucial. AI video platforms typically come with built-in analytics tools that provide real-time insights into how videos are performing across various platforms. Engagement Metrics: AI tools like VideoFission offer detailed analytics on viewership, retention, engagement (likes, shares, comments), and audience demographics. This data helps businesses understand what type of content resonates with their audience and adjust future video strategies accordingly. Optimization: Based on real-time data, AI tools can provide recommendations to optimize future videos—whether it’s adjusting the video’s length, content, or distribution strategy. 7. Scalability for Growing Businesses As small businesses grow, their content needs will expand. AI-generated videos offer the scalability to meet increasing demand without significantly increasing costs or resources. Batch Production: Many AI tools allow businesses to generate multiple variations of videos in one go, perfect for A/B testing or creating video ads for different target groups. Ad Campaigns: AI video generators are ideal for scaling paid ad campaigns. Businesses can create video ads quickly and in large numbers, experimenting with different formats, messages, and visuals. 8. No Expertise Required Video creation typically requires specialized skills like video editing, scriptwriting, and storytelling, which may be difficult for small businesses with limited expertise in-house. AI tools eliminate the need for technical skills, empowering business owners, marketers, and teams to create high-quality videos with minimal training. Beginner-Friendly: Platforms like VideoFission offer intuitive interfaces that guide users through the entire video creation process—from uploading content to publishing the final product. Automated Narration: AI tools can even generate voiceovers or add captions automatically, removing the need for professional voice actors or transcribing content manually. 9. Enhanced Customer Interaction and Education AI-generated videos can also help small businesses provide value to their customers through educational or informative content, boosting customer loyalty and trust. Explainer Videos: Small businesses can create product demos, tutorials, or service explanations that clearly communicate their value proposition to potential customers. Customer Testimonials: AI tools can help businesses create compelling customer testimonial videos by integrating text, audio, and visuals seamlessly. 10. Accessibility to Social Media and Content Marketing Small businesses often struggle with maintaining an active presence on social media due to resource limitations. AI-generated videos provide a way for businesses to maintain a continuous flow of fresh and engaging content for their followers. Social Media Marketing: Videos are more engaging than static images or text on social media platforms. AI tools help small businesses produce videos specifically tailored for the fast-paced nature of platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, leading to higher engagement rates. Repurposing Content: AI tools like Pictory help businesses repurpose long-form content (e.g., blogs, podcasts, or webinars) into short, shareable videos, maximizing the ROI of existing content. Conclusion AI-generated videos are a game-changer for small businesses looking to scale their video marketing efforts. With cost-effective, fast, and easy-to-use tools, small businesses can produce high-quality videos, optimize them for various platforms, and engage their audience without the need for extensive technical skills.

This innovative technology, expected to be integrated into ChatGPT, promises to level the playing field for small enterprises competing in an increasingly digital marketplace. Democratizing Video Production Sora’s integration with ChatGPT could dramatically reduce the barriers to entry for small businesses looking to create professional-quality video content. By automating complex tasks and streamlining the production process, Sora is expected to slash both the time and costs associated with video creation. “This technology enables small companies and novices to produce professional-quality content without investing in expensive crews or sophisticated equipment,” said a spokesperson from Yuzzit, a video content creation platform. Enhancing Marketing Strategies The advent of AI-generated video is set to transform small business marketing strategies: Cost-Effective Production: Small businesses can now create high-quality videos at a fraction of the traditional cost. Rapid Content Creation: The ability to quickly generate videos based on trending topics or promotional content descriptions will allow businesses to capitalize on time-sensitive opportunities. Personalized Customer Engagement: AI-generated videos can be used to create personalized responses to customer queries, enhancing the overall customer experience. Scaling and Customization One of the most significant advantages for small businesses is the ability to scale video production without compromising quality. AI algorithms can quickly generate multiple variations of the same video content, allowing businesses to cater to different market segments and increase their reach. Challenges and Considerations While the potential benefits are substantial, experts caution that the technology is still evolving. Small business owners should be aware of potential limitations in customization options and the need to maintain a human touch in their marketing efforts. As Sora and similar AI video generation tools continue to develop, they are expected to become invaluable assets in the small business toolkit, enabling entrepreneurs to compete more effectively in the digital age. The integration of these technologies into platforms like ChatGPT signals a new era of accessible, high-quality video content creation for businesses of all sizes.

Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing industries, but its rapid expansion comes at a cost energy consumption. As AI models become more complex and widespread, the electricity needed to power data centers and train machine learning models is skyrocketing. This raises concerns about the environmental impact of AI and whether businesses can balance technological progress with sustainability. Training large AI models, like those behind ChatGPT or image generators, requires immense computing power. In fact, some estimates suggest that training a single advanced AI model can consume as much electricity as an entire small town in a year. This energy-intensive process puts strain on power grids and increases carbon emissions, making AI a growing contributor to environmental concerns. Another challenge is the cooling requirements of data centers. AI computations generate extreme heat, requiring energy-intensive cooling systems to prevent overheating. Data centers around the world use massive amounts of water and electricity to keep servers operational, leading to concerns about water scarcity and increased reliance on non-renewable energy sources. To address these issues, tech companies are exploring sustainable solutions. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have pledged to power their data centers with 100% renewable energy, investing in solar, wind, and hydroelectric sources. Additionally, energy-efficient AI chips are being developed to reduce the power demands of deep learning models. By optimizing hardware and improving software efficiency, businesses can lower their carbon footprint while maintaining AI performance. Another promising solution is AI itself. Ironically, AI is being used to improve energy efficiency, optimizing grid management, reducing waste, and predicting electricity demand to prevent overuse. AI-driven climate models are helping businesses and governments develop smarter energy policies that minimize environmental damage. The future of AI depends on finding a balance between innovation and sustainability. Businesses must prioritize green computing practices, invest in energy-efficient infrastructure, and explore AI models that require less computational power. The race to build smarter AI shouldn’t come at the cost of a sustainable planet and with the right strategies, it doesn’t have to. Continue Reading Business Successful Corporate Videos: Tailor Their Size for Different Channels Published 2 days agoon March 18, 2025 By Writer Regardless of the theme, such as testimonials, employee retention, recruitment, company culture, or something else, you will share the video content on various platforms for reach and quick impact. But can you post the same video everywhere? While the content can be the same, the video length must be suitable for each channel for better consumption. It can become blurry or stretched if not optimized properly, affecting the viewing experience. Due to this, user engagement will also suffer. Today, almost 60% of companies rely on videos for marketing and branding. 90% of marketing geniuses acknowledge their effectiveness in lead generation when made with proper specifications. If you want to benefit from this investment, ensure your videos satisfy the size requirements. You can attain the most versatile and crisp video quality with a careful approach. You won’t have to worry about these details when you are involved with a well-known corporate video production San Francisco company because they naturally follow best practices. Still, understanding these basic requirements is crucial. It helps you collaborate with the right partners on this journey. After all, video production is not a one-time event, especially if you want to scale your business. So let’s gather a few critical insights in this context. Website or Homepage Putting up your brand video on the official site is like running a traditional TV ad. Companies use this trick to help people familiarize themselves quickly with their brand. These videos can be 30 seconds to 1 minute long. A product demo video can also be three minutes long. However, this type of video cannot be placed at the top of the website’s fold. Landing page Visitors coming to your landing page need to be tickled with something meaningful. The good thing is that videos on this digital asset can be longer than those on the homepage. Still, try to convey your message in 90 seconds or fewer. Facebook On this platform, videos can be placed into sidebars, feeds, and inboxes. Each has unique upload requirements. For example, regular feed videos that appear on Facebook users’ feeds provide organic growth. These videos can measure 1280 x 720 pixels. Whether shot in square, portrait, or landscape, 1200 pixels is the minimum width. The file size can be 10 GB, and the recommended video length is a maximum of 240 minutes. YouTube Everyone feels they should make long-form videos here, but only experts know that the substance can be delivered quickly. Marketing videos on this channel can be two minutes long or shorter. Expansive ideas can be broken down into short videos like a web series. Furthermore, videos of about 15 to 30 seconds can also be made for YouTube. YouTube Shorts work well with the scrolling generation. Additional info: Videos can be divided into short, medium, and long forms. Short-length videos often run for 0 to 60 seconds. These can drive excellent engagement. However, the video size has to be perfect to hold the viewers’ attention. Medium-size videos with one to two minutes of content are posted on landing pages, LinkedIn, and Facebook. These videos get stable viewership, which allows you to use strong narratives as a theme. Long-form videos have a duration of more than two minutes. These are ideal picks for product explainers, educational content, etc. The best platforms include website pages and YouTube. An experienced agency can make your corporate videos successful. However, consider discussing these details during initial meetings to gauge their expertise and knowledge.

But AI is quickly evolving into something more: a coach, consultant, and even a therapist for business owners. More and more entrepreneurs are turning to AI not just to handle repetitive tasks but to help them make smarter decisions, stay on track with goals, and even manage stress. And with a growing number of AI-powered apps hitting the market, business owners now have access to personal coaching, strategy advice, and accountability support—without the hefty price tag of traditional consultants and mentors. AI as a Business Coach Finding a great business coach can be expensive and time-consuming, but AI-powered coaching apps are stepping in to fill the gap. Tools like Mindsera, Replika, and ChatGPT are offering personalized guidance based on real data, industry trends, and even behavioral patterns. Imagine having an AI that helps you refine your business strategy, set achievable goals, and track progress—all while learning from your habits and adjusting its advice accordingly. These AI coaches act like a mix of mentor and business strategist, helping entrepreneurs sharpen their thinking and take action. AI as a Business Consultant Hiring a consultant can cost thousands, but AI-driven consulting tools are changing the game. Platforms like AlphaSense, IBM Watson, and ChatGPT Enterprise can analyze massive amounts of data, track market trends, and offer actionable insights—all in real-time. Need help researching your competition? Looking for ways to improve your sales funnel? AI-powered consultants can now handle these tasks with impressive accuracy, making expert advice accessible to businesses of all sizes. AI as an Accountability Partner One of the toughest parts of running a business is staying disciplined. Without a boss or manager keeping tabs, it’s easy to push deadlines or get distracted. That’s why AI-powered accountability apps are taking off. Tools like Motion, Todoist AI, and Reclaim.ai act like virtual project managers, reminding you of important tasks, helping you structure your day, and nudging you to stay on track. Some apps even use psychology-based techniques to keep you motivated, ensuring you don’t fall into procrastination mode. AI as a Therapist for Entrepreneurs Running a business can be stressful, and entrepreneurs often struggle with burnout, anxiety, and self-doubt. AI-driven therapy apps are now helping business owners manage stress and improve mental well-being. Platforms like Woebot and Wysa offer AI-powered conversations based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), providing emotional support and practical coping strategies. While these AI therapists aren’t a replacement for human counselors, they offer a quick and private way to work through challenges and regain focus. A Wave of AI-Powered Support Apps With AI rapidly advancing, the number of apps designed to support entrepreneurs is exploding. Whether you need help planning your week, analyzing financial trends, or just a virtual nudge to stay productive, there’s an AI tool for that. As AI continues to evolve, businesses that embrace it beyond just automation—using it for strategy, coaching, and even mental wellness—will gain a serious edge. The future isn’t just about AI replacing tasks; it’s about AI becoming a true partner in success. Need help implementing ai in your business?

If you trade equity index futures tied to indices like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones, you know the stakes. Navigating this turbulence requires a focused approach. Here are some strategies to help you trade smarter during chaotic times. Understand the Impact of Volatility Volatility increases risk but also creates opportunity. Equity index futures are especially reactive as they reflect the broader market’s behavior. When prices swing wildly, you could gain big or lose just as much. Understanding how high or low volatility impacts these futures is critical. It helps you time your trades and adjust your strategies as the market shifts. You should also take time to assess overall market conditions. What’s driving the volatility? Is it economic data, unexpected news, or earnings season? Knowing the “why” behind a movement can influence how and when you trade. Define Your Risk Tolerance Before you jump into trades, know your limits. Volatility can wipe out a trader who overextends themselves without a clear risk strategy. Decide how much you’re willing to lose before placing a trade. Many traders rely on stop-loss orders, which automatically close trades at a set level to avoid bigger losses. Defining your risk tolerance also includes setting position sizes wisely. Don’t bet your entire account on one futures contract. Even seasoned traders keep their exposure small during uncertain times. Staying conservative can help you survive long enough to profit later. Stick to a Game Plan A clear trading plan is your best weapon in volatile markets. This plan should include entry and exit points, profit targets, and risk management strategies. Having structure reduces emotional decision-making, which is dangerous when markets are unpredictable. For instance, if equity index futures surge, stick to your plan instead of chasing the trade. It’s tempting to jump in late, but this often leads to poor decisions. Volatility rewards discipline, not impulsive moves. Consistency will deliver better results over time. Use Technical Analysis Wisely Charts and patterns are a trader’s roadmap. They can help you anticipate price movements, even in choppy markets. Key indicators like Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Averages can be particularly useful. For example, Bollinger Bands expand during high volatility, showing you the range of price movement. If prices hit the upper band frequently, the asset may be overbought. Meanwhile, the RSI can signal whether an index is overbought or oversold, helping pinpoint potential reversals. Using these tools doesn’t guarantee success, but it can improve your odds of making an informed trade. Take Advantage of Short-Term Moves Volatile markets are ideal for short-term strategies. Swing trading and day trading work well when prices are unpredictable. Instead of aiming for long-term trends, you focus on capturing smaller gains over a shorter timeframe. When using these strategies, look for opportunities in sharp price movements. If equity index futures pull back after a sudden rise, consider snatching up lower-priced contracts. Similarly, be ready to close positions quickly when you meet your profit target. Hesitating too long can erase gains in fast-moving markets. Watch Market Correlations Volatility often affects more than just one market. Equity index futures are closely tied to stock market performance, but other markets, like bonds or commodities, may hint at what’s coming. For example, when stock indices drop, safe-haven assets like gold may rise. Watching these relationships can provide clues to guide your trades. Currency markets can also be a good indicator. If the U.S. dollar strengthens, foreign investments might weaken equity index futures tied to American stocks. These signals give you context beyond the futures charts. Use Limit Orders Slippage is common in volatile markets. This happens when your trade executes at a different price than you planned due to rapid market movements. Limit orders can help you avoid surprises. These orders specify the exact price you’re willing to pay or accept for a contract. With equity index futures, precision is key. A limit order prevents you from overpaying or selling for less during fast-moving conditions. While it’s not failproof, it keeps you in control to an extent. Learn from Wins and Losses Volatility provides a real-world lesson for traders. Each trade offers insight into what works and what doesn’t in chaotic markets. Whether you succeed or fail, review your trades regularly. Were your entries timed well? Did you exit too late? How could you improve your strategy? The more you review and refine, the better you’ll handle future volatility. Trading equity index futures in volatile markets isn’t easy, but it’s doable with the right approach. Understand market dynamics, set clear goals, and stay disciplined. Use technical tools to guide your decisions, and remember to manage risk above all else. Volatility may feel intimidating, but it also brings opportunities. With practice and patience, you can turn chaos into profits. Continue Reading Business Why Custom Fortune Cookies Are the Perfect Trade Show Treat Published 2 days agoon March 18, 2025 By Writer Tired of handing out the same old pens, tote bags, or stress balls at trade shows? If you’re looking for a branded giveaway that stands out, consider custom fortune cookies. These delightful treats are not only a fun way to engage your audience but also pack a big punch when it comes to creating memorable brand experiences. Whether you’re an event planner, marketing professional, or trade show exhibitor, this blog will show you why custom fortune cookies might just be the best addition to your next event. Let’s explore how these little snacks can boost your brand, delight attendees, and generate lasting impressions. The Power of Branded Giveaways at Trade Shows Trade shows are all about making connections, standing out, and staying memorable. With countless exhibitors competing for attention, unique giveaways can be a game-changer. While traditional swag items serve a purpose, they often lack the “wow” factor to leave a lasting impact. This is where custom fortune cookies excel. They combine novelty, interactivity, and an edible incentive—key components for creating a memorable experience. Attendees are far more likely to remember a clever fortune message or a delicious surprise than yet another keychain. Simply put, custom fortune cookies create a deeper connection by blending taste, creativity, and personalised branding in one delightful bite. What Are Custom Fortune Cookies? Custom fortune cookies are exactly what they sound like—a traditional fortune cookie with a twist. Instead of the generic sayings you find in standard cookies, these customised treats are tailored to include messages, branding, or even calls to action that aligns with your event or company. Features include: Personalised Messages: Insert your company slogan, witty phrases, or even a sales-friendly CTA on the fortune. Branded Packaging: Wrap the cookies in packaging printed with your logo, colour scheme, or other recognisable brand elements. Flavour Variety: Choose from classic vanilla or opt for something quirky like chocolate or matcha-flavoured cookies to appeal to diverse tastes. The result? An edible giveaway that offers joy, aligns with your brand identity and sparks meaningful connections. Why Custom Fortune Cookies Work They’re Memorable and Unique Most trade show attendees receive hundreds of promotional items, and many end up forgotten or discarded. A custom fortune cookie, however, creates a refreshing break from tradition—even more so when the message inside resonates with the recipient. Imagine attendees cracking open a cookie and finding a personalised fortune like, “Your future success celebrates with [Your Brand Name],” or “Good things are in store—visit Booth #123!” It’s a subtle yet impactful way to make your booth unforgettable. They Create Engagement Who doesn’t like a little mystery? Fortune cookies attract instant interest and interaction. Attendees will be curious about the message inside and may even share their fortune with others—spreading your branding organically in the process. Pro Tip: Use social media to amplify engagement. Encourage attendees to post their fortune with a hashtag or take a selfie with their cookie at your booth. An item this unique can quickly become a social media goldmine. They’re Highly Customisable From packaging design to the actual fortune, custom fortune cookies allow full flexibility. Include your event details, QR codes leading to exclusive offers, or fun on-brand messages that align perfectly with your company voice. For example: A tech company could insert a message reading, “The future of innovation is here at Booth 230—check it out!” A health food brand might add, “Craving something wholesome? [Brand Name] has what you need. Booth 68.” This level of customisation ensures your giveaway not only grabs attention but also communicates your key message effectively. They’re Budget-Friendly Unlike many other custom trade show items, fortune cookies are surprisingly affordable. Even with personalised messages and packaging, they often cost less per unit than many other branded items. They’re Consumable Let’s face it—edible items have a unique advantage. People consume them, so they don’t add clutter or get tossed into a drawer. Providing a snack also builds goodwill among hungry trade show attendees who’ve been walking booths all day. How to Use Custom Fortune Cookies Effectively To truly make an impact with your custom fortune cookies, it’s essential to use them strategically. Here’s how to nail your execution like a pro. Personalised Messaging Think carefully about what you want your message to accomplish. Are you driving traffic to your booth? Do you want your name to stick in their memory? Or are you hoping to generate sign-ups for a product? Messages could include: “Something exciting awaits you at Booth 34. Come see [Your Brand Name] in action.” “Scan the code below for a free trial of [Your Brand Name] today!” Pair Them with Other Experiences Combine your fortune cookies with interactive elements for even greater impact. For example: Spin-to-Win Wheel: Attendees earn their cookies by spinning a prize wheel. Fortune Reveals Raffle Prize: Include a few winning fortunes for larger prizes, such as gift cards or products. Leverage Themes If your event has a central theme or goal, align your fortunes with that narrative. This creates cohesion and amplifies your event messaging. For example, a sustainability-focused event might offer fortunes with eco-friendly tips or affirmations. Highlight Social Media Potential Promote hashtag use and encourage attendees to share photos or videos of their fortunes. This can expand your event’s reach beyond those physically at the trade show. Brands Who Have Used Custom Fortune Cookies Many successful companies have used fortune cookies in their marketing campaigns. Google, for instance, handed out cookies with hidden recruitment messages to entice tech talent. Similarly, Coca-Cola used fortune cookies in targeted marketing campaigns to spread positive quotes tied to brand messaging. These high-profile use cases only reinforce the versatility and creative potential of custom fortune cookies for trade show success. Custom fortune cookies check all the right boxes for trade show giveaways. They’re cost-effective, interactive, memorable, and aligned with your branding goals. From personalised messages to on-theme packaging, these little treats can make a lasting impression on attendees and turn casual encounters into lasting business connections. Looking to stand out at your next trade show? Partner with [Your Brand] to create custom fortune cookies designed just for you. Together, we’ll craft a branded treat that represents your business beautifully—and leaves attendees craving more.

Read up on both the risks and benefits. Content Technology allows small businesses to be more competitive in today’s fast-paced economy. The federal government has adopted Artificial intelligence (AI) as a way to help them better serve the public. As a small business owner, AI can help your small businesses do more with less. SBA is dedicated to informing small businesses about the ethical use of AI tools. We also want to help you think about effective ways to implement AI into your business practices. AI is relatively new, so start small. If you are unsure what tool you may need, many AI tools offer basic services for free or at a lower cost. Try testing them to see if they add value to your business. You may find they improve internal efficiencies, freeing up your time to focus on growing your business. Read on to find out about both the benefits and risks of using AI in your small business. If you're new to AI terminology, our list of common AI terms can help you make informed decisions. You can also read more about government use of AI at AI.gov, or read through additional small business AI resources. How AI can benefit your small business AI can improve efficiency, which can help business owners save time. It can also save on costs and help your business stay competitive in times of mounting inflation. If a job market is experiencing labor shortages, AI can help compensate for skilled labor. AI can help your business: Solve problems before they happen. Tracking traffic and flight delays can help you to avoid delivery and travel issues. Monitoring floodplains can help you prepare for or avoid disaster damage. Rate optimizers can help lessen shipping costs. AI can even help you find ways to mitigate your business’s environmental impact that won’t break the bank. Safeguard your data. Look into security software or vendors that use AI technology. The ability to automate security functions can help security professionals process more data at a faster rate. The ability to quickly react to an attack and apply a security patch can make all the difference to your small business. Make better business decisions. AI can help you analyze your small business data and pick out common themes. Use your own client data to make better strategic decisions. Data inclusive tools can also help you compare your business to similar businesses and find gaps that you can address or advantages you can exploit to give your business an extra boost. Take on repeat tasks. Use a voice assistant to program monthly meetings. Set calendar reminders that remind employees of important work deadlines. Sort your email into inboxes by task. Update to-do lists or restock inventory without having to stop what you’re doing. AI can also be used to record and summarize your team meetings. You can also generate reusable templates that reduce time and improve communications. Create business content. Get help when editing photos or videos. Draft a business plan. Write job postings and blogs. AI can also use your original marketing content to develop e-commerce product descriptions or generate and schedule social media posts across multiple platforms or develop engaging content based on trending hashtags and topics. To keep your budget down, make variations you can use on different sites or over several months. Collaborate and brainstorm. Get ideas for a logo design that uses your company colors, or to come up with a marketing plan that meets your budget. Ask about a solution for a business blocker. If you work alone, AI can help you collaborate on business solutions. You can also use it to find problems in upcoming projects, such as hidden costs or possible financial risks. Improve customer service. Add a website chatbot that can answer common questions or complete an order. Automate your phone service to route calls to the right department. Fine-tune ads to better target your customers’ interests and needs. Write courteous, thoughtful replies to online reviews. Risks of AI use Using AI can mean your business is assuming a certain amount of risk. If it is part of software you have purchased, those creators are responsible for their product’s use of AI. If you are using free AI tools or software in your small business, have another person review all AI products. This will help make sure they are being used ethically, securely, and in a manner that accurately represents your business. If your small business has an attorney, consider a consultation. Your lawyer can help make sure you are using AI consistent with local laws or best business practices. Other considerations include: Intellectual property. AI sources content from the web. Make sure anything you produce doesn’t infringe on any patents, copyrights or trademarks. Security risks. Try not to feed any sensitive data or proprietary information. This will help keep it out of the data pool that the system uses when producing content. Keep an eye out for phishing campaigns that might have been written using AI. Customer trust. Tools that recognize AI-generated content may mark it as spam, or as not generated with real knowledge of the recipient. This could create customer resistance to future outreach efforts. Make sure a person assesses all the messages and outreach campaigns that AI generates. Ethical concerns. Monitor and review content to make sure it reflects your business’s culture and principles. While there are currently no federal or state laws that require businesses to disclose the use of AI, it is becoming an expected best practice. Consider drafting a public statement that discloses how your small business uses AI. Common terms Artificial intelligence (AI) AI is a set of systems that program computers to solve problems or work through tasks. These systems adjust and adapt to new information. This process is meant to imitate human intelligence. Algorithm A list of specific rules or instructions. These help a computer system perform a task or solve a problem. Machine learning This is a field within AI. It refers to the process of using data to produce models that can perform complex tasks. The computers can then “learn” from the data, without more programming. Language model/Large language model (LLM) A language model is a type of machine learning model. It uses math to predict the next word in a series of words. It can also help fill in the missing word in a phrase. An example of this is the autocomplete function on a cell phone. A LLM learns language patterns. It does this by training on a massive amount of data. This allows the machine to recognize the patterns. LLMs can be used for both writing and translation. They are also used to answer questions, like on a chatbot. Generative AI (GenAI) This is an LLM that can create new content. GenAI can make text, images, even videos and music. It learns patterns from existing data. GenAI then uses those patterns to create new and similar data. This technology is what most people know about. GenAI is relatively new and changing daily. Prompt This refers to the information you feed into GenAI. This can be a sentence, question or other information. The AI model will use this information and its pattern models to generate a response.
