Role of Video Content Generation in Education Systems Using Generative AI Lalit Kumar https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8441-1696 Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, India Dushyant Kumar Singh Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, India Mohd Aquib Ansari Bennett University, India 355 Video Content Generation in Education Systems Using Generative AI INTRODUCTION Video content creation using generative AI involves leveraging artificial intelligence algorithms, spe- cifically generative models, to generate, enhance, or manipulate video content. Generative AI, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), can be employed to create realistic and novel video sequences (Kumar & Singh, 2023; Kumar et el., 2023). This process typically involves training the model on a large dataset of existing videos, enabling it to learn patterns, styles, and characteristics of the input data. Once trained, the generative AI can produce new video content by generating frames or even entire sequences autonomously. This technology allows for the creation of unique, visually appealing videos, special effects, and animations without the need for extensive manual labour. It has applications in various industries, including entertainment, marketing, and virtual reality, providing a powerful tool for content creators to explore innovative and dynamic visual experiences. Video plays a crucial role in the education system by providing a dynamic and engaging medium for delivering content (Figure 1). It has become an integral part of modern pedagogy, offering students visual and auditory stimulation that caters to diverse learning styles. Educational videos can bring complex concepts to life, making them more accessible and facilitating better understanding. They also enable educators to create virtual field trips, demonstrations, and simulations, expanding the learning experience beyond traditional classroom boundaries. However, it’s important to approach video integration with a mindful awareness of potential pitfalls. One challenge is the risk of passive consumption, where students may become more focused on the entertainment value rather than the educational content. Additionally, issues of accessibility and equity may arise, as not all students may have equal access to high-quality internet or devices. Striking a balance between utilizing videos for enhanced learning experiences and ensuring equitable access requires thoughtful implementation and consideration of individual student needs. By addressing these challenges with empathy and fostering an inclusive learning environment, educators can harness the power of video to enrich the educational journey for all students (Haga, 2002; Aldausari et al., 2022). To address challenges associated with video content creation using generative AI, several strategies can be implemented. Firstly, to mitigate the risk of passive consumption, educators can design interactive and participatory activities that accompany the generated video content. This encourages students to actively engage with the material, ask questions, and collaborate with their peers. Additionally, incorporating assessments that gauge comprehension and critical thinking skills related to the video content ensures that students are not merely passive viewers but active learners (Wessel et al., 2023). To tackle issues of accessibility and equity, educators should be mindful of the varying technological resources available to students. Providing alternative means of accessing content, such as transcripts or written summaries, can accommodate different learning preferences and address challenges related to internet access or device availability. Furthermore, schools and institutions can work towards ensuring equitable access to technology, bridging the digital divide and promoting inclusivity in the learning en- vironment. Continuous monitoring and improvement of generative AI models are essential to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the content generated. Regular updates and refinements to the algorithms can help address any biases or limitations that may emerge during the content creation process. Addition- ally, involving students in the feedback loop by encouraging them to provide insights on the generated content fosters a collaborative and adaptive learning environment. The aim of video generation for educational content creation is to enhance learning experiences by leveraging multimedia tools to deliver information in engaging and accessible formats.

The impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on practices, policies and research direction in education: a case of ChatGPT and Midjourney Article Full-text available Sep 2023 Thomas K.F. Chiu Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have become increasingly accessible and have impacted school education in numerous ways. However, most of the discussions occur in higher education. In schools, teachers' perspectives are crucial for making sense of innovative technologies. Accordingly, this qualitative study aims to investigate how GenAI changes our school education from the perspectives of teachers and leaders. It used four domains-learning, teaching, assessment, and administration-as the initial framework suggested in a systematic literature review study on AI in education. The participants were 88 school teachers and leaders of different backgrounds. They completed a survey and joined a focus group to share how ChatGPT and Midjounery had a GenAI effect on school education. Thematic analysis identified four main themes and 12 subthemes. The findings provide three suggestions for practices: know-it-all attitude, new prerequisite knowledge, interdisciplinary teaching, and three implications for policy: new assessment, AI education, and professional standards. They also further suggest six future research directions for GenAI in education. ARTICLE HISTORY View Show abstract The new reality of education in the face of advances in generative artificial intelligence Article Full-text available Jan 2024 Francisco José García-Peñalvo Faraón Llorens Javier Vidal It is increasingly common to interact with products that seem “intelligent”, although the label “artificial intelligence” may have been replaced by other euphemisms. Since November 2022, with the emergence of the ChatGPT tool, there has been an exponential increase in the use of artificial intelligence in all areas. Although ChatGPT is just one of many generative artificial intelligence technologies, its impact on teaching and learning processes has been significant. This article reflects on the advantages, disadvantages, potentials, limits, and challenges of generative artificial intelligence technologies in education to avoid the biases inherent in extremist positions. To this end, we conducted a systematic review of both the tools and the scientific production that have emerged in the six months since the appearance of ChatGPT. Generative artificial intelligence is extremely powerful and improving at an accelerated pace, but it is based on large language models with a probabilistic basis, which means that they have no capacity for reasoning or comprehension and are therefore susceptible to containing errors that need to be contrasted. On the other hand, many of the problems associated with these technologies in educational contexts already existed before their appearance, but now, due to their power, we cannot ignore them, and we must assume what our speed of response will be to analyse and incorporate these tools into our teaching practice. View Show abstract Modified Flipped Learning as an Approach to Mitigate the Adverse Effects of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Education Article Full-text available Jul 2023 Abdulmalik Lawan Ahmad Basheer Ridwan Muhammad Ahmad Muhammad Tahir Safiya Lawan Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) systems such as ChatGPT, which create new educational content based on their training data, have led to debates on the systems’ impact on educational practice and the question of whether academia should embrace or reject these tools. Flipped learning is a pedagogical approach that reverses the traditional order of teaching and learning. Instead of receiving direct instruction in the classroom, students are introduced to the learning material before class. This study explores the potential of modified flipped learning as an approach to mitigate the effects of GAI on education. The study highlights the relevance and importance of flipped learning and GAI in the 21st-century educational landscape and proposes a modified flipped learning model that combines the individualized and active learning aspects of flipped learning with the adaptive capabilities of GAI. The study also addressed concerns related to the responsible use of GAI, ethical considerations, and the role of educators in guiding students’ interactions with intelligent systems. In conclusion, the proposed modified flipped learning model would empower students to actively engage in the learning process and take ownership of their education by replacing the traditional role of the teacher with the use of GAI systems for pre-class activities and content creation. However, further research is needed to explore the effectiveness of flipped learning in this context and identify the best ways to implement this approach in the classroom. View Show abstract Generative AI for Learning: Investigating the Potential of Learning Videos with Synthetic Virtual Instructors Chapter Full-text available Jun 2023 Daniel Leiker Ashley Ricker Gyllen Ismail Eldesouky Mutlu Cukurova Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have captured worldwide attention. Tools such as Dalle-2 and ChatGPT demonstrate that tasks previously thought to be beyond the capabilities of AI may now augment the productivity of creative media in various new ways. To date, there is limited research investigating the real-world educational value of AI-generated media. To address this gap, we examined the impact of using generative AI to create learning videos with synthetic virtual instructors. We took a mixed-method approach, randomly assigning adult learners (n = 83) into one of two micro-learning conditions, collecting pre- and post-learning assessments, and surveying participants on their learning experience. The control condition included a traditionally produced instructor video, while the experimental condition included an AI-generated learning video with a synthetic virtual instructor. Learners in both conditions demonstrated significant improvement from pre- to post-learning (p <.001), with no significant differences in gains between the two conditions (p = .80), and no qualitative differences in the perceived learning experience. These findings suggest that AI-generated learning videos have the potential to be a viable substitute for videos produced via traditional methods in online educational settings, making high quality educational content more accessible across the globe.KeywordsAI-Generated Learning ContentGenerative AIAI in Education View Show abstract RETRACTED ARTICLE: A comprehensive survey on generative adversarial networks used for synthesizing multimedia content Article Full-text available Mar 2023 MULTIMED TOOLS APPL Lalit Kumar Dushyant Kumar Singh GAN’s are playing an important role in creating and generating a new set of data from the previously available content. GAN models are impressive in the results for image and video generation tasks. These models uses convolutional neural networks for generator and discriminator. GAN models are progressively improving by adding more latent approaches of deep learning.

GAN is classified for all the domains in which GAN is used, i.e., Image, Video, and Audio. Along with all these things, we have described some applications where the GAN model is used. This manuscript also presents the performance of various GAN models for understanding its working with evaluation metrics (Qualitative and Quantitative). View Show abstract Video Generative Adversarial Networks: A Review Article Full-text available Jan 2022 Nuha Aldausari Arcot Sowmya Nadine Marcus Gelareh Mohammadi With the increasing interest in the content creation field in multiple sectors such as media, education, and entertainment, there is an increased trend in the papers that use AI algorithms to generate content such as images, videos, audio, and text. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is one of the promising models that synthesizes data samples that are similar to real data samples. While the variations of GANs models in general have been covered to some extent in several survey papers, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that reviews the state-of-the-art video GANs models. This paper first categorizes GANs review papers into general GANs review papers, image GANs review papers, and special field GANs review papers such as anomaly detection, medical imaging, or cybersecurity. The paper then summarizes the main improvements in GANs that are not necessarily applied in the video domain in the first run but have been adopted in multiple video GANs variations. Then, a comprehensive review of video GANs models are provided under two main divisions based on existence of a condition. The conditional models are then further classified according to the provided condition into audio, text, video, and image. The paper concludes with the main challenges and limitations of the current video GANs models. View Show abstract Pre-service teachers’ skills development through educational video generation Article Mar 2024 Marta García-Sampedro Susana Agudo Prado Antonio Torralba-Burrial The impacts of the pandemic on education have highlighted the need to improve pre-service teachers’ digital skills training. This quantitative study explored pre-service teachers’ perceptions on how the design, generation, and dissemination of didactic videos enhance their teaching competences. Early childhood, primary, and secondary education English (as a foreign language) pre-service teachers have produced eight different types of educational content in video format (stories, linguistic content, tutorials, documentaries, news programmes, contests, literary reviews, and educational system criticism) addressed to schools´ audience. These videos have been circulated through YouTube channels linked to an open-access online TV portal. The results showed that these educational videos contributed to enriching their skills. Pre-service teachers’ highly positive perceptions regarding improvements of these competences, remark, above all, the development of teamwork abilities thanks to this experience, and let researchers reflect on the design of more effective learning experiences through didactic video generation to ameliorate teacher education.

This paper presents a novel approach for Human pose image generation GAN using a combination of U-Net architecture, Decomposed Component encoder, Laplacian image enhancement technique in the generator, and Siamese Networks with Alignment Loss in the discriminator. The ... [Show full abstract] generator network leverages the U-Net architecture to capture and reconstruct intricate details of human poses. Additionally, a Decomposed Component encoder is incorporated to learn disentangled representations of pose attributes, such as body position, joint angles, and limb orientations. Furthermore, a Laplacian image enhancement technique is applied to enhance the visual quality and sharpness of the generated pose images. To ensure the alignment and similarity of the generated pose images with real poses, Siamese Networks with Alignment Loss are integrated into the discriminator. The Siamese Networks enable pairwise comparison between generated and real poses, guiding the discriminator to learn features that capture the alignment relationship. The alignment loss is computed based on the similarity of feature representations extracted by the Siamese Networks. This proposed model focuses on enhancing the level of detail and realism in the pose representation rather than improving the resolution or sharpness of the image itself so the U-Net architecture and image sharpening algorithm helps the proposed model to generate more realistic images in comparison to the other state-of-art approaches. This manuscript also contains a comparative analysis of experimental results on various physical conditions with the previously existing state-of-the-art approaches. This analysis shows that the proposed algorithm generates 15–20% more realistic images in comparison to other state-of-the-art approaches.

Role of Video Content Generation in Education Systems Using Generative AI Lalit Kumar https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8441-1696 Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, India Dushyant Kumar Singh Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, India Mohd Aquib Ansari Bennett University, India 355 Video Content Generation in Education Systems Using Generative AI INTRODUCTION Video content creation using generative AI involves leveraging artificial intelligence algorithms, spe- cifically generative models, to generate, enhance, or manipulate video content. Generative AI, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), can be employed to create realistic and novel video sequences (Kumar & Singh, 2023; Kumar et el., 2023). This process typically involves training the model on a large dataset of existing videos, enabling it to learn patterns, styles, and characteristics of the input data. Once trained, the generative AI can produce new video content by generating frames or even entire sequences autonomously. This technology allows for the creation of unique, visually appealing videos, special effects, and animations without the need for extensive manual labour. It has applications in various industries, including entertainment, marketing, and virtual reality, providing a powerful tool for content creators to explore innovative and dynamic visual experiences. Video plays a crucial role in the education system by providing a dynamic and engaging medium for delivering content (Figure 1). It has become an integral part of modern pedagogy, offering students visual and auditory stimulation that caters to diverse learning styles. Educational videos can bring complex concepts to life, making them more accessible and facilitating better understanding. They also enable educators to create virtual field trips, demonstrations, and simulations, expanding the learning experience beyond traditional classroom boundaries. However, it’s important to approach video integration with a mindful awareness of potential pitfalls. One challenge is the risk of passive consumption, where students may become more focused on the entertainment value rather than the educational content. Additionally, issues of accessibility and equity may arise, as not all students may have equal access to high-quality internet or devices. Striking a balance between utilizing videos for enhanced learning experiences and ensuring equitable access requires thoughtful implementation and consideration of individual student needs. By addressing these challenges with empathy and fostering an inclusive learning environment, educators can harness the power of video to enrich the educational journey for all students (Haga, 2002; Aldausari et al., 2022). To address challenges associated with video content creation using generative AI, several strategies can be implemented. Firstly, to mitigate the risk of passive consumption, educators can design interactive and participatory activities that accompany the generated video content. This encourages students to actively engage with the material, ask questions, and collaborate with their peers. Additionally, incorporating assessments that gauge comprehension and critical thinking skills related to the video content ensures that students are not merely passive viewers but active learners (Wessel et al., 2023). To tackle issues of accessibility and equity, educators should be mindful of the varying technological resources available to students. Providing alternative means of accessing content, such as transcripts or written summaries, can accommodate different learning preferences and address challenges related to internet access or device availability. Furthermore, schools and institutions can work towards ensuring equitable access to technology, bridging the digital divide and promoting inclusivity in the learning en- vironment. Continuous monitoring and improvement of generative AI models are essential to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the content generated. Regular updates and refinements to the algorithms can help address any biases or limitations that may emerge during the content creation process. Addition- ally, involving students in the feedback loop by encouraging them to provide insights on the generated content fosters a collaborative and adaptive learning environment. The aim of video generation for educational content creation is to enhance learning experiences by leveraging multimedia tools to deliver information in engaging and accessible formats.

The impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on practices, policies and research direction in education: a case of ChatGPT and Midjourney Article Full-text available Sep 2023 Thomas K.F. Chiu Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have become increasingly accessible and have impacted school education in numerous ways. However, most of the discussions occur in higher education. In schools, teachers' perspectives are crucial for making sense of innovative technologies. Accordingly, this qualitative study aims to investigate how GenAI changes our school education from the perspectives of teachers and leaders. It used four domains-learning, teaching, assessment, and administration-as the initial framework suggested in a systematic literature review study on AI in education. The participants were 88 school teachers and leaders of different backgrounds. They completed a survey and joined a focus group to share how ChatGPT and Midjounery had a GenAI effect on school education. Thematic analysis identified four main themes and 12 subthemes. The findings provide three suggestions for practices: know-it-all attitude, new prerequisite knowledge, interdisciplinary teaching, and three implications for policy: new assessment, AI education, and professional standards. They also further suggest six future research directions for GenAI in education. ARTICLE HISTORY View Show abstract The new reality of education in the face of advances in generative artificial intelligence Article Full-text available Jan 2024 Francisco José García-Peñalvo Faraón Llorens Javier Vidal It is increasingly common to interact with products that seem “intelligent”, although the label “artificial intelligence” may have been replaced by other euphemisms. Since November 2022, with the emergence of the ChatGPT tool, there has been an exponential increase in the use of artificial intelligence in all areas. Although ChatGPT is just one of many generative artificial intelligence technologies, its impact on teaching and learning processes has been significant. This article reflects on the advantages, disadvantages, potentials, limits, and challenges of generative artificial intelligence technologies in education to avoid the biases inherent in extremist positions. To this end, we conducted a systematic review of both the tools and the scientific production that have emerged in the six months since the appearance of ChatGPT. Generative artificial intelligence is extremely powerful and improving at an accelerated pace, but it is based on large language models with a probabilistic basis, which means that they have no capacity for reasoning or comprehension and are therefore susceptible to containing errors that need to be contrasted. On the other hand, many of the problems associated with these technologies in educational contexts already existed before their appearance, but now, due to their power, we cannot ignore them, and we must assume what our speed of response will be to analyse and incorporate these tools into our teaching practice. View Show abstract Modified Flipped Learning as an Approach to Mitigate the Adverse Effects of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Education Article Full-text available Jul 2023 Abdulmalik Lawan Ahmad Basheer Ridwan Muhammad Ahmad Muhammad Tahir Safiya Lawan Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) systems such as ChatGPT, which create new educational content based on their training data, have led to debates on the systems’ impact on educational practice and the question of whether academia should embrace or reject these tools. Flipped learning is a pedagogical approach that reverses the traditional order of teaching and learning. Instead of receiving direct instruction in the classroom, students are introduced to the learning material before class. This study explores the potential of modified flipped learning as an approach to mitigate the effects of GAI on education. The study highlights the relevance and importance of flipped learning and GAI in the 21st-century educational landscape and proposes a modified flipped learning model that combines the individualized and active learning aspects of flipped learning with the adaptive capabilities of GAI. The study also addressed concerns related to the responsible use of GAI, ethical considerations, and the role of educators in guiding students’ interactions with intelligent systems. In conclusion, the proposed modified flipped learning model would empower students to actively engage in the learning process and take ownership of their education by replacing the traditional role of the teacher with the use of GAI systems for pre-class activities and content creation. However, further research is needed to explore the effectiveness of flipped learning in this context and identify the best ways to implement this approach in the classroom. View Show abstract Generative AI for Learning: Investigating the Potential of Learning Videos with Synthetic Virtual Instructors Chapter Full-text available Jun 2023 Daniel Leiker Ashley Ricker Gyllen Ismail Eldesouky Mutlu Cukurova Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have captured worldwide attention. Tools such as Dalle-2 and ChatGPT demonstrate that tasks previously thought to be beyond the capabilities of AI may now augment the productivity of creative media in various new ways. To date, there is limited research investigating the real-world educational value of AI-generated media. To address this gap, we examined the impact of using generative AI to create learning videos with synthetic virtual instructors. We took a mixed-method approach, randomly assigning adult learners (n = 83) into one of two micro-learning conditions, collecting pre- and post-learning assessments, and surveying participants on their learning experience. The control condition included a traditionally produced instructor video, while the experimental condition included an AI-generated learning video with a synthetic virtual instructor. Learners in both conditions demonstrated significant improvement from pre- to post-learning (p <.001), with no significant differences in gains between the two conditions (p = .80), and no qualitative differences in the perceived learning experience. These findings suggest that AI-generated learning videos have the potential to be a viable substitute for videos produced via traditional methods in online educational settings, making high quality educational content more accessible across the globe.KeywordsAI-Generated Learning ContentGenerative AIAI in Education View Show abstract RETRACTED ARTICLE: A comprehensive survey on generative adversarial networks used for synthesizing multimedia content Article Full-text available Mar 2023 MULTIMED TOOLS APPL Lalit Kumar Dushyant Kumar Singh GAN’s are playing an important role in creating and generating a new set of data from the previously available content. GAN models are impressive in the results for image and video generation tasks. These models uses convolutional neural networks for generator and discriminator. GAN models are progressively improving by adding more latent approaches of deep learning. GAN model has been implemented for both supervised as well as unsupervised learning for various applications like image inpainting, image blending, video generation, music generation etc. During the implementation of the GAN model for all these applications, some issues arise during the training of discriminators like model collapse, Penalty Gradient etc. This manuscript contains a detailed survey of GAN models presented with varied classifications along with the challenges involved in GAN models. GAN is classified for all the domains in which GAN is used, i.e., Image, Video, and Audio. Along with all these things, we have described some applications where the GAN model is used. This manuscript also presents the performance of various GAN models for understanding its working with evaluation metrics (Qualitative and Quantitative). View Show abstract Video Generative Adversarial Networks: A Review Article Full-text available Jan 2022 Nuha Aldausari Arcot Sowmya Nadine Marcus Gelareh Mohammadi With the increasing interest in the content creation field in multiple sectors such as media, education, and entertainment, there is an increased trend in the papers that use AI algorithms to generate content such as images, videos, audio, and text. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is one of the promising models that synthesizes data samples that are similar to real data samples. While the variations of GANs models in general have been covered to some extent in several survey papers, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that reviews the state-of-the-art video GANs models. This paper first categorizes GANs review papers into general GANs review papers, image GANs review papers, and special field GANs review papers such as anomaly detection, medical imaging, or cybersecurity. The paper then summarizes the main improvements in GANs that are not necessarily applied in the video domain in the first run but have been adopted in multiple video GANs variations. Then, a comprehensive review of video GANs models are provided under two main divisions based on existence of a condition. The conditional models are then further classified according to the provided condition into audio, text, video, and image. The paper concludes with the main challenges and limitations of the current video GANs models.

This quantitative study explored pre-service teachers’ perceptions on how the design, generation, and dissemination of didactic videos enhance their teaching competences. Early childhood, primary, and secondary education English (as a foreign language) pre-service teachers have produced eight different types of educational content in video format (stories, linguistic content, tutorials, documentaries, news programmes, contests, literary reviews, and educational system criticism) addressed to schools´ audience. These videos have been circulated through YouTube channels linked to an open-access online TV portal. The results showed that these educational videos contributed to enriching their skills. Pre-service teachers’ highly positive perceptions regarding improvements of these competences, remark, above all, the development of teamwork abilities thanks to this experience, and let researchers reflect on the design of more effective learning experiences through didactic video generation to ameliorate teacher education.

This paper presents a comparative analysis of three state-of-the-art video synthesis models: Vid2Vid, Fast Vid2Vid, and Dynamic Multi-scale Voxel Flow Network (DMVFN). Vid2Vid and Fast Vid2Vid are generative models that specialize in synthesizing realistic videos based on semantic segmentation maps. In contrast, DMVFN addresses video synthesis using a voxel-based representation and adopts a multi-scale strategy, generating voxel grids at different resolutions to capture both global and local motion information. In result analysis of video synthesis models, Vid2Vid generator and discriminator generate visually captivating videos with accurate object shapes and colors, with accuracy 84.76% and 85.25%, respectively. Whereas, Fast Vid2Vid has achieved a remarkable speed while maintaining a satisfactory quality level with generator and discriminator accuracy of 88.82% and 87.68% together. Finally, DMVFN excels at capturing complex motion patterns and preserving temporal coherence, so it has achieved 86.64% generator and 86.96% discriminator accuracy, although it may have limitations in generating subtle details. Overall, this comparative analysis provides valuable insight into the strengths and limitations of each model, assisting researchers and practitioners in selecting appropriate video synthesis techniques for specific applications.

This paper presents a novel approach for Human pose image generation GAN using a combination of U-Net architecture, Decomposed Component encoder, Laplacian image enhancement technique in the generator, and Siamese Networks with Alignment Loss in the discriminator. The ... [Show full abstract] generator network leverages the U-Net architecture to capture and reconstruct intricate details of human poses. Additionally, a Decomposed Component encoder is incorporated to learn disentangled representations of pose attributes, such as body position, joint angles, and limb orientations. Furthermore, a Laplacian image enhancement technique is applied to enhance the visual quality and sharpness of the generated pose images. To ensure the alignment and similarity of the generated pose images with real poses, Siamese Networks with Alignment Loss are integrated into the discriminator. The Siamese Networks enable pairwise comparison between generated and real poses, guiding the discriminator to learn features that capture the alignment relationship. The alignment loss is computed based on the similarity of feature representations extracted by the Siamese Networks. This proposed model focuses on enhancing the level of detail and realism in the pose representation rather than improving the resolution or sharpness of the image itself so the U-Net architecture and image sharpening algorithm helps the proposed model to generate more realistic images in comparison to the other state-of-art approaches. This manuscript also contains a comparative analysis of experimental results on various physical conditions with the previously existing state-of-the-art approaches. This analysis shows that the proposed algorithm generates 15–20% more realistic images in comparison to other state-of-the-art approaches.

May 14, 2024 The Role of AI in Personalizing Video-Based Learning ;) Personalization: A better way to learn The benefits of personalized learning—instruction individualized for the preferences, needs, and objectives of each student—have been well understood for more than a decade. Providing relevant, engaging content adapted to a student’s knowledge level and preferred learning modalities yields a more satisfying learning experience that increases motivation and improves outcomes. To provide personalized learning, educators have had to master new tactics. Among them are delivery options beyond the classroom and course materials beyond textbooks and lecture notes. Today’s learners, whether they’re in high school, seeking university degrees, or pursuing continuing education or professional development, benefit from choices among how courses are delivered—synchronously or asynchronously, in-person or online. And they expect learning materials in a variety of formats that accommodate accessibility challenges and support their own preferences in learning, assessment, and feedback. The role of AI in personalized learning The need to offer personalized learning has spurred the development of new technologies to support its delivery, from learning management systems, personalized learning platforms, and courseware to gamification and interactive learning and assessment materials. Among the most powerful technology applied to personalized learning is artificial intelligence, or AI, which makes it possible to adapt the pace, level, and path of the instruction based on predictive analysis feedback that assesses the student’s proficiency in real time. AI-enabled learning management systems can evaluate student skill levels, auto-generate learner-specific quizzes and exercises, and provide real-time answers to questions. AI also enables automated content recommendations based on the learner’s previous content choices or those of learners with a similar profile (a tactic borrowed from e-commerce known as collaborative filtering). Generative AI in education “Generative AI” refers to any software tool that has the ability to create—or “generate”—content by responding to natural-language prompts from the user. The best-known and most widely available generative AI models—the technical term for a generative AI tool—are OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. Other topic- and/or industry-specific models exist, and many new ones are in development. Among the applications of generative AI in education are finding citations, creating charts and graphs from descriptions or datasets, and summarizing long-form content. Educators are also using generative AI to structure courses and lesson plans, and help with research. Natural language processing (NLP), a branch of AI, can even create virtual tutors. These sophisticated chatbots can guide students through learning materials, answer topical questions, and provide proactive studying or test-taking assistance. They have become a widely discussed use of generative AI for personalized learning, particularly in high school settings. NLP can also translate foreign-language materials and support accessibility through text-to-voice technology that reads written materials aloud. AI and video-based learning Video-based learning materials are among the most potent ways to engage learners, and audiovisual learning outcomes outpace those of entirely textual models. Videos come in a variety of flavors, from simple screen shares and talking-head lectures to complex animations or professional-quality narrative films. AI tools are especially suited to personalizing video-based learning. Enabled by AI-driven search and content recommendations, these tools can locate relevant video content and home in on the relevant portions of any preexisting video, enabling instructors to customize course materials more easily and, most importantly, allowing students to quickly find the content most relevant to what they’re studying. Video content can even be incorporated on the fly into custom chatbots that then offer up video as well as textual responses—another form of generative AI. AI-driven content generation can, however, be problematic. In addition to plagiarism, introducing bias, and the proliferation of false information, outright “hallucination”—content created when the AI tool perceives or establishes patterns or connections that don’t really exist—poses a risk for ed techs who use generative AI to create learning materials and virtual tutors that use text and/or video to respond to student queries. The best way to ensure the quality of the video used in a personalized learning program is to limit the universe of videos from which search results can be drawn to a curated set of videos that have been pre-licensed and either authored by experts or produced by reliable sources such as PBS, TED, Fuse School, and SciShow. Search engines and educational video ChatGPT and Gemini can be used as search engines—just like Google or Bing—as well as content-generation tools. But using widely available search engines or AI models to locate video content for educational use can be problematic as well. Because ChatGPT is entirely text-based, having no real-time connection to the web, it cannot natively surface multimedia as part of its chat responses. Gemini is also currently text-based, although it can return videos in its search results when prompted. However, the universe of videos it chooses from is limited to YouTube, another Google-owned platform. When users do request video, Gemini’s interface makes video awkward to view, and users are left to find the relevant content within the video on their own. Because anyone can upload content to YouTube, the provenance of the video content Gemini finds may be obscure, putting its suitability for an educational setting in doubt. Videos that are copyright-protected, have poor production values, or that contain outdated or patently false content can find their way into search results alongside well-made videos published on reputable channels. In addition, YouTube videos often contain advertising or other content inappropriate for an educational setting. Mitigating risk and maximizing benefits in AI-driven video learning Relying instead on a curated video library accelerates individualized course creation by obviating the onus of vetting them for reliability, cultural sensitivity, and copyright violation. And it enables educators to confidently align their video content more closely with their courseware and lesson plans and use video in post-assessment remediation. Adding to such a library an AI-driven ability to navigate directly to the relevant section of a long video speeds the curation of video course content for ed techs and further enhances—and personalizes—the learning experience for students. With a vetted video library to supplement textual answers, ed techs can further mitigate hallucination by using snippets of the educational, curated video in chatbot or video tutor responses. A library for personalized video learning The Boclips video platform provides access to millions of ad-free, rights-cleared pedagogical content by trusted content creators that is free from the misinformation prevalent on open internet sources and social platforms. Its videos can be linked to any LMS via an open API and incorporated easily into other course materials; the videos are also available individually directly through the Boclips web portal via a simple, AI-enabled search. And they can be incorporated into course-specific chatbots.

EdTech Magazine Current Issue | Archive twitter feed Home»Software Sep 30 2024 Software AI in Education in 2024: Educators Express Mixed Feelings on the Technology’s Future There is optimism about artificial intelligence’s productivity gains amid worry about inappropriate student use. byAlexander SlaggTwitter Alexander Slagg is a freelance writer specializing in technology and education. He is an ongoing contributor to the CDW family of magazines. Listen Pause As students settle back into classroom routines for the 2024-2025 school year, K–12 teachers and administrators face a host of pressing issues. Among them: how to navigate the use of artificial intelligence in education. While AI has been used for some time in educational tools such as Google Classrooms and GoGuardian, the meteoric rise of ChatGPT in November 2022 brought generative AI front and center in the classroom, as students and educators tinkered with its capabilities to figure out how it might assist them. How best to leverage genAI in the classroom is one of the most important technology questions facing K–12 education. To answer it, school IT professionals can review a snapshot of recent research on AI to make sense of this compelling technology. DISCOVER: Integrate artificial intelligence with K–12 learning objectives. Optimism for AI in Education Is Tinged with Hesitancy In general, education leaders have an optimistic opinion of AI. The Consortium for School Networking’s State of EdTech District Leadership report notes that 97% see benefits in how AI can positively impact education. While there is great optimism, districts lag in actually implementing AI, with only 35% stating that they have a generative AI initiative in place. This discrepancy between positive opinions about AI versus active implementation of the technology is reflected in Carnegie Learning’s The State of AI in Education report. In this survey of educators, 77% of respondents think AI is useful, but only 56% are actually using it. This hesitancy in committing to AI suggests K–12 education leaders are taking a wait-and-see approach to this new technology. Click the banner to learn more about artificial intelligence’s possibilities for your school. Another driver of AI reluctance may be a lack of familiarity with the technology. In Microsoft’s AI in Education report, 68% of educators say they have used AI once or twice, while 22% use it daily. However, only 24% claim a strong familiarity with AI. Most educators in this survey may be trying to develop a better understanding of how the emerging technology could be applied to their administrative and classroom tasks. AI Benefits Productivity and Differentiated Learning Between managing the classroom, grading assignments, planning lessons, communicating with parents and families, and meeting administrative requirements, teachers are stretched thin as they strive to meet all of their occupational demands. Generative AI is well suited to address these pressing teacher needs. According to Carnegie Learning, teachers who use AI are finding multiple benefits from doing so: 42% found that using AI reduced the time spent on administrative tasks. 25% reported benefits in AI’s ability to assist with personalized learning. 18% reported benefits related to improving student engagement. 17% noted AI benefits in enhancing student learning outcomes. Notably, only 1% of respondents found no benefit to using AI in the classroom. WATCH NOW: Modern classroom technologies improve K–12 student engagement. Looking at the particular tasks where AI has been applied, the majority of Carnegie Learning respondents (52%) are using the technology for brainstorming and idea generation. Others use it to create teaching materials, plan lessons or grade assignments. Overall gains in productivity and personalized learning were reflected in both the CoSN and Microsoft reports. Among Microsoft’s respondents, 24% used AI to update lesson plans, supporting materials and assignments. Biggest Concerns Include Training on AI and Student Cheating While educators have found valuable upsides to using AI, they are also concerned about the technology. When CoSN asked them about AI’s biggest risks, 63% worried about new forms of cyberattacks, and 49% cited a lack of teacher training for integrating AI into instruction. Concerns about training and classroom integration were high among Microsoft respondents as well, with 50% seeing a lack of training and support as the biggest challenge.

The most widespread concerns by far among Microsoft and Carnegie Learning educators, however, were related to student cheating and plagiarism. This worry is not lost on CoSN educators, with 20% of respondents saying that they worked in districts that use tools to detect AI-generated answers in student work. Clearly, this is a leading concern for educators that includes a thorny patch of ethical considerations with no easy answers. The Need for AI Policy Guidance To reap the most value and reduce the risk from AI, districts and schools need to be proactive and develop a deeper understanding of the technology. Greater familiarity will allow them to develop strong, effective policies for AI use. Unfortunately, policy is an area in which many districts are currently lacking. At the district and classroom levels, many still do not have AI use policies. Implementing top-down guidance will go a long way toward helping teachers in the classroom make effective use of this powerful technology. gremlin/Getty Images More On Personalized Learning Digital Transformation Policies Training Artificial Intelligence Related Articles Artificial Intelligence FETC 2025: Ways To Bring AI into your K–12 District Artificial Intelligence FETC 2025: Bridging Creativity and Artificial Intelligence in K–12 Education Artificial Intelligence AI Trends in Ed Tech to Watch in 2025 Close See How Your Peers Are Moving Forward in the Cloud New research from CDW can help you build on your success and take the next step.
