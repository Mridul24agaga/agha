  "initialResearchSummary": "**Website Overview: AutomateTube - AI Video Generator**\n\nWelcome to AutomateTube, a platform that specializes in generating videos through Artificial Intelligence (AI). The site offers users a straightforward and efficient way to create videos without needing extensive technical skills or resources. With its user-friendly interface, AutomateTube appeals to both individuals and businesses looking to enhance their digital content through AI-driven video creation.\n\n**What They Offer**\n\nAt the core of AutomateTube's offerings is their AI Video Generator. This tool allows users to create videos simply by inputting their desired content, which the AI then transforms into a dynamic visual format. This could be particularly useful for marketers, content creators, or anyone looking to engage an audience through video without the high production costs typically associated with video creation.\n\n**Main Features and Services**\n\n1. **AI Video Generator**: The primary feature of AutomateTube is their AI Video Generator, which helps users effortlessly create engaging videos tailored to their specifications. This service is particularly valuable for those who may not have expertise in video editing or production.\n\n2. **Create Video and Video Listings**: The platform allows users not just to create videos but also to list these videos. This could be seen as a way to manage and showcase created content potentially for easy sharing on social media or other platforms.\n\n3. **Subscription Model**: AutomateTube seems to operate on a subscription-based model, allowing users to sign up and gain access to their range of services. This kind of model is beneficial as it often results in lower upfront costs and provides ongoing updates and features to the users.\n\n**Customer Satisfaction and Refund Policy**\n\nA significant aspect of AutomateTube’s approach is their commitment to customer satisfaction, as outlined in their detailed Refund Policy. This policy is crucial for any service-based platform, especially one that operates in the digital and creative space, where expectations can vary widely. \n\nHere are the key elements of their refund policy:\n\n- **Eligibility for Refunds**: Customers are eligible for refunds if they request it within 30 days of their purchase. This indicates that they value customer feedback and are willing to uphold a standard of satisfaction within a reasonable timeframe.\n\n- **Conditions for Refunds**: For a refund to be granted, the service must not have been fully utilized, meaning customers should not have accessed the service to its complete extent. Valid reasons for a refund include technical problems that hinder service usage, the service not meeting its advertised specifications, or billing errors.\n\n- **Refund Process**: The process for requesting a refund is relatively straightforward. Customers must submit a request through the support system with their order details and the reason for the refund. AutomateTube promises to review these requests within 48 hours, providing a clear timeline for users on what to expect. If approved, refunds are processed within 5-7 business days, which demonstrates the company’s professionalism and dedication to efficiency.\n\n- **Non-Refundable Items**: It’s also essential to be aware of any non-refundable items outlined in the policy. Completed video projects, used credits or tokens, and subscription fees after 30 days of purchase are not eligible for refunds. This is a standard practice in digital service industries to ensure that providers aren't penalized for services that have already been delivered or actively used. \n\n**How to Contact Support**\n\nThe \"Contact Us\" section is an important inclusion, as it provides users with a direct line of communication should they have any queries regarding the refund policy or the services. A responsive support team can greatly enhance the user experience, especially when dealing with potential issues or concerns about their purchases.\n\n**Conclusion: Why AutomateTube Stands Out**\n\nIn summary, AutomateTube presents itself as a modern solution for video creation, leveraging AI technology to streamline the process. By understanding customer needs and addressing potential concerns through a well-articulated refund policy, they not only enhance user trust but also ensure satisfaction.\n\nWhether you're a small business owner looking to up your marketing game or an individual wanting to create memorable content, AutomateTube’s AI Video Generator holds the promise of making video creation accessible, efficient, and tailored to your specific needs. \n\nUltimately, AutomateTube is more than just a tool; it’s a partner in creativity, helping users turn their ideas into captivating visual narratives effortlessly. With their robust service offerings and solid commitment to user satisfaction, they are well-positioned in the digital landscape. If you’re looking to dive into the world of AI-generated video content, AutomateTube could be your go-to platform.",

Adobe Premiere Pro | Best AI Software to Create Videos Pros Best all round video editor Cloud-syncing for backups Free trial available Colour matching speeds up edits Auto reframing useful for social media Cons Subscription based model Steep learning curve Requires high computer specs download Not only is Premiere Pro my pick of the best video editing software, but it’s now my favourite AI video app too. With the latest version you can download using the button above, you’ll get some crazy powerful AI tools to make creating high quality videos a cinch. Colour Match allows you to match the colours in two different clips in your sequence to help get rid of any discrepancies between different shots in the same scene – really useful if you use two different cameras. The Auto Reframe tool is a godsend for social media video content, allowing you to change horizontal 16:9 video footage into a tall 9:16 aspec ratio, perfect for instagram Stories or YouTube Shorts. If you shoot interviews, the auto audio ducking feature uses AI to lower the volume of music when dialogue is happening Adobe Sensei is the ‘brain’ behind the AI in Premiere Pro, providing other features such as Auto Classification which tags your footage and Morph Cut which smoothes out jump cuts. Overall, even if you didn’t use any of the AI video features in Premiere Pro, you’d still be left with the top editing software of the year – start by downloading a free trial and see what you think. How to Download Adobe Premiere Pro 2. Topaz Video AI | Photography AI Tool for Enlargements Pros Extremely powerful video editing tool Free trial available Upscaling, image stabilization, and slow-motion capabilities Can generate multiple previews at the same time Cons Relatively expensive download Simply put, Topaz Video AI is a standalone desktop video editing application that makes your videos look better. Drag and drop your video into the software, select from the menu of presets, and let the deep-learning robot minds cast their magic. You can even upscale your footage. That means that all your grainy, blurry old 1080p film can now be enhanced to 4K or 8K. You can also render your footage in slow motion which can be handy if you forgot to shoot in the correct frame rate: Let’s say you shot at 24 fps – give Topaz that video and the AI will create new frames between the actual frames you shot, so your 24 fps could become 60 fps, and you can slow it right down. The program also has two types of image stabilization to help you produce engaging videos: The first crops into your footage to create this effect, and the other is image-aware and will fill in the missing gaps around the edges of your video so that the field of view doesn’t change. With this powerful AI video editing software, you can tweak just about any setting you’d want to use to enhance the quality of your footage – the frame rate, the amount of grain, or the sharpness. Not only that, you can create your own custom presets for adding to future videos. Topaz Video AI Review 3. Filmora | Affordable AI Video Maker Pros Simple, easy-to-use interface Good suite of AI tools Subscription or perpetual license options Affordable Cons Doesn’t have the slick feel of some competitors download As well as giving you all the tools you’d expect from a video editing suite, for adding templates, titles and subtitles, and for making adjustments to the video and audio tracks, Filmora also has some fantastic AI tools. You can adjust your footage’s aspect ratio, upscale video resolution from lowly 1080p to, for example, 4K, and change your frame rate to make fast video slow and slow video fast. Other AI tools include their chroma key, which enables you to remove specific background colours. This is especially useful for green screen footage, to make the background transparent so that you can add other media. AI portrait does essentially the same thing and removes even complex backgrounds from behind subjects. Added to that, Filmora has AI image stabilization, and lens correction to help you sort out any irritating distortion your lens might have gifted you. In general, Filmora is my recommended video editing software for beginners – it may not have every feature of Final Cut or Adobe Premiere for video creation, but for the price, it can’t be beaten. Filmora Review Best green screen software 4. Deep Brain | Text to Speech AI Video Tools Pros Innovative AI human technology Multi-language text-to-speech solutions Wide application across sectors Free online AI video editor Highly customizable avatars Cons Learning curve download DeepBrain AI stands out in the field of artificial intelligence with its cutting-edge AI human technology. It excels at creating real-time, interactive artificial humans that can be employed in various domains, such as customer service, virtual assistance, and educational content delivery. Their service enables the use of AI avatars that are customizable to suit different business needs, providing a unique interactive experience for end-users. It’s particularly beneficial for enterprises looking to scale their operations with AI while maintaining a human-like touch in their customer engagement strategies. 5. Fliki | Best AI Video Generator Pros Simple workflow to convert ideas, scripts, blogs, PPT, product URLs, and tweets into videos 2000+ AI voices in 75+ languages and 100+ dialects First in the industry to offer AI-generated video clips High-quality avatars with voice cloning in 29 languages Translate/Dub videos in 75+ Languages Intuitive and easy-to-use interface Cons Require a paid subscription for premium features download Fliki is a groundbreaking text to video AI tool perfect for transforming text into engaging videos with professional voiceovers. Its user-friendly design makes it accessible even to those with little technical experience, allowing them to produce high-quality video content effortlessly. Fliki’s extensive voice selection, available in 75+ languages and over 100 dialects, provides unparalleled personalization options. It also offers advanced voice cloning in 29 languages, and it leads the industry with its unique AI video clips—just input text and watch as Fliki’s AI crafts distinct video content akin to OpenAI’s Sora technology. Whether you’re a content creator, a marketer, or just someone with a personal project, Fliki AI Video Generator provides the tools and flexibility needed to produce visually appealing and impactful videos. 6. Veed.io Pros Good for beginners Easy to learn Range of templates and tools Speech to subtitles feature Cons Some features are only available in higher price plans download One of the best AI video editing options for beginners is Veed.io. It has an extremely simple and easy-to-learn interface, but despite this, it still packs a punch. Veed.io has many of the features of the previous two video editing software programs in this article. With it, you can change the frame rate to speed up or slow down your footage, and you can also remove backgrounds with a single click. Something it’s well-known for is its AI-powered speech to subtitles tool, which accurately transcribes in moments, saving you potential hours of work. And there’s also the text-to-speech feature. With this, you can give your video a voiceover without manually recording your own voice, and you can choose from a range of voice profiles and accents. I’ve included Veed in this list of the best AI video software because I’ve spent many a day transcribing videos manually, and know how frustrating it can be. What is an AI camera? 7. Synthesia Pros Easy way to make presentations Powerful, simple-to-use tool Impressive range of features Affordable AI video creation platform Cons Limited, specialized use case download Synthesia specializes in speech-to-video creation using artificial intelligence to create engaging videos. They give you a range of templates and amazingly lifelike avatars which you can make say anything you want – ideal for creating YouTube videos you don’t want to appear in. Whatever you type, they can say in a range of accents, using diction and, in the most recent iteration, gestures. It’s spooky how realistic it all sounds – even if you don’t have any staff or any desire to appear in YouTube videos yourself, Synthesia can help with your video creation. You can add a background behind your avatar, add a music track, and use a range of other tools to make the video your own. How can AI benefit photography? 8. InVideo Pros Easy to use and learn Simple but powerful Simple, two-tier pricing Article-to-text feature Cons Only the highest membership tiers have access to the best video and image libraries download This software shares a lot in look and feel with Veed.io. It has a super-simple, clean interface that is very easy to navigate. It also has a vast bank of templates for a range of needs from sports to marketing, to help you kick things off. One of its most impressive features is the AI-powered article-to-text tool. With this, you can copy and paste an article into the tool, and it will scrape the text to extract the main ideas, and then create concise content around these. It can create a unique video from an article too. Let’s say I wanted to make a video from this article – I could just paste the URL into InVid, and the video would be created for me! This makes it the best AI video tool for batch creating multiple clips from a blog. Like Veed.io, InVideo also offers automated text-to-speech. No more need to record voiceovers, all thanks to the power of video artificial intelligence. What’s the best mobile video editing app for iPhone and Android? 9. Descript Pros Unique product Powerful editing tools Edit video with text Slick interface Cons It’s not for everyone, but that’s just me trying to find something to say download One for the podcasters. A powerful speech-to-text editor that will save you time by allowing you to edit automatically transcribed text and video voiceover at the same time. Simply put, you can record yourself, your voice and your face, and Descript uses AI to make a video and a written script from this. You can then edit that script, for example shortening long pauses in your speech, removing filler and thinking words, or removing whole phrases. Whatever you remove is also removed from the recorded footage, thereby seamlessly editing your video with AI. The software also allows you to sync your visuals with specific moments in the script, and there’s a toolbar to help you collaborate on a project with a team. Add to that powerful video editing features such as the ability to grade colours, remove backgrounds, and beef up sound quality, and you have yourself a winner. 10. FlexClip Pros Interface good for beginners Great template and stock library AI speech to text AI text to speech Cons Limited tools for pros Only exports to 1080p download This software is rich in templates and has an impressive amount of stock imagery and video you can use to inspire or pad out your videos. The interface is very simple – it’s the best AI video editing software I tested for beginners, who will get the hang of it very easily. Once you have your footage uploaded, you have the standard range of editing tools to work with, to make your video look exactly as you want it to. You can adjust the brightness, and the speed, you can flip it around, trim it, or use FlexClip’s range of filters to automatically adjust the colours. In terms of AI video creation features, there’s speech-to-text, which can quickly generate subtitles, and text-to-speech, which can help you make natural-sounding voiceovers. 11. Rawshorts Pros Good library of resources Timesaver for small businesses Text to animation Automatic voice generator Cons Free version is quite limited download This powerful tool is specifically for people who want to make video animations. Write a script (or get ChatGPT to do that for you!) and paste it into the program. The software will then generate a voiceover, scrape your text for the main ideas, and then use those to make a coherent, animated storyboard. You’ve probably seen these types of animations used on software product sales pages to explain how to use the software. This type of animation can cost thousands of dollars to produce (not to mention countless hours of drawing), but now thanks to AI, you can do it for a fraction of the time and cost. If you need to create videos for small businesses, you can imagine how much easier this clever AI video tool can make your work. 12. Lumen 5 Pros Quick and easy tool to use Text to video Good range of editing tools Cons Free version is very limited download This nifty AI video editing softwa re software helps you automatically transform blog posts, Zoom calls, or articles, into video. It’s super easy to do. For example, just paste your blog article URL into the program, and it will extract the key points to match them with relevant text and video. From there, you can tweak what you want, edit text, and swap out photos and videos from Lumen 5’s online library. You can also make talking head videos and enhance your videos with callouts and cutaways. My favourite feature is the ability to select words in the transcript (auto-generated by AI, of course!), then match the visuals directly to the timing of the audio. For video creation for social media, which often needs captions timed to voice over or talking heads, this AI video app is insanely useful. 13. SyntheSys Pros Professional-level software Text-to-video capabilities Easy-to-use dashboard Cons More expensive than other text-to-video competitors download Using SyntheSys, you can get a lifelike avatar to present a video for you, generated from text, or create a natural-sounding voiceover track. They have a library of male and female avatars, and their technology allows them to use gestures, and natural voice tones, and speak in 145 languages. It’s a great tool for businesses, or anyone wanting to quickly create human-looking and -sounding content for commercial purposes. Whether you want to remain anonymous in your video clips or simply prefer to use someone else, AI video generators like this can help speed up your video creation process. What Is the Best AI Tool to Create Videos? It really depends on what kind of video you want to create, as there is quite a diverse range of AI video generators out there for different use cases. A cinematographer or videographer is more likely to need a tool with the power and scope of Topaz Video AI or Filmora. These can really help you dive deep into your footage and create something extraordinary for professional videos. Veed.io and InVid are best for beginners or those who perhaps need video clips for personal use or smaller scale production edits. Then there are the tools that are better for small businesses, YouTubers, or for commercial use. Descript is a great tool for Youtubers and podcasters to clean up their script and video, whereas Rawshorts will help you create an animation from your script. Those looking for AI to make them a voiceover or a complete presentation with a video or even an avatar will need something different again. Lumen 5, for example, will help you create high quality videos like these, while Synthesia or SyntheSys will generate a presentation for you with a human-ish presenter. How Does an AI Video Generator Work? The computer science behind the nuts and bolts of AI video generation is beyond both my human intelligence and the scope of this article. But in simple terms, what I understand of it is that machine-learning, the machine who has learned – which is a way of saying ‘an extremely powerful computer’ – knowing language on some robotic, mathematical level, scrapes the text and converts it into computer language: numbers. As computers understand everything in these terms, the combinations of numbers it receives from the text will correspond to number patterns within videos that express the same ideas as the text. They will match. And thus, a video is born. AI Video Editing Software FAQ s What is the best AI tool to create videos? For creating videos and ease of use, I’d have to say Lumen 5 for enabling you to quickly make a coherent video from text, or SyntheSys for creating realistic avatar-led video presentations. For specific edits, Topaz Video AI can’t be beaten. Is there an AI that edits videos? Yes. For example, Topaz AI and Filmora both help you edit your videos. You can use image stabilization, change the frame rate to create natural-looking slow-motion effects, upscale your videos, and do many more things that only a year or so ago, weren’t possible. How do I know if a video was created by AI? With many ai video editing tools, you simply won’t know, and that’s increasingly the case. The AI tools in Topaz Video AI are so powerful there’s really no way of telling if that slow-motion video was originally filmed at 60 fps or 24 fps. Likewise, the human avatar you can use to give your video presentations can use natural gestures, voice tones and intonation, which can make it very difficult to know if they’re real or not. Take for example, the Deep Fake video below: It’s certainly very hard to spot if the video creation was by AI or if it was actual footage. What AI video app is everyone using? Everyone is using all of them! All of the video apps in this article are being used by someone, somewhere to save time, to be more efficient, and to create something more compelling for a variety of use cases. If I had to choose one, I’d say it was Topaz Video AI, just because that’s the world I come from, and I know that it’s a very popular resource. For another use case, I’d find it hard to believe that most podcasters weren’t using Descript, as it’s such a powerful and powerfully specialised tool. Is Synthesia Ai video free to use? No, it’s not. Synthesia is only offered on a subscription basis. AI Video Editing Tools: Final Words So there you go. Honestly, even though I wrote this article myself, my mind is a little blown. AI is so new, but it can already do so much. It’s hard to know where it’s going to lead, but although that’s a little terrifying, it’s also exciting. Especially if you’re working with video. The AI video generators and tools available to you are so powerful that they will change the way you film and the way you think about filming. Cinematographers can make 8K cinematic, slow-motion, fully stabilized footage from 1080p footage filmed on an old camera. YouTubers can make video content of themselves with all their thinking words removed. Businesses can make promo videos, voiceovers or video presentations without hiring voiceover artists. It’s head-spinning! Doesn’t it make you want to create AI generated videos just to see how incredible the technology has become? If you’re not already using AI video generators in some form, it definitelt feels like right now is the time to start.

You can adjust your footage’s aspect ratio, upscale video resolution from lowly 1080p to, for example, 4K, and change your frame rate to make fast video slow and slow video fast. Other AI tools include their chroma key, which enables you to remove specific background colours. This is especially useful for green screen footage, to make the background transparent so that you can add other media. AI portrait does essentially the same thing and removes even complex backgrounds from behind subjects. Added to that, Filmora has AI image stabilization, and lens correction to help you sort out any irritating distortion your lens might have gifted you. In general, Filmora is my recommended video editing software for beginners – it may not have every feature of Final Cut or Adobe Premiere for video creation, but for the price, it can’t be beaten. Filmora Review Best green screen software 4. Deep Brain | Text to Speech AI Video Tools Pros Innovative AI human technology Multi-language text-to-speech solutions Wide application across sectors Free online AI video editor Highly customizable avatars Cons Learning curve download DeepBrain AI stands out in the field of artificial intelligence with its cutting-edge AI human technology.

Their service enables the use of AI avatars that are customizable to suit different business needs, providing a unique interactive experience for end-users. It’s particularly beneficial for enterprises looking to scale their operations with AI while maintaining a human-like touch in their customer engagement strategies. 5.

Veed.io Pros Good for beginners Easy to learn Range of templates and tools Speech to subtitles feature Cons Some features are only available in higher price plans download One of the best AI video editing options for beginners is Veed.io. It has an extremely simple and easy-to-learn interface, but despite this, it still packs a punch. Veed.io has many of the features of the previous two video editing software programs in this article. With it, you can change the frame rate to speed up or slow down your footage, and you can also remove backgrounds with a single click. Something it’s well-known for is its AI-powered speech to subtitles tool, which accurately transcribes in moments, saving you potential hours of work. And there’s also the text-to-speech feature. With this, you can give your video a voiceover without manually recording your own voice, and you can choose from a range of voice profiles and accents. I’ve included Veed in this list of the best AI video software because I’ve spent many a day transcribing videos manually, and know how frustrating it can be. What is an AI camera? 7. Synthesia Pros Easy way to make presentations Powerful, simple-to-use tool Impressive range of features Affordable AI video creation platform Cons Limited, specialized use case download Synthesia specializes in speech-to-video creation using artificial intelligence to create engaging videos. They give you a range of templates and amazingly lifelike avatars which you can make say anything you want – ideal for creating YouTube videos you don’t want to appear in. Whatever you type, they can say in a range of accents, using diction and, in the most recent iteration, gestures. It’s spooky how realistic it all sounds – even if you don’t have any staff or any desire to appear in YouTube videos yourself, Synthesia can help with your video creation. You can add a background behind your avatar, add a music track, and use a range of other tools to make the video your own. How can AI benefit photography? 8. InVideo Pros Easy to use and learn Simple but powerful Simple, two-tier pricing Article-to-text feature Cons Only the highest membership tiers have access to the best video and image libraries download This software shares a lot in look and feel with Veed.io. It has a super-simple, clean interface that is very easy to navigate. It also has a vast bank of templates for a range of needs from sports to marketing, to help you kick things off. One of its most impressive features is the AI-powered article-to-text tool. With this, you can copy and paste an article into the tool, and it will scrape the text to extract the main ideas, and then create concise content around these. It can create a unique video from an article too. Let’s say I wanted to make a video from this article – I could just paste the URL into InVid, and the video would be created for me! This makes it the best AI video tool for batch creating multiple clips from a blog. Like Veed.io, InVideo also offers automated text-to-speech. No more need to record voiceovers, all thanks to the power of video artificial intelligence. What’s the best mobile video editing app for iPhone and Android? 9. Descript Pros Unique product Powerful editing tools Edit video with text Slick interface Cons It’s not for everyone, but that’s just me trying to find something to say download One for the podcasters. A powerful speech-to-text editor that will save you time by allowing you to edit automatically transcribed text and video voiceover at the same time. Simply put, you can record yourself, your voice and your face, and Descript uses AI to make a video and a written script from this. You can then edit that script, for example shortening long pauses in your speech, removing filler and thinking words, or removing whole phrases. Whatever you remove is also removed from the recorded footage, thereby seamlessly editing your video with AI. The software also allows you to sync your visuals with specific moments in the script, and there’s a toolbar to help you collaborate on a project with a team. Add to that powerful video editing features such as the ability to grade colours, remove backgrounds, and beef up sound quality, and you have yourself a winner. 10. FlexClip Pros Interface good for beginners Great template and stock library AI speech to text AI text to speech Cons Limited tools for pros Only exports to 1080p download This software is rich in templates and has an impressive amount of stock imagery and video you can use to inspire or pad out your videos. The interface is very simple – it’s the best AI video editing software I tested for beginners, who will get the hang of it very easily. Once you have your footage uploaded, you have the standard range of editing tools to work with, to make your video look exactly as you want it to. You can adjust the brightness, and the speed, you can flip it around, trim it, or use FlexClip’s range of filters to automatically adjust the colours. In terms of AI video creation features, there’s speech-to-text, which can quickly generate subtitles, and text-to-speech, which can help you make natural-sounding voiceovers. 11. Rawshorts Pros Good library of resources Timesaver for small businesses Text to animation Automatic voice generator Cons Free version is quite limited download This powerful tool is specifically for people who want to make video animations. Write a script (or get ChatGPT to do that for you!) and paste it into the program. The software will then generate a voiceover, scrape your text for the main ideas, and then use those to make a coherent, animated storyboard. You’ve probably seen these types of animations used on software product sales pages to explain how to use the software. This type of animation can cost thousands of dollars to produce (not to mention countless hours of drawing), but now thanks to AI, you can do it for a fraction of the time and cost. If you need to create videos for small businesses, you can imagine how much easier this clever AI video tool can make your work. 12. Lumen 5 Pros Quick and easy tool to use Text to video Good range of editing tools Cons Free version is very limited download This nifty AI video editing softwa re software helps you automatically transform blog posts, Zoom calls, or articles, into video. It’s super easy to do. For example, just paste your blog article URL into the program, and it will extract the key points to match them with relevant text and video. From there, you can tweak what you want, edit text, and swap out photos and videos from Lumen 5’s online library. You can also make talking head videos and enhance your videos with callouts and cutaways. My favourite feature is the ability to select words in the transcript (auto-generated by AI, of course!), then match the visuals directly to the timing of the audio. For video creation for social media, which often needs captions timed to voice over or talking heads, this AI video app is insanely useful. 13. SyntheSys Pros Professional-level software Text-to-video capabilities Easy-to-use dashboard Cons More expensive than other text-to-video competitors download Using SyntheSys, you can get a lifelike avatar to present a video for you, generated from text, or create a natural-sounding voiceover track. They have a library of male and female avatars, and their technology allows them to use gestures, and natural voice tones, and speak in 145 languages. It’s a great tool for businesses, or anyone wanting to quickly create human-looking and -sounding content for commercial purposes. Whether you want to remain anonymous in your video clips or simply prefer to use someone else, AI video generators like this can help speed up your video creation process. What Is the Best AI Tool to Create Videos? It really depends on what kind of video you want to create, as there is quite a diverse range of AI video generators out there for different use cases. A cinematographer or videographer is more likely to need a tool with the power and scope of Topaz Video AI or Filmora. These can really help you dive deep into your footage and create something extraordinary for professional videos. Veed.io and InVid are best for beginners or those who perhaps need video clips for personal use or smaller scale production edits. Then there are the tools that are better for small businesses, YouTubers, or for commercial use. Descript is a great tool for Youtubers and podcasters to clean up their script and video, whereas Rawshorts will help you create an animation from your script. Those looking for AI to make them a voiceover or a complete presentation with a video or even an avatar will need something different again. Lumen 5, for example, will help you create high quality videos like these, while Synthesia or SyntheSys will generate a presentation for you with a human-ish presenter. How Does an AI Video Generator Work? The computer science behind the nuts and bolts of AI video generation is beyond both my human intelligence and the scope of this article. But in simple terms, what I understand of it is that machine-learning, the machine who has learned – which is a way of saying ‘an extremely powerful computer’ – knowing language on some robotic, mathematical level, scrapes the text and converts it into computer language: numbers. As computers understand everything in these terms, the combinations of numbers it receives from the text will correspond to number patterns within videos that express the same ideas as the text. They will match. And thus, a video is born. AI Video Editing Software FAQ s What is the best AI tool to create videos? For creating videos and ease of use, I’d have to say Lumen 5 for enabling you to quickly make a coherent video from text, or SyntheSys for creating realistic avatar-led video presentations. For specific edits, Topaz Video AI can’t be beaten. Is there an AI that edits videos? Yes. For example, Topaz AI and Filmora both help you edit your videos. You can use image stabilization, change the frame rate to create natural-looking slow-motion effects, upscale your videos, and do many more things that only a year or so ago, weren’t possible. How do I know if a video was created by AI? With many ai video editing tools, you simply won’t know, and that’s increasingly the case. The AI tools in Topaz Video AI are so powerful there’s really no way of telling if that slow-motion video was originally filmed at 60 fps or 24 fps. Likewise, the human avatar you can use to give your video presentations can use natural gestures, voice tones and intonation, which can make it very difficult to know if they’re real or not. Take for example, the Deep Fake video below: It’s certainly very hard to spot if the video creation was by AI or if it was actual footage. What AI video app is everyone using? Everyone is using all of them! All of the video apps in this article are being used by someone, somewhere to save time, to be more efficient, and to create something more compelling for a variety of use cases. If I had to choose one, I’d say it was Topaz Video AI, just because that’s the world I come from, and I know that it’s a very popular resource. For another use case, I’d find it hard to believe that most podcasters weren’t using Descript, as it’s such a powerful and powerfully specialised tool. Is Synthesia Ai video free to use? No, it’s not. Synthesia is only offered on a subscription basis. AI Video Editing Tools: Final Words So there you go. Honestly, even though I wrote this article myself, my mind is a little blown. AI is so new, but it can already do so much. It’s hard to know where it’s going to lead, but although that’s a little terrifying, it’s also exciting. Especially if you’re working with video. The AI video generators and tools available to you are so powerful that they will change the way you film and the way you think about filming. Cinematographers can make 8K cinematic, slow-motion, fully stabilized footage from 1080p footage filmed on an old camera. YouTubers can make video content of themselves with all their thinking words removed. Businesses can make promo videos, voiceovers or video presentations without hiring voiceover artists. It’s head-spinning! Doesn’t it make you want to create AI generated videos just to see how incredible the technology has become? If you’re not already using AI video generators in some form, it definitelt feels like right now is the time to start.

Load More Results Home Marketing Disruptive AI Video Trends that are Transforming Marketing in 2024 Disruptive AI Video Trends that are Transforming Marketing in 2024 Written by: Kipp Bodnar and Kieran Flanagan THE STATE OF AI IN 2024 New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing with AI. Download the Free Report Updated: 08/01/24 Published: 07/23/24 AI-generated video content is turning the marketing world on its head. But what trends should marketers be focusing on to stay ahead of the competition? If you've been following the latest buzz in AI marketing trends — and you should be — you know that AI video tools are at the forefront of this change. Whether it’s trained ad avatars or hyper-personalized video scripts, these technologies are irreversibly changing how we create content and engage with our audiences. But with such rapid innovation, what’s actually worth the hype? Kieran and I experimented with some of these new developments in a recent episode of Marketing Against the Grain, including a viral AI video on Twitter and an AI-generated ad created in less than 15 minutes. Among the many AI video options available, these four trends have been particularly notable — and are worth paying close attention to. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video 1. Avatar actors and likeness licensing are the new norm. Instead of hiring an actor to read a script or act in an ad, businesses can now license an actor’s likeness, use it to train an AI model, and then use that model to create ads and avatars. This enables marketers to quickly generate a variety of content, testing, and refining different approaches and messages without the logistical constraints of traditional video shoots. For example, this viral video ad features a woman casually talking about a product while seated inside her car. What’s so significant about it, however, is that while she’s a real actress hired off of Fiverr, the video itself is generated by AI video, using tools like Arcads. \"This produces video content that is human-trained but AI-agent delivered,\" Kieran explains. \"That’s quite an unbelievable concept to think through.\" 2. Low-quality but authentic content is driving engagement. Polished, high-budget video ads are quickly becoming a thing of the past — or at least, less favored by audiences. Instead, low-production, personable videos are taking the lead, outperforming traditional ads on platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels. Take, for example, the viral video I mentioned above: it’s not polished or high-budget. Instead, it’s set in a poorly-lit car, with an unflattering angle. Yet people are more likely to engage with it. Why? \"Because it feels authentic, relatable, and personable,\" Kieran explains. \"It’s how a real person would talk about a product.\" For marketers, this shift means experimenting with AI tools like HeyGen and InfinityAI, which quickly create videos that drive engagement, despite — or even because of — their imperfections. 3. Video personalization and customization are must-haves. Hyper-personalized videos that cater to customers’ accessibility needs, languages, and preferences are essential for successful marketing campaigns. During the episode, we highlighted how AI tools can use customer data from your CRM platform — like call logs, support tickets, and emails — to craft personalized video scripts. This enables marketing teams to deliver tailored content that feels uniquely targeted and relevant to each individual viewer. We also experimented with HeyGen’s groundbreaking Avatar in Motion, which creates customized avatars based on your own likeness. Move your hands, make gestures, or use unique tones of voice, and HeyGen will flawlessly track, translate, and lip-sync your video with any customizable input text. 4. Accelerated iteration is driving innovation. AI tools significantly speed up the iteration cycle for creative video content and limit lengthy and expensive production cycles. For example, during the episode, I showed Kieran how I designed and launched a video ad in less than 15 minutes. To stay ahead, marketers need to quickly and constantly innovate, as the ease of copying and templatizing creative work will lead to a rapid commoditization of content. Standard approaches to AI-powered video content may outperform current methods in the short term because they’re new and different. But effectiveness is likely to peak within the first six to twelve months. Then, it will taper off as audiences get used to it and become aware of its widespread use. \"Your best-performing content will now be ‘best-performing’ for a much shorter period of time,\" says Kieran. In other words: your iteration of ‘creative’ as a marketer will have to increase exponentially. Differentiation will rely heavily on the unique 10-20% of creative input, putting increased pressure on marketers to continually produce new and distinctive ideas. Three Tips for Integrating AI into Your Video Marketing Strategy Learn how to incorporate AI into your video workflow by downloading our AI Guide for Marketers and following the tips below. 1. Experiment. Experiment. Experiment. Test different AI video tools to understand their benefits and limitations, helping you find the best fit for your campaign needs and goals. This keeps your team ahead of the competition, identifying new opportunities to capture the attention of your customers. 2. Enhance the Tools You Already Use Not sure where to start? Try using AI video features that already exist in your current marketing tech stack. For example, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Mailchimp offer AI-powered capabilities that boost your marketing effectiveness by automating production processes and offering more detailed performance insights for iteration. 3. Monitor Legal and Ethical Considerations As AI video production becomes more prevalent, legal considerations around likeness licensing and content use will become increasingly important. Invest in the proper training and resources now to ensure you are using AI effectively and ethically in the future.

Adobe Premiere Pro | Best AI Software to Create Videos Pros Best all round video editor Cloud-syncing for backups Free trial available Colour matching speeds up edits Auto reframing useful for social media Cons Subscription based model Steep learning curve Requires high computer specs download Not only is Premiere Pro my pick of the best video editing software, but it’s now my favourite AI video app too. With the latest version you can download using the button above, you’ll get some crazy powerful AI tools to make creating high quality videos a cinch. Colour Match allows you to match the colours in two different clips in your sequence to help get rid of any discrepancies between different shots in the same scene – really useful if you use two different cameras. The Auto Reframe tool is a godsend for social media video content, allowing you to change horizontal 16:9 video footage into a tall 9:16 aspec ratio, perfect for instagram Stories or YouTube Shorts. If you shoot interviews, the auto audio ducking feature uses AI to lower the volume of music when dialogue is happening Adobe Sensei is the ‘brain’ behind the AI in Premiere Pro, providing other features such as Auto Classification which tags your footage and Morph Cut which smoothes out jump cuts. Overall, even if you didn’t use any of the AI video features in Premiere Pro, you’d still be left with the top editing software of the year – start by downloading a free trial and see what you think. How to Download Adobe Premiere Pro 2. Topaz Video AI | Photography AI Tool for Enlargements Pros Extremely powerful video editing tool Free trial available Upscaling, image stabilization, and slow-motion capabilities Can generate multiple previews at the same time Cons Relatively expensive download Simply put, Topaz Video AI is a standalone desktop video editing application that makes your videos look better. Drag and drop your video into the software, select from the menu of presets, and let the deep-learning robot minds cast their magic. You can even upscale your footage. That means that all your grainy, blurry old 1080p film can now be enhanced to 4K or 8K. You can also render your footage in slow motion which can be handy if you forgot to shoot in the correct frame rate: Let’s say you shot at 24 fps – give Topaz that video and the AI will create new frames between the actual frames you shot, so your 24 fps could become 60 fps, and you can slow it right down. The program also has two types of image stabilization to help you produce engaging videos: The first crops into your footage to create this effect, and the other is image-aware and will fill in the missing gaps around the edges of your video so that the field of view doesn’t change. With this powerful AI video editing software, you can tweak just about any setting you’d want to use to enhance the quality of your footage – the frame rate, the amount of grain, or the sharpness. Not only that, you can create your own custom presets for adding to future videos. Topaz Video AI Review 3. Filmora | Affordable AI Video Maker Pros Simple, easy-to-use interface Good suite of AI tools Subscription or perpetual license options Affordable Cons Doesn’t have the slick feel of some competitors download As well as giving you all the tools you’d expect from a video editing suite, for adding templates, titles and subtitles, and for making adjustments to the video and audio tracks, Filmora also has some fantastic AI tools. You can adjust your footage’s aspect ratio, upscale video resolution from lowly 1080p to, for example, 4K, and change your frame rate to make fast video slow and slow video fast. Other AI tools include their chroma key, which enables you to remove specific background colours. This is especially useful for green screen footage, to make the background transparent so that you can add other media. AI portrait does essentially the same thing and removes even complex backgrounds from behind subjects. Added to that, Filmora has AI image stabilization, and lens correction to help you sort out any irritating distortion your lens might have gifted you. In general, Filmora is my recommended video editing software for beginners – it may not have every feature of Final Cut or Adobe Premiere for video creation, but for the price, it can’t be beaten. Filmora Review Best green screen software 4. Deep Brain | Text to Speech AI Video Tools Pros Innovative AI human technology Multi-language text-to-speech solutions Wide application across sectors Free online AI video editor Highly customizable avatars Cons Learning curve download DeepBrain AI stands out in the field of artificial intelligence with its cutting-edge AI human technology. It excels at creating real-time, interactive artificial humans that can be employed in various domains, such as customer service, virtual assistance, and educational content delivery. Their service enables the use of AI avatars that are customizable to suit different business needs, providing a unique interactive experience for end-users. It’s particularly beneficial for enterprises looking to scale their operations with AI while maintaining a human-like touch in their customer engagement strategies. 5. Fliki | Best AI Video Generator Pros Simple workflow to convert ideas, scripts, blogs, PPT, product URLs, and tweets into videos 2000+ AI voices in 75+ languages and 100+ dialects First in the industry to offer AI-generated video clips High-quality avatars with voice cloning in 29 languages Translate/Dub videos in 75+ Languages Intuitive and easy-to-use interface Cons Require a paid subscription for premium features download Fliki is a groundbreaking text to video AI tool perfect for transforming text into engaging videos with professional voiceovers. Its user-friendly design makes it accessible even to those with little technical experience, allowing them to produce high-quality video content effortlessly. Fliki’s extensive voice selection, available in 75+ languages and over 100 dialects, provides unparalleled personalization options. It also offers advanced voice cloning in 29 languages, and it leads the industry with its unique AI video clips—just input text and watch as Fliki’s AI crafts distinct video content akin to OpenAI’s Sora technology. Whether you’re a content creator, a marketer, or just someone with a personal project, Fliki AI Video Generator provides the tools and flexibility needed to produce visually appealing and impactful videos. 6. Veed.io Pros Good for beginners Easy to learn Range of templates and tools Speech to subtitles feature Cons Some features are only available in higher price plans download One of the best AI video editing options for beginners is Veed.io. It has an extremely simple and easy-to-learn interface, but despite this, it still packs a punch. Veed.io has many of the features of the previous two video editing software programs in this article. With it, you can change the frame rate to speed up or slow down your footage, and you can also remove backgrounds with a single click. Something it’s well-known for is its AI-powered speech to subtitles tool, which accurately transcribes in moments, saving you potential hours of work. And there’s also the text-to-speech feature. With this, you can give your video a voiceover without manually recording your own voice, and you can choose from a range of voice profiles and accents. I’ve included Veed in this list of the best AI video software because I’ve spent many a day transcribing videos manually, and know how frustrating it can be. What is an AI camera? 7. Synthesia Pros Easy way to make presentations Powerful, simple-to-use tool Impressive range of features Affordable AI video creation platform Cons Limited, specialized use case download Synthesia specializes in speech-to-video creation using artificial intelligence to create engaging videos. They give you a range of templates and amazingly lifelike avatars which you can make say anything you want – ideal for creating YouTube videos you don’t want to appear in. Whatever you type, they can say in a range of accents, using diction and, in the most recent iteration, gestures. It’s spooky how realistic it all sounds – even if you don’t have any staff or any desire to appear in YouTube videos yourself, Synthesia can help with your video creation. You can add a background behind your avatar, add a music track, and use a range of other tools to make the video your own. How can AI benefit photography? 8. InVideo Pros Easy to use and learn Simple but powerful Simple, two-tier pricing Article-to-text feature Cons Only the highest membership tiers have access to the best video and image libraries download This software shares a lot in look and feel with Veed.io. It has a super-simple, clean interface that is very easy to navigate. It also has a vast bank of templates for a range of needs from sports to marketing, to help you kick things off. One of its most impressive features is the AI-powered article-to-text tool. With this, you can copy and paste an article into the tool, and it will scrape the text to extract the main ideas, and then create concise content around these. It can create a unique video from an article too. Let’s say I wanted to make a video from this article – I could just paste the URL into InVid, and the video would be created for me! This makes it the best AI video tool for batch creating multiple clips from a blog. Like Veed.io, InVideo also offers automated text-to-speech. No more need to record voiceovers, all thanks to the power of video artificial intelligence. What’s the best mobile video editing app for iPhone and Android? 9. Descript Pros Unique product Powerful editing tools Edit video with text Slick interface Cons It’s not for everyone, but that’s just me trying to find something to say download One for the podcasters. A powerful speech-to-text editor that will save you time by allowing you to edit automatically transcribed text and video voiceover at the same time. Simply put, you can record yourself, your voice and your face, and Descript uses AI to make a video and a written script from this. You can then edit that script, for example shortening long pauses in your speech, removing filler and thinking words, or removing whole phrases. Whatever you remove is also removed from the recorded footage, thereby seamlessly editing your video with AI. The software also allows you to sync your visuals with specific moments in the script, and there’s a toolbar to help you collaborate on a project with a team. Add to that powerful video editing features such as the ability to grade colours, remove backgrounds, and beef up sound quality, and you have yourself a winner. 10. FlexClip Pros Interface good for beginners Great template and stock library AI speech to text AI text to speech Cons Limited tools for pros Only exports to 1080p download This software is rich in templates and has an impressive amount of stock imagery and video you can use to inspire or pad out your videos. The interface is very simple – it’s the best AI video editing software I tested for beginners, who will get the hang of it very easily. Once you have your footage uploaded, you have the standard range of editing tools to work with, to make your video look exactly as you want it to. You can adjust the brightness, and the speed, you can flip it around, trim it, or use FlexClip’s range of filters to automatically adjust the colours. In terms of AI video creation features, there’s speech-to-text, which can quickly generate subtitles, and text-to-speech, which can help you make natural-sounding voiceovers. 11. Rawshorts Pros Good library of resources Timesaver for small businesses Text to animation Automatic voice generator Cons Free version is quite limited download This powerful tool is specifically for people who want to make video animations. Write a script (or get ChatGPT to do that for you!) and paste it into the program. The software will then generate a voiceover, scrape your text for the main ideas, and then use those to make a coherent, animated storyboard. You’ve probably seen these types of animations used on software product sales pages to explain how to use the software. This type of animation can cost thousands of dollars to produce (not to mention countless hours of drawing), but now thanks to AI, you can do it for a fraction of the time and cost. If you need to create videos for small businesses, you can imagine how much easier this clever AI video tool can make your work. 12. Lumen 5 Pros Quick and easy tool to use Text to video Good range of editing tools Cons Free version is very limited download This nifty AI video editing softwa re software helps you automatically transform blog posts, Zoom calls, or articles, into video. It’s super easy to do. For example, just paste your blog article URL into the program, and it will extract the key points to match them with relevant text and video. From there, you can tweak what you want, edit text, and swap out photos and videos from Lumen 5’s online library. You can also make talking head videos and enhance your videos with callouts and cutaways. My favourite feature is the ability to select words in the transcript (auto-generated by AI, of course!), then match the visuals directly to the timing of the audio. For video creation for social media, which often needs captions timed to voice over or talking heads, this AI video app is insanely useful. 13. SyntheSys Pros Professional-level software Text-to-video capabilities Easy-to-use dashboard Cons More expensive than other text-to-video competitors download Using SyntheSys, you can get a lifelike avatar to present a video for you, generated from text, or create a natural-sounding voiceover track. They have a library of male and female avatars, and their technology allows them to use gestures, and natural voice tones, and speak in 145 languages. It’s a great tool for businesses, or anyone wanting to quickly create human-looking and -sounding content for commercial purposes. Whether you want to remain anonymous in your video clips or simply prefer to use someone else, AI video generators like this can help speed up your video creation process. What Is the Best AI Tool to Create Videos? It really depends on what kind of video you want to create, as there is quite a diverse range of AI video generators out there for different use cases. A cinematographer or videographer is more likely to need a tool with the power and scope of Topaz Video AI or Filmora. These can really help you dive deep into your footage and create something extraordinary for professional videos. Veed.io and InVid are best for beginners or those who perhaps need video clips for personal use or smaller scale production edits. Then there are the tools that are better for small businesses, YouTubers, or for commercial use. Descript is a great tool for Youtubers and podcasters to clean up their script and video, whereas Rawshorts will help you create an animation from your script. Those looking for AI to make them a voiceover or a complete presentation with a video or even an avatar will need something different again. Lumen 5, for example, will help you create high quality videos like these, while Synthesia or SyntheSys will generate a presentation for you with a human-ish presenter. How Does an AI Video Generator Work? The computer science behind the nuts and bolts of AI video generation is beyond both my human intelligence and the scope of this article. But in simple terms, what I understand of it is that machine-learning, the machine who has learned – which is a way of saying ‘an extremely powerful computer’ – knowing language on some robotic, mathematical level, scrapes the text and converts it into computer language: numbers. As computers understand everything in these terms, the combinations of numbers it receives from the text will correspond to number patterns within videos that express the same ideas as the text. They will match. And thus, a video is born. AI Video Editing Software FAQ s What is the best AI tool to create videos? For creating videos and ease of use, I’d have to say Lumen 5 for enabling you to quickly make a coherent video from text, or SyntheSys for creating realistic avatar-led video presentations. For specific edits, Topaz Video AI can’t be beaten. Is there an AI that edits videos? Yes. For example, Topaz AI and Filmora both help you edit your videos. You can use image stabilization, change the frame rate to create natural-looking slow-motion effects, upscale your videos, and do many more things that only a year or so ago, weren’t possible. How do I know if a video was created by AI? With many ai video editing tools, you simply won’t know, and that’s increasingly the case. The AI tools in Topaz Video AI are so powerful there’s really no way of telling if that slow-motion video was originally filmed at 60 fps or 24 fps. Likewise, the human avatar you can use to give your video presentations can use natural gestures, voice tones and intonation, which can make it very difficult to know if they’re real or not. Take for example, the Deep Fake video below: It’s certainly very hard to spot if the video creation was by AI or if it was actual footage. What AI video app is everyone using? Everyone is using all of them! All of the video apps in this article are being used by someone, somewhere to save time, to be more efficient, and to create something more compelling for a variety of use cases. If I had to choose one, I’d say it was Topaz Video AI, just because that’s the world I come from, and I know that it’s a very popular resource. For another use case, I’d find it hard to believe that most podcasters weren’t using Descript, as it’s such a powerful and powerfully specialised tool. Is Synthesia Ai video free to use? No, it’s not. Synthesia is only offered on a subscription basis. AI Video Editing Tools: Final Words So there you go. Honestly, even though I wrote this article myself, my mind is a little blown. AI is so new, but it can already do so much. It’s hard to know where it’s going to lead, but although that’s a little terrifying, it’s also exciting. Especially if you’re working with video. The AI video generators and tools available to you are so powerful that they will change the way you film and the way you think about filming. Cinematographers can make 8K cinematic, slow-motion, fully stabilized footage from 1080p footage filmed on an old camera. YouTubers can make video content of themselves with all their thinking words removed. Businesses can make promo videos, voiceovers or video presentations without hiring voiceover artists. It’s head-spinning! Doesn’t it make you want to create AI generated videos just to see how incredible the technology has become? If you’re not already using AI video generators in some form, it definitelt feels like right now is the time to start. Editor's Choice Adobe Premiere Pro Use AI to reframe your videos in one click for multiple devices, match colours, tag footage and more in this popular full-featured video editor.
