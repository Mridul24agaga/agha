Generate Al videos with just text Create AI-Generated Videos Using Simple Prompts Try for free 1. Invideo AI Ready to make pro-level videos without the pro-level stress? Things are about to get easier with invideo AI by your side (even if you’re an absolute beginner). Forget the hefty investment in cameras and gear. With invideo AI, all you need to do is “imagine” what kind of video you want to produce and give a prompt based on that (e.g. create a video on “5 productivity tips and use American male accent”, and voilà – it’ll transform your ideas into stunning videos within minutes! So whether you're a budding entrepreneur, a content creator, or a marketer aiming to build your online presence, invideo AI will be your go-to tool. Best For: Pretty much everything! With invideo AI you can make professional-quality videos for YouTube channel, Instagram reels, TikTok, and other purposes such as social media posts, marketing campaigns, and product demos. Top Features: 1. Extensive Stock Media Library Invideo's artificial intelligence video generator gives you access to more than 16 million stock photos and videos. This helps you easily search and put the right video clips into any part of your video. If you need a specific picture or multiple photos, it quickly looks through this big collection pile and picks the best ones. This makes sure your video looks good and matches the requirements. 2. Text Prompt Video Editing This tool makes video editing easier by letting you fix things with easy words or phrases. It's like telling a human video editor what to do, but it's even easier with a tool. Need to remove a scene, use different stock footage, or change the accent? Just give a prompt, and the AI will do the rest. This makes editing easier, even if you don't know much about editing. 3. AI-Powered Script Generation Invideo's AI script maker helps you make interesting, custom scripts for any video project, which saves you a lot of time in writing scripts. This tool is especially useful for platforms like YouTube, where your content needs to be intriguing enough to engage people & grow your channel. 4. Affordable Voiceover Alternatives The AI voiceover generator is a cheaper option than paying for professional voice actors. It makes a speech that sounds like a human in multiple accents, understanding the feeling, intent, and emotion behind each word. This function makes your videos feel alive, adding a professional look without costing too much. Pros It quickly changes your words into videos, making creating content more manageable. You can spend more time on your work and less on technical stuff. With more than 16 million stock media choices, you have access to a unique selection of pictures. This is perfect if you want to create top-notch quality videos without investing hours in creating them. AI-powered script generation can save you a lot of time in making regular, good-quality video content. It's especially helpful if you often face writer's block or have tight schedules. The AI voiceover generator tool can save money while still giving a good sound experience. This is really helpful if you own a small business or are an individual creator. Cons Initially, you might need some time to learn how to interact with the AI well to get the results you want. However, as you proceed, this eventually gets easier as the interface itself is pretty user-friendly. The free version includes watermarks. But, this is a small worry because the paid version starts at just $25/month and gives you a ton of premium features. Pricing Basic: Free Plus: $25/month Max: $60/month (The yearly plans start as low as $20/month) Sign up for invideo AI and start creating high-quality videos within minutes. Try online AI video maker Create high-quality videos for your business with AI video maker easily Get Started Now 2. Descript Do you need help with problems like evoking human facial expressions and emotional responses or the technical bottlenecks that make the video generation process time-consuming? If yes, Descript can help your creative workflow and enrich the quality of your output, making it more high-end and appealing. Moreover, it also realizes the significance of the human side of video production as it's not designed to replace human creativity but to make it better, to give you a vision, and to let the AI do the heavy lifting. Best For: As such, it's best suited to content creators, podcasters, and filmmakers who need to save time and get things done the right way. Because it is a text-based editing system, even the not-so-tech-savvy can use it. Top Features: 1. Automated Transcription Manually transcribing audio and video is time-consuming. To save time, Descript automatically transcribes all your recordings. Since the transcription is merely a text file, if you edit the transcription content, you can also edit the audio or video file itself. 2. Overdub Voice Cloning With Descript's Overdub function, you can type in the missing or correct text and then artificially generate the new audio in your voice or that of the guest. Creating a voice clone of this type involves using a voice sample to make the process convenient and smooth. 3. Studio Sound Editing Poor audio quality can negatively impact great content. Descript tackles this problem with its Studio Sound feature, which applies state-of-the-art AI to enhance the sound quality of audio files. It eliminates noise, hum, and distortion, giving a cleaner and more professional studio-type sound. 4. Video Green Screen and AI Eye Contact The green screen background editor lets you change the environment behind the video, just like a Zoom feature, so you can have more control over how you present your content. This facilitates the humanizing of the video and adds to its realism. Pros It offers a fantastic transcription tool that can automatically transcribe audio and video files into text in 23 languages. It's a handy platform that lets you cut, rearrange, or alter the contents and simplifies editing. It improves the recorded audio quality by making the spoken words much clearer. This makes your content sound super-smooth without you having to edit out one word at a time. Descript also integrates with other platforms such as Slack (a team communication tool), Podbean (podcast hosting platform), Restream (a LIVE streaming studio), and even Final Cut Pro (a professional video editing application), to name a few. You also get tutorials on using the platform to help you quickly master the features and make the most of it. Cons The learning curve for Descript isn't very gentle for someone used to text-based editing. At first, this may seem patchy, but it is difficult for users of conventional timeline-based editing tools to work. Descript boasts a full range of powerful tools but may not meet the requirements of professional-level video editing. It doesn’t even provide the convenient access to advanced effects and controls that a professional editing package would provide. Pricing is a per-person, per-month fee. This can be costly for teams or organizations with many people, primarily if more than one person uses the software. Pricing Free Tier Creator Tier: $15 per user per month Pro Tier: $30 per user per month Enterprise Tier: Custom 3. Runway Runway is an advanced AI text-to-video generator that challenges how creative content is produced and edited. With more than 30 AI-powered creative tools on offer, it is a versatile product, capable of meeting the needs of filmmakers, artists, graphic designers, and content creators for YouTube and TikTok.

This is a valuable feature that lets you produce high-quality images, making it most suitable for tasks needing fine detail work. 4. Noise Reduction and Image Stabilization Noise reduction cleans up noisy or grainy photos, and image stabilization smoothes out shaky videos. Working together, they make your content refined and stylish. 5. Research and Innovation With generative AI, Runway ML will continue to be at the leading edge. As a user, you can enjoy the most advanced and revolutionary developments in this discipline. This means you are always testing the limits of possibility in generative A.I. Pros You can make your creative ideas into reality just by putting them in text. It provides unprecedented freedom of video creation, making it easy to think of and do any style or concept. The platform allows you to apply the style of any one image or prompt to every frame of your video. This is a very important feature in terms of maintaining your visual style consistency across all your video production. Based on mockups, Runway ML can turn out fully stylized and animated renders. This is especially helpful to designers and creators in creating a vibrant, engaging way to present their ideas. It’s easy to cut out subjects in your video and change them as you like with simple text commands. This lets you easily make specific modifications to individual elements in your video. By inputting an image or prompt, Runway ML can increase the realness of untextured renders. This is useful in creating realistic-looking images. Cons You might require a lot of computing resources and time. More complex tasks or high resolutions result in higher resource costs, and this may restrict its availability to users with less powerful hardware. At times, the input prompt is vague or contradictory, whereas Runway ML may produce artifacts or inconsistencies in the generated content. It may still need further smoothing out and cutting. Pricing Basic: Free Standard: $15 per user per month Pro: $35 per user per month Unlimited: $95 per user per month Enterprise: Custom 4. Fliki Fliki is another great free AI text-to-video generator that also has paid versions, letting you create videos as easily as sitting down and writing a few sentences.

It is just the right tool for creators and marketers to keep up with trends towards video over text and attract their audience’s attention. Best For: Fliki AI has become especially popular with bloggers, podcasters, YouTubers, and marketing experts, who use it to create interesting promotional materials. Top Features: 1. Access to Millions of Stock Media Fliki offers millions of photos, videos, and audio to improve your videos with top-notch images and audio. It's great for tasks like making professional presentations or doing personal creative work, as it has many styles and themes. 2.

This gives your videos a real feel to them, increasing the satisfaction of their viewers. It is also replete with a vast stock library for your creativity, which is one of the tool's real treasures. You'll find a diverse selection of images, video clips, and music alike. This library saves you from the trouble of searching for the right file everywhere by making it easier to track down materials from various places. Cost-wise, the tool is quite economical. You can even get better results with it than hiring professionals to do voice-over work. This reasonably priced special feature makes it ideal for any creators with limited amounts of money but ample amounts of content. Cons It does not offer great variety in pictorial variations. Though many options are there, these still might need to fit exactly your creative vision. You might experience glitches and bugs. These technical fumblings can be a bit of a roadblock to your work but are often just remediable with updates or support services. It provides a limited number of minutes per month at no charge. But that's a limit if you are doing really large projects or creating lots of output. Perhaps you would have to limit yourself and decide when to use it or spend extra for a paid plan. Convert text to video with AI Generate a video with just text Try Text to Video Pricing Free Plan Standard Plan: $21 per month for annual plan Premium Plan: $66 per month for annual plan 5. Visla Looking for the best AI video generator from text? Visla can be your right choice for a storytelling tool powered by AI that makes the entire process simpler. It has been fashioned as an easily accessible and powerful platform for a wide variety of users engaged in marketing, education, and other activities.

This lets you use storytelling and communication techniques with greater precision and effectiveness! Best For: Visla is the perfect option for developing and producing videos for marketing and sales, engineering, content creation, social media, team communications, customer service, and even personal branding. This is precisely what makes it so useful for professionals and teams to develop their own strategies for using storytelling to interact with audiences. Top Features: 1. Collaboration and Feedback Visla makes it simple to share your videos with your team or readers. In other words, you can use videos with other people, and you can receive others’ feedback. 2. Versatility for Various Industries Whether you work in marketing, sales, teaching, entertainment, or some other field, it's made to fit in wherever people work. 3. Diverse Use Cases Visla is just good for a variety of these video activities. You can create videos for social media, record personal messages to customers, recap meetings, convert old videos into new uses, or shoot videos for teaching and learning. It's like having one tool to deal with just about any job! 4. AI Summary Visla provides a feature that allows the main points of a text to be immediately grasped. Using AI, it discovers the key points, such as the keywords or main topics, or otherwise makes a long transcript short. 5. Teleprompter Mode Afraid you might have forgotten something or won't do a good job of expressing what is on your mind? This is where the teleprompter mode helps by letting you read from your marks instead of into the lens. This makes you look more confident and you don't lose your audience as you can make eye contact. 6. Community Hub Within the community hub, you can participate in discussions, seek advice, exchange experiences, and even receive ideas from other users. It's a place where you can get to know people using Visla too, help, and learn from one another. Pros Visla gives users the ability to create high-quality videos, working from the most minimal of ideas, perhaps even just a script. The platform can also be used to cover such tasks as writing scripts, narrating in its own voice, choosing the right pieces of video to show, and so on. Its AI-assisted editing functionality can even remove unwanted portions of video with an automatic effect. It has a comprehensible, easy interface, despite its many functions, which means that it can be used by people at every skill level. It allows a first-time user to become proficient with it only really requiring a timer, so that after only 2-3 minutes one can become accustomed. Visla's free subscription plan is particularly generous, as it allows publishers up to 50 minutes of video free of charge every month. This time is longer than most. Of course, there is also a great deal of access to the free version, which offers many of the platform’s main functions. It also comes with all the tools to aid in video production. With narration-assistance features powered by AI, screen recording functions for demonstration videos, text overlays for social media interviews, and so much more. Cons The inability to generate images is one major shortcoming of Visla compared to tools using coherent AI. To make up for this shortcoming, users who want to add this functionality have to feed suitable images to an external AI image generator before importing them into Visla. Exporting videos before downloading them can be very time-consuming. Likewise, the download speeds are quite slow. Even when Visla generates videos itself, it doesn't happen instantaneously, and it can still take a couple of minutes. The computer-generated script might contain mistakes that must be checked and corrected by a human. In addition, since the AI voiceover sometimes pronounces words incorrectly, this might affect the quality of the narrative. Pricing Basic: Free Plan Premium: $24 per month 6. Opus Clip Opus Clip converts full-length videos into short viral videos, and it shines through its comprehensive video content analysis capability. It also determines which parts are most effective and assembles them in easily digestible short clippings. It also employs cutting-edge artificial intelligence-enhanced functions such as AI Curation, AI Virality Score, and AI Emoji Generator to boost the attractiveness and virality of the content. All in all, it provides a great balance between accessibility and advanced, AI-assisted functionality, for newbies and experienced users too! Best For: Converting long-form video content into short clips that can go viral. It uses AI to help you create fun short videos with little effort. Top Features: 1. AI Curation This feature uses GPT-4 Turbo, the most advanced artificial intelligence, to take a long video and pick out the most intriguing segments. The selected parts are then crafted together into an attention-grabbing and compact short clip. Not only can it intelligently choose the segments, but it can also put this into a narrative framework, presenting the video in an organized, entertaining manner. 2. AI Virality Score Using AI and big data analysis of thousands of viral videos, Opus Clip attaches a score for its virality to each clip. With this score, you get a better idea of the potential impact of the cut, and you can use data to make decisions on the best way to maximize reach and engagement. 3. AI Co-Pilot With this feature, you have greater control over the video editing process. You can specify the time frames in your video to clip and make more focused and accurate content. 4. Active Speaker Detection Using predictive AI, Opus Clip analyzes and follows moving faces in the video. This enables you to keep your guests' (or, if you decide to take your own) face in the middle of the video frame. It makes your content more concentrated and professional-looking. 5. AI Keyword Highlighter With this tool, your video captions' important keywords are automatically selected and highlighted which can help to attain higher viewer engagement rates. 6. AI Emoji Generator The power of emojis is not lost on Opus Clip, which automatically adds suitable emojis to your video content. Pros It makes the video production process much faster. In other words, if a video project normally takes an hour, with Opus Clip it could be done in a few minutes. Part of the timesaving potential is especially useful for those who have to produce large amounts of video regularly. With the free trial, you can test the tool without risking any money. You can upload up to 120 minutes of video for free to test its features and determine whether or not it is right for you. This multi-language support makes the tool easier to use in different regions and audiences. This is particularly helpful for creators of content and content generators for whom English is their main language and they’re targeting an international audience or simply working in a multilingual environment. Its useful first paragraph-generating capabilities alone make it a game-changer when it comes to attracting viewers from the start. Cons Opus Clip may be a powerful software, but you would have to invest significant time and effort far beyond just learning how to use the product before you can master its full range of features. This learning curve could be an obstacle for those who need to quickly produce results without going into too much technical detail. Its effectiveness depends on the quality of the input video. If the original content was lousily shot or edited, it might not be able to finely tune it. While customization options are there, they may not meet all requirements or individual preferences of users. For some, this is a drawback, especially if highly personal or unique video styles are needed. The default caption may not be to everyone's tastes and could undermine creative expression. Pricing Free plan Starter Plan: $9 per month Pro: $ 19 per month 7. Colossyan Looking for the best AI music video generator? Colossyan can be just the right choice!

With a range of pricing plans available to suit various needs and budgets, Colossyan provides an economical solution for many users. Cons The actors are advanced AI-generated avatars, looking and sounding highly lifelike, but the platform is limited to these digital actors. This limitation does not allow users to directly incorporate live human actors or their own recordings into the platform.

Pros You get a variety of video templates from which you can choose an existing template that suits your needs or style, or use one of the many blank formats available to build it on your own. There are AI wizards on the platform to help you make a full video from a prompt you give them. In this way, with very little input, you can have a completed video that demonstrates what the AI can do. You're likely to find the platform convenient and fast. If you don't like to learn too much or spend too much time waiting for your videos to process, this might be just the ticket. You can spice up your performance with the built-in voice modulations. This lets you experiment with different voices depending on what you're shooting. Cons If you choose the personal plan, the maximum video quality is limited to 720p. This may be a drawback if you are after a high-definition video. The platform's content moderation system is probably not 100% foolproof, so there is a possibility of inappropriate content slipping through the net. On Windows and Android, you may encounter problems when it comes to feature recognition. If you're using these platforms and want complete compatibility, then this could be a potential drawback.

Overall, even if you didn’t use any of the AI video features in Premiere Pro, you’d still be left with the top editing software of the year – start by downloading a free trial and see what you think. How to Download Adobe Premiere Pro 2. Topaz Video AI | Photography AI Tool for Enlargements Pros Extremely powerful video editing tool Free trial available Upscaling, image stabilization, and slow-motion capabilities Can generate multiple previews at the same time Cons Relatively expensive download Simply put, Topaz Video AI is a standalone desktop video editing application that makes your videos look better. Drag and drop your video into the software, select from the menu of presets, and let the deep-learning robot minds cast their magic. You can even upscale your footage. That means that all your grainy, blurry old 1080p film can now be enhanced to 4K or 8K. You can also render your footage in slow motion which can be handy if you forgot to shoot in the correct frame rate: Let’s say you shot at 24 fps – give Topaz that video and the AI will create new frames between the actual frames you shot, so your 24 fps could become 60 fps, and you can slow it right down. The program also has two types of image stabilization to help you produce engaging videos: The first crops into your footage to create this effect, and the other is image-aware and will fill in the missing gaps around the edges of your video so that the field of view doesn’t change. With this powerful AI video editing software, you can tweak just about any setting you’d want to use to enhance the quality of your footage – the frame rate, the amount of grain, or the sharpness. Not only that, you can create your own custom presets for adding to future videos. Topaz Video AI Review 3. Filmora | Affordable AI Video Maker Pros Simple, easy-to-use interface Good suite of AI tools Subscription or perpetual license options Affordable Cons Doesn’t have the slick feel of some competitors download As well as giving you all the tools you’d expect from a video editing suite, for adding templates, titles and subtitles, and for making adjustments to the video and audio tracks, Filmora also has some fantastic AI tools. You can adjust your footage’s aspect ratio, upscale video resolution from lowly 1080p to, for example, 4K, and change your frame rate to make fast video slow and slow video fast. Other AI tools include their chroma key, which enables you to remove specific background colours. This is especially useful for green screen footage, to make the background transparent so that you can add other media. AI portrait does essentially the same thing and removes even complex backgrounds from behind subjects. Added to that, Filmora has AI image stabilization, and lens correction to help you sort out any irritating distortion your lens might have gifted you. In general, Filmora is my recommended video editing software for beginners – it may not have every feature of Final Cut or Adobe Premiere for video creation, but for the price, it can’t be beaten. Filmora Review Best green screen software 4. Deep Brain | Text to Speech AI Video Tools Pros Innovative AI human technology Multi-language text-to-speech solutions Wide application across sectors Free online AI video editor Highly customizable avatars Cons Learning curve download DeepBrain AI stands out in the field of artificial intelligence with its cutting-edge AI human technology.

Veed.io Pros Good for beginners Easy to learn Range of templates and tools Speech to subtitles feature Cons Some features are only available in higher price plans download One of the best AI video editing options for beginners is Veed.io. It has an extremely simple and easy-to-learn interface, but despite this, it still packs a punch. Veed.io has many of the features of the previous two video editing software programs in this article. With it, you can change the frame rate to speed up or slow down your footage, and you can also remove backgrounds with a single click. Something it’s well-known for is its AI-powered speech to subtitles tool, which accurately transcribes in moments, saving you potential hours of work. And there’s also the text-to-speech feature. With this, you can give your video a voiceover without manually recording your own voice, and you can choose from a range of voice profiles and accents. I’ve included Veed in this list of the best AI video software because I’ve spent many a day transcribing videos manually, and know how frustrating it can be. What is an AI camera? 7. Synthesia Pros Easy way to make presentations Powerful, simple-to-use tool Impressive range of features Affordable AI video creation platform Cons Limited, specialized use case download Synthesia specializes in speech-to-video creation using artificial intelligence to create engaging videos. They give you a range of templates and amazingly lifelike avatars which you can make say anything you want – ideal for creating YouTube videos you don’t want to appear in. Whatever you type, they can say in a range of accents, using diction and, in the most recent iteration, gestures. It’s spooky how realistic it all sounds – even if you don’t have any staff or any desire to appear in YouTube videos yourself, Synthesia can help with your video creation. You can add a background behind your avatar, add a music track, and use a range of other tools to make the video your own. How can AI benefit photography? 8. InVideo Pros Easy to use and learn Simple but powerful Simple, two-tier pricing Article-to-text feature Cons Only the highest membership tiers have access to the best video and image libraries download This software shares a lot in look and feel with Veed.io. It has a super-simple, clean interface that is very easy to navigate. It also has a vast bank of templates for a range of needs from sports to marketing, to help you kick things off. One of its most impressive features is the AI-powered article-to-text tool. With this, you can copy and paste an article into the tool, and it will scrape the text to extract the main ideas, and then create concise content around these. It can create a unique video from an article too. Let’s say I wanted to make a video from this article – I could just paste the URL into InVid, and the video would be created for me! This makes it the best AI video tool for batch creating multiple clips from a blog. Like Veed.io, InVideo also offers automated text-to-speech. No more need to record voiceovers, all thanks to the power of video artificial intelligence. What’s the best mobile video editing app for iPhone and Android? 9. Descript Pros Unique product Powerful editing tools Edit video with text Slick interface Cons It’s not for everyone, but that’s just me trying to find something to say download One for the podcasters. A powerful speech-to-text editor that will save you time by allowing you to edit automatically transcribed text and video voiceover at the same time. Simply put, you can record yourself, your voice and your face, and Descript uses AI to make a video and a written script from this. You can then edit that script, for example shortening long pauses in your speech, removing filler and thinking words, or removing whole phrases. Whatever you remove is also removed from the recorded footage, thereby seamlessly editing your video with AI. The software also allows you to sync your visuals with specific moments in the script, and there’s a toolbar to help you collaborate on a project with a team. Add to that powerful video editing features such as the ability to grade colours, remove backgrounds, and beef up sound quality, and you have yourself a winner. 10. FlexClip Pros Interface good for beginners Great template and stock library AI speech to text AI text to speech Cons Limited tools for pros Only exports to 1080p download This software is rich in templates and has an impressive amount of stock imagery and video you can use to inspire or pad out your videos. The interface is very simple – it’s the best AI video editing software I tested for beginners, who will get the hang of it very easily. Once you have your footage uploaded, you have the standard range of editing tools to work with, to make your video look exactly as you want it to. You can adjust the brightness, and the speed, you can flip it around, trim it, or use FlexClip’s range of filters to automatically adjust the colours. In terms of AI video creation features, there’s speech-to-text, which can quickly generate subtitles, and text-to-speech, which can help you make natural-sounding voiceovers. 11. Rawshorts Pros Good library of resources Timesaver for small businesses Text to animation Automatic voice generator Cons Free version is quite limited download This powerful tool is specifically for people who want to make video animations. Write a script (or get ChatGPT to do that for you!) and paste it into the program. The software will then generate a voiceover, scrape your text for the main ideas, and then use those to make a coherent, animated storyboard. You’ve probably seen these types of animations used on software product sales pages to explain how to use the software. This type of animation can cost thousands of dollars to produce (not to mention countless hours of drawing), but now thanks to AI, you can do it for a fraction of the time and cost. If you need to create videos for small businesses, you can imagine how much easier this clever AI video tool can make your work. 12. Lumen 5 Pros Quick and easy tool to use Text to video Good range of editing tools Cons Free version is very limited download This nifty AI video editing softwa re software helps you automatically transform blog posts, Zoom calls, or articles, into video. It’s super easy to do. For example, just paste your blog article URL into the program, and it will extract the key points to match them with relevant text and video. From there, you can tweak what you want, edit text, and swap out photos and videos from Lumen 5’s online library. You can also make talking head videos and enhance your videos with callouts and cutaways. My favourite feature is the ability to select words in the transcript (auto-generated by AI, of course!), then match the visuals directly to the timing of the audio. For video creation for social media, which often needs captions timed to voice over or talking heads, this AI video app is insanely useful. 13. SyntheSys Pros Professional-level software Text-to-video capabilities Easy-to-use dashboard Cons More expensive than other text-to-video competitors download Using SyntheSys, you can get a lifelike avatar to present a video for you, generated from text, or create a natural-sounding voiceover track. They have a library of male and female avatars, and their technology allows them to use gestures, and natural voice tones, and speak in 145 languages. It’s a great tool for businesses, or anyone wanting to quickly create human-looking and -sounding content for commercial purposes. Whether you want to remain anonymous in your video clips or simply prefer to use someone else, AI video generators like this can help speed up your video creation process. What Is the Best AI Tool to Create Videos? It really depends on what kind of video you want to create, as there is quite a diverse range of AI video generators out there for different use cases. A cinematographer or videographer is more likely to need a tool with the power and scope of Topaz Video AI or Filmora. These can really help you dive deep into your footage and create something extraordinary for professional videos. Veed.io and InVid are best for beginners or those who perhaps need video clips for personal use or smaller scale production edits. Then there are the tools that are better for small businesses, YouTubers, or for commercial use. Descript is a great tool for Youtubers and podcasters to clean up their script and video, whereas Rawshorts will help you create an animation from your script. Those looking for AI to make them a voiceover or a complete presentation with a video or even an avatar will need something different again. Lumen 5, for example, will help you create high quality videos like these, while Synthesia or SyntheSys will generate a presentation for you with a human-ish presenter. How Does an AI Video Generator Work? The computer science behind the nuts and bolts of AI video generation is beyond both my human intelligence and the scope of this article. But in simple terms, what I understand of it is that machine-learning, the machine who has learned – which is a way of saying ‘an extremely powerful computer’ – knowing language on some robotic, mathematical level, scrapes the text and converts it into computer language: numbers. As computers understand everything in these terms, the combinations of numbers it receives from the text will correspond to number patterns within videos that express the same ideas as the text. They will match. And thus, a video is born. AI Video Editing Software FAQ s What is the best AI tool to create videos? For creating videos and ease of use, I’d have to say Lumen 5 for enabling you to quickly make a coherent video from text, or SyntheSys for creating realistic avatar-led video presentations. For specific edits, Topaz Video AI can’t be beaten. Is there an AI that edits videos? Yes. For example, Topaz AI and Filmora both help you edit your videos. You can use image stabilization, change the frame rate to create natural-looking slow-motion effects, upscale your videos, and do many more things that only a year or so ago, weren’t possible. How do I know if a video was created by AI? With many ai video editing tools, you simply won’t know, and that’s increasingly the case. The AI tools in Topaz Video AI are so powerful there’s really no way of telling if that slow-motion video was originally filmed at 60 fps or 24 fps. Likewise, the human avatar you can use to give your video presentations can use natural gestures, voice tones and intonation, which can make it very difficult to know if they’re real or not. Take for example, the Deep Fake video below: It’s certainly very hard to spot if the video creation was by AI or if it was actual footage. What AI video app is everyone using? Everyone is using all of them! All of the video apps in this article are being used by someone, somewhere to save time, to be more efficient, and to create something more compelling for a variety of use cases. If I had to choose one, I’d say it was Topaz Video AI, just because that’s the world I come from, and I know that it’s a very popular resource. For another use case, I’d find it hard to believe that most podcasters weren’t using Descript, as it’s such a powerful and powerfully specialised tool. Is Synthesia Ai video free to use? No, it’s not. Synthesia is only offered on a subscription basis. AI Video Editing Tools: Final Words So there you go. Honestly, even though I wrote this article myself, my mind is a little blown. AI is so new, but it can already do so much. It’s hard to know where it’s going to lead, but although that’s a little terrifying, it’s also exciting. Especially if you’re working with video. The AI video generators and tools available to you are so powerful that they will change the way you film and the way you think about filming. Cinematographers can make 8K cinematic, slow-motion, fully stabilized footage from 1080p footage filmed on an old camera. YouTubers can make video content of themselves with all their thinking words removed. Businesses can make promo videos, voiceovers or video presentations without hiring voiceover artists. It’s head-spinning! Doesn’t it make you want to create AI generated videos just to see how incredible the technology has become? If you’re not already using AI video generators in some form, it definitelt feels like right now is the time to start.

Contentfries Contentfries is a powerful AI-driven tool for repurposing video content. It's a great option for publishers, media companies, and digital marketing teams who need to regularly create engaging social media content. Contentfries offers a significant advantage: turning one long-form video, like a webinar, podcast, or interview, into many short clips optimized for different platforms.

Consider starting with a tool’s free tier to test capabilities before committing to a paid plan. Can AI video tools replace human video editors? AI tools are best viewed as powerful assistants rather than replacements.

Take advantage of built-in features like AI-powered enhancement and professional voice-overs to elevate production quality. What about copyright and ownership of AI-generated videos?

Jump to: Best overall Best free Best on a budget Best for business Honorable mention FAQs Quick menu 1. Best overall 2. Best free 3. Best on a budget 4. Best for business 5. Honorable mention FAQs The best AI video editors provide a new form of functionality that could not have been imagined a few years ago. To edit footage in the old days meant cutting, splicing, and generally messing around far too much. Now the editing process is so much more automated. Not only tweaking existing material, but adding entirely new content on demand. We’ve tested the best video editing software and the best AI tools, and now we’re bringing those together to compare and review video editors powered by AI - with video samples for you to check out. AI video editing offers businesses huge benefits. Sales and marketing teams can quickly communicate new ideas, pitches, and even create digital avatars, without the need for additional tools and personnel. In the past that would mean employing a large array of services, audio and video editors, copywriters, design specialists and more. Now, a simple prompt and some well placed templates can create a serviceable sales video in less time than you can say ‘just do it’. But with an explosion in artificial intelligence, which AI video editor is best for you? We put the top tools to the test, from prompt accuracy and the editing experience to export speeds and video quality. For more AI content creation apps, we compared best AI image generators and best AI art generators. Best AI video editor overall EE Car Show - Flika - YouTube Watch On 1. Fliki Fast and easy with superb features Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Superbly easy to use + High quality results + Flexible fully AI generated options Reasons to avoid - Avatars not available on lowest paid plan - Only limited quality voices on offer For us, Fliki is the best AI video editor you can get right now. It offers by far the fastest and easiest to use video generation and editing service on the market. The user interface is a joy to operate compared to its rivals, and the speed of generation and download is truly astonishing. The only compromise is the lack of access to avatar functionality on the base paid plan. There are six main options on the start menu. Idea to video, as well as blog, PPT, Tweet, Avatar and Product to video. There are also useful features like translation, voice over and voice cloning available, but for most users the first stop is likely to be the AI auto-generated Idea to Video or the URL to Video. I did a number of tests, but started with the URL to Video feature. Having named the project, selected the category, language and aspect ratio, I entered the URL of my blog post. With Idea to Video, the URL box is replaced with a text prompt (e.g. ‘create a video about cat health’). The service then parsed the webpage I gave, and asked me to choose whether I wanted the AI to use stock media or generate digital AI art media. I chose stock, because the AI art seemed a little cheesy for my needs, and I had lots of stored photos to use. I then chose a template, but because I was only on the Standard $28 a month plan there was no option for an avatar. You need to spend $88 a month on the Premium plan for an avatar or voice cloning. Which is a shame. There’s a final Submit button step, and a wait while the AI does its magic. In a matter of seconds, rarely more than 90, up pops the outline for the content. At that point most of the heavy lifting has been done. The script is auto-generated, the media has been selected and linked, and all that’s needed is to polish the script, adjust things like subtitles, audio, font design and background music if wanted. It’s super easy to do all this, which makes editing and polishing no chore at all. Once you’re happy with the final edits, it’s time to download the finished video file in resolutions up to 1080p. Again the processing and download is impressively fast, no more than a minute or so. Best free AI video editor Latest in Digital Security - Synthesia - YouTube Watch On 2. Synthesia Free AI video editing tool with digital avatars on tap Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Excellent AI lip synched voices + Premium voice-over options Reasons to avoid - Overly cumbersome interface - Sloppy AI video asset selection On its free plan, Synthesia provides 36 minutes of video production per year, using any of 6 AI avatars. 60 templates and 120 languages/voices. But to take advantage of the essential AI Assistant, which will help you create videos quickly and easily, you’ll need to upgrade to the Starter Plan. That also gives 10 minutes of video each month, as well as Getty images access. Still, it’s at least good enough to get an idea of what the best AI video editors can do. To start, select from three options, New Video, AI Video Assistant or Import PowerPoint. Unless you’re a complete masochist, most people will choose the AI assistant since it takes all the drudge out of the creation process. Once selected, you move through template choices which are mostly pretty generic corporate styles, and either upload your choice of PDF, Word or text file or paste in a URL to create a video directly from the webpage. The system will then generate the script and slides for the video, along with your choice of tone, audience, language and avatar. Once the initial format is delivered, you’ll need to spend time fixing errors and tweaking the content, and there will be a lot of fixing needed. For some reason the AI seems more artificial than intelligent. In one test I prompted for a video guide to baking a black forest gateau, and while the introduction worked well, the recipe was almost non-existent and none of the recommended images or clips were even close. The whole point of an AI assistant should be to save time and effort, so I was a bit bemused. My second attempt at a video went slightly better. I asked for a webpage conversion, which turned out to be reasonable. While I still had to change almost every background element, the premium voices and avatar were excellent. The lip-synch function is among the best in the business, which really makes the video pop. Such a shame that the rest of the experience is somewhat lackadaisical. Once you’ve finished editing, pressing the Generate button will create the end result. It’s not fast, our short 90 sec video took around 30 minutes to render, which is not ideal for iteration and testing. The whole process from start to finish took around two hours. The company is promising a version 2.0 in a few weeks, so we’ll circle back and see if the experience has improved. Until then we’ve got to deduct points for a definitely sub-standard AI implementation. Best budget AI video editor Marketing EVs - HeyGen - YouTube Watch On 3. HeyGen Powerful video tools and avatars Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Free plan available + Good value subscriptions + Excellent avatar choices and customization + Great for social media shorts Reasons to avoid - AI Studio video creation could be easier - Only 1 minute of video on free plan HeyGen offers some valuable tools for manipulating source video to take all the drudgery out of producing different content types. This is very useful for social media applications, or other places where you might need short snappy video content. The main function though is the AI Studio which lets you create a video from a prompt or from an imported document. The actual video production is good, but not as simple as it could be. The platform uses ChatGPT to help create a script from a text prompt, and it works really well. Unfortunately the script is not automatically added to the slide content sections, so you have to go through and manually paste the results in yourself. It’s a shame because it spoils what is otherwise a nice creative flow. However I found that once you got the hang of the timing of the script, it was fairly straightforward to edit the whole thing and make it sync up properly. But really this should be the job of an AI process. Maybe the next version. There are three main plans. The Free version offers 1 minute of video a month, as opposed to 15 minutes with the $29 a month Creator Plan. The Creator level also provides 1080p video, as well as faster video generation, no watermark and voice cloning. Users can also create three personal video avatars, which is a nice touch. But for some strange reason you can’t upload documents on this paid plan, only on the $149 a month Team plan. Where HeyGen really shines is in the results. Even the default avatars and voices on the lowest Plan offer great results. They’re animated and the voices are varied and decent. The movements also deliver the kind of feel you need to increase engagement. When you add in the ability to easily create your own personal photo or moving avatars, the whole paid package starts to shine with potential. One great new option is the new URL to Video feature. Drop your product page URL into the box and within a few minutes you receive a great looking 38 sec promo video short which you can use on TikTok, or other social platforms. You get to set your preferred audience tags and the language, and the AI lets you select from a set of scripts covering audience needs. It’s super clever, and you even get multiple avatars and environments to choose from. A big win in my book. Overall HeyGen offers a great selection of tools for video and avatar creation. It’s a shame that the AI is not used as well on general videos as it is on the shorts ad feature, but hopefully that will change. Best AI video editor for business Microsoft Report Story - Pictory - YouTube Watch On 4. Pictory A flexible, competent, professional AI video editor Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Clear easy to use interface + Solid range of functions and assets Reasons to avoid - Video editing can be a little clunky, if not buggy Pictory was one of the first AI powered applications on the market, offering a range of plans starting at $25 a month. Like a number of other AI video generator services, Pictory uses material from the Storyblocks and Getty stock assets library for its AI function. In that regard it’s really more like stitching together material than generating it. The Starter Plan gives access to the Storyblocks stock library, 34 digital voices and up to 10 minutes of text to video a month. There’s also access to 5000 audio tracks, transcription services and a branding kit. There are four basic functions on offer. Script to video, article to video, editing video using text and visuals to video (mainly used to make presentations). These base tools can be used to mix and match any sort of content you need, from social media to product promo clips or audio voice overs. There’s no AI generated material on offer, the AI is instead used to stitch together various stock clips and captions to create the finished result. The first thing you notice is the simple dashboard once you sign in. I tested by using one of my older TechRadar articles to create a video, by simply importing the URL. The process was super easy. The AI scanned the web page, worked out what the piece was about, and converted my text into a script for the video. The first thing to note is the resulting script, although good, still needed quite a bit of work to make it properly reflect the original. The AI is not yet clever enough to fully differentiate between generic web page text and the story itself, so there’s around 20 to 30% work needed to clean everything up. The same goes for the images and video clips the application chooses. Some of them were spot on, but around half needed changing. Thankfully the process of swapping out assets is really easy, click and the job’s done. It still takes time though. If you pay for the more expensive Professional Plan at $49 a month, you’re given a choice of 48 super realistic voices from ElevenLabs, otherwise you’ll only be able to use some basic generic voice-overs. You also only have access to the Getty images in the Pro plan, but that’s probably not so bad. Since you can upload your own material to add to the AI curated content. You can even record your own voice over on the basic plan, but there’s no auto sync, so you have to do it scene by scene which is again not a trivial task. I found that creating a simple two minute video from my post took around 90 minutes from start, which is a lot faster than it would be if I had to do everything manually, and record or upload a narration. So it’s definitely a big time saver. It’s always going to look like a stock video because of the lack of any decent editing features like transitions, but for someone who just needs something for their Facebook feed, it’s perfectly good enough. Best AI video editor: Honorable mention MotoCompacto - DeepBrain AI Studios - YouTube Watch On 5. DeepBrain AI Solid AI video editor workhorse Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Free video creation + Wide range of AI video features at a price + Innovative avatar functionality Reasons to avoid - Glacial generation speeds on base paid plan - Strangely complex user interface DeepBrain AI Studios is proof that 18 months is a lifetime in the world of AI. The platform offers a wealth of very solid features, including social media video editing, URL to video and a variety of avatars. But in practice it all seems to be just a little bit old-fashioned. If you want to get a feel for AI video generation and editing for free - it's a fair place to start, but you're unlikely to want to stay with this tool for any length of time. I went through a number of tests, testing avatars, checking out how well the AI functioned, and seeing if the ease of use matched rivals in the market. My main test was again URL to video, as this is a good way to see if the AI models in use are up to the task of recreating web content. The best tools grab all the elements on a webpage, including images and text, the worst don’t. In the case of AI Studios, I found that it did everything it should do, to a degree. My suspicion is that the AI powering the system is perhaps a generation back from the current levels of AI sophistication. The two main tests worked well to generate a script, although neither managed to grab and import the images on the blog post, which is a pretty fundamental requirement. The other quirk is the strangely tiny Options drop-down when starting the project. Blink and you miss it, but in fact accessing it has a huge impact on the type and quality of the generated video. It’s a very strange UI choice. Apart from that, the results are workmanlike. As I said, if this was 2023 it would be amazing. But times have moved on, and any service that offers this average level of avatar voicing and slow generation times is definitely lagging the market. There are some nice additional features you can’t find anywhere else, like avatar gestures (triggering hand movements during the video), and team avatars engaged in conversations, but they’re all locked behind the $89 a month Team plan, which puts them out of reach of most individuals. It’s a pity that the company has decided to focus the platform so heavily on the corporate buying budget, by locking most of the better features behind the top tier plans, but that’s their decision to make. However, if you’re looking to create enterprise training and marketing videos on a regular basis, then the AI Studios product is definitely worth a look. Best AI video editor: FAQs What is an AI video editor? These are software platforms that let you create, edit and manage video production using AI technology. They often operate like the best video makers we've tested - lightweight, online-based tools capable of generating content without the need for the best video editing PCs or best laptops for video editing. It’s worth noting that AI Video Editing is slightly different from AI Video Generation. The former acts mainly as a curator of different stock and AI media types, while the latter is primarily designed to produce artificial video content using a neural network setup. What is an avatar? An avatar is a digital on-screen depiction of a spokesperson, which is coded so it can accept any text and convert it into a) a suitable voice and language and b) deliver the audio in a human-like manner with the appropriate lip movements and hand/arm gestures. The best versions deliver a very human performance. What are the key features to look for in the best AI video editors? There are three main requirements. First, the best AI video editor should use a competent AI engine to drive the whole process. It should be able to generate an accurate script, scan and grab the right assets to go with the script and put everything together in an elegant package ready for publishing. Second, the platform should be extremely easy to use. If the inevitable editing function is complex or buggy, it becomes a chore. Finally, it should be fast. The finished product should arrive as quickly as possible. Just starting out? We tested, reviewed, and rated the best video editing software for beginners. ^ Back to top Are you a pro?

Here's an example video I made for a product launch: PlayProduct Introduction (Free AI Video Template) Synthesia can be used to create a variety of video types, with the most common use cases being learning and development videos, including training videos and other eLearning video production. It also excels at producing onboarding videos and video content for internal communications, as well as marketing and outreach videos. Synthesia is a top-ranked AI software, with 1150+ reviews on G2 and has a rating of 4.7 out of 5. The platform is being used by 50,000 companies of all sizes, with many big names among them, such as Reuters, Zoom, and Amazon. Synthesia is a browser-based platform and I found it easy to set up my first video. I simply typed in my script, selected an avatar from their library, customized my video with the AI video editor, and then Synthesia generated a polished video featuring one of its realistic AI avatars. With over 230 avatars to choose from, I easily found options that fit different tones and purposes. You can also make a custom avatar that looks like you. Synthesia supports over 140 languages, and I was able to create localized versions of my video with ease. The platform even has a multilingual video player that automatically translates videos to viewers’ preferred languages, making it useful for global audiences. I tried adding multiple avatars on screen to simulate conversations, which worked smoothly and could be helpful for training scenarios or role-playing videos. The platform has over 60 professionally designed video templates that make it easy to produce polished content quickly. Features like live collaboration tools allow teams to work together seamlessly, while detailed video analytics provide insights into video performance. Altogether, these capabilities make Synthesia a practical, efficient choice for professional projects.

Th‎e best AI video generators for creative video production Here's my rundown of the best text-to-video and image-to-video AI video generators for creative video production. Hailuo Hailuo Director Mode is so fun. Being able to combine camera shots is just fantastic. Here shaky camera and push in. pic.twitter.com/MfqBA22vm8 — Jerrod Lew (@jerrod_lew) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best free option for creative video production Link: ‎https://hailuoai.video/ Hailuo AI is an AI video generator that delivers high-quality 6-second video clips at 720p resolution. It offers text-to-video, image-to-video and a subject reference feature. Hailuo offers a 3-day free unlimited generation period so that you can generate a bunch of videos for free and really test the tool. Subject reference is a particularly cool feature. It lets you upload a photo of a character and then generate a scene with that character in it. I found the output to be pretty accurate, although I often needed to do some manual editing to maintain coherence. The model can also take multiple attempts to get it right, which will eat into your credits. The feature also often fails at close-ups (wide shots tend to work better but lose fine details). One of the first things that stood out to me was how well it understands prompts. Hailuo seemed to nail camera movements and scene composition accurately. The image quality is also noticeably high. However, generation times are limited to 6 seconds, which makes creating longer sequences more tedious. Al‎ibaba Qwen Another day, another release. Alibaba have quietly included video generation in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max and it's really good. Here are a few examples - check them out. pic.twitter.com/u6qptO59ai — TomLikesRobots🤖 (@TomLikesRobots) January 30, 2025 Verdict: Completely free and produces high quality videos, but often with unreliable generation Link: ‎‎‎‎https://chat.qwenlm.ai/ Alibaba included an AI video generator in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max. It’s a text-to-video only tool, but it’s completely free and I’ve been impressed by the quality. The one catch is that the generation is kind of unreliable. I often enter my prompt and the video generates up to 99% complete and then gets stuck for quite a while. In my experience the videos do eventually finish generating but be prepared to wait a little. The output quality seems to be really good, and while the functionality is limited, it’s completely free and the videos have no watermark. Kl‎ing If you’re looking to combine character consistency with high-quality VFX, @Kling_ai is the best choice. 🎥✨ Version 1.5 absolutely nails VFX. A true must-have! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/rO1WvmLj3k — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) January 12, 2025 Verdict: High quality output, but very long free plan generation wait times Link: ‎https://www.klingai.com/ Kling offers text-to-video and image-to-video features, along with free video generation credits for users who log in each month. Kling brings an impressive level of fluidity and realism to movement in videos. I found the adjustable creativity and relevance slider particularly useful for fine-tuning outputs. Its biggest strength lies in image-to-video generation (and in particular its elements feature), which is far superior to tools like Runway. The motion is smoother, and the AI follows prompts accurately. When I asked for a character to blink or walk forward while the camera zoomed in, Kling delivered exactly what I asked for. If you need storytelling or consistency between frames, Kling is a great option. Kling 1.5 also supports HD, which is a nice bonus. Kling has some drawbacks, the biggest being generation speed. On the free version, I sometimes had to wait an hour or more for a single clip, and I’ve heard of free users waiting a full day for results. This is a major issue if you need quick iterations. On a paid plan the generations are quicker, but I also noticed that Kling sometimes gets stuck at 99% completion and wastes credits. At the end of the day, if you prioritize quality, accuracy, and motion control, Kling is a great choice. The motion brush tool adds extra control, and the first-attempt success rate is high, meaning I spent less time fighting the AI to get what I wanted. Ru‎nway When setting up a shot in Runway, think carefully about where to put the camera. Consider what the camera placement tells the audience about the story, about the character, and about the moment. Every angle is a decision that affects how the audience will experience it. pic.twitter.com/XnijHcb0Jv — Cristóbal Valenzuela (@c_valenzuelab) November 11, 2024 Verdict: The Gen-3 model gives you great results and some amazing advanced features that come with a bit of a learning curve Link: ‎https://runwayml.com/ Runway’s latest Gen-3 model offers a comprehensive suite of creative tools, such as text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video, alongside advanced features like motion brush, keyframes, camera controls and inpainting. On the free basic plan, you can create short text-to-video clips (up to 10 seconds long or 16 seconds using the \"extend video\" feature in the older Gen-2 model) but can’t upscale resolution or remove watermarks. You also can’t generate videos directly from text using their Gen-3 Alpha model on the free plan (only images to video). However, you can still make great videos with just the image-video feature. Here's an example workflow to show you how I use Runway’s free plan to create AI-generated short story videos: Midjourney to generate images Runway for image-to-video Suno to generate music Elevenlabs for some effects Topaz for video upscaling Capcut for editing I found Runway’s advanced features to be pretty amazing. Camera control lets you adjust angles, focus, and movement to achieve a polished, professional look. The Motion brush tool allows you to add motion and direction to specific parts of a video, which is great for creating visually dynamic social media content. Keyframes allow you to configure the starting, middle, and ending frames to create smooth transitions between them. Inpainting lets you automatically remove unwanted objects throughout your clip. This tool handled complex scenes surprisingly well; I could remove background elements without affecting the continuity of the video, something that would usually require a lot of time and expertise. However, I found that these advanced features come with a learning curve, so if you’re new to video editing you might need a bit of practice to fully utilize Runway’s capabilities. I found Runway’s video generation process to be fast and reliable. I think the pricing is reasonable given the platform’s capabilities, especially for creators, filmmakers, and digital artists who want more control and creative freedom. However, the costs might feel high if you’re only looking for basic AI video generation, as Runway is designed for those looking to push creative boundaries and explore the possibilities of AI in video production. Go‎ogle Veo Been generating impossibly dangerous stunts with veo 2 using text prompts. Still surprising how realistic they can look (though not perfect yet). pic.twitter.com/0gETBwGH5y — Ethan Mollick (@emollick) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best option for creative video production, but limited access for now (US only waitlist) Link: ‎https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/ I was blown away by Google Veo 2’s realistic video generation capabilities. Every clip I produced, from a misty jungle scene to a foggy wildlife sequence, was rendered in stunning detail, and the visual fidelity was top-notch. One of the aspects that stood out for me was the advanced cinematic controls. I could specify everything from lens types to shot angles and even adjust depth-of-field effects, which made it feel like I had an entire professional film crew at my fingertips. The dolly zoom and pan shot features, in particular, added that extra layer of cinematic flair that really brought my scenes to life. In my tests, Veo 2 consistently produced more “correct” results compared to other tools like OpenAI’s Sora. The physics simulation is fantastic with objects and characters that move and interact in a way that feels natural and true to real-world behavior. I found that character consistency was excellent too; no matter how complex the scene, the generated characters maintained their look and identity throughout the video. Veo 2 supports high-resolution outputs (up to 4K) and longer video durations too, which simplifies your workflow as you won’t need upscaling tools. The only reason why Veo 2 isn’t my top pick for creative video production is because it’s still not publicly available - you have to join a waitlist and it’s still US only. There’s also room for improvement still, and I sometimes saw some strange character movements in my generated videos. Op‎enAI Sora 🚨 It’s crazy! #Sora just dropped, and it’s already blowing everyone’s minds! 😱🎥 Here are 10 mind-blowing examples showcasing its insane possibilities. 🔥 The future of video is here. 🚀👇 pic.twitter.com/Mcq2OepO3R — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Fun to play around with but needs to improve Link: ‎https://sora.com/ Sora is OpenAI’s entry into text-to-video AI video generation, and after spending some time with it, I’ve found it to be a mixed bag. On the one hand, when Sora works, it can deliver stunning, lifelike visuals, especially for abstract or artistic scenes. Its storyboard functionality is one of my favorite features, as it lets you prompt multiple shots in a single generation, and the “Blend” option adds a fun layer of creativity, allowing you to combine visual elements in unexpected ways. However, in my experience the model struggles with some critical aspects. Sora consistently fails when it comes to physics, general body movements, and character consistency. For example, I tried generating scenes as simple as making cats dance, only to be met with choppy motion, glitches, and overall results that were far from convincing. In several cases, the outputs felt like a gamble: some generations might be passable, but most of the time, prompts didn’t translate well into the expected actions or camera movements. I found that free or cheaper alternatives outperform Sora in accuracy and usability. There’s a steep learning curve, and despite the potential of the video-to-video remix functionality (which I’ve used to remaster some older AI-generated clips), the overall inconsistency is hard to overlook. You can access Sora on the plus plan ($20/month) which gives you 50 videos up to 720p resolution and 5 seconds long, or the pro plan ($200/month) for 500 videos up to 1080p resolution and 20 seconds long. Pi‎ka I had early access to the Pika 2.1 Model, A new journey begins, More clips to follow! @pika_labs pic.twitter.com/rN5OfMacoo — Stevie Mac (@StevieMac03) January 23, 2025 Verdict: The free plan isn’t great, but the premium plans have very good image-to-video features Link: ‎https://pika.art/ Pika offers a free plan that gives you access to Pika 1.5, which has text-to-video and image-to-video features and 150 monthly video credits. Videos can be downloaded without a watermark on the free plan. I wasn’t super impressed with the quality of the generated videos though. However, while Pika 1.5’s video output is nothing special, Pika 2.1 (available on the paid plan) offers an image-to-video feature called scene ingredients, which I think is pretty amazing. With scene ingredients you can build a shot from the exact character, object, wardrobe, and setting you want. It works by using reference images of each element and then providing a prompt. It’s similar to Kling’s elements feature in that it allows you to ensure creative consistency between scenes, which I found made it a super useful tool to produce actually usable videos. Lu‎ma First impression Luma > Sora pic.twitter.com/R2pXVsAesw — The Retro Burn (@burntheretro) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Their new Ray 2 model is great, but it’s a premium feature and it doesn’t offer image-to-video Link: ‎https://lumalabs.ai/ Luma's Ray 2 model has great motion realism and the physics feel really natural. The frame-to-frame consistency is a clear improvement over previous versions and it does an excellent job with cinematic elements, responding impressively to lighting, contrast, film formats, and camera motion. At times, it even seemed to intelligently structure shots. By using highly detailed prompts and running multiple generations, I found that it’s possible to create some truly stunning videos, though it does require some cherry-picking to get the best results. When I tested a sports car driving through snowy mountains at dawn, the scene composition was spot on and the snow, warm light, and camera tracking all felt smooth and natural. I also experimented with close-up shots of faces, and I was surprised by how well it captured emotional expressions, particularly in an extreme sadness prompt, where the eye movements and facial subtleties felt incredibly lifelike. Where Luma stands out is its ability to generate dynamic camera movements while keeping the scene coherent. It understands cinematic depth and framing in a way that makes it ideal for dramatic shots. I found that Luma is great at handling large-scale scene changes. For example, when I asked it to generate a collapsing building Luma delivered a convincing destruction sequence. Currently, Luma’s Ray 2 is only available to paid users and is capped at 720p resolution. Videos can be up to 10 seconds long, but I noticed that after about 7 seconds, scene consistency can start breaking down, occasionally shifting in unintended ways. Ad‎obe Firefly Here's another video created by Adobe Firefly.. a 3D printer, printing a car. Very impressed by the results. https://t.co/L5d8zf3TGv pic.twitter.com/ySylkRlDMS — techAU (@techAU) February 13, 2025 Verdict: Inconsistent motion and limited free use (only 2 free generations) make it hard to recommend Link: ‎‎https://firefly.adobe.com/ Adobe Firefly offers both text to video and image to video, both capable of producing 1080p clips from simple prompts or static images. Firefly struggles with distortion. I tested it by generating a video of \"a cyclist riding through a mountain trail in autumn,\" and while the colors and scenery were nice, the motion was noticeably unnatural. The cyclist's legs appeared to glitch mid-pedal, and the overall movement felt disjointed. Image to video fared better when creating abstract or background footage, but realistic human action remained a challenge. The output currently feels more like digital experiments than polished, usable content. On the positive side, Firefly's interface is intuitive. The built-in controls for adjusting camera angles, motion paths, and shot sizes make experimenting with different styles relatively simple. After generating two free videos, I was prompted to upgrade to either Firefly Standard or Pro for additional generations. While Firefly is enjoyable to explore and has clear creative potential, I’ll stick with more reliable alternatives for projects that need high-quality, natural-looking results. The best AI video generators for social media and YouTube content Fl‎exClip PlayHow to use FlexClip's AI Video Creator Verdict: User-friendly video tool with innovative AI features Link: ‎https://www.flexclip.com/ FlexClip is highly user-friendly platform that excels at helping you create professional-looking videos quickly and efficiently. I love the drag-and-drop editor. It’s perfect for creating videos on the fly without needing to spend hours on intricate editing. I’ve used it to create everything from social media content to promotional videos. The AI-powered text-to-video tool allows you to input simple text prompts, and the AI generates video clips based on the text, matching stock footage, adding text overlays, and even suggesting music. It's perfect for social media clips. While the AI can be a little hit or miss when it comes to perfectly matching footage to specific content, it’s an amazing tool for creating videos when you’re short on time or just need a draft to build upon, and I typically only need to make a few adjustments after generation. The AI script generator is another great feature. While the scripts are generally a good starting point, they often need a little fine-tuning to match the specific tone of the brand or subject matter. This is definitely a time-saver, though, especially when you’re stuck trying to put ideas into words. Another feature that impressed me was the AI background remover. It works surprisingly well. For most images, the background removal is clean, though it sometimes struggles with more intricate details like hair or small objects. It’s a great time-saver when you’re working with product images or need transparent backgrounds quickly. FlexClip also offers an auto-subtitle generator, which is a great tool for improving accessibility and engagement on social media platforms. It’s surprisingly accurate, and I’ve used it for videos on YouTube and Instagram. However, it does occasionally struggle with fast speech or complex accents, so if you’re working with content that has unclear audio, this may not always be 100% reliable. One area where FlexClip could improve is its media library. While it offers a decent range of stock footage and images, it’s not as extensive as some other platforms I’ve used. For niche content, I’ve often had to source additional media from other places. The stock library is good for general-purpose videos, but it may not always have exactly what you need. Ve‎ed PlayHow to Make a YouTube Intro Verdict: User-friendly browser-based video editor that streamlines social media content creation Link: ‎https://www.veed.io/ Veed is a user-friendly, browser-based video editor that made creating social media content incredibly easy for me. The intuitive layout and drag-and-drop functionality let me start projects quickly, and I loved using features like automatic subtitles, text-to-speech, and background removal to give my videos a professional touch. The templates and filters helped keep my style consistent, and with auto-translate, creating multilingual content was straightforward. The only downside I found was that the free plan includes a watermark, and complex scenes sometimes required a bit of manual tweaking to get the AI effects like background removal just right. Overall, Veed offered everything I needed for quick, polished videos with minimal effort. Ca‎nva PlayCreate content fast with Canva Video Verdict: AI-powered video editing with versatile templates Link: ‎https://www.canva.com/video-editor/ai/ Canva is not only a design tool; it’s also a great alternative for creating social media and YouTube videos. I tried its video editor, and I was impressed by how well it adapts to video creation. Canva’s templates make it easy to start projects tailored for platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. One of my favorite features is the automatic resizing, which lets me quickly reformat videos for different platforms without needing to start from scratch. The AI-powered suggestions for text and animations are also handy—it feels like Canva’s tools know how to keep my content consistent and visually engaging. With access to a vast library of stock media and music, I could easily enhance my videos, and the new AI text-to-speech and captioning features were a nice bonus, especially for making my videos more accessible. Overall, Canva’s video editing tools made it simple to produce polished, shareable content that looks just as good as anything created with dedicated video editors. The best AI-powered video editors Fi‎lmora PlayFilmora 14 is HERE! | Introducing a NEW way to edit Verdict: An affordable and user-friendly video editor with robust AI features Link: ‎https://filmora.wondershare.com/ When I first tried Filmora, I was immediately struck by how easy it was to navigate. The drag-and-drop functionality and straightforward interface made it simple to start editing, even without much prior experience. Filmora offers a robust library of transitions, effects, and templates, allowing me to quickly put together visually appealing videos, which is ideal for creating content for social media and YouTube. I appreciated how the platform balances usability with a range of features, making it suitable for both beginners and intermediate users who want to produce polished videos without a steep learning curve. Filmora’s pricing is also accessible, with options that cater to different types of users. They offer an annual subscription starting at around $49.99 per year, and for those looking for more flexibility, a lifetime license is available for around $79.99. There’s also a free version, which is great for testing the software before committing, but it does add a watermark to videos. For creators looking to edit consistently without major financial commitments, Filmora’s pricing offers a good balance of affordability and value, especially considering the powerful AI tools it includes. These plans are well-suited for individuals and small business owners who need regular access to professional-grade video tools without breaking the bank. Filmora's AI-powered tools bring a lot of convenience and creativity to the editing process. I'll run through each one. The AI Smart Cutout feature, for example, allows you to cut objects out of scenes by painting over the area, which is perfect for isolating specific subjects without complex masking. I also found AI Audio Denoise to be extremely useful for cleaning up background noise in my videos, especially when I recorded in less-than-ideal environments. The AI Audio Stretch tool was another handy feature that let me extend background music to match scene transitions, saving me the hassle of remixing or finding perfectly timed tracks. These AI tools are not only time-saving but also elevate the overall quality of the final video, helping users create professional-looking content with minimal effort. The AI Motion Tracking tool was a lot of fun to experiment with—it can be used to track faces or moving objects, allowing for privacy blurring or creative effects like pasting funny stickers over someone’s face to make meme-style videos. Another feature I really enjoyed was AI Remove Background, which made it easy to change the background of my videos without needing a green screen. I could, for instance, place a runner in an outer-space setting, which opens up endless creative possibilities. Additionally, Filmora’s AI Silence Detection tool helped speed up my editing by automatically removing pauses and hesitations, making it effortless to create snappy jump cuts. These tools make Filmora an efficient, AI-enhanced option for quick edits and visually dynamic effects. However, while these AI tools are great for general use, there are a few limitations. The precision of features like Smart Cutout and Remove Background isn’t perfect and might require manual touch-ups for complex scenes. Additionally, while Filmora handles most tasks smoothly, rendering can slow down when working with high-resolution files or when using multiple AI features in one project. This might be a drawback for users with demanding workflows or those creating high-quality, professional-grade content. Overall, though, Filmora’s AI tools make it an impressive choice for social media creators and hobbyists. In summary, Filmora is an accessible, budget-friendly video editor that packs a lot of AI-driven functionality into an affordable package. It’s particularly suited for those creating content for social media, YouTube, or personal projects. With its range of pricing options, Filmora offers a lot of value, especially for casual and intermediate creators who don’t need the high-end features of more advanced (and expensive) software. To‎paz PlayExperience Wonder by Topaz Labs Verdict: A premium AI-driven enhancer that delivers cinematic upscaling and noise reduction for professional-quality footage Link: ‎‎https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-video-ai Topaz Video AI is an advanced video enhancement tool that uses AI to upscale, stabilize, and improve video quality. When I tried it, I was impressed by how well it upscaled footage, even to resolutions as high as 16K, adding a cinematic clarity to older or lower-quality clips. The AI-driven noise reduction made a noticeable difference, effectively removing grain and artifacts that I struggled with in other software. I also found the frame rate enhancement and slow-motion features to be smooth and natural, making it ideal for creating professional-quality slow-motion shots or restoring archival footage. Priced at $299 for personal use and $1099 for commercial licensing, Topaz Video AI is an expensive but valuable investment for filmmakers, content creators, and digital archivists looking to elevate their work with high-end upscaling and video repair capabilities. Ca‎pCut PlayLearn How to Create Amazing Content using CapCut Web Version | CapCut Verdict: A free and versatile editor with intuitive AI tools that make crafting polished content effortless across devices Link: https://www.capcut.com/ CapCut is a free, all-in-one video editing tool that I found easy to use across mobile, desktop, and browser platforms. The array of AI-powered features—like background removal and automatic upscaling—made editing quick and straightforward, especially for creating social media content. The audio-to-text transcription was a time-saver, automatically adding captions that boosted accessibility and engagement on my videos. I liked tools like video stabilization and text-to-speech, which let me enhance video quality without needing complex software. CapCut’s collaborative features were also helpful, especially when working on shared projects, and the library of templates gave me plenty of creative options. Overall, CapCut’s versatility and ease of use make it a great choice for both personal and professional video editing. The best AI video generators for video repurposing Op‎usClip PlayOpusClip 3.0: The smartest AI clipping tool just got smarter Verdict: A smart and time-saving tool that repurposes long videos into engaging, platform-ready clips with minimal effort Link: ‎https://www.opus.pro/ Opus Clip has quickly become one of my favorite tools for repurposing long videos into social media-friendly clips. The AI-driven clip generation feature is surprisingly accurate, identifying the most engaging parts of my videos and saving me the time I’d usually spend sorting through footage. I appreciate how it automatically resizes clips to fit different platforms like TikTok and Instagram without any manual adjustments. Adding captions and even emojis is simple, and I noticed it makes the videos more engaging, especially for viewers who watch without sound. One of the standout features is the \"hook\" identification, which picks out key moments to grab attention quickly. Overall, Opus Clip made it easy to create compelling, shareable content from my existing videos, and the AI features really lightened my workload. Mu‎nch PlayMeet Munch Verdict: Efficiently converts long-form content into shareable social snippets using AI Link: ‎https://www.getmunch.com/ Munch is an AI-based tool for repurposing long-form video content into shorter clips suited for social media platforms. It identifies key moments in videos and includes features like auto-cropping, subtitles, and format adjustments to help optimize content for platforms such as Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok. Munch offers a streamlined way to create shareable content from existing videos, aimed at enhancing reach and engagement across various channels. I found the interface clean and easy to navigate, allowing me to jump right in without needing tutorials. One feature I particularly liked was the automatic detection of key moments. Munch’s AI identifies engaging segments, which saved me the time of manually sifting through my footage to find the best parts to share. For anyone looking to repurpose content across platforms, this automation is a real time-saver. Munch’s formatting tools also make it easy to resize videos for different social platforms. The auto-cropping options adjust clips to fit Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and more, making cross-platform distribution simpler. I appreciated the automatic subtitle feature, which made my videos accessible to a broader audience without much additional work. However, while these features are useful, they lack some customization. I couldn’t manually adjust the selected clips as much as I’d like, and sometimes the AI would pick sections that didn’t feel as relevant or engaging as I had hoped. One limitation I noticed is that the output quality and customization options are fairly basic compared to more advanced editing software. While auto-cropping and subtitles are convenient, the styling options for subtitles are limited, and I missed having more flexibility with transitions and effects. This might be a drawback if you’re aiming for highly polished, branded content, as Munch is more focused on speed and efficiency than fine-tuning. Overall, though, it’s a solid tool for quickly repurposing long videos into social-friendly snippets. If you need a quick way to generate clips from existing content and don’t require advanced editing, Munch is a handy addition to your toolkit. Wi‎secut PlayTurn long videos into shorts with Wisecut AI Verdict: Wisecut streamlines editing by automatically trimming dead space and adding professional touches Link: ‎https://www.wisecut.ai/ Wisecut automatically finds interesting moments in long clips and cuts them, adding music and subtitles. I tested it by uploading a raw clip full of awkward pauses and unnecessary dead spots, and Wisecut’s smart editing removed all the fluff. The auto-cut feature was spot-on, leaving me with a much tighter, more engaging video without having to painstakingly cut it all myself. The tool is super intuitive. It offers handy features like background noise cancellation and even let me choose whether to add background music, which really helped polish the final product. I also appreciated the straightforward interface—it made setting up projects and tweaking settings a breeze. In short, Wisecut has saved me a significant amount of time, letting me focus more on creating content rather than getting bogged down in editing. If you’re looking to streamline your workflow and produce cleaner, more professional videos, I’d highly recommend giving it a try. How did I decide on the best AI video generators?

How to create AI videos with Renderforest Our AI video generator makes creating videos a walk in the park. Just click ‘Generate AI Video,’ and our tool will do all the heavy lifting. Choose your flow There are two flows to choose from: turning your ideas into videos or turning your texts into videos. In the idea-to-video flow, you start by typing your idea in the provided text box. This can be anything from a simple blog post summary to a complex business presentation. The AI will then give you a customizable outline as the foundation for your video. If you already have a script, the text-to-video flow lets you enter it directly, skipping the outline step. In both cases, you can create a professional video in minutes—whether you have a fully formed script or just a concept. Customize Before your video is generated, you’ll have the opportunity to tailor it to your specific needs. In the idea flow, you can set the tone to match your message, choosing from options like formal, friendly, informative, or creative. Pick a narration style and voice that fits perfectly, and select visual themes and character styles that match your brand’s look. Generate When you’re ready, hit the “Do Magic” button and let the AI work its thing. It will turn your ideas or script into a complete video with animations, transitions, and all the visual elements you’ve chosen. The AI takes care of the hard work so you can focus on your content. Edit After the AI generates your video, you can polish it in the video editor. Use the timeline to navigate through different parts of your video and make adjustments to colors, fonts, layouts, and timing. You can also change any text-to-speech (TTS) options and pick from a variety of professional voices or add your own. Make sure every detail is perfect before sharing the final result with your audience. Export and share Once you’re happy with your video, export it in the format and resolution you prefer and share it with the world. Be it for social media, a presentation, or any other purpose, your video will be ready to impress. Why use an AI video generator? AI video generators are game-changers in video creation and distribution, streamlining the process and offering accessibility for everyone. A few factors distinguish the best AI video generators for the job. Saves time AI video generators simplify content creation. Unlike conventional techniques, which can take hours or days to complete, these tasks can now be finished in minutes. These sophisticated technologies optimize the whole video production process by automating tedious tasks such as scripting, rendering, and editing. The result is a combination of efficiency and creativity that traditional video production approaches couldn’t achieve. They also speed up production timelines so you can focus on the creative and strategic parts. Uniform quality AI tools guarantee that every video generated meets predetermined quality requirements. This is especially helpful for businesses and organizations who want to project a consistent image in their content. These tools reduce inconsistencies common with manual production, where human mistakes can impact quality. AI-generated videos often meet the required quality criteria. Maintaining a professional and consistent video message strategy for a business requires this kind of quality management. Adaptability and personalization AI video generators are great at producing accurately customized material to match various needs. They can modify language and style or include distinctive, personalized elements. Plus, they constantly update information in response to audience input or new data. This is extremely helpful for industries that depend on regular updates, such as news distribution or instructional content. These tools are also useful in various industries like marketing, advertising, education, and entertainment. This proves their ability to create material that appeals to a wide range of people and accomplishes various goals. The adaptability and wide range of applications of AI video generators highlight their important role in changing content production to meet the expectations of modern digital communication.

Related reading: The 10 best online video maker tools of 2024 The 6 best Placeit alternatives Top 9 Veed alternatives How to start a podcast Best AI video generators FAQ How does an AI video generator work? AI video generators use machine learning algorithms to generate videos from input, such as written descriptions. These algorithms can understand and interpret the components needed to create cohesive media since they have been trained on huge amounts of previously released video material. Users provide a prompt or description, and the AI combines this data—often with stock footage, photos, text-to-speech technologies, and pre-existing templates—to create a video that complies with the requirements. This procedure often involves creating scenes, having conversations, or even including particular visual and aural components to suit the user’s demands. Can AI video generators create videos for any industry or niche? AI video generators can produce content for almost any sector or niche because of their outstanding versatility. They can use huge libraries of photos, videos, and audio files, which can be mixed and matched in infinite ways to create original material—be it for LinkedIn, your website, or maybe your YouTube channel. AI video generation tools can also generate material with specified themes, styles, or criteria for marketing, education, entertainment, or information sharing. However, the appropriateness and quality of the produced content can vary. Moreover, further modification or monitoring may be necessary for some more specialized or specific problems to guarantee correctness and relevance. How do AI video generators ensure the content is unique? AI video producers maintain uniqueness by using advanced algorithms that can produce a broad range of outcomes from given inputs. Based on the user’s specified prompts or settings, these systems creatively blend components like music, graphics, and video clips. Many AI video makers–such as an AI animation generator—also have systems to search their databases for possible copies or highly similar material to make sure the finished film is original. Be that as it may, the complex nature of the input and the variety of the AI’s training set can impact how distinctive the result is. How much does it cost to use an AI video generator? The cost of using an AI video generator can vary widely based on several factors, including the platform’s capabilities, the quality of the output, and the extent of customization required. Some platforms offer basic services for free, with premium features available through subscription plans or pay-per-video pricing models. Prices range from a few dollars for simple projects to several hundred or thousands for high-quality, professional-grade videos. The project’s specific needs, such as length, complexity, and the need for exclusive assets, will significantly influence the overall cost. Can AI video generators replace professional video editing tools? Despite their rising capabilities, AI video makers are unlikely to replace human video editors completely. While AI is capable of producing standard or templated material efficiently, human editors provide originality, human insight, and human touch that AI is not yet able to match. Experts know their way around visual narrative, emotional connection, and aesthetics—all essential components of powerful videos. Although AI video generators are useful tools, particularly for repetitive jobs or generating drafts, the sophisticated skill set of experienced video editors is still required to produce material of the highest quality.
