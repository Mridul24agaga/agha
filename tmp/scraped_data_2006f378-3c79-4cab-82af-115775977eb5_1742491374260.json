Adobe Premiere Pro | Best AI Software to Create Videos Pros Best all round video editor Cloud-syncing for backups Free trial available Colour matching speeds up edits Auto reframing useful for social media Cons Subscription based model Steep learning curve Requires high computer specs download Not only is Premiere Pro my pick of the best video editing software, but it’s now my favourite AI video app too. With the latest version you can download using the button above, you’ll get some crazy powerful AI tools to make creating high quality videos a cinch. Colour Match allows you to match the colours in two different clips in your sequence to help get rid of any discrepancies between different shots in the same scene – really useful if you use two different cameras. The Auto Reframe tool is a godsend for social media video content, allowing you to change horizontal 16:9 video footage into a tall 9:16 aspec ratio, perfect for instagram Stories or YouTube Shorts. If you shoot interviews, the auto audio ducking feature uses AI to lower the volume of music when dialogue is happening Adobe Sensei is the ‘brain’ behind the AI in Premiere Pro, providing other features such as Auto Classification which tags your footage and Morph Cut which smoothes out jump cuts. Overall, even if you didn’t use any of the AI video features in Premiere Pro, you’d still be left with the top editing software of the year – start by downloading a free trial and see what you think. How to Download Adobe Premiere Pro 2. Topaz Video AI | Photography AI Tool for Enlargements Pros Extremely powerful video editing tool Free trial available Upscaling, image stabilization, and slow-motion capabilities Can generate multiple previews at the same time Cons Relatively expensive download Simply put, Topaz Video AI is a standalone desktop video editing application that makes your videos look better. Drag and drop your video into the software, select from the menu of presets, and let the deep-learning robot minds cast their magic. You can even upscale your footage. That means that all your grainy, blurry old 1080p film can now be enhanced to 4K or 8K. You can also render your footage in slow motion which can be handy if you forgot to shoot in the correct frame rate: Let’s say you shot at 24 fps – give Topaz that video and the AI will create new frames between the actual frames you shot, so your 24 fps could become 60 fps, and you can slow it right down. The program also has two types of image stabilization to help you produce engaging videos: The first crops into your footage to create this effect, and the other is image-aware and will fill in the missing gaps around the edges of your video so that the field of view doesn’t change. With this powerful AI video editing software, you can tweak just about any setting you’d want to use to enhance the quality of your footage – the frame rate, the amount of grain, or the sharpness. Not only that, you can create your own custom presets for adding to future videos. Topaz Video AI Review 3. Filmora | Affordable AI Video Maker Pros Simple, easy-to-use interface Good suite of AI tools Subscription or perpetual license options Affordable Cons Doesn’t have the slick feel of some competitors download As well as giving you all the tools you’d expect from a video editing suite, for adding templates, titles and subtitles, and for making adjustments to the video and audio tracks, Filmora also has some fantastic AI tools. You can adjust your footage’s aspect ratio, upscale video resolution from lowly 1080p to, for example, 4K, and change your frame rate to make fast video slow and slow video fast. Other AI tools include their chroma key, which enables you to remove specific background colours. This is especially useful for green screen footage, to make the background transparent so that you can add other media. AI portrait does essentially the same thing and removes even complex backgrounds from behind subjects. Added to that, Filmora has AI image stabilization, and lens correction to help you sort out any irritating distortion your lens might have gifted you. In general, Filmora is my recommended video editing software for beginners – it may not have every feature of Final Cut or Adobe Premiere for video creation, but for the price, it can’t be beaten. Filmora Review Best green screen software 4. Deep Brain | Text to Speech AI Video Tools Pros Innovative AI human technology Multi-language text-to-speech solutions Wide application across sectors Free online AI video editor Highly customizable avatars Cons Learning curve download DeepBrain AI stands out in the field of artificial intelligence with its cutting-edge AI human technology. It excels at creating real-time, interactive artificial humans that can be employed in various domains, such as customer service, virtual assistance, and educational content delivery. Their service enables the use of AI avatars that are customizable to suit different business needs, providing a unique interactive experience for end-users. It’s particularly beneficial for enterprises looking to scale their operations with AI while maintaining a human-like touch in their customer engagement strategies. 5. Fliki | Best AI Video Generator Pros Simple workflow to convert ideas, scripts, blogs, PPT, product URLs, and tweets into videos 2000+ AI voices in 75+ languages and 100+ dialects First in the industry to offer AI-generated video clips High-quality avatars with voice cloning in 29 languages Translate/Dub videos in 75+ Languages Intuitive and easy-to-use interface Cons Require a paid subscription for premium features download Fliki is a groundbreaking text to video AI tool perfect for transforming text into engaging videos with professional voiceovers. Its user-friendly design makes it accessible even to those with little technical experience, allowing them to produce high-quality video content effortlessly. Fliki’s extensive voice selection, available in 75+ languages and over 100 dialects, provides unparalleled personalization options. It also offers advanced voice cloning in 29 languages, and it leads the industry with its unique AI video clips—just input text and watch as Fliki’s AI crafts distinct video content akin to OpenAI’s Sora technology. Whether you’re a content creator, a marketer, or just someone with a personal project, Fliki AI Video Generator provides the tools and flexibility needed to produce visually appealing and impactful videos. 6. Veed.io Pros Good for beginners Easy to learn Range of templates and tools Speech to subtitles feature Cons Some features are only available in higher price plans download One of the best AI video editing options for beginners is Veed.io. It has an extremely simple and easy-to-learn interface, but despite this, it still packs a punch. Veed.io has many of the features of the previous two video editing software programs in this article. With it, you can change the frame rate to speed up or slow down your footage, and you can also remove backgrounds with a single click. Something it’s well-known for is its AI-powered speech to subtitles tool, which accurately transcribes in moments, saving you potential hours of work. And there’s also the text-to-speech feature. With this, you can give your video a voiceover without manually recording your own voice, and you can choose from a range of voice profiles and accents. I’ve included Veed in this list of the best AI video software because I’ve spent many a day transcribing videos manually, and know how frustrating it can be. What is an AI camera? 7. Synthesia Pros Easy way to make presentations Powerful, simple-to-use tool Impressive range of features Affordable AI video creation platform Cons Limited, specialized use case download Synthesia specializes in speech-to-video creation using artificial intelligence to create engaging videos. They give you a range of templates and amazingly lifelike avatars which you can make say anything you want – ideal for creating YouTube videos you don’t want to appear in. Whatever you type, they can say in a range of accents, using diction and, in the most recent iteration, gestures. It’s spooky how realistic it all sounds – even if you don’t have any staff or any desire to appear in YouTube videos yourself, Synthesia can help with your video creation. You can add a background behind your avatar, add a music track, and use a range of other tools to make the video your own. How can AI benefit photography? 8. InVideo Pros Easy to use and learn Simple but powerful Simple, two-tier pricing Article-to-text feature Cons Only the highest membership tiers have access to the best video and image libraries download This software shares a lot in look and feel with Veed.io. It has a super-simple, clean interface that is very easy to navigate. It also has a vast bank of templates for a range of needs from sports to marketing, to help you kick things off. One of its most impressive features is the AI-powered article-to-text tool. With this, you can copy and paste an article into the tool, and it will scrape the text to extract the main ideas, and then create concise content around these. It can create a unique video from an article too. Let’s say I wanted to make a video from this article – I could just paste the URL into InVid, and the video would be created for me! This makes it the best AI video tool for batch creating multiple clips from a blog. Like Veed.io, InVideo also offers automated text-to-speech. No more need to record voiceovers, all thanks to the power of video artificial intelligence. What’s the best mobile video editing app for iPhone and Android? 9. Descript Pros Unique product Powerful editing tools Edit video with text Slick interface Cons It’s not for everyone, but that’s just me trying to find something to say download One for the podcasters. A powerful speech-to-text editor that will save you time by allowing you to edit automatically transcribed text and video voiceover at the same time. Simply put, you can record yourself, your voice and your face, and Descript uses AI to make a video and a written script from this. You can then edit that script, for example shortening long pauses in your speech, removing filler and thinking words, or removing whole phrases. Whatever you remove is also removed from the recorded footage, thereby seamlessly editing your video with AI. The software also allows you to sync your visuals with specific moments in the script, and there’s a toolbar to help you collaborate on a project with a team. Add to that powerful video editing features such as the ability to grade colours, remove backgrounds, and beef up sound quality, and you have yourself a winner. 10. FlexClip Pros Interface good for beginners Great template and stock library AI speech to text AI text to speech Cons Limited tools for pros Only exports to 1080p download This software is rich in templates and has an impressive amount of stock imagery and video you can use to inspire or pad out your videos. The interface is very simple – it’s the best AI video editing software I tested for beginners, who will get the hang of it very easily. Once you have your footage uploaded, you have the standard range of editing tools to work with, to make your video look exactly as you want it to. You can adjust the brightness, and the speed, you can flip it around, trim it, or use FlexClip’s range of filters to automatically adjust the colours. In terms of AI video creation features, there’s speech-to-text, which can quickly generate subtitles, and text-to-speech, which can help you make natural-sounding voiceovers. 11. Rawshorts Pros Good library of resources Timesaver for small businesses Text to animation Automatic voice generator Cons Free version is quite limited download This powerful tool is specifically for people who want to make video animations. Write a script (or get ChatGPT to do that for you!) and paste it into the program. The software will then generate a voiceover, scrape your text for the main ideas, and then use those to make a coherent, animated storyboard. You’ve probably seen these types of animations used on software product sales pages to explain how to use the software. This type of animation can cost thousands of dollars to produce (not to mention countless hours of drawing), but now thanks to AI, you can do it for a fraction of the time and cost. If you need to create videos for small businesses, you can imagine how much easier this clever AI video tool can make your work. 12. Lumen 5 Pros Quick and easy tool to use Text to video Good range of editing tools Cons Free version is very limited download This nifty AI video editing softwa re software helps you automatically transform blog posts, Zoom calls, or articles, into video. It’s super easy to do. For example, just paste your blog article URL into the program, and it will extract the key points to match them with relevant text and video. From there, you can tweak what you want, edit text, and swap out photos and videos from Lumen 5’s online library. You can also make talking head videos and enhance your videos with callouts and cutaways. My favourite feature is the ability to select words in the transcript (auto-generated by AI, of course!), then match the visuals directly to the timing of the audio. For video creation for social media, which often needs captions timed to voice over or talking heads, this AI video app is insanely useful. 13. SyntheSys Pros Professional-level software Text-to-video capabilities Easy-to-use dashboard Cons More expensive than other text-to-video competitors download Using SyntheSys, you can get a lifelike avatar to present a video for you, generated from text, or create a natural-sounding voiceover track. They have a library of male and female avatars, and their technology allows them to use gestures, and natural voice tones, and speak in 145 languages. It’s a great tool for businesses, or anyone wanting to quickly create human-looking and -sounding content for commercial purposes. Whether you want to remain anonymous in your video clips or simply prefer to use someone else, AI video generators like this can help speed up your video creation process. What Is the Best AI Tool to Create Videos? It really depends on what kind of video you want to create, as there is quite a diverse range of AI video generators out there for different use cases. A cinematographer or videographer is more likely to need a tool with the power and scope of Topaz Video AI or Filmora. These can really help you dive deep into your footage and create something extraordinary for professional videos. Veed.io and InVid are best for beginners or those who perhaps need video clips for personal use or smaller scale production edits. Then there are the tools that are better for small businesses, YouTubers, or for commercial use. Descript is a great tool for Youtubers and podcasters to clean up their script and video, whereas Rawshorts will help you create an animation from your script. Those looking for AI to make them a voiceover or a complete presentation with a video or even an avatar will need something different again. Lumen 5, for example, will help you create high quality videos like these, while Synthesia or SyntheSys will generate a presentation for you with a human-ish presenter. How Does an AI Video Generator Work? The computer science behind the nuts and bolts of AI video generation is beyond both my human intelligence and the scope of this article. But in simple terms, what I understand of it is that machine-learning, the machine who has learned – which is a way of saying ‘an extremely powerful computer’ – knowing language on some robotic, mathematical level, scrapes the text and converts it into computer language: numbers. As computers understand everything in these terms, the combinations of numbers it receives from the text will correspond to number patterns within videos that express the same ideas as the text. They will match. And thus, a video is born. AI Video Editing Software FAQ s What is the best AI tool to create videos? For creating videos and ease of use, I’d have to say Lumen 5 for enabling you to quickly make a coherent video from text, or SyntheSys for creating realistic avatar-led video presentations. For specific edits, Topaz Video AI can’t be beaten. Is there an AI that edits videos? Yes. For example, Topaz AI and Filmora both help you edit your videos. You can use image stabilization, change the frame rate to create natural-looking slow-motion effects, upscale your videos, and do many more things that only a year or so ago, weren’t possible. How do I know if a video was created by AI? With many ai video editing tools, you simply won’t know, and that’s increasingly the case. The AI tools in Topaz Video AI are so powerful there’s really no way of telling if that slow-motion video was originally filmed at 60 fps or 24 fps. Likewise, the human avatar you can use to give your video presentations can use natural gestures, voice tones and intonation, which can make it very difficult to know if they’re real or not. Take for example, the Deep Fake video below: It’s certainly very hard to spot if the video creation was by AI or if it was actual footage. What AI video app is everyone using? Everyone is using all of them! All of the video apps in this article are being used by someone, somewhere to save time, to be more efficient, and to create something more compelling for a variety of use cases. If I had to choose one, I’d say it was Topaz Video AI, just because that’s the world I come from, and I know that it’s a very popular resource. For another use case, I’d find it hard to believe that most podcasters weren’t using Descript, as it’s such a powerful and powerfully specialised tool. Is Synthesia Ai video free to use? No, it’s not. Synthesia is only offered on a subscription basis. AI Video Editing Tools: Final Words So there you go. Honestly, even though I wrote this article myself, my mind is a little blown. AI is so new, but it can already do so much. It’s hard to know where it’s going to lead, but although that’s a little terrifying, it’s also exciting. Especially if you’re working with video. The AI video generators and tools available to you are so powerful that they will change the way you film and the way you think about filming. Cinematographers can make 8K cinematic, slow-motion, fully stabilized footage from 1080p footage filmed on an old camera. YouTubers can make video content of themselves with all their thinking words removed. Businesses can make promo videos, voiceovers or video presentations without hiring voiceover artists. It’s head-spinning! Doesn’t it make you want to create AI generated videos just to see how incredible the technology has become? If you’re not already using AI video generators in some form, it definitelt feels like right now is the time to start.

We took the AI Video Generators and ranked each of them based on multiple metrics. We used our incredibly sophisticated rating system. Learn AI Filmmaking: https://curiousrefuge.com/ai-filmmaking Get AI News to your Inbox: https://curiousrefuge.com/start-here Time Code: 00:00 Intro 00:23 Sora 06:40 Veo 2 09:39 Runway 13:01 Luma 15:52 Minimax 18:39 Kling 21:56 Haiper 24:08 Outro Try each of these tools here: https://sora.com/library https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-2/ https://runwayml.com/ https://dream-machine.lumalabs.ai/ https://hailuoai.video/ https://klingai.com/ https://haiper.ai/ 471 comments in this video we're going to take a look at the best AI video generators of 2025 I'll take a look at each tool talk about the pros and cons and rank them based on my super scientific french fry scale with curly fries being at the top and floppy crinkle cut fries being at the bottom let's get started the first tool that we're going to take a look at is Sora Sora is an incredible tool developed by open AI when it was announced in 2024 our Jaws dropped it looked incredible but now we have access to the tool and the question is does it stand up well let's find out so during this testing process I'm going to basically lay out a pretend scene so that we can have some variety to see the Cinematic potential of each AI video generator so we have this establishing shot here it's basically this kind of like abandoned factory setting we have this shot of this man looking over a computer he's just kind of worried right like something's going on and then we have the shot here of basically kind of a SWAT team maybe they're about to uh get to that researcher and attack him or something and so we're just building tension from just a few shots here and basically I'm going to use each one of those images to test the Cinematic potential of each of these generators so let's get to it to create a video and Sora all you have to do is go to their website click on the plus icon at the bottom and you can upload an image or a video which is pretty cool I'll use this video of a SWAT guy walking towards the door and we'll go ahead and click open once the image is loaded up now you can type in your prompt for our prompt I'll say a soldier walks down a hallway the camera tracks with the soldier as they approach a door handheld camera so the cool thing about using Sora is you have the ability to adjust quite a few different settings that aren't available other tools so for example you can select different aspect ratios we'll say 16 by9 of course uh you can also change the resolution so you can go all the way to 1080p which is great because most of the AI video generators can only do 720p you can also change the duration with some of the resolution settings you can go all the way up to 20 seconds it's pretty cool and then finally you can change the number of variations now with the 1080p version you can only create one variant but with 720 you can do two and with 480 you can do four which is really powerful so when you're ready to render go ahead and click create video I went ahead and rendered out the other two clips as well and combined them together into a scene with some sound effects let's go ahead and take a look copy that okay so as you can see it does look fairly cinematic the establishing shot looks pretty good I like the the dynamic movement I like that the clouds in the background are billowing and it really does feel like an establishing shot we also have the shot here of the soldier walking to the door which is pretty good I should note that we had to edit around a spot where the soldier in the background actually just kind of disappeared so that's just kind of part of working with Sora it sometimes takes your image that you uploaded and changes it a bit whenever it starts to render but you know looks pretty good the alarm you know kind of Clicks in a little late there but it's not bad and then finally we have the shot of the guy looking up and yeah there's like anxiety on his face looks like he's kind of in a hurry the camera Shake looks very very natural so I think it did a pretty good job now of course the problem with working with Sora is because it tends to be one of the more creative tools it can also get the strangest whenever you get into your generation so for example here's one clip that we had and you can see that the background character like disappears behind some random door and then that door closes and then he is approaching this door and same thing over here he just kind of covers up the guy and then a huge door appears which is uh just kind of weird so a lot of times when you're working inside of Sora that type of stuff can happen and it can really eat into your generation credits the strangeness that you get from Sora can be extra annoying sometimes because the tools also pretty expensive the most expensive version is $200 a month which is definitely cost prohibitive for a lot of Independent Artists on the positive side Sora makes it super easy to upload images and videos and you do have the ability to key frame your videos using a storyboard feature which is very helpful when Sora hits it hits incredibly well and the video quality can be incredible so it's definitely an amazing tool for getting really good results and the fact that you can render 1080p natively is really nice of course you probably want to upscale that using an outside tool but the fact that you can render the core video in 1080 is really awesome now the cont to using Sora is exactly like I said it's really expensive which is cost prohibitive for a lot of folks and then the fact that it can tend to cut to random shots and really just waste a lot of time that can be a challenge you also don't have the ability to upload photos of people if you aren't on the most expensive plan so again that makes it really challenging if you're an independent artist using the tool so for all of these AI video generators I'm going to rate them based on three categories the first is realism the second is camera and character physics and the third is workflow and ease of use so for realism inside of Sora I would say eight out of 10 it does a really good job it's not perfect and even the best generations of Sora if you really begin to examine them there can be some strangeness that you begin to uncover but it does a really good job now for character and Camera physics I will say that because Sora can get really strange really quickly and it tends to want to change your scene again and again I have to give it just a 4 out of 10 and for workflow and ease of use I'm going to give it a 5 out of 10 because while the platform is incredibly easy to use and intuitive the fact is the content moderation filters are too extreme with Sora and it makes it really challenging when you're working on a film project so that gives Sora a total score of 17 out of 30 putting them into the sweet potato fry level next up we have Google vo so VO2 was announced recently and the quality of the results that we've seen from the tool are incredible let me show you how to use it so this is what VO2 looks like I'm in Early Access so this isn't publicly available so I'll move quickly here weird thing about using vo is the fact that you don't have the ability to upload your own images at this time you have to create the image on their platform and then you create the video so that can be really tricky especially if you're looking for character consistency lighting consistency color all of those things so you should definitely know about that limitation and it is going to make it incredibly hard to create films with the tool in its current capacity but that being said let me show you the workflow here so I have basically a prompt where I'm going to create an image of a soldier walking down the abandoned hallway let's go ahead and create that image okay we have an image here if you wanted to you could start over I'm just going to go ahead and move forward we'll go to motion here and I'm going to say a soldier walks down a hallway the camera tracks as the soldier approaches the door and we'll go ahead and create that video I did the same thing for the other three shots let's take a look at our result copy that it's pretty wild I mean the establishing shot looks great that shot with the SWAT guy looks amazing and then this is probably one of the more expressive AI videos that I've seen up to this point but the problem that I'm sure you're noticing here is the three shots feel completely different they feel like they're from three completely different films and really no matter how much prompting you do it's really tricky to get the consistency without more advanced tools for doing style consistency location characters all of those things so that's a huge limitation to using vo however the physics engine that's powering vo is probably the best out of any AI video generator so for overall realism I would say with vo 10 out of 10 it is the best AI video tool for creating realistic videos for character and Camera physics again I would say 10 out of 10 I think it does an amazing job not only with camera Shake tracking shots all of those things but also with the actual expression of the characters directing the movement all of those things come through when you're working with vo and it's incredible all of that being said for workflow and ease of use people really don't have access to vo right now so that's not very helpful and then it's also very tricky to work on a scaled up project inside of VO especially because you're going to want consistency you're going to want that film to feel like it lives in these same world and universe and that's just really tricky so that gives vo a score of 23 out of 30 and they are now in the waffle fry level all right good job moving on let's take a look at Runway Runway is an incredible company that really supports the AI film making community and they have a ton of tools outside of just AI generative video alone you can use runway for lip syncing in painting there's a ton of tools that are really interesting to create a video inside a Runway all you have to do is go to generative session and you can upload your image or video and of course we can type in a prompt here I'm just going to say camera tracking shot Soldier walks down the hallway and you can of course change the model that you're using gen 3 Alpha is their best model at the time and you can change it from 5 Seconds to 10 seconds we can just do 5 seconds for now and go ahead and click generate so let's watch your scene copy that okay so you can see there are things to like and also things not to like with this overall scene here uh so if we kind of go to the beginning here the first thing you're probably going to notice is a severe loss in resolution now it's really interesting because a lot of the AI video generators produce results that are around 720p but for some reason the Fidelity of the generations from Runway really don't look great A lot of times uh for example there's a lot of really fuzzy areas you see here with this establishing shot that if an audience was watching this they would really uh not be very forgiving uh for those uh changes in resolution there you also have some really weird physics so you see this character here he's kind of gliding in a weird way this guy in the background he looks pretty good although he's not in much of a hurry but that's okay uh but this guy he kind of seems like he's gliding and a bit like connected to the camera as opposed to his like natural footsteps so that's a little weird and then the final shot here of the guy looking up I I like that Dynamic camera movement obviously there's not a lot of expression on his face it is kind of flat so you'd probably need to use Runway act one to like get a little more expression there uh but it it did an okay job the thing to like about Runway is the fact that it's really quick you can generate like 20 video clips in the time it would take you to generate one inside of cing or minia Max and you also have the ability to use all of those features that I talked about that go Way Beyond just the video generation alone so I really recommend using Runway if you are a filmmaker but let's get to the score for overall realism with Runway I would say that it's kind of just a five out of 10 I was really thinking that the results would be better but it seems like the algorithm has really stagnated recently hope hopefully there will be new announcements soon but at this point it's really beginning to fall behind some of the competitors for character in camera physics again I have to give it a five out of 10 the characters inside of our scene some of them looked good others the physics just didn't look right and the overall camera movement just didn't really make a lot of sense especially with that second shot and for workflow and ease of use I'll say eight out of 10 giving Runway a total of 18 out of 30 putting them strongly inside of that sweet potato category next up we have Luma Luma dream machine released in summer 2024 and it really was one of the first AI video generators that existed in this kind of gen 3 era the results that we got from Luma far exceeded the other results that we were getting from other AI video generators but the question is how does the Luma hold up today Luma is incredibly easy to use all you have to do is click the plus icon on their website go to the image and upload load your image you also have the ability to set an inframe so you can interpolate between the first frame and the last frame and it'll basically animate between them which is pretty cool all we have to do is type in our prompt and go ahead and click render I put all the clips from Luma together let's go ahead and take a look copy that okay so as you can see it's not super real istic an audience would not fully buy the scenes that we're getting from Luma I do think the establishing shot looks pretty good but that second shot with the soldiers here I mean it just looks like this guy in the background is being the creepiest little creepy SWAT guy ever and this guy while the initial turn looks good it just it it's coming across a slow motion which a lot of the AI video generators will give you slow motion footage and that's not really helpful if you're working on a project that's supposed to have realistic Dynamic physics and then the final shot here of the guy his eyes looks weird it looks like he's like a weird skeleton guy uh I think was it X-Men where the guy like blinked in two different ways it kind of looks like he has like a weird blink going on right now so it really just did not do an amazing job so while Luma is fast and easy to use and their API is also incredibly quick the fact is that realism is really bad you tend to get a lot of slow motion video clips from Luma and the physics just aren't really that realistic so for overall realism I'm going to give Luma a two out of 10 for character in camera physics again a two out of 10 and then for workflow and ease of use I'm going to say five out of 10 the actual interface is incredibly easy to use but when you actually get into the resolution that you're getting from Luma the overall Fidelity the quality of the generations and then also just the feasibility of the tools that are there the first frame and last frame feature is great in theory in actuality it doesn't actually work out so good most of the time so I'm actually only going to give that a five out of 10 so that means that the total score for Luma is 9 out of 10 putting it in the steak fry category although some french fries with some A1 that would probably be pretty solid next up is minia Max also known as hilu it is a chinese-based video generator that popped up in 2024 and the results are pretty impressive let me show you how to use it to use Minimax all you have to do is go to the hilu AI video website and go ahead and click quick create from here you can drag in an image and we'll paste in our prompt and the cool thing is you do have the ability to generate up to three video clips at a time which is pretty cool and go ahead and click generate so let's watch back our results from Minimax copy [Music] that so as you can see there's some things to like and some things not to like about this the first is the overall movement of the camera especially on the establishing shot it's not super Dynamic and the things that should be moving for example the clouds in the background there's really just not a lot of movement it it's okay but it's not the best you also have the second shot here and let's just note this guy who is just being a like a sneak King over here he's just like sneaking around creeping in the weirdest possible way and I should also note that we prompted for the soldier to basically be walking towards the door and he really just kind of like checks his gun and like looks around there's really just not a lot of movement there so not the best result from that shot and then finally we have this shot here and you can see that the man he's kind of talking here I don't really know what he's saying we didn't prompt in for talking but for some reason Minimax really likes making everyone talk so again minia Max is incredibly easy to use and the physics are decent especially if you have shots that aren't getting enough movement from some of the other video platforms Minx tends to give you the most overall movement and so it can really just add life to your animation just think about it as H giving your subject some coffee that's kind of what you're doing whenever you use minia max now the con to using Minx is the fact that it the overall realism is just not amazing compared to the AI video generators that are now available it used to be amazing just a few months ago it really was one of the best tools but as it stands right now it's not giving us the best results and the overall resolution is also a bit lower from miniac so you're going to have to upres the result and then also probably do a little bit of sharpening because it does tend to be a little soft so for overall realism from minia Max I'm going to say seven out of 10 for character in camera physics we're going to do 6 out of 10 and for workflow and ease of use it's incredibly easy to use we're going to say8 out of 10 which gives Mini Max a score of 21 out of 30 and they are officially a sweet potato next up we have cing like minia Max clling is a Chinese video model but they have many more features that are interesting you have the ability to train models on someone's face so that you can have them in the video again and again there's a lot more control over the videos that you generate and there's just more settings that can adjust including negative prompting to get exactly what you're looking for to create a video inside of cing all you have to do is go to the AI videos button and you can drag and drop your image and I'm using the latest version of cing that's 1.6 again you type in a prompt you can also change the duration the number of generations and then also the creativity strength which is pretty cool and then they do have a spot down here to type in negative prompts so things like Blurry Distortion weird all of those words that you typically would want to include in a negative prompt you can paste down here and when you're ready of course you can click generate so let's take a look at the results here copy [Music] that okay I got to say I'm really impressed from the result from cling here I think that it really embodies a lot of the Cinematic Aesthetics and elements that I would want to see from a video generator for example if we go back to the beginning here you can see that the smoke is billowing from this Factory and we have that nice movement of the overall scene which is cool we also have this second clip here it's pretty interesting because you have the soldier that holds up the gun and then it rack focuses on this guy in the background and his movement if you compare that to some of the other tools the guy in the background's movement is very realistic it really looks like there's a lot of weight behind it steps obviously we'd probably want to prompt in a little more urgency from the way he's approaching that door but it is what we prompted and the actual added camera movement looks good and I should also note that on the edges here you're seeing some chromatic aberration it's taking on Lind Dynamics like that's really uh a very cinematic and uh a much more detailed result that we're getting from cing versus other tools like Luma you couldn't even begin to think about chromatic aberration like that because the resolution is already so soft that that's that's a something to focus on in the future whenever their model gets as good as clean and then we have the shot here of the guy anxiously looking at his computer and I should note that when we prompted in for you know someone anxiously at their computer the system actually understood what anxiety is when it's captured on camera there's usually a pushing in feels like the world is closing in around them and uh really the overall uh cinematic result helps to reinforce the story that we're trying to tell so it's kind of like having a bit of an AI Director of Photography helping you out during the production process here so for overall realism I would say eight out of 10 for cing it does a really good job most of the time character in character physics again I would say eight out of 10 and then for workflow and ease of use again eight out of 10 so eights across the board that gives cing a total of 24 out of 30 putting it in the waffle fry category and then finally we we have hyper 2.5 hyper is a super fast and easy tool to use but can it stand up to the other tools let's find out so I'm on Hyper's website and all you have to do is go to image to video and let's go ahead and upload our image so our image is uploaded and then we have our prompt here so you do have the ability to change the resolution if you want and also the duration up to 6 seconds long and go ahead and click create let's take a look at our final result [Music] here copy [Music] that okay so as you can see the result from hyper is not amazing the first shot is just incredibly static there's just no movement whatsoever the second shot I don't know what's happening this guy's not even moving and this guy the the weight behind the guy's steps is just strange he's like floating and then it just like randomly Zooms in for some reason at the end so no idea what's going on there and then finally we have the shot of the guy kind of rising up and I suppose it's okay the only problem is when he blinks it is like it's like too fast and too robotic it's like it didn't blink for enough frame so it looks like he's I don't know some sort of like robot character that's been programmed to Blink as opposed to a real uh video clip here so I just don't think it did an amazing job so while I definitely think hyper is a very fast and easy tool to use the truth is it's very unrealistic and the physics are honestly pretty bad at this point so for overall realism I'm going to give hyper a one out of 10 for character and Camera physics I'll give it a two out of 10 I think that last shot was okay but not the best and for workflow and ease of use I'm going to say two out of 10 mainly because the overall Fidelity and resolution of those final videos that you get they're not amazing and there's not a ton of advanced features on their platform so that gives hyper a total of five out of 30 putting it unfortunately in

Jump to: Best overall Best free Best on a budget Best for business Honorable mention FAQs Quick menu 1. Best overall 2. Best free 3. Best on a budget 4. Best for business 5. Honorable mention FAQs The best AI video editors provide a new form of functionality that could not have been imagined a few years ago. To edit footage in the old days meant cutting, splicing, and generally messing around far too much. Now the editing process is so much more automated. Not only tweaking existing material, but adding entirely new content on demand. We’ve tested the best video editing software and the best AI tools, and now we’re bringing those together to compare and review video editors powered by AI - with video samples for you to check out. AI video editing offers businesses huge benefits. Sales and marketing teams can quickly communicate new ideas, pitches, and even create digital avatars, without the need for additional tools and personnel. In the past that would mean employing a large array of services, audio and video editors, copywriters, design specialists and more. Now, a simple prompt and some well placed templates can create a serviceable sales video in less time than you can say ‘just do it’. But with an explosion in artificial intelligence, which AI video editor is best for you? We put the top tools to the test, from prompt accuracy and the editing experience to export speeds and video quality. For more AI content creation apps, we compared best AI image generators and best AI art generators. Best AI video editor overall EE Car Show - Flika - YouTube Watch On 1. Fliki Fast and easy with superb features Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Superbly easy to use + High quality results + Flexible fully AI generated options Reasons to avoid - Avatars not available on lowest paid plan - Only limited quality voices on offer For us, Fliki is the best AI video editor you can get right now. It offers by far the fastest and easiest to use video generation and editing service on the market. The user interface is a joy to operate compared to its rivals, and the speed of generation and download is truly astonishing. The only compromise is the lack of access to avatar functionality on the base paid plan. There are six main options on the start menu. Idea to video, as well as blog, PPT, Tweet, Avatar and Product to video. There are also useful features like translation, voice over and voice cloning available, but for most users the first stop is likely to be the AI auto-generated Idea to Video or the URL to Video. I did a number of tests, but started with the URL to Video feature. Having named the project, selected the category, language and aspect ratio, I entered the URL of my blog post. With Idea to Video, the URL box is replaced with a text prompt (e.g. ‘create a video about cat health’). The service then parsed the webpage I gave, and asked me to choose whether I wanted the AI to use stock media or generate digital AI art media. I chose stock, because the AI art seemed a little cheesy for my needs, and I had lots of stored photos to use. I then chose a template, but because I was only on the Standard $28 a month plan there was no option for an avatar. You need to spend $88 a month on the Premium plan for an avatar or voice cloning. Which is a shame. There’s a final Submit button step, and a wait while the AI does its magic. In a matter of seconds, rarely more than 90, up pops the outline for the content. At that point most of the heavy lifting has been done. The script is auto-generated, the media has been selected and linked, and all that’s needed is to polish the script, adjust things like subtitles, audio, font design and background music if wanted. It’s super easy to do all this, which makes editing and polishing no chore at all. Once you’re happy with the final edits, it’s time to download the finished video file in resolutions up to 1080p. Again the processing and download is impressively fast, no more than a minute or so. Best free AI video editor Latest in Digital Security - Synthesia - YouTube Watch On 2. Synthesia Free AI video editing tool with digital avatars on tap Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Excellent AI lip synched voices + Premium voice-over options Reasons to avoid - Overly cumbersome interface - Sloppy AI video asset selection On its free plan, Synthesia provides 36 minutes of video production per year, using any of 6 AI avatars. 60 templates and 120 languages/voices. But to take advantage of the essential AI Assistant, which will help you create videos quickly and easily, you’ll need to upgrade to the Starter Plan. That also gives 10 minutes of video each month, as well as Getty images access. Still, it’s at least good enough to get an idea of what the best AI video editors can do. To start, select from three options, New Video, AI Video Assistant or Import PowerPoint. Unless you’re a complete masochist, most people will choose the AI assistant since it takes all the drudge out of the creation process. Once selected, you move through template choices which are mostly pretty generic corporate styles, and either upload your choice of PDF, Word or text file or paste in a URL to create a video directly from the webpage. The system will then generate the script and slides for the video, along with your choice of tone, audience, language and avatar. Once the initial format is delivered, you’ll need to spend time fixing errors and tweaking the content, and there will be a lot of fixing needed. For some reason the AI seems more artificial than intelligent. In one test I prompted for a video guide to baking a black forest gateau, and while the introduction worked well, the recipe was almost non-existent and none of the recommended images or clips were even close. The whole point of an AI assistant should be to save time and effort, so I was a bit bemused. My second attempt at a video went slightly better. I asked for a webpage conversion, which turned out to be reasonable. While I still had to change almost every background element, the premium voices and avatar were excellent. The lip-synch function is among the best in the business, which really makes the video pop. Such a shame that the rest of the experience is somewhat lackadaisical. Once you’ve finished editing, pressing the Generate button will create the end result. It’s not fast, our short 90 sec video took around 30 minutes to render, which is not ideal for iteration and testing. The whole process from start to finish took around two hours. The company is promising a version 2.0 in a few weeks, so we’ll circle back and see if the experience has improved. Until then we’ve got to deduct points for a definitely sub-standard AI implementation. Best budget AI video editor Marketing EVs - HeyGen - YouTube Watch On 3. HeyGen Powerful video tools and avatars Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Free plan available + Good value subscriptions + Excellent avatar choices and customization + Great for social media shorts Reasons to avoid - AI Studio video creation could be easier - Only 1 minute of video on free plan HeyGen offers some valuable tools for manipulating source video to take all the drudgery out of producing different content types. This is very useful for social media applications, or other places where you might need short snappy video content. The main function though is the AI Studio which lets you create a video from a prompt or from an imported document. The actual video production is good, but not as simple as it could be. The platform uses ChatGPT to help create a script from a text prompt, and it works really well. Unfortunately the script is not automatically added to the slide content sections, so you have to go through and manually paste the results in yourself. It’s a shame because it spoils what is otherwise a nice creative flow. However I found that once you got the hang of the timing of the script, it was fairly straightforward to edit the whole thing and make it sync up properly. But really this should be the job of an AI process. Maybe the next version. There are three main plans. The Free version offers 1 minute of video a month, as opposed to 15 minutes with the $29 a month Creator Plan. The Creator level also provides 1080p video, as well as faster video generation, no watermark and voice cloning. Users can also create three personal video avatars, which is a nice touch. But for some strange reason you can’t upload documents on this paid plan, only on the $149 a month Team plan. Where HeyGen really shines is in the results. Even the default avatars and voices on the lowest Plan offer great results. They’re animated and the voices are varied and decent. The movements also deliver the kind of feel you need to increase engagement. When you add in the ability to easily create your own personal photo or moving avatars, the whole paid package starts to shine with potential. One great new option is the new URL to Video feature. Drop your product page URL into the box and within a few minutes you receive a great looking 38 sec promo video short which you can use on TikTok, or other social platforms. You get to set your preferred audience tags and the language, and the AI lets you select from a set of scripts covering audience needs. It’s super clever, and you even get multiple avatars and environments to choose from. A big win in my book. Overall HeyGen offers a great selection of tools for video and avatar creation. It’s a shame that the AI is not used as well on general videos as it is on the shorts ad feature, but hopefully that will change. Best AI video editor for business Microsoft Report Story - Pictory - YouTube Watch On 4. Pictory A flexible, competent, professional AI video editor Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Clear easy to use interface + Solid range of functions and assets Reasons to avoid - Video editing can be a little clunky, if not buggy Pictory was one of the first AI powered applications on the market, offering a range of plans starting at $25 a month. Like a number of other AI video generator services, Pictory uses material from the Storyblocks and Getty stock assets library for its AI function. In that regard it’s really more like stitching together material than generating it. The Starter Plan gives access to the Storyblocks stock library, 34 digital voices and up to 10 minutes of text to video a month. There’s also access to 5000 audio tracks, transcription services and a branding kit. There are four basic functions on offer. Script to video, article to video, editing video using text and visuals to video (mainly used to make presentations). These base tools can be used to mix and match any sort of content you need, from social media to product promo clips or audio voice overs. There’s no AI generated material on offer, the AI is instead used to stitch together various stock clips and captions to create the finished result. The first thing you notice is the simple dashboard once you sign in. I tested by using one of my older TechRadar articles to create a video, by simply importing the URL. The process was super easy. The AI scanned the web page, worked out what the piece was about, and converted my text into a script for the video. The first thing to note is the resulting script, although good, still needed quite a bit of work to make it properly reflect the original. The AI is not yet clever enough to fully differentiate between generic web page text and the story itself, so there’s around 20 to 30% work needed to clean everything up. The same goes for the images and video clips the application chooses. Some of them were spot on, but around half needed changing. Thankfully the process of swapping out assets is really easy, click and the job’s done. It still takes time though. If you pay for the more expensive Professional Plan at $49 a month, you’re given a choice of 48 super realistic voices from ElevenLabs, otherwise you’ll only be able to use some basic generic voice-overs. You also only have access to the Getty images in the Pro plan, but that’s probably not so bad. Since you can upload your own material to add to the AI curated content. You can even record your own voice over on the basic plan, but there’s no auto sync, so you have to do it scene by scene which is again not a trivial task. I found that creating a simple two minute video from my post took around 90 minutes from start, which is a lot faster than it would be if I had to do everything manually, and record or upload a narration. So it’s definitely a big time saver. It’s always going to look like a stock video because of the lack of any decent editing features like transitions, but for someone who just needs something for their Facebook feed, it’s perfectly good enough. Best AI video editor: Honorable mention MotoCompacto - DeepBrain AI Studios - YouTube Watch On 5. DeepBrain AI Solid AI video editor workhorse Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Free video creation + Wide range of AI video features at a price + Innovative avatar functionality Reasons to avoid - Glacial generation speeds on base paid plan - Strangely complex user interface DeepBrain AI Studios is proof that 18 months is a lifetime in the world of AI. The platform offers a wealth of very solid features, including social media video editing, URL to video and a variety of avatars. But in practice it all seems to be just a little bit old-fashioned. If you want to get a feel for AI video generation and editing for free - it's a fair place to start, but you're unlikely to want to stay with this tool for any length of time. I went through a number of tests, testing avatars, checking out how well the AI functioned, and seeing if the ease of use matched rivals in the market. My main test was again URL to video, as this is a good way to see if the AI models in use are up to the task of recreating web content. The best tools grab all the elements on a webpage, including images and text, the worst don’t. In the case of AI Studios, I found that it did everything it should do, to a degree. My suspicion is that the AI powering the system is perhaps a generation back from the current levels of AI sophistication. The two main tests worked well to generate a script, although neither managed to grab and import the images on the blog post, which is a pretty fundamental requirement. The other quirk is the strangely tiny Options drop-down when starting the project. Blink and you miss it, but in fact accessing it has a huge impact on the type and quality of the generated video. It’s a very strange UI choice. Apart from that, the results are workmanlike. As I said, if this was 2023 it would be amazing. But times have moved on, and any service that offers this average level of avatar voicing and slow generation times is definitely lagging the market. There are some nice additional features you can’t find anywhere else, like avatar gestures (triggering hand movements during the video), and team avatars engaged in conversations, but they’re all locked behind the $89 a month Team plan, which puts them out of reach of most individuals. It’s a pity that the company has decided to focus the platform so heavily on the corporate buying budget, by locking most of the better features behind the top tier plans, but that’s their decision to make. However, if you’re looking to create enterprise training and marketing videos on a regular basis, then the AI Studios product is definitely worth a look. Best AI video editor: FAQs What is an AI video editor? These are software platforms that let you create, edit and manage video production using AI technology. They often operate like the best video makers we've tested - lightweight, online-based tools capable of generating content without the need for the best video editing PCs or best laptops for video editing. It’s worth noting that AI Video Editing is slightly different from AI Video Generation. The former acts mainly as a curator of different stock and AI media types, while the latter is primarily designed to produce artificial video content using a neural network setup. What is an avatar? An avatar is a digital on-screen depiction of a spokesperson, which is coded so it can accept any text and convert it into a) a suitable voice and language and b) deliver the audio in a human-like manner with the appropriate lip movements and hand/arm gestures. The best versions deliver a very human performance. What are the key features to look for in the best AI video editors? There are three main requirements. First, the best AI video editor should use a competent AI engine to drive the whole process. It should be able to generate an accurate script, scan and grab the right assets to go with the script and put everything together in an elegant package ready for publishing. Second, the platform should be extremely easy to use. If the inevitable editing function is complex or buggy, it becomes a chore. Finally, it should be fast. The finished product should arrive as quickly as possible. Just starting out? We tested, reviewed, and rated the best video editing software for beginners. ^ Back to top Are you a pro?

Adobe Premiere Pro | Best AI Software to Create Videos Pros Best all round video editor Cloud-syncing for backups Free trial available Colour matching speeds up edits Auto reframing useful for social media Cons Subscription based model Steep learning curve Requires high computer specs download Not only is Premiere Pro my pick of the best video editing software, but it’s now my favourite AI video app too. With the latest version you can download using the button above, you’ll get some crazy powerful AI tools to make creating high quality videos a cinch. Colour Match allows you to match the colours in two different clips in your sequence to help get rid of any discrepancies between different shots in the same scene – really useful if you use two different cameras. The Auto Reframe tool is a godsend for social media video content, allowing you to change horizontal 16:9 video footage into a tall 9:16 aspec ratio, perfect for instagram Stories or YouTube Shorts. If you shoot interviews, the auto audio ducking feature uses AI to lower the volume of music when dialogue is happening Adobe Sensei is the ‘brain’ behind the AI in Premiere Pro, providing other features such as Auto Classification which tags your footage and Morph Cut which smoothes out jump cuts. Overall, even if you didn’t use any of the AI video features in Premiere Pro, you’d still be left with the top editing software of the year – start by downloading a free trial and see what you think. How to Download Adobe Premiere Pro 2. Topaz Video AI | Photography AI Tool for Enlargements Pros Extremely powerful video editing tool Free trial available Upscaling, image stabilization, and slow-motion capabilities Can generate multiple previews at the same time Cons Relatively expensive download Simply put, Topaz Video AI is a standalone desktop video editing application that makes your videos look better. Drag and drop your video into the software, select from the menu of presets, and let the deep-learning robot minds cast their magic. You can even upscale your footage. That means that all your grainy, blurry old 1080p film can now be enhanced to 4K or 8K. You can also render your footage in slow motion which can be handy if you forgot to shoot in the correct frame rate: Let’s say you shot at 24 fps – give Topaz that video and the AI will create new frames between the actual frames you shot, so your 24 fps could become 60 fps, and you can slow it right down. The program also has two types of image stabilization to help you produce engaging videos: The first crops into your footage to create this effect, and the other is image-aware and will fill in the missing gaps around the edges of your video so that the field of view doesn’t change. With this powerful AI video editing software, you can tweak just about any setting you’d want to use to enhance the quality of your footage – the frame rate, the amount of grain, or the sharpness. Not only that, you can create your own custom presets for adding to future videos. Topaz Video AI Review 3. Filmora | Affordable AI Video Maker Pros Simple, easy-to-use interface Good suite of AI tools Subscription or perpetual license options Affordable Cons Doesn’t have the slick feel of some competitors download As well as giving you all the tools you’d expect from a video editing suite, for adding templates, titles and subtitles, and for making adjustments to the video and audio tracks, Filmora also has some fantastic AI tools. You can adjust your footage’s aspect ratio, upscale video resolution from lowly 1080p to, for example, 4K, and change your frame rate to make fast video slow and slow video fast. Other AI tools include their chroma key, which enables you to remove specific background colours. This is especially useful for green screen footage, to make the background transparent so that you can add other media. AI portrait does essentially the same thing and removes even complex backgrounds from behind subjects. Added to that, Filmora has AI image stabilization, and lens correction to help you sort out any irritating distortion your lens might have gifted you. In general, Filmora is my recommended video editing software for beginners – it may not have every feature of Final Cut or Adobe Premiere for video creation, but for the price, it can’t be beaten. Filmora Review Best green screen software 4. Deep Brain | Text to Speech AI Video Tools Pros Innovative AI human technology Multi-language text-to-speech solutions Wide application across sectors Free online AI video editor Highly customizable avatars Cons Learning curve download DeepBrain AI stands out in the field of artificial intelligence with its cutting-edge AI human technology. It excels at creating real-time, interactive artificial humans that can be employed in various domains, such as customer service, virtual assistance, and educational content delivery. Their service enables the use of AI avatars that are customizable to suit different business needs, providing a unique interactive experience for end-users. It’s particularly beneficial for enterprises looking to scale their operations with AI while maintaining a human-like touch in their customer engagement strategies. 5.

Veed.io Pros Good for beginners Easy to learn Range of templates and tools Speech to subtitles feature Cons Some features are only available in higher price plans download One of the best AI video editing options for beginners is Veed.io. It has an extremely simple and easy-to-learn interface, but despite this, it still packs a punch. Veed.io has many of the features of the previous two video editing software programs in this article. With it, you can change the frame rate to speed up or slow down your footage, and you can also remove backgrounds with a single click. Something it’s well-known for is its AI-powered speech to subtitles tool, which accurately transcribes in moments, saving you potential hours of work. And there’s also the text-to-speech feature. With this, you can give your video a voiceover without manually recording your own voice, and you can choose from a range of voice profiles and accents. I’ve included Veed in this list of the best AI video software because I’ve spent many a day transcribing videos manually, and know how frustrating it can be. What is an AI camera? 7. Synthesia Pros Easy way to make presentations Powerful, simple-to-use tool Impressive range of features Affordable AI video creation platform Cons Limited, specialized use case download Synthesia specializes in speech-to-video creation using artificial intelligence to create engaging videos. They give you a range of templates and amazingly lifelike avatars which you can make say anything you want – ideal for creating YouTube videos you don’t want to appear in. Whatever you type, they can say in a range of accents, using diction and, in the most recent iteration, gestures. It’s spooky how realistic it all sounds – even if you don’t have any staff or any desire to appear in YouTube videos yourself, Synthesia can help with your video creation. You can add a background behind your avatar, add a music track, and use a range of other tools to make the video your own. How can AI benefit photography? 8. InVideo Pros Easy to use and learn Simple but powerful Simple, two-tier pricing Article-to-text feature Cons Only the highest membership tiers have access to the best video and image libraries download This software shares a lot in look and feel with Veed.io. It has a super-simple, clean interface that is very easy to navigate. It also has a vast bank of templates for a range of needs from sports to marketing, to help you kick things off. One of its most impressive features is the AI-powered article-to-text tool. With this, you can copy and paste an article into the tool, and it will scrape the text to extract the main ideas, and then create concise content around these. It can create a unique video from an article too. Let’s say I wanted to make a video from this article – I could just paste the URL into InVid, and the video would be created for me! This makes it the best AI video tool for batch creating multiple clips from a blog. Like Veed.io, InVideo also offers automated text-to-speech. No more need to record voiceovers, all thanks to the power of video artificial intelligence. What’s the best mobile video editing app for iPhone and Android? 9. Descript Pros Unique product Powerful editing tools Edit video with text Slick interface Cons It’s not for everyone, but that’s just me trying to find something to say download One for the podcasters. A powerful speech-to-text editor that will save you time by allowing you to edit automatically transcribed text and video voiceover at the same time. Simply put, you can record yourself, your voice and your face, and Descript uses AI to make a video and a written script from this. You can then edit that script, for example shortening long pauses in your speech, removing filler and thinking words, or removing whole phrases. Whatever you remove is also removed from the recorded footage, thereby seamlessly editing your video with AI. The software also allows you to sync your visuals with specific moments in the script, and there’s a toolbar to help you collaborate on a project with a team. Add to that powerful video editing features such as the ability to grade colours, remove backgrounds, and beef up sound quality, and you have yourself a winner. 10. FlexClip Pros Interface good for beginners Great template and stock library AI speech to text AI text to speech Cons Limited tools for pros Only exports to 1080p download This software is rich in templates and has an impressive amount of stock imagery and video you can use to inspire or pad out your videos. The interface is very simple – it’s the best AI video editing software I tested for beginners, who will get the hang of it very easily. Once you have your footage uploaded, you have the standard range of editing tools to work with, to make your video look exactly as you want it to. You can adjust the brightness, and the speed, you can flip it around, trim it, or use FlexClip’s range of filters to automatically adjust the colours. In terms of AI video creation features, there’s speech-to-text, which can quickly generate subtitles, and text-to-speech, which can help you make natural-sounding voiceovers. 11. Rawshorts Pros Good library of resources Timesaver for small businesses Text to animation Automatic voice generator Cons Free version is quite limited download This powerful tool is specifically for people who want to make video animations. Write a script (or get ChatGPT to do that for you!) and paste it into the program. The software will then generate a voiceover, scrape your text for the main ideas, and then use those to make a coherent, animated storyboard. You’ve probably seen these types of animations used on software product sales pages to explain how to use the software. This type of animation can cost thousands of dollars to produce (not to mention countless hours of drawing), but now thanks to AI, you can do it for a fraction of the time and cost. If you need to create videos for small businesses, you can imagine how much easier this clever AI video tool can make your work. 12. Lumen 5 Pros Quick and easy tool to use Text to video Good range of editing tools Cons Free version is very limited download This nifty AI video editing softwa re software helps you automatically transform blog posts, Zoom calls, or articles, into video. It’s super easy to do. For example, just paste your blog article URL into the program, and it will extract the key points to match them with relevant text and video. From there, you can tweak what you want, edit text, and swap out photos and videos from Lumen 5’s online library. You can also make talking head videos and enhance your videos with callouts and cutaways. My favourite feature is the ability to select words in the transcript (auto-generated by AI, of course!), then match the visuals directly to the timing of the audio. For video creation for social media, which often needs captions timed to voice over or talking heads, this AI video app is insanely useful. 13. SyntheSys Pros Professional-level software Text-to-video capabilities Easy-to-use dashboard Cons More expensive than other text-to-video competitors download Using SyntheSys, you can get a lifelike avatar to present a video for you, generated from text, or create a natural-sounding voiceover track. They have a library of male and female avatars, and their technology allows them to use gestures, and natural voice tones, and speak in 145 languages. It’s a great tool for businesses, or anyone wanting to quickly create human-looking and -sounding content for commercial purposes. Whether you want to remain anonymous in your video clips or simply prefer to use someone else, AI video generators like this can help speed up your video creation process. What Is the Best AI Tool to Create Videos? It really depends on what kind of video you want to create, as there is quite a diverse range of AI video generators out there for different use cases. A cinematographer or videographer is more likely to need a tool with the power and scope of Topaz Video AI or Filmora. These can really help you dive deep into your footage and create something extraordinary for professional videos. Veed.io and InVid are best for beginners or those who perhaps need video clips for personal use or smaller scale production edits. Then there are the tools that are better for small businesses, YouTubers, or for commercial use. Descript is a great tool for Youtubers and podcasters to clean up their script and video, whereas Rawshorts will help you create an animation from your script. Those looking for AI to make them a voiceover or a complete presentation with a video or even an avatar will need something different again. Lumen 5, for example, will help you create high quality videos like these, while Synthesia or SyntheSys will generate a presentation for you with a human-ish presenter. How Does an AI Video Generator Work? The computer science behind the nuts and bolts of AI video generation is beyond both my human intelligence and the scope of this article. But in simple terms, what I understand of it is that machine-learning, the machine who has learned – which is a way of saying ‘an extremely powerful computer’ – knowing language on some robotic, mathematical level, scrapes the text and converts it into computer language: numbers. As computers understand everything in these terms, the combinations of numbers it receives from the text will correspond to number patterns within videos that express the same ideas as the text. They will match. And thus, a video is born. AI Video Editing Software FAQ s What is the best AI tool to create videos? For creating videos and ease of use, I’d have to say Lumen 5 for enabling you to quickly make a coherent video from text, or SyntheSys for creating realistic avatar-led video presentations. For specific edits, Topaz Video AI can’t be beaten. Is there an AI that edits videos? Yes. For example, Topaz AI and Filmora both help you edit your videos. You can use image stabilization, change the frame rate to create natural-looking slow-motion effects, upscale your videos, and do many more things that only a year or so ago, weren’t possible. How do I know if a video was created by AI? With many ai video editing tools, you simply won’t know, and that’s increasingly the case. The AI tools in Topaz Video AI are so powerful there’s really no way of telling if that slow-motion video was originally filmed at 60 fps or 24 fps. Likewise, the human avatar you can use to give your video presentations can use natural gestures, voice tones and intonation, which can make it very difficult to know if they’re real or not. Take for example, the Deep Fake video below: It’s certainly very hard to spot if the video creation was by AI or if it was actual footage. What AI video app is everyone using? Everyone is using all of them! All of the video apps in this article are being used by someone, somewhere to save time, to be more efficient, and to create something more compelling for a variety of use cases. If I had to choose one, I’d say it was Topaz Video AI, just because that’s the world I come from, and I know that it’s a very popular resource. For another use case, I’d find it hard to believe that most podcasters weren’t using Descript, as it’s such a powerful and powerfully specialised tool. Is Synthesia Ai video free to use? No, it’s not. Synthesia is only offered on a subscription basis. AI Video Editing Tools: Final Words So there you go. Honestly, even though I wrote this article myself, my mind is a little blown. AI is so new, but it can already do so much. It’s hard to know where it’s going to lead, but although that’s a little terrifying, it’s also exciting. Especially if you’re working with video. The AI video generators and tools available to you are so powerful that they will change the way you film and the way you think about filming. Cinematographers can make 8K cinematic, slow-motion, fully stabilized footage from 1080p footage filmed on an old camera. YouTubers can make video content of themselves with all their thinking words removed. Businesses can make promo videos, voiceovers or video presentations without hiring voiceover artists. It’s head-spinning! Doesn’t it make you want to create AI generated videos just to see how incredible the technology has become? If you’re not already using AI video generators in some form, it definitelt feels like right now is the time to start.

Load More Results Home Marketing Disruptive AI Video Trends that are Transforming Marketing in 2024 Disruptive AI Video Trends that are Transforming Marketing in 2024 Written by: Kipp Bodnar and Kieran Flanagan THE STATE OF AI IN 2024 New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing with AI. Download the Free Report Updated: 08/01/24 Published: 07/23/24 AI-generated video content is turning the marketing world on its head. But what trends should marketers be focusing on to stay ahead of the competition? If you've been following the latest buzz in AI marketing trends — and you should be — you know that AI video tools are at the forefront of this change. Whether it’s trained ad avatars or hyper-personalized video scripts, these technologies are irreversibly changing how we create content and engage with our audiences. But with such rapid innovation, what’s actually worth the hype? Kieran and I experimented with some of these new developments in a recent episode of Marketing Against the Grain, including a viral AI video on Twitter and an AI-generated ad created in less than 15 minutes. Among the many AI video options available, these four trends have been particularly notable — and are worth paying close attention to. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video 1. Avatar actors and likeness licensing are the new norm. Instead of hiring an actor to read a script or act in an ad, businesses can now license an actor’s likeness, use it to train an AI model, and then use that model to create ads and avatars. This enables marketers to quickly generate a variety of content, testing, and refining different approaches and messages without the logistical constraints of traditional video shoots. For example, this viral video ad features a woman casually talking about a product while seated inside her car. What’s so significant about it, however, is that while she’s a real actress hired off of Fiverr, the video itself is generated by AI video, using tools like Arcads. \"This produces video content that is human-trained but AI-agent delivered,\" Kieran explains. \"That’s quite an unbelievable concept to think through.\" 2. Low-quality but authentic content is driving engagement. Polished, high-budget video ads are quickly becoming a thing of the past — or at least, less favored by audiences. Instead, low-production, personable videos are taking the lead, outperforming traditional ads on platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels. Take, for example, the viral video I mentioned above: it’s not polished or high-budget. Instead, it’s set in a poorly-lit car, with an unflattering angle. Yet people are more likely to engage with it. Why? \"Because it feels authentic, relatable, and personable,\" Kieran explains. \"It’s how a real person would talk about a product.\" For marketers, this shift means experimenting with AI tools like HeyGen and InfinityAI, which quickly create videos that drive engagement, despite — or even because of — their imperfections. 3. Video personalization and customization are must-haves. Hyper-personalized videos that cater to customers’ accessibility needs, languages, and preferences are essential for successful marketing campaigns. During the episode, we highlighted how AI tools can use customer data from your CRM platform — like call logs, support tickets, and emails — to craft personalized video scripts. This enables marketing teams to deliver tailored content that feels uniquely targeted and relevant to each individual viewer. We also experimented with HeyGen’s groundbreaking Avatar in Motion, which creates customized avatars based on your own likeness. Move your hands, make gestures, or use unique tones of voice, and HeyGen will flawlessly track, translate, and lip-sync your video with any customizable input text. 4. Accelerated iteration is driving innovation. AI tools significantly speed up the iteration cycle for creative video content and limit lengthy and expensive production cycles. For example, during the episode, I showed Kieran how I designed and launched a video ad in less than 15 minutes. To stay ahead, marketers need to quickly and constantly innovate, as the ease of copying and templatizing creative work will lead to a rapid commoditization of content. Standard approaches to AI-powered video content may outperform current methods in the short term because they’re new and different. But effectiveness is likely to peak within the first six to twelve months. Then, it will taper off as audiences get used to it and become aware of its widespread use. \"Your best-performing content will now be ‘best-performing’ for a much shorter period of time,\" says Kieran. In other words: your iteration of ‘creative’ as a marketer will have to increase exponentially. Differentiation will rely heavily on the unique 10-20% of creative input, putting increased pressure on marketers to continually produce new and distinctive ideas. Three Tips for Integrating AI into Your Video Marketing Strategy Learn how to incorporate AI into your video workflow by downloading our AI Guide for Marketers and following the tips below. 1. Experiment. Experiment. Experiment. Test different AI video tools to understand their benefits and limitations, helping you find the best fit for your campaign needs and goals. This keeps your team ahead of the competition, identifying new opportunities to capture the attention of your customers. 2. Enhance the Tools You Already Use Not sure where to start? Try using AI video features that already exist in your current marketing tech stack. For example, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Mailchimp offer AI-powered capabilities that boost your marketing effectiveness by automating production processes and offering more detailed performance insights for iteration. 3. Monitor Legal and Ethical Considerations As AI video production becomes more prevalent, legal considerations around likeness licensing and content use will become increasingly important. Invest in the proper training and resources now to ensure you are using AI effectively and ethically in the future.

It digs deeper into ideas shared by marketing leaders Kipp Bodnar (HubSpot’s CMO) and Kieran Flanagan (SVP, Marketing at HubSpot) as they unpack growth strategies and learn from standout founders and peers.
