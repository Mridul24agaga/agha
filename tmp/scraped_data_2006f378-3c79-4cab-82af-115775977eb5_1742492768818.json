This website provides users with tools and services designed to create videos quickly and efficiently, using AI-driven technology. The premise is straightforward: leveraging the power of AI, users can generate high-quality video content without the need for complex video editing skills or extensive time commitments.\n\n**Main Focus and Purpose**\n\nAutomateTube’s primary objective is to simplify the video creation process for individuals and businesses alike. It caters to a wide audience, ranging from marketers looking for promotional content to educators wanting to create engaging learning materials. The emphasis is on accessibility, enabling users with varying degrees of technical proficiency to produce videos seamlessly.\n\n**Key Services Offered**\n\nAt the core of the AutomateTube platform is its AI Video Generator. This tool allows users to create videos by following a simple process. While specific details about the features of the generator are not provided on the surface, we can infer that it likely includes customizable templates, text-to-video capabilities, and possibly options for voiceovers and background music, all powered by AI algorithms. The goal is to streamline the video creation process, making it as user-friendly as possible.\n\n**Subscription and Login Options**\n\nTo access the full capabilities of the platform, users need to either subscribe or log in. This suggests that AutomateTube operates on a subscription model, which is common in software services today. By subscribing, users can benefit from ongoing updates, new features, and possibly community support. The mention of “Create Video” and “Create Video Listing” implies functionality for not only making videos but also organizing or categorizing them for easy access and sharing.\n\n**Refund Policy Insights**\n\nUnderstanding the company’s approach to customer satisfaction is critical, and AutomateTube outlines a clear refund policy. This policy is comprehensive, ensuring that users know what to expect when it comes to refunds. Here are the main points broken down:\n\n1. **Eligibility for Refunds**: Users can request a refund within 30 days of purchase if they haven’t fully utilized the service. This is essential for customer assurance, as it encourages potential customers to try the service without the fear of losing their investment.\n\n2. **Valid Reasons for Refund**: The policy lists acceptable grounds for a refund, such as technical issues that hinder service usage, services not matching advertised specifications, and billing errors. This transparency builds trust with users, making them feel secure in their purchasing decisions.\n\n3. **Refund Process**: Initiating a refund is straightforward—users must submit a request through the support system, providing relevant order details and reasons.

Completed video projects, used credits or tokens, and subscription fees after 30 days fall into this category. This is a standard practice among many digital service providers to prevent abuse of the refund policy.\n\n5. **Support Availability**: For any questions or clarifications regarding their refund policy, users are encouraged to contact the support team. This shows a commitment to customer service and helps create a supportive environment for users who may have concerns.\n\n**Legal Considerations**\n\nThe website also mentions “Terms and Conditions” and “Privacy Policy,” which are critical for any online platform.

Generate Al videos with just text Create AI-Generated Videos Using Simple Prompts Try for free 1. Invideo AI Ready to make pro-level videos without the pro-level stress? Things are about to get easier with invideo AI by your side (even if you’re an absolute beginner). Forget the hefty investment in cameras and gear. With invideo AI, all you need to do is “imagine” what kind of video you want to produce and give a prompt based on that (e.g. create a video on “5 productivity tips and use American male accent”, and voilà – it’ll transform your ideas into stunning videos within minutes! So whether you're a budding entrepreneur, a content creator, or a marketer aiming to build your online presence, invideo AI will be your go-to tool. Best For: Pretty much everything! With invideo AI you can make professional-quality videos for YouTube channel, Instagram reels, TikTok, and other purposes such as social media posts, marketing campaigns, and product demos. Top Features: 1. Extensive Stock Media Library Invideo's artificial intelligence video generator gives you access to more than 16 million stock photos and videos. This helps you easily search and put the right video clips into any part of your video. If you need a specific picture or multiple photos, it quickly looks through this big collection pile and picks the best ones. This makes sure your video looks good and matches the requirements. 2. Text Prompt Video Editing This tool makes video editing easier by letting you fix things with easy words or phrases. It's like telling a human video editor what to do, but it's even easier with a tool. Need to remove a scene, use different stock footage, or change the accent? Just give a prompt, and the AI will do the rest. This makes editing easier, even if you don't know much about editing. 3. AI-Powered Script Generation Invideo's AI script maker helps you make interesting, custom scripts for any video project, which saves you a lot of time in writing scripts. This tool is especially useful for platforms like YouTube, where your content needs to be intriguing enough to engage people & grow your channel. 4. Affordable Voiceover Alternatives The AI voiceover generator is a cheaper option than paying for professional voice actors. It makes a speech that sounds like a human in multiple accents, understanding the feeling, intent, and emotion behind each word. This function makes your videos feel alive, adding a professional look without costing too much. Pros It quickly changes your words into videos, making creating content more manageable. You can spend more time on your work and less on technical stuff. With more than 16 million stock media choices, you have access to a unique selection of pictures. This is perfect if you want to create top-notch quality videos without investing hours in creating them. AI-powered script generation can save you a lot of time in making regular, good-quality video content. It's especially helpful if you often face writer's block or have tight schedules. The AI voiceover generator tool can save money while still giving a good sound experience. This is really helpful if you own a small business or are an individual creator. Cons Initially, you might need some time to learn how to interact with the AI well to get the results you want. However, as you proceed, this eventually gets easier as the interface itself is pretty user-friendly. The free version includes watermarks. But, this is a small worry because the paid version starts at just $25/month and gives you a ton of premium features. Pricing Basic: Free Plus: $25/month Max: $60/month (The yearly plans start as low as $20/month) Sign up for invideo AI and start creating high-quality videos within minutes. Try online AI video maker Create high-quality videos for your business with AI video maker easily Get Started Now 2. Descript Do you need help with problems like evoking human facial expressions and emotional responses or the technical bottlenecks that make the video generation process time-consuming? If yes, Descript can help your creative workflow and enrich the quality of your output, making it more high-end and appealing. Moreover, it also realizes the significance of the human side of video production as it's not designed to replace human creativity but to make it better, to give you a vision, and to let the AI do the heavy lifting. Best For: As such, it's best suited to content creators, podcasters, and filmmakers who need to save time and get things done the right way. Because it is a text-based editing system, even the not-so-tech-savvy can use it. Top Features: 1. Automated Transcription Manually transcribing audio and video is time-consuming. To save time, Descript automatically transcribes all your recordings. Since the transcription is merely a text file, if you edit the transcription content, you can also edit the audio or video file itself. 2. Overdub Voice Cloning With Descript's Overdub function, you can type in the missing or correct text and then artificially generate the new audio in your voice or that of the guest. Creating a voice clone of this type involves using a voice sample to make the process convenient and smooth. 3. Studio Sound Editing Poor audio quality can negatively impact great content. Descript tackles this problem with its Studio Sound feature, which applies state-of-the-art AI to enhance the sound quality of audio files. It eliminates noise, hum, and distortion, giving a cleaner and more professional studio-type sound. 4. Video Green Screen and AI Eye Contact The green screen background editor lets you change the environment behind the video, just like a Zoom feature, so you can have more control over how you present your content. This facilitates the humanizing of the video and adds to its realism. Pros It offers a fantastic transcription tool that can automatically transcribe audio and video files into text in 23 languages. It's a handy platform that lets you cut, rearrange, or alter the contents and simplifies editing. It improves the recorded audio quality by making the spoken words much clearer. This makes your content sound super-smooth without you having to edit out one word at a time. Descript also integrates with other platforms such as Slack (a team communication tool), Podbean (podcast hosting platform), Restream (a LIVE streaming studio), and even Final Cut Pro (a professional video editing application), to name a few. You also get tutorials on using the platform to help you quickly master the features and make the most of it. Cons The learning curve for Descript isn't very gentle for someone used to text-based editing. At first, this may seem patchy, but it is difficult for users of conventional timeline-based editing tools to work. Descript boasts a full range of powerful tools but may not meet the requirements of professional-level video editing. It doesn’t even provide the convenient access to advanced effects and controls that a professional editing package would provide. Pricing is a per-person, per-month fee. This can be costly for teams or organizations with many people, primarily if more than one person uses the software. Pricing Free Tier Creator Tier: $15 per user per month Pro Tier: $30 per user per month Enterprise Tier: Custom 3. Runway Runway is an advanced AI text-to-video generator that challenges how creative content is produced and edited.

This is a valuable feature that lets you produce high-quality images, making it most suitable for tasks needing fine detail work. 4. Noise Reduction and Image Stabilization Noise reduction cleans up noisy or grainy photos, and image stabilization smoothes out shaky videos. Working together, they make your content refined and stylish. 5. Research and Innovation With generative AI, Runway ML will continue to be at the leading edge. As a user, you can enjoy the most advanced and revolutionary developments in this discipline. This means you are always testing the limits of possibility in generative A.I. Pros You can make your creative ideas into reality just by putting them in text. It provides unprecedented freedom of video creation, making it easy to think of and do any style or concept. The platform allows you to apply the style of any one image or prompt to every frame of your video. This is a very important feature in terms of maintaining your visual style consistency across all your video production. Based on mockups, Runway ML can turn out fully stylized and animated renders. This is especially helpful to designers and creators in creating a vibrant, engaging way to present their ideas. It’s easy to cut out subjects in your video and change them as you like with simple text commands. This lets you easily make specific modifications to individual elements in your video. By inputting an image or prompt, Runway ML can increase the realness of untextured renders. This is useful in creating realistic-looking images. Cons You might require a lot of computing resources and time. More complex tasks or high resolutions result in higher resource costs, and this may restrict its availability to users with less powerful hardware. At times, the input prompt is vague or contradictory, whereas Runway ML may produce artifacts or inconsistencies in the generated content. It may still need further smoothing out and cutting. Pricing Basic: Free Standard: $15 per user per month Pro: $35 per user per month Unlimited: $95 per user per month Enterprise: Custom 4. Fliki Fliki is another great free AI text-to-video generator that also has paid versions, letting you create videos as easily as sitting down and writing a few sentences. Aside from its practical aspects, Fliki is also fuelling a larger shift in content culture. It is just the right tool for creators and marketers to keep up with trends towards video over text and attract their audience’s attention. Best For: Fliki AI has become especially popular with bloggers, podcasters, YouTubers, and marketing experts, who use it to create interesting promotional materials. Top Features: 1. Access to Millions of Stock Media Fliki offers millions of photos, videos, and audio to improve your videos with top-notch images and audio. It's great for tasks like making professional presentations or doing personal creative work, as it has many styles and themes. 2. Over 2000 Realistic Text-to-Speech Voices Across 75+ Languages It removes the need for expensive voice samples and recording tools. It provides an easy and affordable way to change text into everyday, professional-sounding speech in multiple languages and accents. 3. Text to Video Fliki's Text to Video tool lets you easily convert text or notes into fascinating visuals using AI sounds and a comprehensive media collection. 4.

This feature is good for making things stand out, personal projects, and adding a special flair to the content. 5. AI Voiceovers Fliki uses AI Voiceovers to change text into realistic voices made by AI. These sounds are human-like, which gives a realistic touch to your videos and doesn’t make them sound mechanical. Pros The tool's interface is quite simple and easy. You won't be distracted by technical difficulties but can focus on your creativity. The audio quality of the voiceover is very natural and professional. This gives your videos a real feel to them, increasing the satisfaction of their viewers. It is also replete with a vast stock library for your creativity, which is one of the tool's real treasures. You'll find a diverse selection of images, video clips, and music alike. This library saves you from the trouble of searching for the right file everywhere by making it easier to track down materials from various places. Cost-wise, the tool is quite economical. You can even get better results with it than hiring professionals to do voice-over work. This reasonably priced special feature makes it ideal for any creators with limited amounts of money but ample amounts of content. Cons It does not offer great variety in pictorial variations. Though many options are there, these still might need to fit exactly your creative vision. You might experience glitches and bugs. These technical fumblings can be a bit of a roadblock to your work but are often just remediable with updates or support services. It provides a limited number of minutes per month at no charge. But that's a limit if you are doing really large projects or creating lots of output. Perhaps you would have to limit yourself and decide when to use it or spend extra for a paid plan. Convert text to video with AI Generate a video with just text Try Text to Video Pricing Free Plan Standard Plan: $21 per month for annual plan Premium Plan: $66 per month for annual plan 5. Visla Looking for the best AI video generator from text? Visla can be your right choice for a storytelling tool powered by AI that makes the entire process simpler. It has been fashioned as an easily accessible and powerful platform for a wide variety of users engaged in marketing, education, and other activities.

This lets you use storytelling and communication techniques with greater precision and effectiveness! Best For: Visla is the perfect option for developing and producing videos for marketing and sales, engineering, content creation, social media, team communications, customer service, and even personal branding. This is precisely what makes it so useful for professionals and teams to develop their own strategies for using storytelling to interact with audiences. Top Features: 1. Collaboration and Feedback Visla makes it simple to share your videos with your team or readers. In other words, you can use videos with other people, and you can receive others’ feedback. 2. Versatility for Various Industries Whether you work in marketing, sales, teaching, entertainment, or some other field, it's made to fit in wherever people work. 3. Diverse Use Cases Visla is just good for a variety of these video activities.

It's like having one tool to deal with just about any job! 4. AI Summary Visla provides a feature that allows the main points of a text to be immediately grasped. Using AI, it discovers the key points, such as the keywords or main topics, or otherwise makes a long transcript short. 5. Teleprompter Mode Afraid you might have forgotten something or won't do a good job of expressing what is on your mind? This is where the teleprompter mode helps by letting you read from your marks instead of into the lens. This makes you look more confident and you don't lose your audience as you can make eye contact. 6. Community Hub Within the community hub, you can participate in discussions, seek advice, exchange experiences, and even receive ideas from other users. It's a place where you can get to know people using Visla too, help, and learn from one another. Pros Visla gives users the ability to create high-quality videos, working from the most minimal of ideas, perhaps even just a script. The platform can also be used to cover such tasks as writing scripts, narrating in its own voice, choosing the right pieces of video to show, and so on. Its AI-assisted editing functionality can even remove unwanted portions of video with an automatic effect. It has a comprehensible, easy interface, despite its many functions, which means that it can be used by people at every skill level. It allows a first-time user to become proficient with it only really requiring a timer, so that after only 2-3 minutes one can become accustomed. Visla's free subscription plan is particularly generous, as it allows publishers up to 50 minutes of video free of charge every month. This time is longer than most. Of course, there is also a great deal of access to the free version, which offers many of the platform’s main functions. It also comes with all the tools to aid in video production. With narration-assistance features powered by AI, screen recording functions for demonstration videos, text overlays for social media interviews, and so much more. Cons The inability to generate images is one major shortcoming of Visla compared to tools using coherent AI. To make up for this shortcoming, users who want to add this functionality have to feed suitable images to an external AI image generator before importing them into Visla. Exporting videos before downloading them can be very time-consuming. Likewise, the download speeds are quite slow. Even when Visla generates videos itself, it doesn't happen instantaneously, and it can still take a couple of minutes. The computer-generated script might contain mistakes that must be checked and corrected by a human. In addition, since the AI voiceover sometimes pronounces words incorrectly, this might affect the quality of the narrative. Pricing Basic: Free Plan Premium: $24 per month 6. Opus Clip Opus Clip converts full-length videos into short viral videos, and it shines through its comprehensive video content analysis capability. It also determines which parts are most effective and assembles them in easily digestible short clippings. It also employs cutting-edge artificial intelligence-enhanced functions such as AI Curation, AI Virality Score, and AI Emoji Generator to boost the attractiveness and virality of the content. All in all, it provides a great balance between accessibility and advanced, AI-assisted functionality, for newbies and experienced users too! Best For: Converting long-form video content into short clips that can go viral. It uses AI to help you create fun short videos with little effort. Top Features: 1. AI Curation This feature uses GPT-4 Turbo, the most advanced artificial intelligence, to take a long video and pick out the most intriguing segments. The selected parts are then crafted together into an attention-grabbing and compact short clip. Not only can it intelligently choose the segments, but it can also put this into a narrative framework, presenting the video in an organized, entertaining manner. 2. AI Virality Score Using AI and big data analysis of thousands of viral videos, Opus Clip attaches a score for its virality to each clip. With this score, you get a better idea of the potential impact of the cut, and you can use data to make decisions on the best way to maximize reach and engagement. 3. AI Co-Pilot With this feature, you have greater control over the video editing process. You can specify the time frames in your video to clip and make more focused and accurate content. 4. Active Speaker Detection Using predictive AI, Opus Clip analyzes and follows moving faces in the video. This enables you to keep your guests' (or, if you decide to take your own) face in the middle of the video frame. It makes your content more concentrated and professional-looking. 5. AI Keyword Highlighter With this tool, your video captions' important keywords are automatically selected and highlighted which can help to attain higher viewer engagement rates. 6. AI Emoji Generator The power of emojis is not lost on Opus Clip, which automatically adds suitable emojis to your video content. Pros It makes the video production process much faster. In other words, if a video project normally takes an hour, with Opus Clip it could be done in a few minutes. Part of the timesaving potential is especially useful for those who have to produce large amounts of video regularly. With the free trial, you can test the tool without risking any money. You can upload up to 120 minutes of video for free to test its features and determine whether or not it is right for you. This multi-language support makes the tool easier to use in different regions and audiences. This is particularly helpful for creators of content and content generators for whom English is their main language and they’re targeting an international audience or simply working in a multilingual environment. Its useful first paragraph-generating capabilities alone make it a game-changer when it comes to attracting viewers from the start. Cons Opus Clip may be a powerful software, but you would have to invest significant time and effort far beyond just learning how to use the product before you can master its full range of features. This learning curve could be an obstacle for those who need to quickly produce results without going into too much technical detail. Its effectiveness depends on the quality of the input video. If the original content was lousily shot or edited, it might not be able to finely tune it. While customization options are there, they may not meet all requirements or individual preferences of users. For some, this is a drawback, especially if highly personal or unique video styles are needed. The default caption may not be to everyone's tastes and could undermine creative expression. Pricing Free plan Starter Plan: $9 per month Pro: $ 19 per month 7. Colossyan Looking for the best AI music video generator? Colossyan can be just the right choice! It is an AI-assisted video creation tool for streamlining the video-creating process.

With a range of pricing plans available to suit various needs and budgets, Colossyan provides an economical solution for many users. Cons The actors are advanced AI-generated avatars, looking and sounding highly lifelike, but the platform is limited to these digital actors. This limitation does not allow users to directly incorporate live human actors or their own recordings into the platform. As comfortable and convenient as Colossyan is, the more sophisticated its customization capabilities are as they need a learning curve.

See how Descript complements your creativity and streamlines the process. Vivian Tejeda AI for Creators Recording Gear & Setup In this article Start editing audio & video This makes the editing process so much faster. I wish I knew about Descript a year ago. Matt D., Copywriter Sign up Today, creators can find artificial intelligence tools for nearly everything—from writing your YouTube descriptions to adjusting your eye contact in a video. Generative AI, which produces new content based on a single prompt, has changed the game for video generation. It’s made visual storytelling a more accessible task to creators from all backgrounds. It has also made it even more essential for creators to stay in the loop when it comes to AI video generation tools. Because these tools come with a wide range of capabilities: some can generate whole videos from a few words, just like an image generator might. Others use AI for smaller but equally important pieces of the video production process, like background removal. This guide highlights a range of the best AI video generators, outlining their best features and unique benefits they offer when creating videos. What is an AI-generated video? An AI-generated video is a type of video created with machine learning software. These automated systems use algorithms to assemble video elements like images, audio files, and text into a cohesive narrative based on a creator’s prompt. 3 benefits of AI-powered video generators Now we know what an AI video generator is, let’s explore the advantages of using one in your video production process. Efficiency and time savings Unlike traditional manual editing and assembly methods, you don’t need advanced video editing skills to create AI-generated videos. Using AI tools, you can get more done faster. In the past, you'd have to spend hours making videos by meticulously editing footage frame by frame. Today, AI-powered video generators like Synthesia, Descript, and Pictory assemble and make quality videos in a fraction of the time, so you can ship new content to various platforms quickly. Consistency and error reduction A good AI video generator doesn’t glance over tiny details. Programmed with set guidelines, AI video software delivers consistent and virtually error-free video content, making it invaluable for producing any type of video content—from training webinars to—from training webinars to YouTube channel content. Metadata aspects, such as subtitles and additional video data, are handled with the same level of accuracy. The end result: create content that’s not just good, but structurally great and accessible to all viewers. Customizable versatility across formats The real beauty of AI video generators lies in their flexibility. Need an Apple-friendly Quicktime video? Done. A Windows Media video for Microsoft users? No problem. Some generators can even support less common video formats, including MOV, AVI, WMV, and MPEG-4. With added functionality like customizable video templates and transitions, you have a lot of leeway in personalizing videos to your liking using an AI video template.

Adobe Premiere Pro | Best AI Software to Create Videos Pros Best all round video editor Cloud-syncing for backups Free trial available Colour matching speeds up edits Auto reframing useful for social media Cons Subscription based model Steep learning curve Requires high computer specs download Not only is Premiere Pro my pick of the best video editing software, but it’s now my favourite AI video app too. With the latest version you can download using the button above, you’ll get some crazy powerful AI tools to make creating high quality videos a cinch. Colour Match allows you to match the colours in two different clips in your sequence to help get rid of any discrepancies between different shots in the same scene – really useful if you use two different cameras. The Auto Reframe tool is a godsend for social media video content, allowing you to change horizontal 16:9 video footage into a tall 9:16 aspec ratio, perfect for instagram Stories or YouTube Shorts. If you shoot interviews, the auto audio ducking feature uses AI to lower the volume of music when dialogue is happening Adobe Sensei is the ‘brain’ behind the AI in Premiere Pro, providing other features such as Auto Classification which tags your footage and Morph Cut which smoothes out jump cuts. Overall, even if you didn’t use any of the AI video features in Premiere Pro, you’d still be left with the top editing software of the year – start by downloading a free trial and see what you think. How to Download Adobe Premiere Pro 2. Topaz Video AI | Photography AI Tool for Enlargements Pros Extremely powerful video editing tool Free trial available Upscaling, image stabilization, and slow-motion capabilities Can generate multiple previews at the same time Cons Relatively expensive download Simply put, Topaz Video AI is a standalone desktop video editing application that makes your videos look better. Drag and drop your video into the software, select from the menu of presets, and let the deep-learning robot minds cast their magic. You can even upscale your footage. That means that all your grainy, blurry old 1080p film can now be enhanced to 4K or 8K. You can also render your footage in slow motion which can be handy if you forgot to shoot in the correct frame rate: Let’s say you shot at 24 fps – give Topaz that video and the AI will create new frames between the actual frames you shot, so your 24 fps could become 60 fps, and you can slow it right down. The program also has two types of image stabilization to help you produce engaging videos: The first crops into your footage to create this effect, and the other is image-aware and will fill in the missing gaps around the edges of your video so that the field of view doesn’t change. With this powerful AI video editing software, you can tweak just about any setting you’d want to use to enhance the quality of your footage – the frame rate, the amount of grain, or the sharpness. Not only that, you can create your own custom presets for adding to future videos. Topaz Video AI Review 3. Filmora | Affordable AI Video Maker Pros Simple, easy-to-use interface Good suite of AI tools Subscription or perpetual license options Affordable Cons Doesn’t have the slick feel of some competitors download As well as giving you all the tools you’d expect from a video editing suite, for adding templates, titles and subtitles, and for making adjustments to the video and audio tracks, Filmora also has some fantastic AI tools. You can adjust your footage’s aspect ratio, upscale video resolution from lowly 1080p to, for example, 4K, and change your frame rate to make fast video slow and slow video fast. Other AI tools include their chroma key, which enables you to remove specific background colours. This is especially useful for green screen footage, to make the background transparent so that you can add other media. AI portrait does essentially the same thing and removes even complex backgrounds from behind subjects. Added to that, Filmora has AI image stabilization, and lens correction to help you sort out any irritating distortion your lens might have gifted you. In general, Filmora is my recommended video editing software for beginners – it may not have every feature of Final Cut or Adobe Premiere for video creation, but for the price, it can’t be beaten. Filmora Review Best green screen software 4. Deep Brain | Text to Speech AI Video Tools Pros Innovative AI human technology Multi-language text-to-speech solutions Wide application across sectors Free online AI video editor Highly customizable avatars Cons Learning curve download DeepBrain AI stands out in the field of artificial intelligence with its cutting-edge AI human technology.

Their service enables the use of AI avatars that are customizable to suit different business needs, providing a unique interactive experience for end-users.

Veed.io Pros Good for beginners Easy to learn Range of templates and tools Speech to subtitles feature Cons Some features are only available in higher price plans download One of the best AI video editing options for beginners is Veed.io. It has an extremely simple and easy-to-learn interface, but despite this, it still packs a punch. Veed.io has many of the features of the previous two video editing software programs in this article. With it, you can change the frame rate to speed up or slow down your footage, and you can also remove backgrounds with a single click. Something it’s well-known for is its AI-powered speech to subtitles tool, which accurately transcribes in moments, saving you potential hours of work. And there’s also the text-to-speech feature. With this, you can give your video a voiceover without manually recording your own voice, and you can choose from a range of voice profiles and accents. I’ve included Veed in this list of the best AI video software because I’ve spent many a day transcribing videos manually, and know how frustrating it can be. What is an AI camera? 7. Synthesia Pros Easy way to make presentations Powerful, simple-to-use tool Impressive range of features Affordable AI video creation platform Cons Limited, specialized use case download Synthesia specializes in speech-to-video creation using artificial intelligence to create engaging videos. They give you a range of templates and amazingly lifelike avatars which you can make say anything you want – ideal for creating YouTube videos you don’t want to appear in. Whatever you type, they can say in a range of accents, using diction and, in the most recent iteration, gestures. It’s spooky how realistic it all sounds – even if you don’t have any staff or any desire to appear in YouTube videos yourself, Synthesia can help with your video creation. You can add a background behind your avatar, add a music track, and use a range of other tools to make the video your own. How can AI benefit photography? 8. InVideo Pros Easy to use and learn Simple but powerful Simple, two-tier pricing Article-to-text feature Cons Only the highest membership tiers have access to the best video and image libraries download This software shares a lot in look and feel with Veed.io. It has a super-simple, clean interface that is very easy to navigate. It also has a vast bank of templates for a range of needs from sports to marketing, to help you kick things off. One of its most impressive features is the AI-powered article-to-text tool. With this, you can copy and paste an article into the tool, and it will scrape the text to extract the main ideas, and then create concise content around these. It can create a unique video from an article too. Let’s say I wanted to make a video from this article – I could just paste the URL into InVid, and the video would be created for me! This makes it the best AI video tool for batch creating multiple clips from a blog. Like Veed.io, InVideo also offers automated text-to-speech. No more need to record voiceovers, all thanks to the power of video artificial intelligence. What’s the best mobile video editing app for iPhone and Android? 9. Descript Pros Unique product Powerful editing tools Edit video with text Slick interface Cons It’s not for everyone, but that’s just me trying to find something to say download One for the podcasters. A powerful speech-to-text editor that will save you time by allowing you to edit automatically transcribed text and video voiceover at the same time. Simply put, you can record yourself, your voice and your face, and Descript uses AI to make a video and a written script from this. You can then edit that script, for example shortening long pauses in your speech, removing filler and thinking words, or removing whole phrases. Whatever you remove is also removed from the recorded footage, thereby seamlessly editing your video with AI. The software also allows you to sync your visuals with specific moments in the script, and there’s a toolbar to help you collaborate on a project with a team. Add to that powerful video editing features such as the ability to grade colours, remove backgrounds, and beef up sound quality, and you have yourself a winner. 10. FlexClip Pros Interface good for beginners Great template and stock library AI speech to text AI text to speech Cons Limited tools for pros Only exports to 1080p download This software is rich in templates and has an impressive amount of stock imagery and video you can use to inspire or pad out your videos. The interface is very simple – it’s the best AI video editing software I tested for beginners, who will get the hang of it very easily. Once you have your footage uploaded, you have the standard range of editing tools to work with, to make your video look exactly as you want it to. You can adjust the brightness, and the speed, you can flip it around, trim it, or use FlexClip’s range of filters to automatically adjust the colours. In terms of AI video creation features, there’s speech-to-text, which can quickly generate subtitles, and text-to-speech, which can help you make natural-sounding voiceovers. 11. Rawshorts Pros Good library of resources Timesaver for small businesses Text to animation Automatic voice generator Cons Free version is quite limited download This powerful tool is specifically for people who want to make video animations. Write a script (or get ChatGPT to do that for you!) and paste it into the program. The software will then generate a voiceover, scrape your text for the main ideas, and then use those to make a coherent, animated storyboard. You’ve probably seen these types of animations used on software product sales pages to explain how to use the software. This type of animation can cost thousands of dollars to produce (not to mention countless hours of drawing), but now thanks to AI, you can do it for a fraction of the time and cost. If you need to create videos for small businesses, you can imagine how much easier this clever AI video tool can make your work. 12. Lumen 5 Pros Quick and easy tool to use Text to video Good range of editing tools Cons Free version is very limited download This nifty AI video editing softwa re software helps you automatically transform blog posts, Zoom calls, or articles, into video. It’s super easy to do. For example, just paste your blog article URL into the program, and it will extract the key points to match them with relevant text and video. From there, you can tweak what you want, edit text, and swap out photos and videos from Lumen 5’s online library. You can also make talking head videos and enhance your videos with callouts and cutaways. My favourite feature is the ability to select words in the transcript (auto-generated by AI, of course!), then match the visuals directly to the timing of the audio. For video creation for social media, which often needs captions timed to voice over or talking heads, this AI video app is insanely useful. 13. SyntheSys Pros Professional-level software Text-to-video capabilities Easy-to-use dashboard Cons More expensive than other text-to-video competitors download Using SyntheSys, you can get a lifelike avatar to present a video for you, generated from text, or create a natural-sounding voiceover track. They have a library of male and female avatars, and their technology allows them to use gestures, and natural voice tones, and speak in 145 languages. It’s a great tool for businesses, or anyone wanting to quickly create human-looking and -sounding content for commercial purposes. Whether you want to remain anonymous in your video clips or simply prefer to use someone else, AI video generators like this can help speed up your video creation process. What Is the Best AI Tool to Create Videos? It really depends on what kind of video you want to create, as there is quite a diverse range of AI video generators out there for different use cases. A cinematographer or videographer is more likely to need a tool with the power and scope of Topaz Video AI or Filmora. These can really help you dive deep into your footage and create something extraordinary for professional videos. Veed.io and InVid are best for beginners or those who perhaps need video clips for personal use or smaller scale production edits. Then there are the tools that are better for small businesses, YouTubers, or for commercial use. Descript is a great tool for Youtubers and podcasters to clean up their script and video, whereas Rawshorts will help you create an animation from your script. Those looking for AI to make them a voiceover or a complete presentation with a video or even an avatar will need something different again. Lumen 5, for example, will help you create high quality videos like these, while Synthesia or SyntheSys will generate a presentation for you with a human-ish presenter. How Does an AI Video Generator Work? The computer science behind the nuts and bolts of AI video generation is beyond both my human intelligence and the scope of this article. But in simple terms, what I understand of it is that machine-learning, the machine who has learned – which is a way of saying ‘an extremely powerful computer’ – knowing language on some robotic, mathematical level, scrapes the text and converts it into computer language: numbers. As computers understand everything in these terms, the combinations of numbers it receives from the text will correspond to number patterns within videos that express the same ideas as the text. They will match. And thus, a video is born. AI Video Editing Software FAQ s What is the best AI tool to create videos? For creating videos and ease of use, I’d have to say Lumen 5 for enabling you to quickly make a coherent video from text, or SyntheSys for creating realistic avatar-led video presentations. For specific edits, Topaz Video AI can’t be beaten. Is there an AI that edits videos? Yes. For example, Topaz AI and Filmora both help you edit your videos. You can use image stabilization, change the frame rate to create natural-looking slow-motion effects, upscale your videos, and do many more things that only a year or so ago, weren’t possible. How do I know if a video was created by AI? With many ai video editing tools, you simply won’t know, and that’s increasingly the case. The AI tools in Topaz Video AI are so powerful there’s really no way of telling if that slow-motion video was originally filmed at 60 fps or 24 fps. Likewise, the human avatar you can use to give your video presentations can use natural gestures, voice tones and intonation, which can make it very difficult to know if they’re real or not. Take for example, the Deep Fake video below: It’s certainly very hard to spot if the video creation was by AI or if it was actual footage. What AI video app is everyone using? Everyone is using all of them! All of the video apps in this article are being used by someone, somewhere to save time, to be more efficient, and to create something more compelling for a variety of use cases. If I had to choose one, I’d say it was Topaz Video AI, just because that’s the world I come from, and I know that it’s a very popular resource. For another use case, I’d find it hard to believe that most podcasters weren’t using Descript, as it’s such a powerful and powerfully specialised tool. Is Synthesia Ai video free to use? No, it’s not. Synthesia is only offered on a subscription basis. AI Video Editing Tools: Final Words So there you go. Honestly, even though I wrote this article myself, my mind is a little blown. AI is so new, but it can already do so much. It’s hard to know where it’s going to lead, but although that’s a little terrifying, it’s also exciting. Especially if you’re working with video. The AI video generators and tools available to you are so powerful that they will change the way you film and the way you think about filming. Cinematographers can make 8K cinematic, slow-motion, fully stabilized footage from 1080p footage filmed on an old camera. YouTubers can make video content of themselves with all their thinking words removed. Businesses can make promo videos, voiceovers or video presentations without hiring voiceover artists. It’s head-spinning! Doesn’t it make you want to create AI generated videos just to see how incredible the technology has become? If you’re not already using AI video generators in some form, it definitelt feels like right now is the time to start.

We took the AI Video Generators and ranked each of them based on multiple metrics. We used our incredibly sophisticated rating system.

https://dream-machine.lumalabs.ai/ https://hailuoai.video/ https://klingai.com/ https://haiper.ai/ 471 comments in this video we're going to take a look at the best AI video generators of 2025 I'll take a look at each tool talk about the pros and cons and rank them based on my super scientific french fry scale with curly fries being at the top and floppy crinkle cut fries being at the bottom let's get started the first tool that we're going to take a look at is Sora Sora is an incredible tool developed by open AI when it was announced in 2024 our Jaws dropped it looked incredible but now we have access to the tool and the question is does it stand up well let's find out so during this testing process I'm going to basically lay out a pretend scene so that we can have some variety to see the Cinematic potential of each AI video generator so we have this establishing shot here it's basically this kind of like abandoned factory setting we have this shot of this man looking over a computer he's just kind of worried right like something's going on and then we have the shot here of basically kind of a SWAT team maybe they're about to uh get to that researcher and attack him or something and so we're just building tension from just a few shots here and basically I'm going to use each one of those images to test the Cinematic potential of each of these generators so let's get to it to create a video and Sora all you have to do is go to their website click on the plus icon at the bottom and you can upload an image or a video which is pretty cool I'll use this video of a SWAT guy walking towards the door and we'll go ahead and click open once the image is loaded up now you can type in your prompt for our prompt I'll say a soldier walks down a hallway the camera tracks with the soldier as they approach a door handheld camera so the cool thing about using Sora is you have the ability to adjust quite a few different settings that aren't available other tools so for example you can select different aspect ratios we'll say 16 by9 of course uh you can also change the resolution so you can go all the way to 1080p which is great because most of the AI video generators can only do 720p you can also change the duration with some of the resolution settings you can go all the way up to 20 seconds it's pretty cool and then finally you can change the number of variations now with the 1080p version you can only create one variant but with 720 you can do two and with 480 you can do four which is really powerful so when you're ready to render go ahead and click create video I went ahead and rendered out the other two clips as well and combined them together into a scene with some sound effects let's go ahead and take a look copy that okay so as you can see it does look fairly cinematic the establishing shot looks pretty good I like the the dynamic movement I like that the clouds in the background are billowing and it really does feel like an establishing shot we also have the shot here of the soldier walking to the door which is pretty good I should note that we had to edit around a spot where the soldier in the background actually just kind of disappeared so that's just kind of part of working with Sora it sometimes takes your image that you uploaded and changes it a bit whenever it starts to render but you know looks pretty good the alarm you know kind of Clicks in a little late there but it's not bad and then finally we have the shot of the guy looking up and yeah there's like anxiety on his face looks like he's kind of in a hurry the camera Shake looks very very natural so I think it did a pretty good job now of course the problem with working with Sora is because it tends to be one of the more creative tools it can also get the strangest whenever you get into your generation so for example here's one clip that we had and you can see that the background character like disappears behind some random door and then that door closes and then he is approaching this door and same thing over here he just kind of covers up the guy and then a huge door appears which is uh just kind of weird so a lot of times when you're working inside of Sora that type of stuff can happen and it can really eat into your generation credits the strangeness that you get from Sora can be extra annoying sometimes because the tools also pretty expensive the most expensive version is $200 a month which is definitely cost prohibitive for a lot of Independent Artists on the positive side Sora makes it super easy to upload images and videos and you do have the ability to key frame your videos using a storyboard feature which is very helpful when Sora hits it hits incredibly well and the video quality can be incredible so it's definitely an amazing tool for getting really good results and the fact that you can render 1080p natively is really nice of course you probably want to upscale that using an outside tool but the fact that you can render the core video in 1080 is really awesome now the cont to using Sora is exactly like I said it's really expensive which is cost prohibitive for a lot of folks and then the fact that it can tend to cut to random shots and really just waste a lot of time that can be a challenge you also don't have the ability to upload photos of people if you aren't on the most expensive plan so again that makes it really challenging if you're an independent artist using the tool so for all of these AI video generators I'm going to rate them based on three categories the first is realism the second is camera and character physics and the third is workflow and ease of use so for realism inside of Sora I would say eight out of 10 it does a really good job it's not perfect and even the best generations of Sora if you really begin to examine them there can be some strangeness that you begin to uncover but it does a really good job now for character and Camera physics I will say that because Sora can get really strange really quickly and it tends to want to change your scene again and again I have to give it just a 4 out of 10 and for workflow and ease of use I'm going to give it a 5 out of 10 because while the platform is incredibly easy to use and intuitive the fact is the content moderation filters are too extreme with Sora and it makes it really challenging when you're working on a film project so that gives Sora a total score of 17 out of 30 putting them into the sweet potato fry level next up we have Google vo so VO2 was announced recently and the quality of the results that we've seen from the tool are incredible let me show you how to use it so this is what VO2 looks like I'm in Early Access so this isn't publicly available so I'll move quickly here weird thing about using vo is the fact that you don't have the ability to upload your own images at this time you have to create the image on their platform and then you create the video so that can be really tricky especially if you're looking for character consistency lighting consistency color all of those things so you should definitely know about that limitation and it is going to make it incredibly hard to create films with the tool in its current capacity but that being said let me show you the workflow here so I have basically a prompt where I'm going to create an image of a soldier walking down the abandoned hallway let's go ahead and create that image okay we have an image here if you wanted to you could start over I'm just going to go ahead and move forward we'll go to motion here and I'm going to say a soldier walks down a hallway the camera tracks as the soldier approaches the door and we'll go ahead and create that video I did the same thing for the other three shots let's take a look at our result copy that it's pretty wild I mean the establishing shot looks great that shot with the SWAT guy looks amazing and then this is probably one of the more expressive AI videos that I've seen up to this point but the problem that I'm sure you're noticing here is the three shots feel completely different they feel like they're from three completely different films and really no matter how much prompting you do it's really tricky to get the consistency without more advanced tools for doing style consistency location characters all of those things so that's a huge limitation to using vo however the physics engine that's powering vo is probably the best out of any AI video generator so for overall realism I would say with vo 10 out of 10 it is the best AI video tool for creating realistic videos for character and Camera physics again I would say 10 out of 10 I think it does an amazing job not only with camera Shake tracking shots all of those things but also with the actual expression of the characters directing the movement all of those things come through when you're working with vo and it's incredible all of that being said for workflow and ease of use people really don't have access to vo right now so that's not very helpful and then it's also very tricky to work on a scaled up project inside of VO especially because you're going to want consistency you're going to want that film to feel like it lives in these same world and universe and that's just really tricky so that gives vo a score of 23 out of 30 and they are now in the waffle fry level all right good job moving on let's take a look at Runway Runway is an incredible company that really supports the AI film making community and they have a ton of tools outside of just AI generative video alone you can use runway for lip syncing in painting there's a ton of tools that are really interesting to create a video inside a Runway all you have to do is go to generative session and you can upload your image or video and of course we can type in a prompt here I'm just going to say camera tracking shot Soldier walks down the hallway and you can of course change the model that you're using gen 3 Alpha is their best model at the time and you can change it from 5 Seconds to 10 seconds we can just do 5 seconds for now and go ahead and click generate so let's watch your scene copy that okay so you can see there are things to like and also things not to like with this overall scene here uh so if we kind of go to the beginning here the first thing you're probably going to notice is a severe loss in resolution now it's really interesting because a lot of the AI video generators produce results that are around 720p but for some reason the Fidelity of the generations from Runway really don't look great A lot of times uh for example there's a lot of really fuzzy areas you see here with this establishing shot that if an audience was watching this they would really uh not be very forgiving uh for those uh changes in resolution there you also have some really weird physics so you see this character here he's kind of gliding in a weird way this guy in the background he looks pretty good although he's not in much of a hurry but that's okay uh but this guy he kind of seems like he's gliding and a bit like connected to the camera as opposed to his like natural footsteps so that's a little weird and then the final shot here of the guy looking up I I like that Dynamic camera movement obviously there's not a lot of expression on his face it is kind of flat so you'd probably need to use Runway act one to like get a little more expression there uh but it it did an okay job the thing to like about Runway is the fact that it's really quick you can generate like 20 video clips in the time it would take you to generate one inside of cing or minia Max and you also have the ability to use all of those features that I talked about that go Way Beyond just the video generation alone so I really recommend using Runway if you are a filmmaker but let's get to the score for overall realism with Runway I would say that it's kind of just a five out of 10 I was really thinking that the results would be better but it seems like the algorithm has really stagnated recently hope hopefully there will be new announcements soon but at this point it's really beginning to fall behind some of the competitors for character in camera physics again I have to give it a five out of 10 the characters inside of our scene some of them looked good others the physics just didn't look right and the overall camera movement just didn't really make a lot of sense especially with that second shot and for workflow and ease of use I'll say eight out of 10 giving Runway a total of 18 out of 30 putting them strongly inside of that sweet potato category next up we have Luma Luma dream machine released in summer 2024 and it really was one of the first AI video generators that existed in this kind of gen 3 era the results that we got from Luma far exceeded the other results that we were getting from other AI video generators but the question is how does the Luma hold up today Luma is incredibly easy to use all you have to do is click the plus icon on their website go to the image and upload load your image you also have the ability to set an inframe so you can interpolate between the first frame and the last frame and it'll basically animate between them which is pretty cool all we have to do is type in our prompt and go ahead and click render I put all the clips from Luma together let's go ahead and take a look copy that okay so as you can see it's not super real istic an audience would not fully buy the scenes that we're getting from Luma I do think the establishing shot looks pretty good but that second shot with the soldiers here I mean it just looks like this guy in the background is being the creepiest little creepy SWAT guy ever and this guy while the initial turn looks good it just it it's coming across a slow motion which a lot of the AI video generators will give you slow motion footage and that's not really helpful if you're working on a project that's supposed to have realistic Dynamic physics and then the final shot here of the guy his eyes looks weird it looks like he's like a weird skeleton guy uh I think was it X-Men where the guy like blinked in two different ways it kind of looks like he has like a weird blink going on right now so it really just did not do an amazing job so while Luma is fast and easy to use and their API is also incredibly quick the fact is that realism is really bad you tend to get a lot of slow motion video clips from Luma and the physics just aren't really that realistic so for overall realism I'm going to give Luma a two out of 10 for character in camera physics again a two out of 10 and then for workflow and ease of use I'm going to say five out of 10 the actual interface is incredibly easy to use but when you actually get into the resolution that you're getting from Luma the overall Fidelity the quality of the generations and then also just the feasibility of the tools that are there the first frame and last frame feature is great in theory in actuality it doesn't actually work out so good most of the time so I'm actually only going to give that a five out of 10 so that means that the total score for Luma is 9 out of 10 putting it in the steak fry category although some french fries with some A1 that would probably be pretty solid next up is minia Max also known as hilu it is a chinese-based video generator that popped up in 2024 and the results are pretty impressive let me show you how to use it to use Minimax all you have to do is go to the hilu AI video website and go ahead and click quick create from here you can drag in an image and we'll paste in our prompt and the cool thing is you do have the ability to generate up to three video clips at a time which is pretty cool and go ahead and click generate so let's watch back our results from Minimax copy [Music] that so as you can see there's some things to like and some things not to like about this the first is the overall movement of the camera especially on the establishing shot it's not super Dynamic and the things that should be moving for example the clouds in the background there's really just not a lot of movement it it's okay but it's not the best you also have the second shot here and let's just note this guy who is just being a like a sneak King over here he's just like sneaking around creeping in the weirdest possible way and I should also note that we prompted for the soldier to basically be walking towards the door and he really just kind of like checks his gun and like looks around there's really just not a lot of movement there so not the best result from that shot and then finally we have this shot here and you can see that the man he's kind of talking here I don't really know what he's saying we didn't prompt in for talking but for some reason Minimax really likes making everyone talk so again minia Max is incredibly easy to use and the physics are decent especially if you have shots that aren't getting enough movement from some of the other video platforms Minx tends to give you the most overall movement and so it can really just add life to your animation just think about it as H giving your subject some coffee that's kind of what you're doing whenever you use minia max now the con to using Minx is the fact that it the overall realism is just not amazing compared to the AI video generators that are now available it used to be amazing just a few months ago it really was one of the best tools but as it stands right now it's not giving us the best results and the overall resolution is also a bit lower from miniac so you're going to have to upres the result and then also probably do a little bit of sharpening because it does tend to be a little soft so for overall realism from minia Max I'm going to say seven out of 10 for character in camera physics we're going to do 6 out of 10 and for workflow and ease of use it's incredibly easy to use we're going to say8 out of 10 which gives Mini Max a score of 21 out of 30 and they are officially a sweet potato next up we have cing like minia Max clling is a Chinese video model but they have many more features that are interesting you have the ability to train models on someone's face so that you can have them in the video again and again there's a lot more control over the videos that you generate and there's just more settings that can adjust including negative prompting to get exactly what you're looking for to create a video inside of cing all you have to do is go to the AI videos button and you can drag and drop your image and I'm using the latest version of cing that's 1.6 again you type in a prompt you can also change the duration the number of generations and then also the creativity strength which is pretty cool and then they do have a spot down here to type in negative prompts so things like Blurry Distortion weird all of those words that you typically would want to include in a negative prompt you can paste down here and when you're ready of course you can click generate so let's take a look at the results here copy [Music] that okay I got to say I'm really impressed from the result from cling here I think that it really embodies a lot of the Cinematic Aesthetics and elements that I would want to see from a video generator for example if we go back to the beginning here you can see that the smoke is billowing from this Factory and we have that nice movement of the overall scene which is cool we also have this second clip here it's pretty interesting because you have the soldier that holds up the gun and then it rack focuses on this guy in the background and his movement if you compare that to some of the other tools the guy in the background's movement is very realistic it really looks like there's a lot of weight behind it steps obviously we'd probably want to prompt in a little more urgency from the way he's approaching that door but it is what we prompted and the actual added camera movement looks good and I should also note that on the edges here you're seeing some chromatic aberration it's taking on Lind Dynamics like that's really uh a very cinematic and uh a much more detailed result that we're getting from cing versus other tools like Luma you couldn't even begin to think about chromatic aberration like that because the resolution is already so soft that that's that's a something to focus on in the future whenever their model gets as good as clean and then we have the shot here of the guy anxiously looking at his computer and I should note that when we prompted in for you know someone anxiously at their computer the system actually understood what anxiety is when it's captured on camera there's usually a pushing in feels like the world is closing in around them and uh really the overall uh cinematic result helps to reinforce the story that we're trying to tell so it's kind of like having a bit of an AI Director of Photography helping you out during the production process here so for overall realism I would say eight out of 10 for cing it does a really good job most of the time character in character physics again I would say eight out of 10 and then for workflow and ease of use again eight out of 10 so eights across the board that gives cing a total of 24 out of 30 putting it in the waffle fry category and then finally we we have hyper 2.5 hyper is a super fast and easy tool to use but can it stand up to the other tools let's find out so I'm on Hyper's website and all you have to do is go to image to video and let's go ahead and upload our image so our image is uploaded and then we have our prompt here so you do have the ability to change the resolution if you want and also the duration up to 6 seconds long and go ahead and click create let's take a look at our final result [Music] here copy [Music] that okay so as you can see the result from hyper is not amazing the first shot is just incredibly static there's just no movement whatsoever the second shot I don't know what's happening this guy's not even moving and this guy the the weight behind the guy's steps is just strange he's like floating and then it just like randomly Zooms in for some reason at the end so no idea what's going on there and then finally we have the shot of the guy kind of rising up and I suppose it's okay the only problem is when he blinks it is like it's like too fast and too robotic it's like it didn't blink for enough frame so it looks like he's I don't know some sort of like robot character that's been programmed to Blink as opposed to a real uh video clip here so I just don't think it did an amazing job so while I definitely think hyper is a very fast and easy tool to use the truth is it's very unrealistic and the physics are honestly pretty bad at this point so for overall realism I'm going to give hyper a one out of 10 for character and Camera physics I'll give it a two out of 10 I think that last shot was okay but not the best and for workflow and ease of use I'm going to say two out of 10 mainly because the overall Fidelity and resolution of those final videos that you get they're not amazing and there's not a ton of advanced features on their platform so that gives hyper a total of five out of 30 putting it unfortunately in

BasedLabs AI 5. Synthesia.io Below you will find more tools and me using each tool and sharing my results and opinions. This article is supported by readers. If you choose to make a purchase using the links below, I might earn a small commission at no cost to you! 1. Colossyan AI 👉 Free trial and 10% off using code ARTTURI Colossyan is an AI video generation platform designed to simplify the process of creating professional videos. It caters to individual content creators, professionals, small teams, and large enterprises, offering a range of tools and features to enhance video production. Let’s see how it performs in my hands! Highlight Features Prompt to Video: Enables creating complete videos from a simple script written by the user. Custom Voice and Avatars: Offers the ability to create custom voices and avatars, including lite avatars for quick recording using a web camera. Avatar Conversations: Supports scenario-based training videos with multiple avatars per scene. Icon Library: Provides a collection of professionally crafted icons. Auto-Translations: Offers automatic translations for videos in different languages. Export Options: Allows exporting in various formats like MP3, SRT, and PDF. Enterprise Features: Includes SCORM export, enhanced security options like SAML/SSO, and collaboration tools. Comprehensive Free Trial: Offers a complete free to try most features for free without signing up. My Experience I extensively tested Colossyan and created some scenes to see how it performs. If you want to get a hunch without having to do anything, just preview one of the ready-made projects on the homepage. But I recommend giving it an actual try. You don’t even need an account to start using the tool which is unlike most tools on this list. Just open up the creator and start creating. Awesome! If you want a detailed guide, you can check the video Colossyan has created. They’ve used their tool to narrate that scene, pretty cool, isn’t it? I’ll share my experiences with the tool below. So first, you need to create the script for the video actor to play. I generated mine with ChatGPT. If you haven’t signed up, there are some heavy limits, though. Just sign up to get more characters to use. Then, it’s time to place the avatar in the right position. I like the ability to freely customize it. For example, you can have a full body shot or just a Bubble-like presentation. Then you can change the background or even place an image or video on it. This way you can make your video look exactly like you want to. The customizations don’t stop at the character. You can do editing on your slides. For example, here I’ve changed the slide background to something nicer: To make the presentation more visually pleasing, you can always add those shapes and other elements to it. Heck, you can even play a song in the background. To this point, I’ve just edited the opening slide and script for the video. To make the video more interesting, you should add more slides to it. This is easy on Colossyan. Just click add more to add more slides and scenes to your presentation. This opens up a scene options view from where you can pick different types of scenes for your project. For example, on this one, I’m adding a guest speaker on the video side by side with my main avatar: Then, you can do the same customizations for the guest avatar as you’ve done with the main one, such as tweak the script. change position, and so on. The only downside I found was that sometimes the software gives me an unexpected error. This is a bit frustrating as you can’t tell what’s causing it. But luckily, you can always save and refresh. Or if you’re stuck, the team will help you resolve any issues right away. Other than that, what a journey! This tool lets you create amazing videos and presentations with AI. Notice how I haven’t even signed up at this point. Yet I was able to create a comprehensive video with all sorts of customizations and perks along the way! You can even try it for free, so why not give it a shot? I cannot recommend this enough. Pros Versatile: Suitable for individuals to large enterprises. The tool can create simple explainer videos as well as more detailed full-on presentations with guests etc. Customization: Extensive options for custom voices, avatars, and imagery. The tool doesn’t just create a video. In addition, you can use it to create a full presentation from start to finish with all the customizations you’ll ever need. Multilingual Support: Offers over 70 languages and auto-translation features. User-Friendly: Simplifies complex video production tasks and more importantly, saves a boatload of time and money. Amazing Free Trial: You can test the tool extensively without even signing up for free. This is unlike most AI video makers on the market. Cons Learning Curve: The tool has all the bells and whistles, so it can take a bit longer to learn how to use it than your average AI video tool. Don’t know if it’s a con, though. Occasional Slowness. I tried choosing templates and the UI froze for a couple of seconds. Nothing too serious but can be a bit confusing. Pricing: May be expensive for individuals or small teams, especially for high-end features. Pricing Starter: $19 per month (billed annually). Pro: $61 per month (billed annually). Enterprise Plan: Custom pricing for extensive features and unlimited video creation. Free Trial: Free, with limited features and video creation minutes. Get 10% off with code ARTTURI Bottom Line Colossyan is the most comprehensive AI video generation tool on the market. It offers a broad range of features suitable for various users. I also had a chat with their team and founders. They’re such a helpful bunch of people! Colossyan’s strength lies in its customization options and ease of use. This in my opinion makes it a valuable tool for creators looking to create high-quality videos with minimal effort and cost. I’d give it a shot! You can try it for free with this link.

I Tried 15 AI Headshot Generators. Here’s My Verdict ---------------------------------------------------- ### I spent $2,000 to find the best AI headshot generator on the market. In this post, I will show you my results medium.com 2. HeyGen AI HeyGen is one of the most impressive uses of AI video I’ve ever seen. This tool allows you to create a perfect clone of yourself. One that talks like you and acts like you. It even speaks in different languages. Here’s how my AI version compares to the real me. You can watch a short video of myself using the tool and what it’s capable of here: Try HeyGen for Free Key Features Let’s take a short look at the features of HeyGen. AI Video Creation: HeyGen turns text into presentation-style videos. Customizable AI Avatars: HeyGen has 100+ AI avatars you can customize. Cloning. This tool allows you to clone yourself with AI and make it speak any language. Templates: HeyGen comes with templates for marketing, presentations, and more. LLM Integration: HeyGen has a ChatGPT integration you can use for scripting. This smoothens the process of video creation for you. Plus a lot more. My Experience Let me show you what the tool did for me. Although there are lots of features, I think the best way to demonstrate this one is by showing how AI cloning works. Feel free to follow along or just read along. If you want to create an avatar for yourself, sign up here. You can skip the introduction videos and instructions as I will show you everything here. Next, let’s create an AI clone for you. Go to the home view (where you’ll land automatically.) Then click on “Create Instant Avatar:” Next, it’s time to submit a video of yourself. This is so the AI can learn how you sound and move. Make sure that these are good in your video: Good lighting Quiet space Be as natural as you can Make gestures below your chest Have a longer pause between each sentence You can use your smart device's camera Look at the camera as you speak Film for 2–5 minutes. You can speak in any language. Then just submit your clip to HeyGen. It can take a while for the AI to process. This takes about 5–10 minutes. You can exit the screen. HeyGen will let you know when the AI clone has been created via email. Once the AI avatar is ready, it appears in the “My Avatar” section in the main view of HeyGen. Just click on it! It will greet you :) Impressive, isn’t it? But let’s start using it! Go to the main view of HeyGen, and click on “Create with AI Studio.” Then, add a script from the left-hand side. This can be any text that you want the AI to speak on your behalf (in your character.) You can use AI to generate the script too! Remember to include your avatar in the scene. To do this, click on the “Avatar” on the left and click on your image to use your AI clone. Unfortunately, you cannot preview your video before the AI has created it. (You can preview your voice, though.) Also, it takes a while (and costs a bit) to create the video, so make sure that before you generate these things are in place: Your AI avatar is in use and is added to the blank canvas (as I mentioned before) Your voice clone is activated. Click your avatar and choose your voice if it’s not already. At this point, you can change your language if you want to! Then hit the “Submit” button to generate the video. This will send your script to HeyGen AI which will then use your avatar to render a video. This takes 5–10 minutes again. Once the video is ready, HeyGen sends you a message through email. Enjoy! Pros Realistic AI. Oh my, how realistic those AI speakers are—needless to mention how good the AI clone was. Wow! No useless features to make the tool look more impressive. It’s straight to the point, simple, and powerful! Easy to use—although it takes a bit time to render the videos and upload your video. There’s a free trial you can use. Not on cloning, though :( Try HeyGen for Free! Cons Expensive for individuals. I calculated that at the moment a 10-minute video with my AI clone costs about $40. Slow. It took about 30 minutes from sign-up to create my clone that spoke a 30-second script. Impractical. Although it’s powerful, I cannot see myself using it because it takes time and costs a lot. It’s easier for me to just film those videos myself. Pricing Free: $0 Creator: $24/mo Team: $120/mo Enterprise: Contact sales Bottom Line I love HeyGen. The cloning thing is perhaps the most impressive use of AI I’ve seen. Although it’s a bit slow and impractical, it’s scary good, and accurate. I’d definitely give it a try. If you’re shy in front of a camera or if you’ve always wanted to speak different languages, this is the tool for you. You can generate realistic presentations with the pre-built actors too! Try HeyGen for Free 3. DeepBrain AI Best Overall — Start a Free Trial Using This Link! DeepBrain AI is one of the best AI video-generating tools out there! You can use this tool to generate many types of videos from advertisements to greetings to sales pitches. No matter what business/individual use you have in your mind, this tool has got your back. DeepBrain AI is a simple text-to-video generator that uses the latest advancements in AI. Although the tool is already impressive, thanks to the massive developments in AI, it will probably improve. In my eyes, this tool could be one of the go-to AI video generators of the future. My Experience with Deepbrain AI DeepBrain has a ton of cool presets to use. You can choose from a presentation to a sales pitch to a greeting. Many options give me a great variety of choices for different use cases. Here’s an example presentation I’m generating on DeepBrain AI: The UI flows smoothly, although there is a small lag when moving from one scene to another. Also, at first, it wasn’t quite clear to me how you insert the script but once I realized how it’s done it became super easy to use the tool. This is a test of using the presentation feature of DeepBrain AI. This tool converts text to speech in a video format that looks nice and professional. One cool feature of this tool is you don’t even need to create the scripts yourself — you can use AI to do that. For example, here I ask AI to generate a sales pitch about what types of houses to live in: Once you’ve done this step, you can just insert the AI-generated text into the script. Once this is done, the video reads the generated text. Pretty sleek, isn’t it? This is where AI is taking us :) If you’re not happy with the presets, you can always customize or edit things around, such as: Voice actor Background Fonts and colors Add music and sound effects Notice that this tool doesn’t generate arbitrary videos (at least not yet), but instead, you can generate those awesome presentation videos where a person speaks your text out. BTW, this applies to all the AI video-generating tools. This will likely change drastically in the next 2–3 years. Speaking of features, let’s take a closer look at what DeepBrain AI comes with. Key Features Supports a ton of languages GPT-powered text generator for generating scenes A ton of AI voice actors Accurate text-to-video Realistic videos and voice actors Support for multiple use cases Affordable pricing 24/7 support chat Pricing DeepBrain has three pricing plans: $29/month for basic use Custom for power users and enterprises (contact the sales team) Free trial with the link below Try DeepBrain AI 4. BasedLabs AI Try free with this link BasedLabs.ai is a platform focused on AI-generated images and video content. Unlike most video generators on this list, BasedLabs focuses on creating short videos about anything, not just presentations. For most visitors who aren’t looking for pitches and presentations, this is the best video maker tool online. It offers a variety of tools and features for generating and exploring AI-generated visual content. Let’s see how this tool performs. Key Features AI tools for visual content creation Intuitive interface A community for sharing and exploring content 👉 Get 10% off all plans with code ARTTURI My Experience It’s been all hype and promises for now. But let’s see how the tool actually performs. I will show you how I was able to generate these two videos with the tool and assess the quality and overall process at the same. To start creating videos with AI, just hit the “Generate” button on the homepage. Then you need to create an account. I used Google to sign up to make it faster. I just gave it a generic name like “AIvideotester”: Once your account is created, you can start making videos with AI. If you don’t have an input image, you can use AI to generate images in BasedLabs. For example, here I create one. Just a simple prompt will do, no need to make it this complex if you don’t want to. Then it takes about 15 seconds to generate those images. And here’s the resulting image set: I chose the top-most one. I think it looks good for now. Then it’s time to start converting the image to a video. Just hit next. This opens up the video view. For now, you can just use a basic motion slider to increase/decrease movement in the video. There’s no input for the video creator to tell what to do in the video. So you will need to let the AI do the work here. Just hit “Make Video” and it starts doing its magic. This took about 30 seconds for me. Don’t be confused if the loading bar sticks at 0% for about 10–20 seconds. That’s normal! After waiting for a while, here’s the result video: Pretty impressive, isn’t it? Although the video is short, this is something I made completely out of thin air in just 2 minutes or less. That’s awesome. This already gives you an idea of what the tool can do. But let me try another feature just to show how awesome it is. Let’s try to drop an image into the video editor and turn it into a video. Here’s an image from Finland that a photographer has taken. I want to turn this into a video. So here’s what I did. I dropped this image to the BasedLabs video generator view. Then it verified if I wanted to proceed with this image: Once again, now there are no controls for me to use. So this image is automatically converted to a video by the AI now. It took about 30–40 seconds this time. Here’s the result: Just wow! The clouds look very realistic and the movement looks smooth and real. I’m shocked at how well this tool performed. Of course, this clip is still short and for example, the water is still. But that’s nonetheless very impressive. I can just imagine what this tool can do in a year or two… 👉 Get 10% off all plans with code ARTTURI Pros User-friendly and very easy to use Free trial to experiment with different videos and creations High-quality AI-generated videos Community from which you can draw inspiration Amazing results (although short) Cons Limitations in the toolset, for example, you cannot tell what to do in the video Not for long-form videos, those are just 1–2 seconds in length. Some performance issues as I had to wait almost a minute for a short clip to generate Some videos look unrealistic and robotic Pricing Creator: $12/mo Pro: $28/mo 👉 Get 10% off all plans with code ARTTURI Bottom Line BasedLabs is awesome. Better yet, it’s free to try. It’s the first tool that I encountered that makes these short AI clips that people have been craving for for a long time now. The tool was awesome. It was relatively quick, the results were good (although short), and the quality was amazing. Oh, and by the way, you can also create images with this one. If you don’t have an input image, you can generate one with BasedLabs and then turn it into a video. Try Basedlabs for FREE 5.

Not only is it a great tool for generating videos, but it offers you a good video editor solution for the post-production phase. This way you can make your generated videos even better. There are multiple styles of videos you can choose from. For example, you can use Synthesia to generate videos for product demos, marketing, greetings, and much more. Notice that Synthesia is by no means restricted to English content only. The tool supports 60+ languages which makes it a great choice for someone to create videos for clients in pretty much any country. Synthesia works for all kinds of businesses.

To create a video, all you need to do is enter a text input that will be spoken on the video. Also, you need to choose the style of the video and the AI speaker for it. 👉 Activate your free trial My Experience with Synthesia Here’s an example video I just generated to praise my imaginary colleague: It was pretty simple to create a video with Synthesia for free. All I had to do was enter a short text prompt to view and choose the type of video to generate. This quite literally took 30 seconds to do. Once you have requested Synthesia to generate a free video, you need to wait for a minute or two. To access the video, you need to enter your email address where the new video will be sent after it has been completed. Of course, the video content must be appropriate. Otherwise, Synthesia won’t generate it for you. So please, only use it professionally! After a couple of minutes of waiting, Synthesia sent me an email with the video. Not only could I watch the video but also share it here on this blog post. Synthesia makes it easy to share your videos on social platforms and blog posts if you wish. I think using Synthesia is seamless and the free trial version is worth trying.

InVideo.io InVideo offers a powerful AI for generating videos for marketing and explanations. To create with InVideo, you don’t need to have a video creation or video editing background. The tool intelligently splits your input script into logical parts. Besides, the tool chooses matching visuals to the scenes that you can adjust. There are lots of templates, workflows, and assets to choose from. With InVideo, you can create high-quality videos to meet your professional needs. One thing I like about this solution is you can try InVideo for free. Of course, there will be a watermark on the exported video. But if you like the quality of the videos, you can consider subscribing to a paid plan to get rid of the watermarks. My Experience with InVideo Here is an example video I generated with InVideo in 2 minutes. ✅ I’m amazed by the accuracy of the InVideo video visuals. The tool picked these automatically without my input! I’m talking about AI in the video, and the tool chose visuals about AI and human evolution towards AI. Let me briefly show you my experience with InVideo. You can try InVideo for free. Before creating your first clip, you need to sign up for a free trial and answer a quick quiz. For me, the sign-up took about a minute among the quiz. Once you’ve signed up, the video editor pops up. From the video editor view, you can choose a workflow that best meets your demand. The options are: Templates Text-to-video Stock media Editor To test the InVideo, I picked Text-to-Video. Then you can enter the text script into the tool and it will convert it into a video. I wrote a small script for my brand new video about AI video generation and how it will disrupt the video industry. The tool intelligently splits the text input into different scenes. For example, one of my paragraphs was too long to fit one scene. The tool resolved this by splitting it into two sections. You can make adjustments yourself if you don’t like the automated edits made by InVideo. Once the video is complete, you can download and share it. For me, it took about 30 seconds to render my short 30-second clip or so. The free version has watermarks on it. To get rid of the watermarks, you need to subscribe to a paid plan. Overall the experience with InVideo is great. It didn’t take longer than 2 minutes to produce a nice 30-second clip that normally would take me 15–30 minutes to produce. Key Features Let’s take a look at some of the most notable features of InVideo. AI-powered video generation capabilities with great automated decision-making make the videos look professional.
