Adobe Premiere Pro | Best AI Software to Create Videos Pros Best all round video editor Cloud-syncing for backups Free trial available Colour matching speeds up edits Auto reframing useful for social media Cons Subscription based model Steep learning curve Requires high computer specs download Not only is Premiere Pro my pick of the best video editing software, but it’s now my favourite AI video app too. With the latest version you can download using the button above, you’ll get some crazy powerful AI tools to make creating high quality videos a cinch.

Overall, even if you didn’t use any of the AI video features in Premiere Pro, you’d still be left with the top editing software of the year – start by downloading a free trial and see what you think. How to Download Adobe Premiere Pro 2. Topaz Video AI | Photography AI Tool for Enlargements Pros Extremely powerful video editing tool Free trial available Upscaling, image stabilization, and slow-motion capabilities Can generate multiple previews at the same time Cons Relatively expensive download Simply put, Topaz Video AI is a standalone desktop video editing application that makes your videos look better. Drag and drop your video into the software, select from the menu of presets, and let the deep-learning robot minds cast their magic. You can even upscale your footage. That means that all your grainy, blurry old 1080p film can now be enhanced to 4K or 8K. You can also render your footage in slow motion which can be handy if you forgot to shoot in the correct frame rate: Let’s say you shot at 24 fps – give Topaz that video and the AI will create new frames between the actual frames you shot, so your 24 fps could become 60 fps, and you can slow it right down. The program also has two types of image stabilization to help you produce engaging videos: The first crops into your footage to create this effect, and the other is image-aware and will fill in the missing gaps around the edges of your video so that the field of view doesn’t change. With this powerful AI video editing software, you can tweak just about any setting you’d want to use to enhance the quality of your footage – the frame rate, the amount of grain, or the sharpness. Not only that, you can create your own custom presets for adding to future videos. Topaz Video AI Review 3. Filmora | Affordable AI Video Maker Pros Simple, easy-to-use interface Good suite of AI tools Subscription or perpetual license options Affordable Cons Doesn’t have the slick feel of some competitors download As well as giving you all the tools you’d expect from a video editing suite, for adding templates, titles and subtitles, and for making adjustments to the video and audio tracks, Filmora also has some fantastic AI tools. You can adjust your footage’s aspect ratio, upscale video resolution from lowly 1080p to, for example, 4K, and change your frame rate to make fast video slow and slow video fast. Other AI tools include their chroma key, which enables you to remove specific background colours. This is especially useful for green screen footage, to make the background transparent so that you can add other media. AI portrait does essentially the same thing and removes even complex backgrounds from behind subjects. Added to that, Filmora has AI image stabilization, and lens correction to help you sort out any irritating distortion your lens might have gifted you. In general, Filmora is my recommended video editing software for beginners – it may not have every feature of Final Cut or Adobe Premiere for video creation, but for the price, it can’t be beaten.

Veed.io Pros Good for beginners Easy to learn Range of templates and tools Speech to subtitles feature Cons Some features are only available in higher price plans download One of the best AI video editing options for beginners is Veed.io. It has an extremely simple and easy-to-learn interface, but despite this, it still packs a punch. Veed.io has many of the features of the previous two video editing software programs in this article. With it, you can change the frame rate to speed up or slow down your footage, and you can also remove backgrounds with a single click. Something it’s well-known for is its AI-powered speech to subtitles tool, which accurately transcribes in moments, saving you potential hours of work. And there’s also the text-to-speech feature. With this, you can give your video a voiceover without manually recording your own voice, and you can choose from a range of voice profiles and accents. I’ve included Veed in this list of the best AI video software because I’ve spent many a day transcribing videos manually, and know how frustrating it can be. What is an AI camera? 7. Synthesia Pros Easy way to make presentations Powerful, simple-to-use tool Impressive range of features Affordable AI video creation platform Cons Limited, specialized use case download Synthesia specializes in speech-to-video creation using artificial intelligence to create engaging videos. They give you a range of templates and amazingly lifelike avatars which you can make say anything you want – ideal for creating YouTube videos you don’t want to appear in. Whatever you type, they can say in a range of accents, using diction and, in the most recent iteration, gestures. It’s spooky how realistic it all sounds – even if you don’t have any staff or any desire to appear in YouTube videos yourself, Synthesia can help with your video creation. You can add a background behind your avatar, add a music track, and use a range of other tools to make the video your own. How can AI benefit photography? 8. InVideo Pros Easy to use and learn Simple but powerful Simple, two-tier pricing Article-to-text feature Cons Only the highest membership tiers have access to the best video and image libraries download This software shares a lot in look and feel with Veed.io. It has a super-simple, clean interface that is very easy to navigate. It also has a vast bank of templates for a range of needs from sports to marketing, to help you kick things off. One of its most impressive features is the AI-powered article-to-text tool. With this, you can copy and paste an article into the tool, and it will scrape the text to extract the main ideas, and then create concise content around these. It can create a unique video from an article too. Let’s say I wanted to make a video from this article – I could just paste the URL into InVid, and the video would be created for me! This makes it the best AI video tool for batch creating multiple clips from a blog. Like Veed.io, InVideo also offers automated text-to-speech. No more need to record voiceovers, all thanks to the power of video artificial intelligence. What’s the best mobile video editing app for iPhone and Android? 9. Descript Pros Unique product Powerful editing tools Edit video with text Slick interface Cons It’s not for everyone, but that’s just me trying to find something to say download One for the podcasters. A powerful speech-to-text editor that will save you time by allowing you to edit automatically transcribed text and video voiceover at the same time. Simply put, you can record yourself, your voice and your face, and Descript uses AI to make a video and a written script from this. You can then edit that script, for example shortening long pauses in your speech, removing filler and thinking words, or removing whole phrases. Whatever you remove is also removed from the recorded footage, thereby seamlessly editing your video with AI. The software also allows you to sync your visuals with specific moments in the script, and there’s a toolbar to help you collaborate on a project with a team. Add to that powerful video editing features such as the ability to grade colours, remove backgrounds, and beef up sound quality, and you have yourself a winner. 10. FlexClip Pros Interface good for beginners Great template and stock library AI speech to text AI text to speech Cons Limited tools for pros Only exports to 1080p download This software is rich in templates and has an impressive amount of stock imagery and video you can use to inspire or pad out your videos. The interface is very simple – it’s the best AI video editing software I tested for beginners, who will get the hang of it very easily. Once you have your footage uploaded, you have the standard range of editing tools to work with, to make your video look exactly as you want it to. You can adjust the brightness, and the speed, you can flip it around, trim it, or use FlexClip’s range of filters to automatically adjust the colours. In terms of AI video creation features, there’s speech-to-text, which can quickly generate subtitles, and text-to-speech, which can help you make natural-sounding voiceovers. 11. Rawshorts Pros Good library of resources Timesaver for small businesses Text to animation Automatic voice generator Cons Free version is quite limited download This powerful tool is specifically for people who want to make video animations. Write a script (or get ChatGPT to do that for you!) and paste it into the program. The software will then generate a voiceover, scrape your text for the main ideas, and then use those to make a coherent, animated storyboard. You’ve probably seen these types of animations used on software product sales pages to explain how to use the software. This type of animation can cost thousands of dollars to produce (not to mention countless hours of drawing), but now thanks to AI, you can do it for a fraction of the time and cost. If you need to create videos for small businesses, you can imagine how much easier this clever AI video tool can make your work. 12. Lumen 5 Pros Quick and easy tool to use Text to video Good range of editing tools Cons Free version is very limited download This nifty AI video editing softwa re software helps you automatically transform blog posts, Zoom calls, or articles, into video. It’s super easy to do. For example, just paste your blog article URL into the program, and it will extract the key points to match them with relevant text and video. From there, you can tweak what you want, edit text, and swap out photos and videos from Lumen 5’s online library. You can also make talking head videos and enhance your videos with callouts and cutaways. My favourite feature is the ability to select words in the transcript (auto-generated by AI, of course!), then match the visuals directly to the timing of the audio. For video creation for social media, which often needs captions timed to voice over or talking heads, this AI video app is insanely useful. 13. SyntheSys Pros Professional-level software Text-to-video capabilities Easy-to-use dashboard Cons More expensive than other text-to-video competitors download Using SyntheSys, you can get a lifelike avatar to present a video for you, generated from text, or create a natural-sounding voiceover track. They have a library of male and female avatars, and their technology allows them to use gestures, and natural voice tones, and speak in 145 languages. It’s a great tool for businesses, or anyone wanting to quickly create human-looking and -sounding content for commercial purposes. Whether you want to remain anonymous in your video clips or simply prefer to use someone else, AI video generators like this can help speed up your video creation process. What Is the Best AI Tool to Create Videos? It really depends on what kind of video you want to create, as there is quite a diverse range of AI video generators out there for different use cases. A cinematographer or videographer is more likely to need a tool with the power and scope of Topaz Video AI or Filmora. These can really help you dive deep into your footage and create something extraordinary for professional videos. Veed.io and InVid are best for beginners or those who perhaps need video clips for personal use or smaller scale production edits. Then there are the tools that are better for small businesses, YouTubers, or for commercial use. Descript is a great tool for Youtubers and podcasters to clean up their script and video, whereas Rawshorts will help you create an animation from your script. Those looking for AI to make them a voiceover or a complete presentation with a video or even an avatar will need something different again. Lumen 5, for example, will help you create high quality videos like these, while Synthesia or SyntheSys will generate a presentation for you with a human-ish presenter. How Does an AI Video Generator Work? The computer science behind the nuts and bolts of AI video generation is beyond both my human intelligence and the scope of this article. But in simple terms, what I understand of it is that machine-learning, the machine who has learned – which is a way of saying ‘an extremely powerful computer’ – knowing language on some robotic, mathematical level, scrapes the text and converts it into computer language: numbers. As computers understand everything in these terms, the combinations of numbers it receives from the text will correspond to number patterns within videos that express the same ideas as the text. They will match. And thus, a video is born. AI Video Editing Software FAQ s What is the best AI tool to create videos? For creating videos and ease of use, I’d have to say Lumen 5 for enabling you to quickly make a coherent video from text, or SyntheSys for creating realistic avatar-led video presentations. For specific edits, Topaz Video AI can’t be beaten. Is there an AI that edits videos? Yes. For example, Topaz AI and Filmora both help you edit your videos. You can use image stabilization, change the frame rate to create natural-looking slow-motion effects, upscale your videos, and do many more things that only a year or so ago, weren’t possible. How do I know if a video was created by AI? With many ai video editing tools, you simply won’t know, and that’s increasingly the case. The AI tools in Topaz Video AI are so powerful there’s really no way of telling if that slow-motion video was originally filmed at 60 fps or 24 fps. Likewise, the human avatar you can use to give your video presentations can use natural gestures, voice tones and intonation, which can make it very difficult to know if they’re real or not. Take for example, the Deep Fake video below: It’s certainly very hard to spot if the video creation was by AI or if it was actual footage. What AI video app is everyone using? Everyone is using all of them! All of the video apps in this article are being used by someone, somewhere to save time, to be more efficient, and to create something more compelling for a variety of use cases. If I had to choose one, I’d say it was Topaz Video AI, just because that’s the world I come from, and I know that it’s a very popular resource. For another use case, I’d find it hard to believe that most podcasters weren’t using Descript, as it’s such a powerful and powerfully specialised tool. Is Synthesia Ai video free to use? No, it’s not. Synthesia is only offered on a subscription basis. AI Video Editing Tools: Final Words So there you go. Honestly, even though I wrote this article myself, my mind is a little blown. AI is so new, but it can already do so much. It’s hard to know where it’s going to lead, but although that’s a little terrifying, it’s also exciting. Especially if you’re working with video. The AI video generators and tools available to you are so powerful that they will change the way you film and the way you think about filming. Cinematographers can make 8K cinematic, slow-motion, fully stabilized footage from 1080p footage filmed on an old camera. YouTubers can make video content of themselves with all their thinking words removed. Businesses can make promo videos, voiceovers or video presentations without hiring voiceover artists. It’s head-spinning! Doesn’t it make you want to create AI generated videos just to see how incredible the technology has become? If you’re not already using AI video generators in some form, it definitelt feels like right now is the time to start.

We took the AI Video Generators and ranked each of them based on multiple metrics. We used our incredibly sophisticated rating system.

https://dream-machine.lumalabs.ai/ https://hailuoai.video/ https://klingai.com/ https://haiper.ai/ 471 comments in this video we're going to take a look at the best AI video generators of 2025 I'll take a look at each tool talk about the pros and cons and rank them based on my super scientific french fry scale with curly fries being at the top and floppy crinkle cut fries being at the bottom let's get started the first tool that we're going to take a look at is Sora Sora is an incredible tool developed by open AI when it was announced in 2024 our Jaws dropped it looked incredible but now we have access to the tool and the question is does it stand up well let's find out so during this testing process I'm going to basically lay out a pretend scene so that we can have some variety to see the Cinematic potential of each AI video generator so we have this establishing shot here it's basically this kind of like abandoned factory setting we have this shot of this man looking over a computer he's just kind of worried right like something's going on and then we have the shot here of basically kind of a SWAT team maybe they're about to uh get to that researcher and attack him or something and so we're just building tension from just a few shots here and basically I'm going to use each one of those images to test the Cinematic potential of each of these generators so let's get to it to create a video and Sora all you have to do is go to their website click on the plus icon at the bottom and you can upload an image or a video which is pretty cool I'll use this video of a SWAT guy walking towards the door and we'll go ahead and click open once the image is loaded up now you can type in your prompt for our prompt I'll say a soldier walks down a hallway the camera tracks with the soldier as they approach a door handheld camera so the cool thing about using Sora is you have the ability to adjust quite a few different settings that aren't available other tools so for example you can select different aspect ratios we'll say 16 by9 of course uh you can also change the resolution so you can go all the way to 1080p which is great because most of the AI video generators can only do 720p you can also change the duration with some of the resolution settings you can go all the way up to 20 seconds it's pretty cool and then finally you can change the number of variations now with the 1080p version you can only create one variant but with 720 you can do two and with 480 you can do four which is really powerful so when you're ready to render go ahead and click create video I went ahead and rendered out the other two clips as well and combined them together into a scene with some sound effects let's go ahead and take a look copy that okay so as you can see it does look fairly cinematic the establishing shot looks pretty good I like the the dynamic movement I like that the clouds in the background are billowing and it really does feel like an establishing shot we also have the shot here of the soldier walking to the door which is pretty good I should note that we had to edit around a spot where the soldier in the background actually just kind of disappeared so that's just kind of part of working with Sora it sometimes takes your image that you uploaded and changes it a bit whenever it starts to render but you know looks pretty good the alarm you know kind of Clicks in a little late there but it's not bad and then finally we have the shot of the guy looking up and yeah there's like anxiety on his face looks like he's kind of in a hurry the camera Shake looks very very natural so I think it did a pretty good job now of course the problem with working with Sora is because it tends to be one of the more creative tools it can also get the strangest whenever you get into your generation so for example here's one clip that we had and you can see that the background character like disappears behind some random door and then that door closes and then he is approaching this door and same thing over here he just kind of covers up the guy and then a huge door appears which is uh just kind of weird so a lot of times when you're working inside of Sora that type of stuff can happen and it can really eat into your generation credits the strangeness that you get from Sora can be extra annoying sometimes because the tools also pretty expensive the most expensive version is $200 a month which is definitely cost prohibitive for a lot of Independent Artists on the positive side Sora makes it super easy to upload images and videos and you do have the ability to key frame your videos using a storyboard feature which is very helpful when Sora hits it hits incredibly well and the video quality can be incredible so it's definitely an amazing tool for getting really good results and the fact that you can render 1080p natively is really nice of course you probably want to upscale that using an outside tool but the fact that you can render the core video in 1080 is really awesome now the cont to using Sora is exactly like I said it's really expensive which is cost prohibitive for a lot of folks and then the fact that it can tend to cut to random shots and really just waste a lot of time that can be a challenge you also don't have the ability to upload photos of people if you aren't on the most expensive plan so again that makes it really challenging if you're an independent artist using the tool so for all of these AI video generators I'm going to rate them based on three categories the first is realism the second is camera and character physics and the third is workflow and ease of use so for realism inside of Sora I would say eight out of 10 it does a really good job it's not perfect and even the best generations of Sora if you really begin to examine them there can be some strangeness that you begin to uncover but it does a really good job now for character and Camera physics I will say that because Sora can get really strange really quickly and it tends to want to change your scene again and again I have to give it just a 4 out of 10 and for workflow and ease of use I'm going to give it a 5 out of 10 because while the platform is incredibly easy to use and intuitive the fact is the content moderation filters are too extreme with Sora and it makes it really challenging when you're working on a film project so that gives Sora a total score of 17 out of 30 putting them into the sweet potato fry level next up we have Google vo so VO2 was announced recently and the quality of the results that we've seen from the tool are incredible let me show you how to use it so this is what VO2 looks like I'm in Early Access so this isn't publicly available so I'll move quickly here weird thing about using vo is the fact that you don't have the ability to upload your own images at this time you have to create the image on their platform and then you create the video so that can be really tricky especially if you're looking for character consistency lighting consistency color all of those things so you should definitely know about that limitation and it is going to make it incredibly hard to create films with the tool in its current capacity but that being said let me show you the workflow here so I have basically a prompt where I'm going to create an image of a soldier walking down the abandoned hallway let's go ahead and create that image okay we have an image here if you wanted to you could start over I'm just going to go ahead and move forward we'll go to motion here and I'm going to say a soldier walks down a hallway the camera tracks as the soldier approaches the door and we'll go ahead and create that video I did the same thing for the other three shots let's take a look at our result copy that it's pretty wild I mean the establishing shot looks great that shot with the SWAT guy looks amazing and then this is probably one of the more expressive AI videos that I've seen up to this point but the problem that I'm sure you're noticing here is the three shots feel completely different they feel like they're from three completely different films and really no matter how much prompting you do it's really tricky to get the consistency without more advanced tools for doing style consistency location characters all of those things so that's a huge limitation to using vo however the physics engine that's powering vo is probably the best out of any AI video generator so for overall realism I would say with vo 10 out of 10 it is the best AI video tool for creating realistic videos for character and Camera physics again I would say 10 out of 10 I think it does an amazing job not only with camera Shake tracking shots all of those things but also with the actual expression of the characters directing the movement all of those things come through when you're working with vo and it's incredible all of that being said for workflow and ease of use people really don't have access to vo right now so that's not very helpful and then it's also very tricky to work on a scaled up project inside of VO especially because you're going to want consistency you're going to want that film to feel like it lives in these same world and universe and that's just really tricky so that gives vo a score of 23 out of 30 and they are now in the waffle fry level all right good job moving on let's take a look at Runway Runway is an incredible company that really supports the AI film making community and they have a ton of tools outside of just AI generative video alone you can use runway for lip syncing in painting there's a ton of tools that are really interesting to create a video inside a Runway all you have to do is go to generative session and you can upload your image or video and of course we can type in a prompt here I'm just going to say camera tracking shot Soldier walks down the hallway and you can of course change the model that you're using gen 3 Alpha is their best model at the time and you can change it from 5 Seconds to 10 seconds we can just do 5 seconds for now and go ahead and click generate so let's watch your scene copy that okay so you can see there are things to like and also things not to like with this overall scene here uh so if we kind of go to the beginning here the first thing you're probably going to notice is a severe loss in resolution now it's really interesting because a lot of the AI video generators produce results that are around 720p but for some reason the Fidelity of the generations from Runway really don't look great A lot of times uh for example there's a lot of really fuzzy areas you see here with this establishing shot that if an audience was watching this they would really uh not be very forgiving uh for those uh changes in resolution there you also have some really weird physics so you see this character here he's kind of gliding in a weird way this guy in the background he looks pretty good although he's not in much of a hurry but that's okay uh but this guy he kind of seems like he's gliding and a bit like connected to the camera as opposed to his like natural footsteps so that's a little weird and then the final shot here of the guy looking up I I like that Dynamic camera movement obviously there's not a lot of expression on his face it is kind of flat so you'd probably need to use Runway act one to like get a little more expression there uh but it it did an okay job the thing to like about Runway is the fact that it's really quick you can generate like 20 video clips in the time it would take you to generate one inside of cing or minia Max and you also have the ability to use all of those features that I talked about that go Way Beyond just the video generation alone so I really recommend using Runway if you are a filmmaker but let's get to the score for overall realism with Runway I would say that it's kind of just a five out of 10 I was really thinking that the results would be better but it seems like the algorithm has really stagnated recently hope hopefully there will be new announcements soon but at this point it's really beginning to fall behind some of the competitors for character in camera physics again I have to give it a five out of 10 the characters inside of our scene some of them looked good others the physics just didn't look right and the overall camera movement just didn't really make a lot of sense especially with that second shot and for workflow and ease of use I'll say eight out of 10 giving Runway a total of 18 out of 30 putting them strongly inside of that sweet potato category next up we have Luma Luma dream machine released in summer 2024 and it really was one of the first AI video generators that existed in this kind of gen 3 era the results that we got from Luma far exceeded the other results that we were getting from other AI video generators but the question is how does the Luma hold up today Luma is incredibly easy to use all you have to do is click the plus icon on their website go to the image and upload load your image you also have the ability to set an inframe so you can interpolate between the first frame and the last frame and it'll basically animate between them which is pretty cool all we have to do is type in our prompt and go ahead and click render I put all the clips from Luma together let's go ahead and take a look copy that okay so as you can see it's not super real istic an audience would not fully buy the scenes that we're getting from Luma I do think the establishing shot looks pretty good but that second shot with the soldiers here I mean it just looks like this guy in the background is being the creepiest little creepy SWAT guy ever and this guy while the initial turn looks good it just it it's coming across a slow motion which a lot of the AI video generators will give you slow motion footage and that's not really helpful if you're working on a project that's supposed to have realistic Dynamic physics and then the final shot here of the guy his eyes looks weird it looks like he's like a weird skeleton guy uh I think was it X-Men where the guy like blinked in two different ways it kind of looks like he has like a weird blink going on right now so it really just did not do an amazing job so while Luma is fast and easy to use and their API is also incredibly quick the fact is that realism is really bad you tend to get a lot of slow motion video clips from Luma and the physics just aren't really that realistic so for overall realism I'm going to give Luma a two out of 10 for character in camera physics again a two out of 10 and then for workflow and ease of use I'm going to say five out of 10 the actual interface is incredibly easy to use but when you actually get into the resolution that you're getting from Luma the overall Fidelity the quality of the generations and then also just the feasibility of the tools that are there the first frame and last frame feature is great in theory in actuality it doesn't actually work out so good most of the time so I'm actually only going to give that a five out of 10 so that means that the total score for Luma is 9 out of 10 putting it in the steak fry category although some french fries with some A1 that would probably be pretty solid next up is minia Max also known as hilu it is a chinese-based video generator that popped up in 2024 and the results are pretty impressive let me show you how to use it to use Minimax all you have to do is go to the hilu AI video website and go ahead and click quick create from here you can drag in an image and we'll paste in our prompt and the cool thing is you do have the ability to generate up to three video clips at a time which is pretty cool and go ahead and click generate so let's watch back our results from Minimax copy [Music] that so as you can see there's some things to like and some things not to like about this the first is the overall movement of the camera especially on the establishing shot it's not super Dynamic and the things that should be moving for example the clouds in the background there's really just not a lot of movement it it's okay but it's not the best you also have the second shot here and let's just note this guy who is just being a like a sneak King over here he's just like sneaking around creeping in the weirdest possible way and I should also note that we prompted for the soldier to basically be walking towards the door and he really just kind of like checks his gun and like looks around there's really just not a lot of movement there so not the best result from that shot and then finally we have this shot here and you can see that the man he's kind of talking here I don't really know what he's saying we didn't prompt in for talking but for some reason Minimax really likes making everyone talk so again minia Max is incredibly easy to use and the physics are decent especially if you have shots that aren't getting enough movement from some of the other video platforms Minx tends to give you the most overall movement and so it can really just add life to your animation just think about it as H giving your subject some coffee that's kind of what you're doing whenever you use minia max now the con to using Minx is the fact that it the overall realism is just not amazing compared to the AI video generators that are now available it used to be amazing just a few months ago it really was one of the best tools but as it stands right now it's not giving us the best results and the overall resolution is also a bit lower from miniac so you're going to have to upres the result and then also probably do a little bit of sharpening because it does tend to be a little soft so for overall realism from minia Max I'm going to say seven out of 10 for character in camera physics we're going to do 6 out of 10 and for workflow and ease of use it's incredibly easy to use we're going to say8 out of 10 which gives Mini Max a score of 21 out of 30 and they are officially a sweet potato next up we have cing like minia Max clling is a Chinese video model but they have many more features that are interesting you have the ability to train models on someone's face so that you can have them in the video again and again there's a lot more control over the videos that you generate and there's just more settings that can adjust including negative prompting to get exactly what you're looking for to create a video inside of cing all you have to do is go to the AI videos button and you can drag and drop your image and I'm using the latest version of cing that's 1.6 again you type in a prompt you can also change the duration the number of generations and then also the creativity strength which is pretty cool and then they do have a spot down here to type in negative prompts so things like Blurry Distortion weird all of those words that you typically would want to include in a negative prompt you can paste down here and when you're ready of course you can click generate so let's take a look at the results here copy [Music] that okay I got to say I'm really impressed from the result from cling here I think that it really embodies a lot of the Cinematic Aesthetics and elements that I would want to see from a video generator for example if we go back to the beginning here you can see that the smoke is billowing from this Factory and we have that nice movement of the overall scene which is cool we also have this second clip here it's pretty interesting because you have the soldier that holds up the gun and then it rack focuses on this guy in the background and his movement if you compare that to some of the other tools the guy in the background's movement is very realistic it really looks like there's a lot of weight behind it steps obviously we'd probably want to prompt in a little more urgency from the way he's approaching that door but it is what we prompted and the actual added camera movement looks good and I should also note that on the edges here you're seeing some chromatic aberration it's taking on Lind Dynamics like that's really uh a very cinematic and uh a much more detailed result that we're getting from cing versus other tools like Luma you couldn't even begin to think about chromatic aberration like that because the resolution is already so soft that that's that's a something to focus on in the future whenever their model gets as good as clean and then we have the shot here of the guy anxiously looking at his computer and I should note that when we prompted in for you know someone anxiously at their computer the system actually understood what anxiety is when it's captured on camera there's usually a pushing in feels like the world is closing in around them and uh really the overall uh cinematic result helps to reinforce the story that we're trying to tell so it's kind of like having a bit of an AI Director of Photography helping you out during the production process here so for overall realism I would say eight out of 10 for cing it does a really good job most of the time character in character physics again I would say eight out of 10 and then for workflow and ease of use again eight out of 10 so eights across the board that gives cing a total of 24 out of 30 putting it in the waffle fry category and then finally we we have hyper 2.5 hyper is a super fast and easy tool to use but can it stand up to the other tools let's find out so I'm on Hyper's website and all you have to do is go to image to video and let's go ahead and upload our image so our image is uploaded and then we have our prompt here so you do have the ability to change the resolution if you want and also the duration up to 6 seconds long and go ahead and click create let's take a look at our final result [Music] here copy [Music] that okay so as you can see the result from hyper is not amazing the first shot is just incredibly static there's just no movement whatsoever the second shot I don't know what's happening this guy's not even moving and this guy the the weight behind the guy's steps is just strange he's like floating and then it just like randomly Zooms in for some reason at the end so no idea what's going on there and then finally we have the shot of the guy kind of rising up and I suppose it's okay the only problem is when he blinks it is like it's like too fast and too robotic it's like it didn't blink for enough frame so it looks like he's I don't know some sort of like robot character that's been programmed to Blink as opposed to a real uh video clip here so I just don't think it did an amazing job so while I definitely think hyper is a very fast and easy tool to use the truth is it's very unrealistic and the physics are honestly pretty bad at this point so for overall realism I'm going to give hyper a one out of 10 for character and Camera physics I'll give it a two out of 10 I think that last shot was okay but not the best and for workflow and ease of use I'm going to say two out of 10 mainly because the overall Fidelity and resolution of those final videos that you get they're not amazing and there's not a ton of advanced features on their platform so that gives hyper a total of five out of 30 putting it unfortunately in

Synthesia and D-ID offer similar avatar-based video creation, but HeyGen's competitive pricing and broad language support make it a strong alternative.

Implementation Tips Structure your text with headings and subheadings: This allows Fliki to interpret your content accurately and create suitable scenes. Experiment with different AI voices: Test various voices to find the best fit for your brand and message. Review and adjust auto-generated scenes: Manual adjustments can improve the visual narrative, even if the initial generation is accurate.

Pricing and Technical Requirements Fliki offers various subscription plans starting at $11/month. The platform is web-based, requiring only a stable internet connection and a modern web browser.

The AI interprets the prompt and generates a matching video, complete with movement, lighting, and even physics. This is by far the most popular type of AI video generation. Image-to-video Look at that VEO 2 animates windows wallpaper! pic.twitter.com/qL51V8S4oA — testtm (@test_tm7873) December 26, 2024 Image-to-video AI video generation animates static images, bringing them to life with motion effects. AI can generate smooth transitions, camera movements, or even animate characters from a few frames. Image-to-video models are popular with AI video creators because they allow you to maintain character, scene and object consistency throughout your video. You would typically use these tools alongside an AI image generator like Midjourney. Video-to-video @runwayml has 4K upscaling now! 🤯 I did a comparison between Runway GEN-3 and Topaz Video AI's upscaler, from HD to 4K. Runway's file size footprint is 40% of Topaz (using the Theia model), and after reviewing the results on a 40\" monitor, there's little to no difference in… pic.twitter.com/GamPOXq9mr — Tom Blake (@Iamtomblake) January 9, 2025 Video-to-video AI video generation uses AI to enhance, modify, or transform existing videos rather than creating new ones from scratch. This can include improving video quality, changing styles, adding special effects, or even altering elements within the footage—like removing objects, or replacing backgrounds. Some good examples of video-to-video includes Synthesia's AI dubbing (with lip sync) or Topaz's video upscaling. Th‎e best AI video generator for studio-quality videos with AI avatars Synthesia PlayCreate an AI Video in 4 Minutes with Synthesia ⚡️ Verdict: Easy to use and great for training, internal communications, marketing, outreach and localisation/translation ‎Link: ‎https://www.synthesia.io/ Synthesia is a leading AI video generator that allows you to create studio-quality videos with AI avatars that can narrate your text. It includes more than 60 video templates you can start from, and you can choose between more than 230 AI avatars that speak more than 140 languages and accents. Here's an example video I made for a product launch: PlayProduct Introduction (Free AI Video Template) Synthesia can be used to create a variety of video types, with the most common use cases being learning and development videos, including training videos and other eLearning video production. It also excels at producing onboarding videos and video content for internal communications, as well as marketing and outreach videos. Synthesia is a top-ranked AI software, with 1150+ reviews on G2 and has a rating of 4.7 out of 5. The platform is being used by 50,000 companies of all sizes, with many big names among them, such as Reuters, Zoom, and Amazon. Synthesia is a browser-based platform and I found it easy to set up my first video. I simply typed in my script, selected an avatar from their library, customized my video with the AI video editor, and then Synthesia generated a polished video featuring one of its realistic AI avatars. With over 230 avatars to choose from, I easily found options that fit different tones and purposes. You can also make a custom avatar that looks like you. Synthesia supports over 140 languages, and I was able to create localized versions of my video with ease. The platform even has a multilingual video player that automatically translates videos to viewers’ preferred languages, making it useful for global audiences. I tried adding multiple avatars on screen to simulate conversations, which worked smoothly and could be helpful for training scenarios or role-playing videos. The platform has over 60 professionally designed video templates that make it easy to produce polished content quickly. Features like live collaboration tools allow teams to work together seamlessly, while detailed video analytics provide insights into video performance. Altogether, these capabilities make Synthesia a practical, efficient choice for professional projects. One of its most popular use cases is as training video software, but it's also great for other sales and marketing videos and multilingual content. Th‎e best AI video generators for creative video production Here's my rundown of the best text-to-video and image-to-video AI video generators for creative video production. Hailuo Hailuo Director Mode is so fun. Being able to combine camera shots is just fantastic. Here shaky camera and push in. pic.twitter.com/MfqBA22vm8 — Jerrod Lew (@jerrod_lew) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best free option for creative video production Link: ‎https://hailuoai.video/ Hailuo AI is an AI video generator that delivers high-quality 6-second video clips at 720p resolution. It offers text-to-video, image-to-video and a subject reference feature. Hailuo offers a 3-day free unlimited generation period so that you can generate a bunch of videos for free and really test the tool. Subject reference is a particularly cool feature. It lets you upload a photo of a character and then generate a scene with that character in it. I found the output to be pretty accurate, although I often needed to do some manual editing to maintain coherence. The model can also take multiple attempts to get it right, which will eat into your credits. The feature also often fails at close-ups (wide shots tend to work better but lose fine details). One of the first things that stood out to me was how well it understands prompts. Hailuo seemed to nail camera movements and scene composition accurately. The image quality is also noticeably high. However, generation times are limited to 6 seconds, which makes creating longer sequences more tedious. Al‎ibaba Qwen Another day, another release. Alibaba have quietly included video generation in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max and it's really good. Here are a few examples - check them out. pic.twitter.com/u6qptO59ai — TomLikesRobots🤖 (@TomLikesRobots) January 30, 2025 Verdict: Completely free and produces high quality videos, but often with unreliable generation Link: ‎‎‎‎https://chat.qwenlm.ai/ Alibaba included an AI video generator in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max. It’s a text-to-video only tool, but it’s completely free and I’ve been impressed by the quality. The one catch is that the generation is kind of unreliable. I often enter my prompt and the video generates up to 99% complete and then gets stuck for quite a while. In my experience the videos do eventually finish generating but be prepared to wait a little. The output quality seems to be really good, and while the functionality is limited, it’s completely free and the videos have no watermark. Kl‎ing If you’re looking to combine character consistency with high-quality VFX, @Kling_ai is the best choice. 🎥✨ Version 1.5 absolutely nails VFX. A true must-have! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/rO1WvmLj3k — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) January 12, 2025 Verdict: High quality output, but very long free plan generation wait times Link: ‎https://www.klingai.com/ Kling offers text-to-video and image-to-video features, along with free video generation credits for users who log in each month. Kling brings an impressive level of fluidity and realism to movement in videos. I found the adjustable creativity and relevance slider particularly useful for fine-tuning outputs. Its biggest strength lies in image-to-video generation (and in particular its elements feature), which is far superior to tools like Runway. The motion is smoother, and the AI follows prompts accurately. When I asked for a character to blink or walk forward while the camera zoomed in, Kling delivered exactly what I asked for. If you need storytelling or consistency between frames, Kling is a great option. Kling 1.5 also supports HD, which is a nice bonus. Kling has some drawbacks, the biggest being generation speed. On the free version, I sometimes had to wait an hour or more for a single clip, and I’ve heard of free users waiting a full day for results. This is a major issue if you need quick iterations. On a paid plan the generations are quicker, but I also noticed that Kling sometimes gets stuck at 99% completion and wastes credits. At the end of the day, if you prioritize quality, accuracy, and motion control, Kling is a great choice. The motion brush tool adds extra control, and the first-attempt success rate is high, meaning I spent less time fighting the AI to get what I wanted. Ru‎nway When setting up a shot in Runway, think carefully about where to put the camera. Consider what the camera placement tells the audience about the story, about the character, and about the moment. Every angle is a decision that affects how the audience will experience it. pic.twitter.com/XnijHcb0Jv — Cristóbal Valenzuela (@c_valenzuelab) November 11, 2024 Verdict: The Gen-3 model gives you great results and some amazing advanced features that come with a bit of a learning curve Link: ‎https://runwayml.com/ Runway’s latest Gen-3 model offers a comprehensive suite of creative tools, such as text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video, alongside advanced features like motion brush, keyframes, camera controls and inpainting. On the free basic plan, you can create short text-to-video clips (up to 10 seconds long or 16 seconds using the \"extend video\" feature in the older Gen-2 model) but can’t upscale resolution or remove watermarks. You also can’t generate videos directly from text using their Gen-3 Alpha model on the free plan (only images to video). However, you can still make great videos with just the image-video feature. Here's an example workflow to show you how I use Runway’s free plan to create AI-generated short story videos: Midjourney to generate images Runway for image-to-video Suno to generate music Elevenlabs for some effects Topaz for video upscaling Capcut for editing I found Runway’s advanced features to be pretty amazing. Camera control lets you adjust angles, focus, and movement to achieve a polished, professional look. The Motion brush tool allows you to add motion and direction to specific parts of a video, which is great for creating visually dynamic social media content. Keyframes allow you to configure the starting, middle, and ending frames to create smooth transitions between them. Inpainting lets you automatically remove unwanted objects throughout your clip. This tool handled complex scenes surprisingly well; I could remove background elements without affecting the continuity of the video, something that would usually require a lot of time and expertise. However, I found that these advanced features come with a learning curve, so if you’re new to video editing you might need a bit of practice to fully utilize Runway’s capabilities. I found Runway’s video generation process to be fast and reliable. I think the pricing is reasonable given the platform’s capabilities, especially for creators, filmmakers, and digital artists who want more control and creative freedom. However, the costs might feel high if you’re only looking for basic AI video generation, as Runway is designed for those looking to push creative boundaries and explore the possibilities of AI in video production. Go‎ogle Veo Been generating impossibly dangerous stunts with veo 2 using text prompts. Still surprising how realistic they can look (though not perfect yet). pic.twitter.com/0gETBwGH5y — Ethan Mollick (@emollick) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best option for creative video production, but limited access for now (US only waitlist) Link: ‎https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/ I was blown away by Google Veo 2’s realistic video generation capabilities. Every clip I produced, from a misty jungle scene to a foggy wildlife sequence, was rendered in stunning detail, and the visual fidelity was top-notch. One of the aspects that stood out for me was the advanced cinematic controls. I could specify everything from lens types to shot angles and even adjust depth-of-field effects, which made it feel like I had an entire professional film crew at my fingertips. The dolly zoom and pan shot features, in particular, added that extra layer of cinematic flair that really brought my scenes to life. In my tests, Veo 2 consistently produced more “correct” results compared to other tools like OpenAI’s Sora. The physics simulation is fantastic with objects and characters that move and interact in a way that feels natural and true to real-world behavior. I found that character consistency was excellent too; no matter how complex the scene, the generated characters maintained their look and identity throughout the video. Veo 2 supports high-resolution outputs (up to 4K) and longer video durations too, which simplifies your workflow as you won’t need upscaling tools. The only reason why Veo 2 isn’t my top pick for creative video production is because it’s still not publicly available - you have to join a waitlist and it’s still US only. There’s also room for improvement still, and I sometimes saw some strange character movements in my generated videos. Op‎enAI Sora 🚨 It’s crazy! #Sora just dropped, and it’s already blowing everyone’s minds! 😱🎥 Here are 10 mind-blowing examples showcasing its insane possibilities. 🔥 The future of video is here. 🚀👇 pic.twitter.com/Mcq2OepO3R — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Fun to play around with but needs to improve Link: ‎https://sora.com/ Sora is OpenAI’s entry into text-to-video AI video generation, and after spending some time with it, I’ve found it to be a mixed bag. On the one hand, when Sora works, it can deliver stunning, lifelike visuals, especially for abstract or artistic scenes. Its storyboard functionality is one of my favorite features, as it lets you prompt multiple shots in a single generation, and the “Blend” option adds a fun layer of creativity, allowing you to combine visual elements in unexpected ways. However, in my experience the model struggles with some critical aspects. Sora consistently fails when it comes to physics, general body movements, and character consistency. For example, I tried generating scenes as simple as making cats dance, only to be met with choppy motion, glitches, and overall results that were far from convincing. In several cases, the outputs felt like a gamble: some generations might be passable, but most of the time, prompts didn’t translate well into the expected actions or camera movements. I found that free or cheaper alternatives outperform Sora in accuracy and usability. There’s a steep learning curve, and despite the potential of the video-to-video remix functionality (which I’ve used to remaster some older AI-generated clips), the overall inconsistency is hard to overlook. You can access Sora on the plus plan ($20/month) which gives you 50 videos up to 720p resolution and 5 seconds long, or the pro plan ($200/month) for 500 videos up to 1080p resolution and 20 seconds long. Pi‎ka I had early access to the Pika 2.1 Model, A new journey begins, More clips to follow! @pika_labs pic.twitter.com/rN5OfMacoo — Stevie Mac (@StevieMac03) January 23, 2025 Verdict: The free plan isn’t great, but the premium plans have very good image-to-video features Link: ‎https://pika.art/ Pika offers a free plan that gives you access to Pika 1.5, which has text-to-video and image-to-video features and 150 monthly video credits. Videos can be downloaded without a watermark on the free plan. I wasn’t super impressed with the quality of the generated videos though. However, while Pika 1.5’s video output is nothing special, Pika 2.1 (available on the paid plan) offers an image-to-video feature called scene ingredients, which I think is pretty amazing. With scene ingredients you can build a shot from the exact character, object, wardrobe, and setting you want. It works by using reference images of each element and then providing a prompt. It’s similar to Kling’s elements feature in that it allows you to ensure creative consistency between scenes, which I found made it a super useful tool to produce actually usable videos. Lu‎ma First impression Luma > Sora pic.twitter.com/R2pXVsAesw — The Retro Burn (@burntheretro) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Their new Ray 2 model is great, but it’s a premium feature and it doesn’t offer image-to-video Link: ‎https://lumalabs.ai/ Luma's Ray 2 model has great motion realism and the physics feel really natural. The frame-to-frame consistency is a clear improvement over previous versions and it does an excellent job with cinematic elements, responding impressively to lighting, contrast, film formats, and camera motion. At times, it even seemed to intelligently structure shots. By using highly detailed prompts and running multiple generations, I found that it’s possible to create some truly stunning videos, though it does require some cherry-picking to get the best results. When I tested a sports car driving through snowy mountains at dawn, the scene composition was spot on and the snow, warm light, and camera tracking all felt smooth and natural. I also experimented with close-up shots of faces, and I was surprised by how well it captured emotional expressions, particularly in an extreme sadness prompt, where the eye movements and facial subtleties felt incredibly lifelike. Where Luma stands out is its ability to generate dynamic camera movements while keeping the scene coherent. It understands cinematic depth and framing in a way that makes it ideal for dramatic shots. I found that Luma is great at handling large-scale scene changes. For example, when I asked it to generate a collapsing building Luma delivered a convincing destruction sequence. Currently, Luma’s Ray 2 is only available to paid users and is capped at 720p resolution. Videos can be up to 10 seconds long, but I noticed that after about 7 seconds, scene consistency can start breaking down, occasionally shifting in unintended ways. Ad‎obe Firefly Here's another video created by Adobe Firefly.. a 3D printer, printing a car. Very impressed by the results. https://t.co/L5d8zf3TGv pic.twitter.com/ySylkRlDMS — techAU (@techAU) February 13, 2025 Verdict: Inconsistent motion and limited free use (only 2 free generations) make it hard to recommend Link: ‎‎https://firefly.adobe.com/ Adobe Firefly offers both text to video and image to video, both capable of producing 1080p clips from simple prompts or static images. Firefly struggles with distortion. I tested it by generating a video of \"a cyclist riding through a mountain trail in autumn,\" and while the colors and scenery were nice, the motion was noticeably unnatural. The cyclist's legs appeared to glitch mid-pedal, and the overall movement felt disjointed. Image to video fared better when creating abstract or background footage, but realistic human action remained a challenge. The output currently feels more like digital experiments than polished, usable content. On the positive side, Firefly's interface is intuitive. The built-in controls for adjusting camera angles, motion paths, and shot sizes make experimenting with different styles relatively simple. After generating two free videos, I was prompted to upgrade to either Firefly Standard or Pro for additional generations. While Firefly is enjoyable to explore and has clear creative potential, I’ll stick with more reliable alternatives for projects that need high-quality, natural-looking results. The best AI video generators for social media and YouTube content Fl‎exClip PlayHow to use FlexClip's AI Video Creator Verdict: User-friendly video tool with innovative AI features Link: ‎https://www.flexclip.com/ FlexClip is highly user-friendly platform that excels at helping you create professional-looking videos quickly and efficiently. I love the drag-and-drop editor. It’s perfect for creating videos on the fly without needing to spend hours on intricate editing. I’ve used it to create everything from social media content to promotional videos. The AI-powered text-to-video tool allows you to input simple text prompts, and the AI generates video clips based on the text, matching stock footage, adding text overlays, and even suggesting music. It's perfect for social media clips. While the AI can be a little hit or miss when it comes to perfectly matching footage to specific content, it’s an amazing tool for creating videos when you’re short on time or just need a draft to build upon, and I typically only need to make a few adjustments after generation. The AI script generator is another great feature. While the scripts are generally a good starting point, they often need a little fine-tuning to match the specific tone of the brand or subject matter. This is definitely a time-saver, though, especially when you’re stuck trying to put ideas into words. Another feature that impressed me was the AI background remover. It works surprisingly well. For most images, the background removal is clean, though it sometimes struggles with more intricate details like hair or small objects. It’s a great time-saver when you’re working with product images or need transparent backgrounds quickly. FlexClip also offers an auto-subtitle generator, which is a great tool for improving accessibility and engagement on social media platforms. It’s surprisingly accurate, and I’ve used it for videos on YouTube and Instagram. However, it does occasionally struggle with fast speech or complex accents, so if you’re working with content that has unclear audio, this may not always be 100% reliable. One area where FlexClip could improve is its media library. While it offers a decent range of stock footage and images, it’s not as extensive as some other platforms I’ve used. For niche content, I’ve often had to source additional media from other places. The stock library is good for general-purpose videos, but it may not always have exactly what you need. Ve‎ed PlayHow to Make a YouTube Intro Verdict: User-friendly browser-based video editor that streamlines social media content creation Link: ‎https://www.veed.io/ Veed is a user-friendly, browser-based video editor that made creating social media content incredibly easy for me. The intuitive layout and drag-and-drop functionality let me start projects quickly, and I loved using features like automatic subtitles, text-to-speech, and background removal to give my videos a professional touch. The templates and filters helped keep my style consistent, and with auto-translate, creating multilingual content was straightforward. The only downside I found was that the free plan includes a watermark, and complex scenes sometimes required a bit of manual tweaking to get the AI effects like background removal just right. Overall, Veed offered everything I needed for quick, polished videos with minimal effort. Ca‎nva PlayCreate content fast with Canva Video Verdict: AI-powered video editing with versatile templates Link: ‎https://www.canva.com/video-editor/ai/ Canva is not only a design tool; it’s also a great alternative for creating social media and YouTube videos. I tried its video editor, and I was impressed by how well it adapts to video creation. Canva’s templates make it easy to start projects tailored for platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. One of my favorite features is the automatic resizing, which lets me quickly reformat videos for different platforms without needing to start from scratch. The AI-powered suggestions for text and animations are also handy—it feels like Canva’s tools know how to keep my content consistent and visually engaging. With access to a vast library of stock media and music, I could easily enhance my videos, and the new AI text-to-speech and captioning features were a nice bonus, especially for making my videos more accessible. Overall, Canva’s video editing tools made it simple to produce polished, shareable content that looks just as good as anything created with dedicated video editors. The best AI-powered video editors Fi‎lmora PlayFilmora 14 is HERE! | Introducing a NEW way to edit Verdict: An affordable and user-friendly video editor with robust AI features Link: ‎https://filmora.wondershare.com/ When I first tried Filmora, I was immediately struck by how easy it was to navigate. The drag-and-drop functionality and straightforward interface made it simple to start editing, even without much prior experience. Filmora offers a robust library of transitions, effects, and templates, allowing me to quickly put together visually appealing videos, which is ideal for creating content for social media and YouTube. I appreciated how the platform balances usability with a range of features, making it suitable for both beginners and intermediate users who want to produce polished videos without a steep learning curve. Filmora’s pricing is also accessible, with options that cater to different types of users. They offer an annual subscription starting at around $49.99 per year, and for those looking for more flexibility, a lifetime license is available for around $79.99. There’s also a free version, which is great for testing the software before committing, but it does add a watermark to videos. For creators looking to edit consistently without major financial commitments, Filmora’s pricing offers a good balance of affordability and value, especially considering the powerful AI tools it includes. These plans are well-suited for individuals and small business owners who need regular access to professional-grade video tools without breaking the bank. Filmora's AI-powered tools bring a lot of convenience and creativity to the editing process. I'll run through each one. The AI Smart Cutout feature, for example, allows you to cut objects out of scenes by painting over the area, which is perfect for isolating specific subjects without complex masking. I also found AI Audio Denoise to be extremely useful for cleaning up background noise in my videos, especially when I recorded in less-than-ideal environments. The AI Audio Stretch tool was another handy feature that let me extend background music to match scene transitions, saving me the hassle of remixing or finding perfectly timed tracks. These AI tools are not only time-saving but also elevate the overall quality of the final video, helping users create professional-looking content with minimal effort. The AI Motion Tracking tool was a lot of fun to experiment with—it can be used to track faces or moving objects, allowing for privacy blurring or creative effects like pasting funny stickers over someone’s face to make meme-style videos. Another feature I really enjoyed was AI Remove Background, which made it easy to change the background of my videos without needing a green screen. I could, for instance, place a runner in an outer-space setting, which opens up endless creative possibilities. Additionally, Filmora’s AI Silence Detection tool helped speed up my editing by automatically removing pauses and hesitations, making it effortless to create snappy jump cuts. These tools make Filmora an efficient, AI-enhanced option for quick edits and visually dynamic effects. However, while these AI tools are great for general use, there are a few limitations. The precision of features like Smart Cutout and Remove Background isn’t perfect and might require manual touch-ups for complex scenes. Additionally, while Filmora handles most tasks smoothly, rendering can slow down when working with high-resolution files or when using multiple AI features in one project. This might be a drawback for users with demanding workflows or those creating high-quality, professional-grade content. Overall, though, Filmora’s AI tools make it an impressive choice for social media creators and hobbyists. In summary, Filmora is an accessible, budget-friendly video editor that packs a lot of AI-driven functionality into an affordable package. It’s particularly suited for those creating content for social media, YouTube, or personal projects. With its range of pricing options, Filmora offers a lot of value, especially for casual and intermediate creators who don’t need the high-end features of more advanced (and expensive) software. To‎paz PlayExperience Wonder by Topaz Labs Verdict: A premium AI-driven enhancer that delivers cinematic upscaling and noise reduction for professional-quality footage Link: ‎‎https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-video-ai Topaz Video AI is an advanced video enhancement tool that uses AI to upscale, stabilize, and improve video quality. When I tried it, I was impressed by how well it upscaled footage, even to resolutions as high as 16K, adding a cinematic clarity to older or lower-quality clips. The AI-driven noise reduction made a noticeable difference, effectively removing grain and artifacts that I struggled with in other software. I also found the frame rate enhancement and slow-motion features to be smooth and natural, making it ideal for creating professional-quality slow-motion shots or restoring archival footage. Priced at $299 for personal use and $1099 for commercial licensing, Topaz Video AI is an expensive but valuable investment for filmmakers, content creators, and digital archivists looking to elevate their work with high-end upscaling and video repair capabilities. Ca‎pCut PlayLearn How to Create Amazing Content using CapCut Web Version | CapCut Verdict: A free and versatile editor with intuitive AI tools that make crafting polished content effortless across devices Link: https://www.capcut.com/ CapCut is a free, all-in-one video editing tool that I found easy to use across mobile, desktop, and browser platforms. The array of AI-powered features—like background removal and automatic upscaling—made editing quick and straightforward, especially for creating social media content. The audio-to-text transcription was a time-saver, automatically adding captions that boosted accessibility and engagement on my videos. I liked tools like video stabilization and text-to-speech, which let me enhance video quality without needing complex software. CapCut’s collaborative features were also helpful, especially when working on shared projects, and the library of templates gave me plenty of creative options. Overall, CapCut’s versatility and ease of use make it a great choice for both personal and professional video editing. The best AI video generators for video repurposing Op‎usClip PlayOpusClip 3.0: The smartest AI clipping tool just got smarter Verdict: A smart and time-saving tool that repurposes long videos into engaging, platform-ready clips with minimal effort Link: ‎https://www.opus.pro/ Opus Clip has quickly become one of my favorite tools for repurposing long videos into social media-friendly clips. The AI-driven clip generation feature is surprisingly accurate, identifying the most engaging parts of my videos and saving me the time I’d usually spend sorting through footage. I appreciate how it automatically resizes clips to fit different platforms like TikTok and Instagram without any manual adjustments. Adding captions and even emojis is simple, and I noticed it makes the videos more engaging, especially for viewers who watch without sound. One of the standout features is the \"hook\" identification, which picks out key moments to grab attention quickly. Overall, Opus Clip made it easy to create compelling, shareable content from my existing videos, and the AI features really lightened my workload. Mu‎nch PlayMeet Munch Verdict: Efficiently converts long-form content into shareable social snippets using AI Link: ‎https://www.getmunch.com/ Munch is an AI-based tool for repurposing long-form video content into shorter clips suited for social media platforms. It identifies key moments in videos and includes features like auto-cropping, subtitles, and format adjustments to help optimize content for platforms such as Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok. Munch offers a streamlined way to create shareable content from existing videos, aimed at enhancing reach and engagement across various channels. I found the interface clean and easy to navigate, allowing me to jump right in without needing tutorials. One feature I particularly liked was the automatic detection of key moments. Munch’s AI identifies engaging segments, which saved me the time of manually sifting through my footage to find the best parts to share. For anyone looking to repurpose content across platforms, this automation is a real time-saver. Munch’s formatting tools also make it easy to resize videos for different social platforms. The auto-cropping options adjust clips to fit Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and more, making cross-platform distribution simpler. I appreciated the automatic subtitle feature, which made my videos accessible to a broader audience without much additional work. However, while these features are useful, they lack some customization. I couldn’t manually adjust the selected clips as much as I’d like, and sometimes the AI would pick sections that didn’t feel as relevant or engaging as I had hoped. One limitation I noticed is that the output quality and customization options are fairly basic compared to more advanced editing software. While auto-cropping and subtitles are convenient, the styling options for subtitles are limited, and I missed having more flexibility with transitions and effects. This might be a drawback if you’re aiming for highly polished, branded content, as Munch is more focused on speed and efficiency than fine-tuning. Overall, though, it’s a solid tool for quickly repurposing long videos into social-friendly snippets. If you need a quick way to generate clips from existing content and don’t require advanced editing, Munch is a handy addition to your toolkit. Wi‎secut PlayTurn long videos into shorts with Wisecut AI Verdict: Wisecut streamlines editing by automatically trimming dead space and adding professional touches Link: ‎https://www.wisecut.ai/ Wisecut automatically finds interesting moments in long clips and cuts them, adding music and subtitles. I tested it by uploading a raw clip full of awkward pauses and unnecessary dead spots, and Wisecut’s smart editing removed all the fluff. The auto-cut feature was spot-on, leaving me with a much tighter, more engaging video without having to painstakingly cut it all myself. The tool is super intuitive. It offers handy features like background noise cancellation and even let me choose whether to add background music, which really helped polish the final product. I also appreciated the straightforward interface—it made setting up projects and tweaking settings a breeze. In short, Wisecut has saved me a significant amount of time, letting me focus more on creating content rather than getting bogged down in editing. If you’re looking to streamline your workflow and produce cleaner, more professional videos, I’d highly recommend giving it a try. How did I decide on the best AI video generators? I focused on the following factors when building this list: Quality of Output – I evaluated whether each tool produces videos with the resolution, length, and overall quality required for professional results Ease of Use and Customization – I looked for an intuitive interface and flexible customization options to accommodate different skill levels and creative needs Platform Compatibility and Export Options – I checked if the tool is compatible across devices and offers export options suitable for various platforms Pricing and Free Plan Limitations – I compared pricing structures and the limitations of free plans to ensure they offer good value for different budgets AI Capabilities and Features – I specifically assessed the AI-driven features About the author Content Writer & Marketing Expert Ema Lukan Ema Lukan is a seasoned Content Writer and Marketing Expert with a rich history of collaborating with marketing agencies, SaaS companies, and film studios.

The AI interprets the prompt and generates a matching video, complete with movement, lighting, and even physics. This is by far the most popular type of AI video generation. Image-to-video Look at that VEO 2 animates windows wallpaper! pic.twitter.com/qL51V8S4oA — testtm (@test_tm7873) December 26, 2024 Image-to-video AI video generation animates static images, bringing them to life with motion effects. AI can generate smooth transitions, camera movements, or even animate characters from a few frames. Image-to-video models are popular with AI video creators because they allow you to maintain character, scene and object consistency throughout your video. You would typically use these tools alongside an AI image generator like Midjourney. Video-to-video @runwayml has 4K upscaling now! 🤯 I did a comparison between Runway GEN-3 and Topaz Video AI's upscaler, from HD to 4K. Runway's file size footprint is 40% of Topaz (using the Theia model), and after reviewing the results on a 40\" monitor, there's little to no difference in… pic.twitter.com/GamPOXq9mr — Tom Blake (@Iamtomblake) January 9, 2025 Video-to-video AI video generation uses AI to enhance, modify, or transform existing videos rather than creating new ones from scratch. This can include improving video quality, changing styles, adding special effects, or even altering elements within the footage—like removing objects, or replacing backgrounds. Some good examples of video-to-video includes Synthesia's AI dubbing (with lip sync) or Topaz's video upscaling. Th‎e best AI video generator for studio-quality videos with AI avatars Synthesia PlayCreate an AI Video in 4 Minutes with Synthesia ⚡️ Verdict: Easy to use and great for training, internal communications, marketing, outreach and localisation/translation ‎Link: ‎https://www.synthesia.io/ Synthesia is a leading AI video generator that allows you to create studio-quality videos with AI avatars that can narrate your text. It includes more than 60 video templates you can start from, and you can choose between more than 230 AI avatars that speak more than 140 languages and accents. Here's an example video I made for a product launch: PlayProduct Introduction (Free AI Video Template) Synthesia can be used to create a variety of video types, with the most common use cases being learning and development videos, including training videos and other eLearning video production. It also excels at producing onboarding videos and video content for internal communications, as well as marketing and outreach videos. Synthesia is a top-ranked AI software, with 1150+ reviews on G2 and has a rating of 4.7 out of 5. The platform is being used by 50,000 companies of all sizes, with many big names among them, such as Reuters, Zoom, and Amazon. Synthesia is a browser-based platform and I found it easy to set up my first video. I simply typed in my script, selected an avatar from their library, customized my video with the AI video editor, and then Synthesia generated a polished video featuring one of its realistic AI avatars. With over 230 avatars to choose from, I easily found options that fit different tones and purposes. You can also make a custom avatar that looks like you. Synthesia supports over 140 languages, and I was able to create localized versions of my video with ease. The platform even has a multilingual video player that automatically translates videos to viewers’ preferred languages, making it useful for global audiences. I tried adding multiple avatars on screen to simulate conversations, which worked smoothly and could be helpful for training scenarios or role-playing videos. The platform has over 60 professionally designed video templates that make it easy to produce polished content quickly. Features like live collaboration tools allow teams to work together seamlessly, while detailed video analytics provide insights into video performance. Altogether, these capabilities make Synthesia a practical, efficient choice for professional projects. One of its most popular use cases is as training video software, but it's also great for other sales and marketing videos and multilingual content. Th‎e best AI video generators for creative video production Here's my rundown of the best text-to-video and image-to-video AI video generators for creative video production. Hailuo Hailuo Director Mode is so fun. Being able to combine camera shots is just fantastic. Here shaky camera and push in. pic.twitter.com/MfqBA22vm8 — Jerrod Lew (@jerrod_lew) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best free option for creative video production Link: ‎https://hailuoai.video/ Hailuo AI is an AI video generator that delivers high-quality 6-second video clips at 720p resolution. It offers text-to-video, image-to-video and a subject reference feature. Hailuo offers a 3-day free unlimited generation period so that you can generate a bunch of videos for free and really test the tool. Subject reference is a particularly cool feature. It lets you upload a photo of a character and then generate a scene with that character in it. I found the output to be pretty accurate, although I often needed to do some manual editing to maintain coherence. The model can also take multiple attempts to get it right, which will eat into your credits. The feature also often fails at close-ups (wide shots tend to work better but lose fine details). One of the first things that stood out to me was how well it understands prompts. Hailuo seemed to nail camera movements and scene composition accurately. The image quality is also noticeably high. However, generation times are limited to 6 seconds, which makes creating longer sequences more tedious. Al‎ibaba Qwen Another day, another release. Alibaba have quietly included video generation in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max and it's really good. Here are a few examples - check them out. pic.twitter.com/u6qptO59ai — TomLikesRobots🤖 (@TomLikesRobots) January 30, 2025 Verdict: Completely free and produces high quality videos, but often with unreliable generation Link: ‎‎‎‎https://chat.qwenlm.ai/ Alibaba included an AI video generator in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max. It’s a text-to-video only tool, but it’s completely free and I’ve been impressed by the quality. The one catch is that the generation is kind of unreliable. I often enter my prompt and the video generates up to 99% complete and then gets stuck for quite a while. In my experience the videos do eventually finish generating but be prepared to wait a little. The output quality seems to be really good, and while the functionality is limited, it’s completely free and the videos have no watermark. Kl‎ing If you’re looking to combine character consistency with high-quality VFX, @Kling_ai is the best choice. 🎥✨ Version 1.5 absolutely nails VFX. A true must-have! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/rO1WvmLj3k — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) January 12, 2025 Verdict: High quality output, but very long free plan generation wait times Link: ‎https://www.klingai.com/ Kling offers text-to-video and image-to-video features, along with free video generation credits for users who log in each month. Kling brings an impressive level of fluidity and realism to movement in videos. I found the adjustable creativity and relevance slider particularly useful for fine-tuning outputs. Its biggest strength lies in image-to-video generation (and in particular its elements feature), which is far superior to tools like Runway. The motion is smoother, and the AI follows prompts accurately. When I asked for a character to blink or walk forward while the camera zoomed in, Kling delivered exactly what I asked for. If you need storytelling or consistency between frames, Kling is a great option. Kling 1.5 also supports HD, which is a nice bonus. Kling has some drawbacks, the biggest being generation speed. On the free version, I sometimes had to wait an hour or more for a single clip, and I’ve heard of free users waiting a full day for results. This is a major issue if you need quick iterations. On a paid plan the generations are quicker, but I also noticed that Kling sometimes gets stuck at 99% completion and wastes credits. At the end of the day, if you prioritize quality, accuracy, and motion control, Kling is a great choice. The motion brush tool adds extra control, and the first-attempt success rate is high, meaning I spent less time fighting the AI to get what I wanted. Ru‎nway When setting up a shot in Runway, think carefully about where to put the camera. Consider what the camera placement tells the audience about the story, about the character, and about the moment. Every angle is a decision that affects how the audience will experience it. pic.twitter.com/XnijHcb0Jv — Cristóbal Valenzuela (@c_valenzuelab) November 11, 2024 Verdict: The Gen-3 model gives you great results and some amazing advanced features that come with a bit of a learning curve Link: ‎https://runwayml.com/ Runway’s latest Gen-3 model offers a comprehensive suite of creative tools, such as text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video, alongside advanced features like motion brush, keyframes, camera controls and inpainting. On the free basic plan, you can create short text-to-video clips (up to 10 seconds long or 16 seconds using the \"extend video\" feature in the older Gen-2 model) but can’t upscale resolution or remove watermarks. You also can’t generate videos directly from text using their Gen-3 Alpha model on the free plan (only images to video). However, you can still make great videos with just the image-video feature. Here's an example workflow to show you how I use Runway’s free plan to create AI-generated short story videos: Midjourney to generate images Runway for image-to-video Suno to generate music Elevenlabs for some effects Topaz for video upscaling Capcut for editing I found Runway’s advanced features to be pretty amazing. Camera control lets you adjust angles, focus, and movement to achieve a polished, professional look. The Motion brush tool allows you to add motion and direction to specific parts of a video, which is great for creating visually dynamic social media content. Keyframes allow you to configure the starting, middle, and ending frames to create smooth transitions between them. Inpainting lets you automatically remove unwanted objects throughout your clip. This tool handled complex scenes surprisingly well; I could remove background elements without affecting the continuity of the video, something that would usually require a lot of time and expertise. However, I found that these advanced features come with a learning curve, so if you’re new to video editing you might need a bit of practice to fully utilize Runway’s capabilities. I found Runway’s video generation process to be fast and reliable. I think the pricing is reasonable given the platform’s capabilities, especially for creators, filmmakers, and digital artists who want more control and creative freedom. However, the costs might feel high if you’re only looking for basic AI video generation, as Runway is designed for those looking to push creative boundaries and explore the possibilities of AI in video production. Go‎ogle Veo Been generating impossibly dangerous stunts with veo 2 using text prompts. Still surprising how realistic they can look (though not perfect yet). pic.twitter.com/0gETBwGH5y — Ethan Mollick (@emollick) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best option for creative video production, but limited access for now (US only waitlist) Link: ‎https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/ I was blown away by Google Veo 2’s realistic video generation capabilities. Every clip I produced, from a misty jungle scene to a foggy wildlife sequence, was rendered in stunning detail, and the visual fidelity was top-notch. One of the aspects that stood out for me was the advanced cinematic controls. I could specify everything from lens types to shot angles and even adjust depth-of-field effects, which made it feel like I had an entire professional film crew at my fingertips. The dolly zoom and pan shot features, in particular, added that extra layer of cinematic flair that really brought my scenes to life. In my tests, Veo 2 consistently produced more “correct” results compared to other tools like OpenAI’s Sora. The physics simulation is fantastic with objects and characters that move and interact in a way that feels natural and true to real-world behavior. I found that character consistency was excellent too; no matter how complex the scene, the generated characters maintained their look and identity throughout the video. Veo 2 supports high-resolution outputs (up to 4K) and longer video durations too, which simplifies your workflow as you won’t need upscaling tools. The only reason why Veo 2 isn’t my top pick for creative video production is because it’s still not publicly available - you have to join a waitlist and it’s still US only. There’s also room for improvement still, and I sometimes saw some strange character movements in my generated videos. Op‎enAI Sora 🚨 It’s crazy! #Sora just dropped, and it’s already blowing everyone’s minds! 😱🎥 Here are 10 mind-blowing examples showcasing its insane possibilities. 🔥 The future of video is here. 🚀👇 pic.twitter.com/Mcq2OepO3R — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Fun to play around with but needs to improve Link: ‎https://sora.com/ Sora is OpenAI’s entry into text-to-video AI video generation, and after spending some time with it, I’ve found it to be a mixed bag. On the one hand, when Sora works, it can deliver stunning, lifelike visuals, especially for abstract or artistic scenes. Its storyboard functionality is one of my favorite features, as it lets you prompt multiple shots in a single generation, and the “Blend” option adds a fun layer of creativity, allowing you to combine visual elements in unexpected ways. However, in my experience the model struggles with some critical aspects. Sora consistently fails when it comes to physics, general body movements, and character consistency. For example, I tried generating scenes as simple as making cats dance, only to be met with choppy motion, glitches, and overall results that were far from convincing. In several cases, the outputs felt like a gamble: some generations might be passable, but most of the time, prompts didn’t translate well into the expected actions or camera movements. I found that free or cheaper alternatives outperform Sora in accuracy and usability. There’s a steep learning curve, and despite the potential of the video-to-video remix functionality (which I’ve used to remaster some older AI-generated clips), the overall inconsistency is hard to overlook. You can access Sora on the plus plan ($20/month) which gives you 50 videos up to 720p resolution and 5 seconds long, or the pro plan ($200/month) for 500 videos up to 1080p resolution and 20 seconds long. Pi‎ka I had early access to the Pika 2.1 Model, A new journey begins, More clips to follow! @pika_labs pic.twitter.com/rN5OfMacoo — Stevie Mac (@StevieMac03) January 23, 2025 Verdict: The free plan isn’t great, but the premium plans have very good image-to-video features Link: ‎https://pika.art/ Pika offers a free plan that gives you access to Pika 1.5, which has text-to-video and image-to-video features and 150 monthly video credits. Videos can be downloaded without a watermark on the free plan. I wasn’t super impressed with the quality of the generated videos though. However, while Pika 1.5’s video output is nothing special, Pika 2.1 (available on the paid plan) offers an image-to-video feature called scene ingredients, which I think is pretty amazing. With scene ingredients you can build a shot from the exact character, object, wardrobe, and setting you want. It works by using reference images of each element and then providing a prompt. It’s similar to Kling’s elements feature in that it allows you to ensure creative consistency between scenes, which I found made it a super useful tool to produce actually usable videos. Lu‎ma First impression Luma > Sora pic.twitter.com/R2pXVsAesw — The Retro Burn (@burntheretro) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Their new Ray 2 model is great, but it’s a premium feature and it doesn’t offer image-to-video Link: ‎https://lumalabs.ai/ Luma's Ray 2 model has great motion realism and the physics feel really natural. The frame-to-frame consistency is a clear improvement over previous versions and it does an excellent job with cinematic elements, responding impressively to lighting, contrast, film formats, and camera motion. At times, it even seemed to intelligently structure shots. By using highly detailed prompts and running multiple generations, I found that it’s possible to create some truly stunning videos, though it does require some cherry-picking to get the best results. When I tested a sports car driving through snowy mountains at dawn, the scene composition was spot on and the snow, warm light, and camera tracking all felt smooth and natural. I also experimented with close-up shots of faces, and I was surprised by how well it captured emotional expressions, particularly in an extreme sadness prompt, where the eye movements and facial subtleties felt incredibly lifelike. Where Luma stands out is its ability to generate dynamic camera movements while keeping the scene coherent. It understands cinematic depth and framing in a way that makes it ideal for dramatic shots. I found that Luma is great at handling large-scale scene changes. For example, when I asked it to generate a collapsing building Luma delivered a convincing destruction sequence. Currently, Luma’s Ray 2 is only available to paid users and is capped at 720p resolution. Videos can be up to 10 seconds long, but I noticed that after about 7 seconds, scene consistency can start breaking down, occasionally shifting in unintended ways. Ad‎obe Firefly Here's another video created by Adobe Firefly.. a 3D printer, printing a car. Very impressed by the results. https://t.co/L5d8zf3TGv pic.twitter.com/ySylkRlDMS — techAU (@techAU) February 13, 2025 Verdict: Inconsistent motion and limited free use (only 2 free generations) make it hard to recommend Link: ‎‎https://firefly.adobe.com/ Adobe Firefly offers both text to video and image to video, both capable of producing 1080p clips from simple prompts or static images. Firefly struggles with distortion. I tested it by generating a video of \"a cyclist riding through a mountain trail in autumn,\" and while the colors and scenery were nice, the motion was noticeably unnatural. The cyclist's legs appeared to glitch mid-pedal, and the overall movement felt disjointed. Image to video fared better when creating abstract or background footage, but realistic human action remained a challenge. The output currently feels more like digital experiments than polished, usable content. On the positive side, Firefly's interface is intuitive. The built-in controls for adjusting camera angles, motion paths, and shot sizes make experimenting with different styles relatively simple. After generating two free videos, I was prompted to upgrade to either Firefly Standard or Pro for additional generations. While Firefly is enjoyable to explore and has clear creative potential, I’ll stick with more reliable alternatives for projects that need high-quality, natural-looking results. The best AI video generators for social media and YouTube content Fl‎exClip PlayHow to use FlexClip's AI Video Creator Verdict: User-friendly video tool with innovative AI features Link: ‎https://www.flexclip.com/ FlexClip is highly user-friendly platform that excels at helping you create professional-looking videos quickly and efficiently. I love the drag-and-drop editor. It’s perfect for creating videos on the fly without needing to spend hours on intricate editing. I’ve used it to create everything from social media content to promotional videos. The AI-powered text-to-video tool allows you to input simple text prompts, and the AI generates video clips based on the text, matching stock footage, adding text overlays, and even suggesting music. It's perfect for social media clips. While the AI can be a little hit or miss when it comes to perfectly matching footage to specific content, it’s an amazing tool for creating videos when you’re short on time or just need a draft to build upon, and I typically only need to make a few adjustments after generation. The AI script generator is another great feature. While the scripts are generally a good starting point, they often need a little fine-tuning to match the specific tone of the brand or subject matter. This is definitely a time-saver, though, especially when you’re stuck trying to put ideas into words. Another feature that impressed me was the AI background remover. It works surprisingly well. For most images, the background removal is clean, though it sometimes struggles with more intricate details like hair or small objects. It’s a great time-saver when you’re working with product images or need transparent backgrounds quickly. FlexClip also offers an auto-subtitle generator, which is a great tool for improving accessibility and engagement on social media platforms. It’s surprisingly accurate, and I’ve used it for videos on YouTube and Instagram. However, it does occasionally struggle with fast speech or complex accents, so if you’re working with content that has unclear audio, this may not always be 100% reliable. One area where FlexClip could improve is its media library. While it offers a decent range of stock footage and images, it’s not as extensive as some other platforms I’ve used. For niche content, I’ve often had to source additional media from other places. The stock library is good for general-purpose videos, but it may not always have exactly what you need. Ve‎ed PlayHow to Make a YouTube Intro Verdict: User-friendly browser-based video editor that streamlines social media content creation Link: ‎https://www.veed.io/ Veed is a user-friendly, browser-based video editor that made creating social media content incredibly easy for me. The intuitive layout and drag-and-drop functionality let me start projects quickly, and I loved using features like automatic subtitles, text-to-speech, and background removal to give my videos a professional touch. The templates and filters helped keep my style consistent, and with auto-translate, creating multilingual content was straightforward. The only downside I found was that the free plan includes a watermark, and complex scenes sometimes required a bit of manual tweaking to get the AI effects like background removal just right. Overall, Veed offered everything I needed for quick, polished videos with minimal effort. Ca‎nva PlayCreate content fast with Canva Video Verdict: AI-powered video editing with versatile templates Link: ‎https://www.canva.com/video-editor/ai/ Canva is not only a design tool; it’s also a great alternative for creating social media and YouTube videos. I tried its video editor, and I was impressed by how well it adapts to video creation. Canva’s templates make it easy to start projects tailored for platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. One of my favorite features is the automatic resizing, which lets me quickly reformat videos for different platforms without needing to start from scratch. The AI-powered suggestions for text and animations are also handy—it feels like Canva’s tools know how to keep my content consistent and visually engaging. With access to a vast library of stock media and music, I could easily enhance my videos, and the new AI text-to-speech and captioning features were a nice bonus, especially for making my videos more accessible. Overall, Canva’s video editing tools made it simple to produce polished, shareable content that looks just as good as anything created with dedicated video editors. The best AI-powered video editors Fi‎lmora PlayFilmora 14 is HERE! | Introducing a NEW way to edit Verdict: An affordable and user-friendly video editor with robust AI features Link: ‎https://filmora.wondershare.com/ When I first tried Filmora, I was immediately struck by how easy it was to navigate. The drag-and-drop functionality and straightforward interface made it simple to start editing, even without much prior experience. Filmora offers a robust library of transitions, effects, and templates, allowing me to quickly put together visually appealing videos, which is ideal for creating content for social media and YouTube. I appreciated how the platform balances usability with a range of features, making it suitable for both beginners and intermediate users who want to produce polished videos without a steep learning curve. Filmora’s pricing is also accessible, with options that cater to different types of users. They offer an annual subscription starting at around $49.99 per year, and for those looking for more flexibility, a lifetime license is available for around $79.99. There’s also a free version, which is great for testing the software before committing, but it does add a watermark to videos. For creators looking to edit consistently without major financial commitments, Filmora’s pricing offers a good balance of affordability and value, especially considering the powerful AI tools it includes. These plans are well-suited for individuals and small business owners who need regular access to professional-grade video tools without breaking the bank. Filmora's AI-powered tools bring a lot of convenience and creativity to the editing process. I'll run through each one. The AI Smart Cutout feature, for example, allows you to cut objects out of scenes by painting over the area, which is perfect for isolating specific subjects without complex masking. I also found AI Audio Denoise to be extremely useful for cleaning up background noise in my videos, especially when I recorded in less-than-ideal environments. The AI Audio Stretch tool was another handy feature that let me extend background music to match scene transitions, saving me the hassle of remixing or finding perfectly timed tracks. These AI tools are not only time-saving but also elevate the overall quality of the final video, helping users create professional-looking content with minimal effort. The AI Motion Tracking tool was a lot of fun to experiment with—it can be used to track faces or moving objects, allowing for privacy blurring or creative effects like pasting funny stickers over someone’s face to make meme-style videos. Another feature I really enjoyed was AI Remove Background, which made it easy to change the background of my videos without needing a green screen. I could, for instance, place a runner in an outer-space setting, which opens up endless creative possibilities. Additionally, Filmora’s AI Silence Detection tool helped speed up my editing by automatically removing pauses and hesitations, making it effortless to create snappy jump cuts. These tools make Filmora an efficient, AI-enhanced option for quick edits and visually dynamic effects. However, while these AI tools are great for general use, there are a few limitations. The precision of features like Smart Cutout and Remove Background isn’t perfect and might require manual touch-ups for complex scenes. Additionally, while Filmora handles most tasks smoothly, rendering can slow down when working with high-resolution files or when using multiple AI features in one project. This might be a drawback for users with demanding workflows or those creating high-quality, professional-grade content. Overall, though, Filmora’s AI tools make it an impressive choice for social media creators and hobbyists. In summary, Filmora is an accessible, budget-friendly video editor that packs a lot of AI-driven functionality into an affordable package. It’s particularly suited for those creating content for social media, YouTube, or personal projects. With its range of pricing options, Filmora offers a lot of value, especially for casual and intermediate creators who don’t need the high-end features of more advanced (and expensive) software. To‎paz PlayExperience Wonder by Topaz Labs Verdict: A premium AI-driven enhancer that delivers cinematic upscaling and noise reduction for professional-quality footage Link: ‎‎https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-video-ai Topaz Video AI is an advanced video enhancement tool that uses AI to upscale, stabilize, and improve video quality. When I tried it, I was impressed by how well it upscaled footage, even to resolutions as high as 16K, adding a cinematic clarity to older or lower-quality clips. The AI-driven noise reduction made a noticeable difference, effectively removing grain and artifacts that I struggled with in other software. I also found the frame rate enhancement and slow-motion features to be smooth and natural, making it ideal for creating professional-quality slow-motion shots or restoring archival footage. Priced at $299 for personal use and $1099 for commercial licensing, Topaz Video AI is an expensive but valuable investment for filmmakers, content creators, and digital archivists looking to elevate their work with high-end upscaling and video repair capabilities. Ca‎pCut PlayLearn How to Create Amazing Content using CapCut Web Version | CapCut Verdict: A free and versatile editor with intuitive AI tools that make crafting polished content effortless across devices Link: https://www.capcut.com/ CapCut is a free, all-in-one video editing tool that I found easy to use across mobile, desktop, and browser platforms. The array of AI-powered features—like background removal and automatic upscaling—made editing quick and straightforward, especially for creating social media content. The audio-to-text transcription was a time-saver, automatically adding captions that boosted accessibility and engagement on my videos. I liked tools like video stabilization and text-to-speech, which let me enhance video quality without needing complex software. CapCut’s collaborative features were also helpful, especially when working on shared projects, and the library of templates gave me plenty of creative options. Overall, CapCut’s versatility and ease of use make it a great choice for both personal and professional video editing. The best AI video generators for video repurposing Op‎usClip PlayOpusClip 3.0: The smartest AI clipping tool just got smarter Verdict: A smart and time-saving tool that repurposes long videos into engaging, platform-ready clips with minimal effort Link: ‎https://www.opus.pro/ Opus Clip has quickly become one of my favorite tools for repurposing long videos into social media-friendly clips. The AI-driven clip generation feature is surprisingly accurate, identifying the most engaging parts of my videos and saving me the time I’d usually spend sorting through footage. I appreciate how it automatically resizes clips to fit different platforms like TikTok and Instagram without any manual adjustments. Adding captions and even emojis is simple, and I noticed it makes the videos more engaging, especially for viewers who watch without sound. One of the standout features is the \"hook\" identification, which picks out key moments to grab attention quickly. Overall, Opus Clip made it easy to create compelling, shareable content from my existing videos, and the AI features really lightened my workload. Mu‎nch PlayMeet Munch Verdict: Efficiently converts long-form content into shareable social snippets using AI Link: ‎https://www.getmunch.com/ Munch is an AI-based tool for repurposing long-form video content into shorter clips suited for social media platforms. It identifies key moments in videos and includes features like auto-cropping, subtitles, and format adjustments to help optimize content for platforms such as Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok. Munch offers a streamlined way to create shareable content from existing videos, aimed at enhancing reach and engagement across various channels. I found the interface clean and easy to navigate, allowing me to jump right in without needing tutorials. One feature I particularly liked was the automatic detection of key moments. Munch’s AI identifies engaging segments, which saved me the time of manually sifting through my footage to find the best parts to share. For anyone looking to repurpose content across platforms, this automation is a real time-saver. Munch’s formatting tools also make it easy to resize videos for different social platforms. The auto-cropping options adjust clips to fit Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and more, making cross-platform distribution simpler. I appreciated the automatic subtitle feature, which made my videos accessible to a broader audience without much additional work. However, while these features are useful, they lack some customization. I couldn’t manually adjust the selected clips as much as I’d like, and sometimes the AI would pick sections that didn’t feel as relevant or engaging as I had hoped. One limitation I noticed is that the output quality and customization options are fairly basic compared to more advanced editing software. While auto-cropping and subtitles are convenient, the styling options for subtitles are limited, and I missed having more flexibility with transitions and effects. This might be a drawback if you’re aiming for highly polished, branded content, as Munch is more focused on speed and efficiency than fine-tuning. Overall, though, it’s a solid tool for quickly repurposing long videos into social-friendly snippets. If you need a quick way to generate clips from existing content and don’t require advanced editing, Munch is a handy addition to your toolkit. Wi‎secut PlayTurn long videos into shorts with Wisecut AI Verdict: Wisecut streamlines editing by automatically trimming dead space and adding professional touches Link: ‎https://www.wisecut.ai/ Wisecut automatically finds interesting moments in long clips and cuts them, adding music and subtitles. I tested it by uploading a raw clip full of awkward pauses and unnecessary dead spots, and Wisecut’s smart editing removed all the fluff. The auto-cut feature was spot-on, leaving me with a much tighter, more engaging video without having to painstakingly cut it all myself. The tool is super intuitive. It offers handy features like background noise cancellation and even let me choose whether to add background music, which really helped polish the final product. I also appreciated the straightforward interface—it made setting up projects and tweaking settings a breeze. In short, Wisecut has saved me a significant amount of time, letting me focus more on creating content rather than getting bogged down in editing. If you’re looking to streamline your workflow and produce cleaner, more professional videos, I’d highly recommend giving it a try. How did I decide on the best AI video generators?
