Generate Al videos with just text Create AI-Generated Videos Using Simple Prompts Try for free 1. Invideo AI Ready to make pro-level videos without the pro-level stress? Things are about to get easier with invideo AI by your side (even if you’re an absolute beginner). Forget the hefty investment in cameras and gear. With invideo AI, all you need to do is “imagine” what kind of video you want to produce and give a prompt based on that (e.g. create a video on “5 productivity tips and use American male accent”, and voilà – it’ll transform your ideas into stunning videos within minutes! So whether you're a budding entrepreneur, a content creator, or a marketer aiming to build your online presence, invideo AI will be your go-to tool. Best For: Pretty much everything! With invideo AI you can make professional-quality videos for YouTube channel, Instagram reels, TikTok, and other purposes such as social media posts, marketing campaigns, and product demos. Top Features: 1. Extensive Stock Media Library Invideo's artificial intelligence video generator gives you access to more than 16 million stock photos and videos. This helps you easily search and put the right video clips into any part of your video. If you need a specific picture or multiple photos, it quickly looks through this big collection pile and picks the best ones. This makes sure your video looks good and matches the requirements. 2. Text Prompt Video Editing This tool makes video editing easier by letting you fix things with easy words or phrases. It's like telling a human video editor what to do, but it's even easier with a tool. Need to remove a scene, use different stock footage, or change the accent? Just give a prompt, and the AI will do the rest. This makes editing easier, even if you don't know much about editing. 3. AI-Powered Script Generation Invideo's AI script maker helps you make interesting, custom scripts for any video project, which saves you a lot of time in writing scripts. This tool is especially useful for platforms like YouTube, where your content needs to be intriguing enough to engage people & grow your channel. 4. Affordable Voiceover Alternatives The AI voiceover generator is a cheaper option than paying for professional voice actors. It makes a speech that sounds like a human in multiple accents, understanding the feeling, intent, and emotion behind each word. This function makes your videos feel alive, adding a professional look without costing too much. Pros It quickly changes your words into videos, making creating content more manageable. You can spend more time on your work and less on technical stuff. With more than 16 million stock media choices, you have access to a unique selection of pictures. This is perfect if you want to create top-notch quality videos without investing hours in creating them. AI-powered script generation can save you a lot of time in making regular, good-quality video content. It's especially helpful if you often face writer's block or have tight schedules. The AI voiceover generator tool can save money while still giving a good sound experience. This is really helpful if you own a small business or are an individual creator. Cons Initially, you might need some time to learn how to interact with the AI well to get the results you want. However, as you proceed, this eventually gets easier as the interface itself is pretty user-friendly. The free version includes watermarks. But, this is a small worry because the paid version starts at just $25/month and gives you a ton of premium features. Pricing Basic: Free Plus: $25/month Max: $60/month (The yearly plans start as low as $20/month) Sign up for invideo AI and start creating high-quality videos within minutes. Try online AI video maker Create high-quality videos for your business with AI video maker easily Get Started Now 2. Descript Do you need help with problems like evoking human facial expressions and emotional responses or the technical bottlenecks that make the video generation process time-consuming? If yes, Descript can help your creative workflow and enrich the quality of your output, making it more high-end and appealing. Moreover, it also realizes the significance of the human side of video production as it's not designed to replace human creativity but to make it better, to give you a vision, and to let the AI do the heavy lifting. Best For: As such, it's best suited to content creators, podcasters, and filmmakers who need to save time and get things done the right way. Because it is a text-based editing system, even the not-so-tech-savvy can use it. Top Features: 1. Automated Transcription Manually transcribing audio and video is time-consuming. To save time, Descript automatically transcribes all your recordings. Since the transcription is merely a text file, if you edit the transcription content, you can also edit the audio or video file itself. 2. Overdub Voice Cloning With Descript's Overdub function, you can type in the missing or correct text and then artificially generate the new audio in your voice or that of the guest. Creating a voice clone of this type involves using a voice sample to make the process convenient and smooth. 3. Studio Sound Editing Poor audio quality can negatively impact great content. Descript tackles this problem with its Studio Sound feature, which applies state-of-the-art AI to enhance the sound quality of audio files. It eliminates noise, hum, and distortion, giving a cleaner and more professional studio-type sound. 4. Video Green Screen and AI Eye Contact The green screen background editor lets you change the environment behind the video, just like a Zoom feature, so you can have more control over how you present your content. This facilitates the humanizing of the video and adds to its realism. Pros It offers a fantastic transcription tool that can automatically transcribe audio and video files into text in 23 languages. It's a handy platform that lets you cut, rearrange, or alter the contents and simplifies editing. It improves the recorded audio quality by making the spoken words much clearer. This makes your content sound super-smooth without you having to edit out one word at a time. Descript also integrates with other platforms such as Slack (a team communication tool), Podbean (podcast hosting platform), Restream (a LIVE streaming studio), and even Final Cut Pro (a professional video editing application), to name a few. You also get tutorials on using the platform to help you quickly master the features and make the most of it. Cons The learning curve for Descript isn't very gentle for someone used to text-based editing. At first, this may seem patchy, but it is difficult for users of conventional timeline-based editing tools to work. Descript boasts a full range of powerful tools but may not meet the requirements of professional-level video editing. It doesn’t even provide the convenient access to advanced effects and controls that a professional editing package would provide. Pricing is a per-person, per-month fee. This can be costly for teams or organizations with many people, primarily if more than one person uses the software. Pricing Free Tier Creator Tier: $15 per user per month Pro Tier: $30 per user per month Enterprise Tier: Custom 3. Runway Runway is an advanced AI text-to-video generator that challenges how creative content is produced and edited. With more than 30 AI-powered creative tools on offer, it is a versatile product, capable of meeting the needs of filmmakers, artists, graphic designers, and content creators for YouTube and TikTok. Runway AI offers a wide range of features for video editing from trimming cropping and resizing to adding music, voiceovers, and sound effects. You can also adjust colors, and backgrounds can be replaced automatically. These features not only cut down editing time but also open the door to professional-level video-making! Best For: Converting textual descriptions into high-grade images and videos. Top Features: 1. Generative AI Tools Runway ML offers more than 30 AI Magic Tools in its collection. These tools help you create all sorts of different content, such as videos, images, and so on. 2. Text to Video Generation (Gen-2) This is a game changer for video creation. It allows you to generate videos starting from text prompts to bring your ideas to life as you choose. Storytelling, animation, and other videos are all turned into dynamic videos by Gen-2. 3. High-Resolution Image Synthesis With Runway ML, you can make extremely high-resolution images with latent diffusion models. This is a valuable feature that lets you produce high-quality images, making it most suitable for tasks needing fine detail work. 4. Noise Reduction and Image Stabilization Noise reduction cleans up noisy or grainy photos, and image stabilization smoothes out shaky videos. Working together, they make your content refined and stylish. 5. Research and Innovation With generative AI, Runway ML will continue to be at the leading edge. As a user, you can enjoy the most advanced and revolutionary developments in this discipline. This means you are always testing the limits of possibility in generative A.I. Pros You can make your creative ideas into reality just by putting them in text. It provides unprecedented freedom of video creation, making it easy to think of and do any style or concept. The platform allows you to apply the style of any one image or prompt to every frame of your video. This is a very important feature in terms of maintaining your visual style consistency across all your video production. Based on mockups, Runway ML can turn out fully stylized and animated renders. This is especially helpful to designers and creators in creating a vibrant, engaging way to present their ideas. It’s easy to cut out subjects in your video and change them as you like with simple text commands. This lets you easily make specific modifications to individual elements in your video. By inputting an image or prompt, Runway ML can increase the realness of untextured renders. This is useful in creating realistic-looking images. Cons You might require a lot of computing resources and time. More complex tasks or high resolutions result in higher resource costs, and this may restrict its availability to users with less powerful hardware. At times, the input prompt is vague or contradictory, whereas Runway ML may produce artifacts or inconsistencies in the generated content. It may still need further smoothing out and cutting. Pricing Basic: Free Standard: $15 per user per month Pro: $35 per user per month Unlimited: $95 per user per month Enterprise: Custom 4. Fliki Fliki is another great free AI text-to-video generator that also has paid versions, letting you create videos as easily as sitting down and writing a few sentences. Aside from its practical aspects, Fliki is also fuelling a larger shift in content culture. It is just the right tool for creators and marketers to keep up with trends towards video over text and attract their audience’s attention. Best For: Fliki AI has become especially popular with bloggers, podcasters, YouTubers, and marketing experts, who use it to create interesting promotional materials. Top Features: 1. Access to Millions of Stock Media Fliki offers millions of photos, videos, and audio to improve your videos with top-notch images and audio. It's great for tasks like making professional presentations or doing personal creative work, as it has many styles and themes. 2. Over 2000 Realistic Text-to-Speech Voices Across 75+ Languages It removes the need for expensive voice samples and recording tools. It provides an easy and affordable way to change text into everyday, professional-sounding speech in multiple languages and accents. 3. Text to Video Fliki's Text to Video tool lets you easily convert text or notes into fascinating visuals using AI sounds and a comprehensive media collection. 4. Voice Cloning It lets you create special copies for an audience experience tailored to them. This feature is good for making things stand out, personal projects, and adding a special flair to the content. 5. AI Voiceovers Fliki uses AI Voiceovers to change text into realistic voices made by AI. These sounds are human-like, which gives a realistic touch to your videos and doesn’t make them sound mechanical. Pros The tool's interface is quite simple and easy. You won't be distracted by technical difficulties but can focus on your creativity. The audio quality of the voiceover is very natural and professional. This gives your videos a real feel to them, increasing the satisfaction of their viewers. It is also replete with a vast stock library for your creativity, which is one of the tool's real treasures. You'll find a diverse selection of images, video clips, and music alike. This library saves you from the trouble of searching for the right file everywhere by making it easier to track down materials from various places. Cost-wise, the tool is quite economical. You can even get better results with it than hiring professionals to do voice-over work. This reasonably priced special feature makes it ideal for any creators with limited amounts of money but ample amounts of content. Cons It does not offer great variety in pictorial variations. Though many options are there, these still might need to fit exactly your creative vision. You might experience glitches and bugs. These technical fumblings can be a bit of a roadblock to your work but are often just remediable with updates or support services. It provides a limited number of minutes per month at no charge. But that's a limit if you are doing really large projects or creating lots of output. Perhaps you would have to limit yourself and decide when to use it or spend extra for a paid plan. Convert text to video with AI Generate a video with just text Try Text to Video Pricing Free Plan Standard Plan: $21 per month for annual plan Premium Plan: $66 per month for annual plan 5. Visla Looking for the best AI video generator from text? Visla can be your right choice for a storytelling tool powered by AI that makes the entire process simpler. It has been fashioned as an easily accessible and powerful platform for a wide variety of users engaged in marketing, education, and other activities. Its most noteworthy feature is the ability to promote collaboration and improve workflow efficiency to quickly turn your ideas into videos. This lets you use storytelling and communication techniques with greater precision and effectiveness! Best For: Visla is the perfect option for developing and producing videos for marketing and sales, engineering, content creation, social media, team communications, customer service, and even personal branding. This is precisely what makes it so useful for professionals and teams to develop their own strategies for using storytelling to interact with audiences. Top Features: 1. Collaboration and Feedback Visla makes it simple to share your videos with your team or readers. In other words, you can use videos with other people, and you can receive others’ feedback. 2. Versatility for Various Industries Whether you work in marketing, sales, teaching, entertainment, or some other field, it's made to fit in wherever people work. 3. Diverse Use Cases Visla is just good for a variety of these video activities. You can create videos for social media, record personal messages to customers, recap meetings, convert old videos into new uses, or shoot videos for teaching and learning. It's like having one tool to deal with just about any job! 4. AI Summary Visla provides a feature that allows the main points of a text to be immediately grasped. Using AI, it discovers the key points, such as the keywords or main topics, or otherwise makes a long transcript short. 5. Teleprompter Mode Afraid you might have forgotten something or won't do a good job of expressing what is on your mind? This is where the teleprompter mode helps by letting you read from your marks instead of into the lens. This makes you look more confident and you don't lose your audience as you can make eye contact. 6. Community Hub Within the community hub, you can participate in discussions, seek advice, exchange experiences, and even receive ideas from other users. It's a place where you can get to know people using Visla too, help, and learn from one another. Pros Visla gives users the ability to create high-quality videos, working from the most minimal of ideas, perhaps even just a script. The platform can also be used to cover such tasks as writing scripts, narrating in its own voice, choosing the right pieces of video to show, and so on. Its AI-assisted editing functionality can even remove unwanted portions of video with an automatic effect. It has a comprehensible, easy interface, despite its many functions, which means that it can be used by people at every skill level. It allows a first-time user to become proficient with it only really requiring a timer, so that after only 2-3 minutes one can become accustomed. Visla's free subscription plan is particularly generous, as it allows publishers up to 50 minutes of video free of charge every month. This time is longer than most. Of course, there is also a great deal of access to the free version, which offers many of the platform’s main functions. It also comes with all the tools to aid in video production. With narration-assistance features powered by AI, screen recording functions for demonstration videos, text overlays for social media interviews, and so much more. Cons The inability to generate images is one major shortcoming of Visla compared to tools using coherent AI. To make up for this shortcoming, users who want to add this functionality have to feed suitable images to an external AI image generator before importing them into Visla. Exporting videos before downloading them can be very time-consuming. Likewise, the download speeds are quite slow. Even when Visla generates videos itself, it doesn't happen instantaneously, and it can still take a couple of minutes. The computer-generated script might contain mistakes that must be checked and corrected by a human. In addition, since the AI voiceover sometimes pronounces words incorrectly, this might affect the quality of the narrative. Pricing Basic: Free Plan Premium: $24 per month 6. Opus Clip Opus Clip converts full-length videos into short viral videos, and it shines through its comprehensive video content analysis capability. It also determines which parts are most effective and assembles them in easily digestible short clippings. It also employs cutting-edge artificial intelligence-enhanced functions such as AI Curation, AI Virality Score, and AI Emoji Generator to boost the attractiveness and virality of the content. All in all, it provides a great balance between accessibility and advanced, AI-assisted functionality, for newbies and experienced users too! Best For: Converting long-form video content into short clips that can go viral. It uses AI to help you create fun short videos with little effort. Top Features: 1. AI Curation This feature uses GPT-4 Turbo, the most advanced artificial intelligence, to take a long video and pick out the most intriguing segments. The selected parts are then crafted together into an attention-grabbing and compact short clip. Not only can it intelligently choose the segments, but it can also put this into a narrative framework, presenting the video in an organized, entertaining manner. 2. AI Virality Score Using AI and big data analysis of thousands of viral videos, Opus Clip attaches a score for its virality to each clip. With this score, you get a better idea of the potential impact of the cut, and you can use data to make decisions on the best way to maximize reach and engagement. 3. AI Co-Pilot With this feature, you have greater control over the video editing process. You can specify the time frames in your video to clip and make more focused and accurate content. 4. Active Speaker Detection Using predictive AI, Opus Clip analyzes and follows moving faces in the video. This enables you to keep your guests' (or, if you decide to take your own) face in the middle of the video frame. It makes your content more concentrated and professional-looking. 5. AI Keyword Highlighter With this tool, your video captions' important keywords are automatically selected and highlighted which can help to attain higher viewer engagement rates. 6. AI Emoji Generator The power of emojis is not lost on Opus Clip, which automatically adds suitable emojis to your video content. Pros It makes the video production process much faster. In other words, if a video project normally takes an hour, with Opus Clip it could be done in a few minutes. Part of the timesaving potential is especially useful for those who have to produce large amounts of video regularly. With the free trial, you can test the tool without risking any money. You can upload up to 120 minutes of video for free to test its features and determine whether or not it is right for you. This multi-language support makes the tool easier to use in different regions and audiences. This is particularly helpful for creators of content and content generators for whom English is their main language and they’re targeting an international audience or simply working in a multilingual environment. Its useful first paragraph-generating capabilities alone make it a game-changer when it comes to attracting viewers from the start. Cons Opus Clip may be a powerful software, but you would have to invest significant time and effort far beyond just learning how to use the product before you can master its full range of features. This learning curve could be an obstacle for those who need to quickly produce results without going into too much technical detail. Its effectiveness depends on the quality of the input video. If the original content was lousily shot or edited, it might not be able to finely tune it. While customization options are there, they may not meet all requirements or individual preferences of users. For some, this is a drawback, especially if highly personal or unique video styles are needed. The default caption may not be to everyone's tastes and could undermine creative expression. Pricing Free plan Starter Plan: $9 per month Pro: $ 19 per month 7. Colossyan Looking for the best AI music video generator? Colossyan can be just the right choice! It is an AI-assisted video creation tool for streamlining the video-creating process. In particular, Colossyan is adept at creating content of different forms, including marketing videos, explainer videos, and training and learning content, in more than 70 languages. This makes it a good fit for various industries and applications. Best For: For creating interactive and engaging training videos, upgrading presentations into impactful videos, and making videos to help employees onboarding and training. Top Features: 1. AI Avatars With Colossyan's AI Avatars, customers enjoy a huge array of digital avatars of different genders, ages, and ethnicities. These avatars aren't just created as lifeless images but with life-like movements and facial expressions. This brings a bit more realism and engagement to your videos, making them more relevant to your audience. 2. Conversation Feature The Conversation feature in Colossyan is especially innovative as it allows you to make videos featuring two AI avatars talking to each other. This can be used to enhance your stories in your videos, making them more interesting and lively. 3. Brand Kit Creation Brand styles created and saved in the Brand Kit feature can then be applied to your videos for consistency. These include text styles, colors, logos, and fonts. With a brand kit, your video content will reflect your brand's visual identity and therefore look consistently professional. 4. Video Customization Options Colossyan provides many options to customize your videos. This includes a selection of backgrounds (solid colors, stock photos, video clips), a selection of add-on text overlays in various styles, a selection of music from a range of possibilities, implementation of a wide selection of transition effects. Pros The interface is simple to use. So, even if you are unfamiliar with video editing, it will be easy for you. The platform provides a broad range of customization functions, giving users the ability to personalize their videos as they see fit. With a wide range of AI avatars and backgrounds, text styles, and music to choose from, alternative video creation doesn't get any more complete than Colossyan! The platform allows for smooth scene transitions, and the high-resolution output helps to raise the quality and professional image of videos. With a range of pricing plans available to suit various needs and budgets, Colossyan provides an economical solution for many users. Cons The actors are advanced AI-generated avatars, looking and sounding highly lifelike, but the platform is limited to these digital actors. This limitation does not allow users to directly incorporate live human actors or their own recordings into the platform. As comfortable and convenient as Colossyan is, the more sophisticated its customization capabilities are as they need a learning curve. Pricing Starter Plan: $35 per month Pro Plan: $120 per month Enterprise Plan: Customizable Generate AI videos quickly Generate Al videos like magic Get Started Now 8. DeepBrain AI The DeepBrain AI makes the video-creating process less complex, taking the difficulty and cost of video editing out of the equation. All you need to do is, enter or upload a script to the platform to produce a video, which then becomes the main storyline of your video. When your script is set, the platform's text-to-speech feature turns your written word into a spoken story. This is an amazingly efficient process, usually taking less than 5 minutes to produce a complete video! Best For: DeepBrain AI fits best for video production, including educational and training material and marketing, advertising, and customer service content. Top Features: 1.

There are a range of flexible pricing plans, suited to your particular needs and budget. Whether you're a person or a business, you can benefit from the platform's features without the rigidity of a set pricing structure. Cons It has no integration with other software or platforms. This limitation might be inconvenient if you need integration with other tools or services for an enhanced video production environment. If you are on a team or need to collaborate with others on video projects, you might feel frustrated because there is no such mechanism in the platform. Pricing Starter Plan: $30 per month Pro Plan: $225 per month Enterprise Plan: Customizable 9. Hour One Hour One AI is just the right platform to produce AI-generated videos, especially if we talk about the best AI video generator free version available in the market.

There are AI wizards on the platform to help you make a full video from a prompt you give them. In this way, with very little input, you can have a completed video that demonstrates what the AI can do. You're likely to find the platform convenient and fast. If you don't like to learn too much or spend too much time waiting for your videos to process, this might be just the ticket. You can spice up your performance with the built-in voice modulations. This lets you experiment with different voices depending on what you're shooting. Cons If you choose the personal plan, the maximum video quality is limited to 720p. This may be a drawback if you are after a high-definition video. The platform's content moderation system is probably not 100% foolproof, so there is a possibility of inappropriate content slipping through the net. On Windows and Android, you may encounter problems when it comes to feature recognition. If you're using these platforms and want complete compatibility, then this could be a potential drawback. Pricing Basic Plan: Free Lite: $30 per month Business: $112 per month Enterprise: Custom 10. Synthesia This one has been among the go-to favorites of all time among the best free AI video generators to generate content with pre-produced AI presenters. The USP?

It supports more than 120 languages and accents which means you can easily cater to a global audience. Its editing studio is user-friendly, with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface streamlining the video creation process. So, even if you have no video editing experience you can do it with ease without any significant learning curve. Cons The personal plan allows for only ten video credits per month, which could prove limiting to users who require a lot of videos. While the custom avatar creation service adds a personal touch to videos, it can be quite expensive. Pricing Starter Plan: $22 per month Creator Plan: $67 per month Enterprise: Custom Frequently Asked Questions How to make AI videos? You can easily make AI videos using an AI video generator.

Types of AI video generation Text-to-video Veo 2 is PURE FIRE 🔥 \"A small pink liquid monster, styled like a rapper with a backward cap and chunky gold chain, performing a kickflip down a flight of stairs.

The AI interprets the prompt and generates a matching video, complete with movement, lighting, and even physics. This is by far the most popular type of AI video generation. Image-to-video Look at that VEO 2 animates windows wallpaper! pic.twitter.com/qL51V8S4oA — testtm (@test_tm7873) December 26, 2024 Image-to-video AI video generation animates static images, bringing them to life with motion effects. AI can generate smooth transitions, camera movements, or even animate characters from a few frames. Image-to-video models are popular with AI video creators because they allow you to maintain character, scene and object consistency throughout your video. You would typically use these tools alongside an AI image generator like Midjourney. Video-to-video @runwayml has 4K upscaling now! 🤯 I did a comparison between Runway GEN-3 and Topaz Video AI's upscaler, from HD to 4K. Runway's file size footprint is 40% of Topaz (using the Theia model), and after reviewing the results on a 40\" monitor, there's little to no difference in… pic.twitter.com/GamPOXq9mr — Tom Blake (@Iamtomblake) January 9, 2025 Video-to-video AI video generation uses AI to enhance, modify, or transform existing videos rather than creating new ones from scratch. This can include improving video quality, changing styles, adding special effects, or even altering elements within the footage—like removing objects, or replacing backgrounds. Some good examples of video-to-video includes Synthesia's AI dubbing (with lip sync) or Topaz's video upscaling. Th‎e best AI video generator for studio-quality videos with AI avatars Synthesia PlayCreate an AI Video in 4 Minutes with Synthesia ⚡️ Verdict: Easy to use and great for training, internal communications, marketing, outreach and localisation/translation ‎Link: ‎https://www.synthesia.io/ Synthesia is a leading AI video generator that allows you to create studio-quality videos with AI avatars that can narrate your text. It includes more than 60 video templates you can start from, and you can choose between more than 230 AI avatars that speak more than 140 languages and accents. Here's an example video I made for a product launch: PlayProduct Introduction (Free AI Video Template) Synthesia can be used to create a variety of video types, with the most common use cases being learning and development videos, including training videos and other eLearning video production. It also excels at producing onboarding videos and video content for internal communications, as well as marketing and outreach videos. Synthesia is a top-ranked AI software, with 1150+ reviews on G2 and has a rating of 4.7 out of 5. The platform is being used by 50,000 companies of all sizes, with many big names among them, such as Reuters, Zoom, and Amazon. Synthesia is a browser-based platform and I found it easy to set up my first video. I simply typed in my script, selected an avatar from their library, customized my video with the AI video editor, and then Synthesia generated a polished video featuring one of its realistic AI avatars. With over 230 avatars to choose from, I easily found options that fit different tones and purposes. You can also make a custom avatar that looks like you. Synthesia supports over 140 languages, and I was able to create localized versions of my video with ease. The platform even has a multilingual video player that automatically translates videos to viewers’ preferred languages, making it useful for global audiences. I tried adding multiple avatars on screen to simulate conversations, which worked smoothly and could be helpful for training scenarios or role-playing videos. The platform has over 60 professionally designed video templates that make it easy to produce polished content quickly. Features like live collaboration tools allow teams to work together seamlessly, while detailed video analytics provide insights into video performance. Altogether, these capabilities make Synthesia a practical, efficient choice for professional projects. One of its most popular use cases is as training video software, but it's also great for other sales and marketing videos and multilingual content. Th‎e best AI video generators for creative video production Here's my rundown of the best text-to-video and image-to-video AI video generators for creative video production. Hailuo Hailuo Director Mode is so fun. Being able to combine camera shots is just fantastic. Here shaky camera and push in. pic.twitter.com/MfqBA22vm8 — Jerrod Lew (@jerrod_lew) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best free option for creative video production Link: ‎https://hailuoai.video/ Hailuo AI is an AI video generator that delivers high-quality 6-second video clips at 720p resolution. It offers text-to-video, image-to-video and a subject reference feature. Hailuo offers a 3-day free unlimited generation period so that you can generate a bunch of videos for free and really test the tool. Subject reference is a particularly cool feature. It lets you upload a photo of a character and then generate a scene with that character in it. I found the output to be pretty accurate, although I often needed to do some manual editing to maintain coherence. The model can also take multiple attempts to get it right, which will eat into your credits. The feature also often fails at close-ups (wide shots tend to work better but lose fine details). One of the first things that stood out to me was how well it understands prompts. Hailuo seemed to nail camera movements and scene composition accurately. The image quality is also noticeably high. However, generation times are limited to 6 seconds, which makes creating longer sequences more tedious. Al‎ibaba Qwen Another day, another release. Alibaba have quietly included video generation in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max and it's really good. Here are a few examples - check them out. pic.twitter.com/u6qptO59ai — TomLikesRobots🤖 (@TomLikesRobots) January 30, 2025 Verdict: Completely free and produces high quality videos, but often with unreliable generation Link: ‎‎‎‎https://chat.qwenlm.ai/ Alibaba included an AI video generator in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max. It’s a text-to-video only tool, but it’s completely free and I’ve been impressed by the quality. The one catch is that the generation is kind of unreliable. I often enter my prompt and the video generates up to 99% complete and then gets stuck for quite a while. In my experience the videos do eventually finish generating but be prepared to wait a little. The output quality seems to be really good, and while the functionality is limited, it’s completely free and the videos have no watermark. Kl‎ing If you’re looking to combine character consistency with high-quality VFX, @Kling_ai is the best choice. 🎥✨ Version 1.5 absolutely nails VFX. A true must-have! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/rO1WvmLj3k — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) January 12, 2025 Verdict: High quality output, but very long free plan generation wait times Link: ‎https://www.klingai.com/ Kling offers text-to-video and image-to-video features, along with free video generation credits for users who log in each month. Kling brings an impressive level of fluidity and realism to movement in videos. I found the adjustable creativity and relevance slider particularly useful for fine-tuning outputs. Its biggest strength lies in image-to-video generation (and in particular its elements feature), which is far superior to tools like Runway. The motion is smoother, and the AI follows prompts accurately. When I asked for a character to blink or walk forward while the camera zoomed in, Kling delivered exactly what I asked for. If you need storytelling or consistency between frames, Kling is a great option. Kling 1.5 also supports HD, which is a nice bonus. Kling has some drawbacks, the biggest being generation speed. On the free version, I sometimes had to wait an hour or more for a single clip, and I’ve heard of free users waiting a full day for results. This is a major issue if you need quick iterations. On a paid plan the generations are quicker, but I also noticed that Kling sometimes gets stuck at 99% completion and wastes credits. At the end of the day, if you prioritize quality, accuracy, and motion control, Kling is a great choice. The motion brush tool adds extra control, and the first-attempt success rate is high, meaning I spent less time fighting the AI to get what I wanted. Ru‎nway When setting up a shot in Runway, think carefully about where to put the camera. Consider what the camera placement tells the audience about the story, about the character, and about the moment. Every angle is a decision that affects how the audience will experience it. pic.twitter.com/XnijHcb0Jv — Cristóbal Valenzuela (@c_valenzuelab) November 11, 2024 Verdict: The Gen-3 model gives you great results and some amazing advanced features that come with a bit of a learning curve Link: ‎https://runwayml.com/ Runway’s latest Gen-3 model offers a comprehensive suite of creative tools, such as text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video, alongside advanced features like motion brush, keyframes, camera controls and inpainting. On the free basic plan, you can create short text-to-video clips (up to 10 seconds long or 16 seconds using the \"extend video\" feature in the older Gen-2 model) but can’t upscale resolution or remove watermarks. You also can’t generate videos directly from text using their Gen-3 Alpha model on the free plan (only images to video). However, you can still make great videos with just the image-video feature. Here's an example workflow to show you how I use Runway’s free plan to create AI-generated short story videos: Midjourney to generate images Runway for image-to-video Suno to generate music Elevenlabs for some effects Topaz for video upscaling Capcut for editing I found Runway’s advanced features to be pretty amazing. Camera control lets you adjust angles, focus, and movement to achieve a polished, professional look. The Motion brush tool allows you to add motion and direction to specific parts of a video, which is great for creating visually dynamic social media content. Keyframes allow you to configure the starting, middle, and ending frames to create smooth transitions between them. Inpainting lets you automatically remove unwanted objects throughout your clip. This tool handled complex scenes surprisingly well; I could remove background elements without affecting the continuity of the video, something that would usually require a lot of time and expertise. However, I found that these advanced features come with a learning curve, so if you’re new to video editing you might need a bit of practice to fully utilize Runway’s capabilities. I found Runway’s video generation process to be fast and reliable. I think the pricing is reasonable given the platform’s capabilities, especially for creators, filmmakers, and digital artists who want more control and creative freedom. However, the costs might feel high if you’re only looking for basic AI video generation, as Runway is designed for those looking to push creative boundaries and explore the possibilities of AI in video production. Go‎ogle Veo Been generating impossibly dangerous stunts with veo 2 using text prompts. Still surprising how realistic they can look (though not perfect yet). pic.twitter.com/0gETBwGH5y — Ethan Mollick (@emollick) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best option for creative video production, but limited access for now (US only waitlist) Link: ‎https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/ I was blown away by Google Veo 2’s realistic video generation capabilities. Every clip I produced, from a misty jungle scene to a foggy wildlife sequence, was rendered in stunning detail, and the visual fidelity was top-notch. One of the aspects that stood out for me was the advanced cinematic controls. I could specify everything from lens types to shot angles and even adjust depth-of-field effects, which made it feel like I had an entire professional film crew at my fingertips. The dolly zoom and pan shot features, in particular, added that extra layer of cinematic flair that really brought my scenes to life. In my tests, Veo 2 consistently produced more “correct” results compared to other tools like OpenAI’s Sora. The physics simulation is fantastic with objects and characters that move and interact in a way that feels natural and true to real-world behavior. I found that character consistency was excellent too; no matter how complex the scene, the generated characters maintained their look and identity throughout the video. Veo 2 supports high-resolution outputs (up to 4K) and longer video durations too, which simplifies your workflow as you won’t need upscaling tools. The only reason why Veo 2 isn’t my top pick for creative video production is because it’s still not publicly available - you have to join a waitlist and it’s still US only. There’s also room for improvement still, and I sometimes saw some strange character movements in my generated videos. Op‎enAI Sora 🚨 It’s crazy! #Sora just dropped, and it’s already blowing everyone’s minds! 😱🎥 Here are 10 mind-blowing examples showcasing its insane possibilities. 🔥 The future of video is here. 🚀👇 pic.twitter.com/Mcq2OepO3R — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Fun to play around with but needs to improve Link: ‎https://sora.com/ Sora is OpenAI’s entry into text-to-video AI video generation, and after spending some time with it, I’ve found it to be a mixed bag. On the one hand, when Sora works, it can deliver stunning, lifelike visuals, especially for abstract or artistic scenes. Its storyboard functionality is one of my favorite features, as it lets you prompt multiple shots in a single generation, and the “Blend” option adds a fun layer of creativity, allowing you to combine visual elements in unexpected ways. However, in my experience the model struggles with some critical aspects. Sora consistently fails when it comes to physics, general body movements, and character consistency. For example, I tried generating scenes as simple as making cats dance, only to be met with choppy motion, glitches, and overall results that were far from convincing. In several cases, the outputs felt like a gamble: some generations might be passable, but most of the time, prompts didn’t translate well into the expected actions or camera movements. I found that free or cheaper alternatives outperform Sora in accuracy and usability. There’s a steep learning curve, and despite the potential of the video-to-video remix functionality (which I’ve used to remaster some older AI-generated clips), the overall inconsistency is hard to overlook. You can access Sora on the plus plan ($20/month) which gives you 50 videos up to 720p resolution and 5 seconds long, or the pro plan ($200/month) for 500 videos up to 1080p resolution and 20 seconds long. Pi‎ka I had early access to the Pika 2.1 Model, A new journey begins, More clips to follow! @pika_labs pic.twitter.com/rN5OfMacoo — Stevie Mac (@StevieMac03) January 23, 2025 Verdict: The free plan isn’t great, but the premium plans have very good image-to-video features Link: ‎https://pika.art/ Pika offers a free plan that gives you access to Pika 1.5, which has text-to-video and image-to-video features and 150 monthly video credits. Videos can be downloaded without a watermark on the free plan. I wasn’t super impressed with the quality of the generated videos though. However, while Pika 1.5’s video output is nothing special, Pika 2.1 (available on the paid plan) offers an image-to-video feature called scene ingredients, which I think is pretty amazing. With scene ingredients you can build a shot from the exact character, object, wardrobe, and setting you want. It works by using reference images of each element and then providing a prompt. It’s similar to Kling’s elements feature in that it allows you to ensure creative consistency between scenes, which I found made it a super useful tool to produce actually usable videos. Lu‎ma First impression Luma > Sora pic.twitter.com/R2pXVsAesw — The Retro Burn (@burntheretro) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Their new Ray 2 model is great, but it’s a premium feature and it doesn’t offer image-to-video Link: ‎https://lumalabs.ai/ Luma's Ray 2 model has great motion realism and the physics feel really natural. The frame-to-frame consistency is a clear improvement over previous versions and it does an excellent job with cinematic elements, responding impressively to lighting, contrast, film formats, and camera motion. At times, it even seemed to intelligently structure shots. By using highly detailed prompts and running multiple generations, I found that it’s possible to create some truly stunning videos, though it does require some cherry-picking to get the best results. When I tested a sports car driving through snowy mountains at dawn, the scene composition was spot on and the snow, warm light, and camera tracking all felt smooth and natural. I also experimented with close-up shots of faces, and I was surprised by how well it captured emotional expressions, particularly in an extreme sadness prompt, where the eye movements and facial subtleties felt incredibly lifelike. Where Luma stands out is its ability to generate dynamic camera movements while keeping the scene coherent. It understands cinematic depth and framing in a way that makes it ideal for dramatic shots. I found that Luma is great at handling large-scale scene changes. For example, when I asked it to generate a collapsing building Luma delivered a convincing destruction sequence. Currently, Luma’s Ray 2 is only available to paid users and is capped at 720p resolution. Videos can be up to 10 seconds long, but I noticed that after about 7 seconds, scene consistency can start breaking down, occasionally shifting in unintended ways. Ad‎obe Firefly Here's another video created by Adobe Firefly.. a 3D printer, printing a car. Very impressed by the results. https://t.co/L5d8zf3TGv pic.twitter.com/ySylkRlDMS — techAU (@techAU) February 13, 2025 Verdict: Inconsistent motion and limited free use (only 2 free generations) make it hard to recommend Link: ‎‎https://firefly.adobe.com/ Adobe Firefly offers both text to video and image to video, both capable of producing 1080p clips from simple prompts or static images. Firefly struggles with distortion. I tested it by generating a video of \"a cyclist riding through a mountain trail in autumn,\" and while the colors and scenery were nice, the motion was noticeably unnatural. The cyclist's legs appeared to glitch mid-pedal, and the overall movement felt disjointed. Image to video fared better when creating abstract or background footage, but realistic human action remained a challenge. The output currently feels more like digital experiments than polished, usable content. On the positive side, Firefly's interface is intuitive. The built-in controls for adjusting camera angles, motion paths, and shot sizes make experimenting with different styles relatively simple. After generating two free videos, I was prompted to upgrade to either Firefly Standard or Pro for additional generations. While Firefly is enjoyable to explore and has clear creative potential, I’ll stick with more reliable alternatives for projects that need high-quality, natural-looking results. The best AI video generators for social media and YouTube content Fl‎exClip PlayHow to use FlexClip's AI Video Creator Verdict: User-friendly video tool with innovative AI features Link: ‎https://www.flexclip.com/ FlexClip is highly user-friendly platform that excels at helping you create professional-looking videos quickly and efficiently. I love the drag-and-drop editor. It’s perfect for creating videos on the fly without needing to spend hours on intricate editing. I’ve used it to create everything from social media content to promotional videos. The AI-powered text-to-video tool allows you to input simple text prompts, and the AI generates video clips based on the text, matching stock footage, adding text overlays, and even suggesting music. It's perfect for social media clips. While the AI can be a little hit or miss when it comes to perfectly matching footage to specific content, it’s an amazing tool for creating videos when you’re short on time or just need a draft to build upon, and I typically only need to make a few adjustments after generation. The AI script generator is another great feature. While the scripts are generally a good starting point, they often need a little fine-tuning to match the specific tone of the brand or subject matter. This is definitely a time-saver, though, especially when you’re stuck trying to put ideas into words. Another feature that impressed me was the AI background remover. It works surprisingly well. For most images, the background removal is clean, though it sometimes struggles with more intricate details like hair or small objects. It’s a great time-saver when you’re working with product images or need transparent backgrounds quickly. FlexClip also offers an auto-subtitle generator, which is a great tool for improving accessibility and engagement on social media platforms. It’s surprisingly accurate, and I’ve used it for videos on YouTube and Instagram. However, it does occasionally struggle with fast speech or complex accents, so if you’re working with content that has unclear audio, this may not always be 100% reliable. One area where FlexClip could improve is its media library. While it offers a decent range of stock footage and images, it’s not as extensive as some other platforms I’ve used. For niche content, I’ve often had to source additional media from other places. The stock library is good for general-purpose videos, but it may not always have exactly what you need. Ve‎ed PlayHow to Make a YouTube Intro Verdict: User-friendly browser-based video editor that streamlines social media content creation Link: ‎https://www.veed.io/ Veed is a user-friendly, browser-based video editor that made creating social media content incredibly easy for me. The intuitive layout and drag-and-drop functionality let me start projects quickly, and I loved using features like automatic subtitles, text-to-speech, and background removal to give my videos a professional touch. The templates and filters helped keep my style consistent, and with auto-translate, creating multilingual content was straightforward. The only downside I found was that the free plan includes a watermark, and complex scenes sometimes required a bit of manual tweaking to get the AI effects like background removal just right. Overall, Veed offered everything I needed for quick, polished videos with minimal effort. Ca‎nva PlayCreate content fast with Canva Video Verdict: AI-powered video editing with versatile templates Link: ‎https://www.canva.com/video-editor/ai/ Canva is not only a design tool; it’s also a great alternative for creating social media and YouTube videos. I tried its video editor, and I was impressed by how well it adapts to video creation. Canva’s templates make it easy to start projects tailored for platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. One of my favorite features is the automatic resizing, which lets me quickly reformat videos for different platforms without needing to start from scratch. The AI-powered suggestions for text and animations are also handy—it feels like Canva’s tools know how to keep my content consistent and visually engaging. With access to a vast library of stock media and music, I could easily enhance my videos, and the new AI text-to-speech and captioning features were a nice bonus, especially for making my videos more accessible. Overall, Canva’s video editing tools made it simple to produce polished, shareable content that looks just as good as anything created with dedicated video editors. The best AI-powered video editors Fi‎lmora PlayFilmora 14 is HERE! | Introducing a NEW way to edit Verdict: An affordable and user-friendly video editor with robust AI features Link: ‎https://filmora.wondershare.com/ When I first tried Filmora, I was immediately struck by how easy it was to navigate. The drag-and-drop functionality and straightforward interface made it simple to start editing, even without much prior experience. Filmora offers a robust library of transitions, effects, and templates, allowing me to quickly put together visually appealing videos, which is ideal for creating content for social media and YouTube. I appreciated how the platform balances usability with a range of features, making it suitable for both beginners and intermediate users who want to produce polished videos without a steep learning curve. Filmora’s pricing is also accessible, with options that cater to different types of users. They offer an annual subscription starting at around $49.99 per year, and for those looking for more flexibility, a lifetime license is available for around $79.99. There’s also a free version, which is great for testing the software before committing, but it does add a watermark to videos. For creators looking to edit consistently without major financial commitments, Filmora’s pricing offers a good balance of affordability and value, especially considering the powerful AI tools it includes. These plans are well-suited for individuals and small business owners who need regular access to professional-grade video tools without breaking the bank. Filmora's AI-powered tools bring a lot of convenience and creativity to the editing process. I'll run through each one. The AI Smart Cutout feature, for example, allows you to cut objects out of scenes by painting over the area, which is perfect for isolating specific subjects without complex masking. I also found AI Audio Denoise to be extremely useful for cleaning up background noise in my videos, especially when I recorded in less-than-ideal environments. The AI Audio Stretch tool was another handy feature that let me extend background music to match scene transitions, saving me the hassle of remixing or finding perfectly timed tracks. These AI tools are not only time-saving but also elevate the overall quality of the final video, helping users create professional-looking content with minimal effort. The AI Motion Tracking tool was a lot of fun to experiment with—it can be used to track faces or moving objects, allowing for privacy blurring or creative effects like pasting funny stickers over someone’s face to make meme-style videos. Another feature I really enjoyed was AI Remove Background, which made it easy to change the background of my videos without needing a green screen. I could, for instance, place a runner in an outer-space setting, which opens up endless creative possibilities. Additionally, Filmora’s AI Silence Detection tool helped speed up my editing by automatically removing pauses and hesitations, making it effortless to create snappy jump cuts. These tools make Filmora an efficient, AI-enhanced option for quick edits and visually dynamic effects. However, while these AI tools are great for general use, there are a few limitations. The precision of features like Smart Cutout and Remove Background isn’t perfect and might require manual touch-ups for complex scenes. Additionally, while Filmora handles most tasks smoothly, rendering can slow down when working with high-resolution files or when using multiple AI features in one project. This might be a drawback for users with demanding workflows or those creating high-quality, professional-grade content. Overall, though, Filmora’s AI tools make it an impressive choice for social media creators and hobbyists. In summary, Filmora is an accessible, budget-friendly video editor that packs a lot of AI-driven functionality into an affordable package. It’s particularly suited for those creating content for social media, YouTube, or personal projects. With its range of pricing options, Filmora offers a lot of value, especially for casual and intermediate creators who don’t need the high-end features of more advanced (and expensive) software. To‎paz PlayExperience Wonder by Topaz Labs Verdict: A premium AI-driven enhancer that delivers cinematic upscaling and noise reduction for professional-quality footage Link: ‎‎https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-video-ai Topaz Video AI is an advanced video enhancement tool that uses AI to upscale, stabilize, and improve video quality. When I tried it, I was impressed by how well it upscaled footage, even to resolutions as high as 16K, adding a cinematic clarity to older or lower-quality clips. The AI-driven noise reduction made a noticeable difference, effectively removing grain and artifacts that I struggled with in other software. I also found the frame rate enhancement and slow-motion features to be smooth and natural, making it ideal for creating professional-quality slow-motion shots or restoring archival footage. Priced at $299 for personal use and $1099 for commercial licensing, Topaz Video AI is an expensive but valuable investment for filmmakers, content creators, and digital archivists looking to elevate their work with high-end upscaling and video repair capabilities. Ca‎pCut PlayLearn How to Create Amazing Content using CapCut Web Version | CapCut Verdict: A free and versatile editor with intuitive AI tools that make crafting polished content effortless across devices Link: https://www.capcut.com/ CapCut is a free, all-in-one video editing tool that I found easy to use across mobile, desktop, and browser platforms. The array of AI-powered features—like background removal and automatic upscaling—made editing quick and straightforward, especially for creating social media content. The audio-to-text transcription was a time-saver, automatically adding captions that boosted accessibility and engagement on my videos. I liked tools like video stabilization and text-to-speech, which let me enhance video quality without needing complex software. CapCut’s collaborative features were also helpful, especially when working on shared projects, and the library of templates gave me plenty of creative options. Overall, CapCut’s versatility and ease of use make it a great choice for both personal and professional video editing. The best AI video generators for video repurposing Op‎usClip PlayOpusClip 3.0: The smartest AI clipping tool just got smarter Verdict: A smart and time-saving tool that repurposes long videos into engaging, platform-ready clips with minimal effort Link: ‎https://www.opus.pro/ Opus Clip has quickly become one of my favorite tools for repurposing long videos into social media-friendly clips. The AI-driven clip generation feature is surprisingly accurate, identifying the most engaging parts of my videos and saving me the time I’d usually spend sorting through footage. I appreciate how it automatically resizes clips to fit different platforms like TikTok and Instagram without any manual adjustments. Adding captions and even emojis is simple, and I noticed it makes the videos more engaging, especially for viewers who watch without sound. One of the standout features is the \"hook\" identification, which picks out key moments to grab attention quickly. Overall, Opus Clip made it easy to create compelling, shareable content from my existing videos, and the AI features really lightened my workload. Mu‎nch PlayMeet Munch Verdict: Efficiently converts long-form content into shareable social snippets using AI Link: ‎https://www.getmunch.com/ Munch is an AI-based tool for repurposing long-form video content into shorter clips suited for social media platforms. It identifies key moments in videos and includes features like auto-cropping, subtitles, and format adjustments to help optimize content for platforms such as Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok. Munch offers a streamlined way to create shareable content from existing videos, aimed at enhancing reach and engagement across various channels. I found the interface clean and easy to navigate, allowing me to jump right in without needing tutorials. One feature I particularly liked was the automatic detection of key moments. Munch’s AI identifies engaging segments, which saved me the time of manually sifting through my footage to find the best parts to share. For anyone looking to repurpose content across platforms, this automation is a real time-saver. Munch’s formatting tools also make it easy to resize videos for different social platforms. The auto-cropping options adjust clips to fit Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and more, making cross-platform distribution simpler. I appreciated the automatic subtitle feature, which made my videos accessible to a broader audience without much additional work. However, while these features are useful, they lack some customization. I couldn’t manually adjust the selected clips as much as I’d like, and sometimes the AI would pick sections that didn’t feel as relevant or engaging as I had hoped. One limitation I noticed is that the output quality and customization options are fairly basic compared to more advanced editing software. While auto-cropping and subtitles are convenient, the styling options for subtitles are limited, and I missed having more flexibility with transitions and effects. This might be a drawback if you’re aiming for highly polished, branded content, as Munch is more focused on speed and efficiency than fine-tuning. Overall, though, it’s a solid tool for quickly repurposing long videos into social-friendly snippets. If you need a quick way to generate clips from existing content and don’t require advanced editing, Munch is a handy addition to your toolkit. Wi‎secut PlayTurn long videos into shorts with Wisecut AI Verdict: Wisecut streamlines editing by automatically trimming dead space and adding professional touches Link: ‎https://www.wisecut.ai/ Wisecut automatically finds interesting moments in long clips and cuts them, adding music and subtitles. I tested it by uploading a raw clip full of awkward pauses and unnecessary dead spots, and Wisecut’s smart editing removed all the fluff. The auto-cut feature was spot-on, leaving me with a much tighter, more engaging video without having to painstakingly cut it all myself. The tool is super intuitive. It offers handy features like background noise cancellation and even let me choose whether to add background music, which really helped polish the final product. I also appreciated the straightforward interface—it made setting up projects and tweaking settings a breeze. In short, Wisecut has saved me a significant amount of time, letting me focus more on creating content rather than getting bogged down in editing. If you’re looking to streamline your workflow and produce cleaner, more professional videos, I’d highly recommend giving it a try. How did I decide on the best AI video generators?

Types of AI video generation Text-to-video Veo 2 is PURE FIRE 🔥 \"A small pink liquid monster, styled like a rapper with a backward cap and chunky gold chain, performing a kickflip down a flight of stairs. The skateboard spins multiple times underneath as the liquid creature's form ripples and splashes dynamically in… pic.twitter.com/0EEeWlPcHE — Javi Lopez ⛩️ (@javilopen) January 13, 2025 Text-to-video AI video generation allows users to create videos simply by describing a scene in text. The AI interprets the prompt and generates a matching video, complete with movement, lighting, and even physics. This is by far the most popular type of AI video generation. Image-to-video Look at that VEO 2 animates windows wallpaper! pic.twitter.com/qL51V8S4oA — testtm (@test_tm7873) December 26, 2024 Image-to-video AI video generation animates static images, bringing them to life with motion effects. AI can generate smooth transitions, camera movements, or even animate characters from a few frames. Image-to-video models are popular with AI video creators because they allow you to maintain character, scene and object consistency throughout your video. You would typically use these tools alongside an AI image generator like Midjourney. Video-to-video @runwayml has 4K upscaling now! 🤯 I did a comparison between Runway GEN-3 and Topaz Video AI's upscaler, from HD to 4K. Runway's file size footprint is 40% of Topaz (using the Theia model), and after reviewing the results on a 40\" monitor, there's little to no difference in… pic.twitter.com/GamPOXq9mr — Tom Blake (@Iamtomblake) January 9, 2025 Video-to-video AI video generation uses AI to enhance, modify, or transform existing videos rather than creating new ones from scratch. This can include improving video quality, changing styles, adding special effects, or even altering elements within the footage—like removing objects, or replacing backgrounds. Some good examples of video-to-video includes Synthesia's AI dubbing (with lip sync) or Topaz's video upscaling. Th‎e best AI video generator for studio-quality videos with AI avatars Synthesia PlayCreate an AI Video in 4 Minutes with Synthesia ⚡️ Verdict: Easy to use and great for training, internal communications, marketing, outreach and localisation/translation ‎Link: ‎https://www.synthesia.io/ Synthesia is a leading AI video generator that allows you to create studio-quality videos with AI avatars that can narrate your text. It includes more than 60 video templates you can start from, and you can choose between more than 230 AI avatars that speak more than 140 languages and accents. Here's an example video I made for a product launch: PlayProduct Introduction (Free AI Video Template) Synthesia can be used to create a variety of video types, with the most common use cases being learning and development videos, including training videos and other eLearning video production. It also excels at producing onboarding videos and video content for internal communications, as well as marketing and outreach videos. Synthesia is a top-ranked AI software, with 1150+ reviews on G2 and has a rating of 4.7 out of 5. The platform is being used by 50,000 companies of all sizes, with many big names among them, such as Reuters, Zoom, and Amazon. Synthesia is a browser-based platform and I found it easy to set up my first video. I simply typed in my script, selected an avatar from their library, customized my video with the AI video editor, and then Synthesia generated a polished video featuring one of its realistic AI avatars. With over 230 avatars to choose from, I easily found options that fit different tones and purposes. You can also make a custom avatar that looks like you. Synthesia supports over 140 languages, and I was able to create localized versions of my video with ease. The platform even has a multilingual video player that automatically translates videos to viewers’ preferred languages, making it useful for global audiences. I tried adding multiple avatars on screen to simulate conversations, which worked smoothly and could be helpful for training scenarios or role-playing videos. The platform has over 60 professionally designed video templates that make it easy to produce polished content quickly. Features like live collaboration tools allow teams to work together seamlessly, while detailed video analytics provide insights into video performance. Altogether, these capabilities make Synthesia a practical, efficient choice for professional projects. One of its most popular use cases is as training video software, but it's also great for other sales and marketing videos and multilingual content. Th‎e best AI video generators for creative video production Here's my rundown of the best text-to-video and image-to-video AI video generators for creative video production. Hailuo Hailuo Director Mode is so fun. Being able to combine camera shots is just fantastic. Here shaky camera and push in. pic.twitter.com/MfqBA22vm8 — Jerrod Lew (@jerrod_lew) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best free option for creative video production Link: ‎https://hailuoai.video/ Hailuo AI is an AI video generator that delivers high-quality 6-second video clips at 720p resolution. It offers text-to-video, image-to-video and a subject reference feature. Hailuo offers a 3-day free unlimited generation period so that you can generate a bunch of videos for free and really test the tool. Subject reference is a particularly cool feature. It lets you upload a photo of a character and then generate a scene with that character in it. I found the output to be pretty accurate, although I often needed to do some manual editing to maintain coherence. The model can also take multiple attempts to get it right, which will eat into your credits. The feature also often fails at close-ups (wide shots tend to work better but lose fine details). One of the first things that stood out to me was how well it understands prompts. Hailuo seemed to nail camera movements and scene composition accurately. The image quality is also noticeably high. However, generation times are limited to 6 seconds, which makes creating longer sequences more tedious. Al‎ibaba Qwen Another day, another release. Alibaba have quietly included video generation in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max and it's really good. Here are a few examples - check them out. pic.twitter.com/u6qptO59ai — TomLikesRobots🤖 (@TomLikesRobots) January 30, 2025 Verdict: Completely free and produces high quality videos, but often with unreliable generation Link: ‎‎‎‎https://chat.qwenlm.ai/ Alibaba included an AI video generator in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max. It’s a text-to-video only tool, but it’s completely free and I’ve been impressed by the quality. The one catch is that the generation is kind of unreliable. I often enter my prompt and the video generates up to 99% complete and then gets stuck for quite a while. In my experience the videos do eventually finish generating but be prepared to wait a little. The output quality seems to be really good, and while the functionality is limited, it’s completely free and the videos have no watermark. Kl‎ing If you’re looking to combine character consistency with high-quality VFX, @Kling_ai is the best choice. 🎥✨ Version 1.5 absolutely nails VFX. A true must-have! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/rO1WvmLj3k — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) January 12, 2025 Verdict: High quality output, but very long free plan generation wait times Link: ‎https://www.klingai.com/ Kling offers text-to-video and image-to-video features, along with free video generation credits for users who log in each month. Kling brings an impressive level of fluidity and realism to movement in videos. I found the adjustable creativity and relevance slider particularly useful for fine-tuning outputs. Its biggest strength lies in image-to-video generation (and in particular its elements feature), which is far superior to tools like Runway. The motion is smoother, and the AI follows prompts accurately. When I asked for a character to blink or walk forward while the camera zoomed in, Kling delivered exactly what I asked for. If you need storytelling or consistency between frames, Kling is a great option. Kling 1.5 also supports HD, which is a nice bonus. Kling has some drawbacks, the biggest being generation speed. On the free version, I sometimes had to wait an hour or more for a single clip, and I’ve heard of free users waiting a full day for results. This is a major issue if you need quick iterations. On a paid plan the generations are quicker, but I also noticed that Kling sometimes gets stuck at 99% completion and wastes credits. At the end of the day, if you prioritize quality, accuracy, and motion control, Kling is a great choice. The motion brush tool adds extra control, and the first-attempt success rate is high, meaning I spent less time fighting the AI to get what I wanted. Ru‎nway When setting up a shot in Runway, think carefully about where to put the camera. Consider what the camera placement tells the audience about the story, about the character, and about the moment. Every angle is a decision that affects how the audience will experience it. pic.twitter.com/XnijHcb0Jv — Cristóbal Valenzuela (@c_valenzuelab) November 11, 2024 Verdict: The Gen-3 model gives you great results and some amazing advanced features that come with a bit of a learning curve Link: ‎https://runwayml.com/ Runway’s latest Gen-3 model offers a comprehensive suite of creative tools, such as text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video, alongside advanced features like motion brush, keyframes, camera controls and inpainting. On the free basic plan, you can create short text-to-video clips (up to 10 seconds long or 16 seconds using the \"extend video\" feature in the older Gen-2 model) but can’t upscale resolution or remove watermarks. You also can’t generate videos directly from text using their Gen-3 Alpha model on the free plan (only images to video). However, you can still make great videos with just the image-video feature. Here's an example workflow to show you how I use Runway’s free plan to create AI-generated short story videos: Midjourney to generate images Runway for image-to-video Suno to generate music Elevenlabs for some effects Topaz for video upscaling Capcut for editing I found Runway’s advanced features to be pretty amazing. Camera control lets you adjust angles, focus, and movement to achieve a polished, professional look. The Motion brush tool allows you to add motion and direction to specific parts of a video, which is great for creating visually dynamic social media content. Keyframes allow you to configure the starting, middle, and ending frames to create smooth transitions between them. Inpainting lets you automatically remove unwanted objects throughout your clip. This tool handled complex scenes surprisingly well; I could remove background elements without affecting the continuity of the video, something that would usually require a lot of time and expertise. However, I found that these advanced features come with a learning curve, so if you’re new to video editing you might need a bit of practice to fully utilize Runway’s capabilities. I found Runway’s video generation process to be fast and reliable. I think the pricing is reasonable given the platform’s capabilities, especially for creators, filmmakers, and digital artists who want more control and creative freedom. However, the costs might feel high if you’re only looking for basic AI video generation, as Runway is designed for those looking to push creative boundaries and explore the possibilities of AI in video production. Go‎ogle Veo Been generating impossibly dangerous stunts with veo 2 using text prompts. Still surprising how realistic they can look (though not perfect yet). pic.twitter.com/0gETBwGH5y — Ethan Mollick (@emollick) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best option for creative video production, but limited access for now (US only waitlist) Link: ‎https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/ I was blown away by Google Veo 2’s realistic video generation capabilities. Every clip I produced, from a misty jungle scene to a foggy wildlife sequence, was rendered in stunning detail, and the visual fidelity was top-notch. One of the aspects that stood out for me was the advanced cinematic controls. I could specify everything from lens types to shot angles and even adjust depth-of-field effects, which made it feel like I had an entire professional film crew at my fingertips. The dolly zoom and pan shot features, in particular, added that extra layer of cinematic flair that really brought my scenes to life. In my tests, Veo 2 consistently produced more “correct” results compared to other tools like OpenAI’s Sora. The physics simulation is fantastic with objects and characters that move and interact in a way that feels natural and true to real-world behavior. I found that character consistency was excellent too; no matter how complex the scene, the generated characters maintained their look and identity throughout the video. Veo 2 supports high-resolution outputs (up to 4K) and longer video durations too, which simplifies your workflow as you won’t need upscaling tools. The only reason why Veo 2 isn’t my top pick for creative video production is because it’s still not publicly available - you have to join a waitlist and it’s still US only. There’s also room for improvement still, and I sometimes saw some strange character movements in my generated videos. Op‎enAI Sora 🚨 It’s crazy! #Sora just dropped, and it’s already blowing everyone’s minds! 😱🎥 Here are 10 mind-blowing examples showcasing its insane possibilities. 🔥 The future of video is here. 🚀👇 pic.twitter.com/Mcq2OepO3R — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Fun to play around with but needs to improve Link: ‎https://sora.com/ Sora is OpenAI’s entry into text-to-video AI video generation, and after spending some time with it, I’ve found it to be a mixed bag. On the one hand, when Sora works, it can deliver stunning, lifelike visuals, especially for abstract or artistic scenes. Its storyboard functionality is one of my favorite features, as it lets you prompt multiple shots in a single generation, and the “Blend” option adds a fun layer of creativity, allowing you to combine visual elements in unexpected ways. However, in my experience the model struggles with some critical aspects. Sora consistently fails when it comes to physics, general body movements, and character consistency. For example, I tried generating scenes as simple as making cats dance, only to be met with choppy motion, glitches, and overall results that were far from convincing. In several cases, the outputs felt like a gamble: some generations might be passable, but most of the time, prompts didn’t translate well into the expected actions or camera movements. I found that free or cheaper alternatives outperform Sora in accuracy and usability. There’s a steep learning curve, and despite the potential of the video-to-video remix functionality (which I’ve used to remaster some older AI-generated clips), the overall inconsistency is hard to overlook. You can access Sora on the plus plan ($20/month) which gives you 50 videos up to 720p resolution and 5 seconds long, or the pro plan ($200/month) for 500 videos up to 1080p resolution and 20 seconds long. Pi‎ka I had early access to the Pika 2.1 Model, A new journey begins, More clips to follow! @pika_labs pic.twitter.com/rN5OfMacoo — Stevie Mac (@StevieMac03) January 23, 2025 Verdict: The free plan isn’t great, but the premium plans have very good image-to-video features Link: ‎https://pika.art/ Pika offers a free plan that gives you access to Pika 1.5, which has text-to-video and image-to-video features and 150 monthly video credits. Videos can be downloaded without a watermark on the free plan. I wasn’t super impressed with the quality of the generated videos though. However, while Pika 1.5’s video output is nothing special, Pika 2.1 (available on the paid plan) offers an image-to-video feature called scene ingredients, which I think is pretty amazing. With scene ingredients you can build a shot from the exact character, object, wardrobe, and setting you want. It works by using reference images of each element and then providing a prompt. It’s similar to Kling’s elements feature in that it allows you to ensure creative consistency between scenes, which I found made it a super useful tool to produce actually usable videos. Lu‎ma First impression Luma > Sora pic.twitter.com/R2pXVsAesw — The Retro Burn (@burntheretro) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Their new Ray 2 model is great, but it’s a premium feature and it doesn’t offer image-to-video Link: ‎https://lumalabs.ai/ Luma's Ray 2 model has great motion realism and the physics feel really natural. The frame-to-frame consistency is a clear improvement over previous versions and it does an excellent job with cinematic elements, responding impressively to lighting, contrast, film formats, and camera motion. At times, it even seemed to intelligently structure shots. By using highly detailed prompts and running multiple generations, I found that it’s possible to create some truly stunning videos, though it does require some cherry-picking to get the best results. When I tested a sports car driving through snowy mountains at dawn, the scene composition was spot on and the snow, warm light, and camera tracking all felt smooth and natural. I also experimented with close-up shots of faces, and I was surprised by how well it captured emotional expressions, particularly in an extreme sadness prompt, where the eye movements and facial subtleties felt incredibly lifelike. Where Luma stands out is its ability to generate dynamic camera movements while keeping the scene coherent. It understands cinematic depth and framing in a way that makes it ideal for dramatic shots. I found that Luma is great at handling large-scale scene changes. For example, when I asked it to generate a collapsing building Luma delivered a convincing destruction sequence. Currently, Luma’s Ray 2 is only available to paid users and is capped at 720p resolution. Videos can be up to 10 seconds long, but I noticed that after about 7 seconds, scene consistency can start breaking down, occasionally shifting in unintended ways. Ad‎obe Firefly Here's another video created by Adobe Firefly.. a 3D printer, printing a car. Very impressed by the results. https://t.co/L5d8zf3TGv pic.twitter.com/ySylkRlDMS — techAU (@techAU) February 13, 2025 Verdict: Inconsistent motion and limited free use (only 2 free generations) make it hard to recommend Link: ‎‎https://firefly.adobe.com/ Adobe Firefly offers both text to video and image to video, both capable of producing 1080p clips from simple prompts or static images. Firefly struggles with distortion. I tested it by generating a video of \"a cyclist riding through a mountain trail in autumn,\" and while the colors and scenery were nice, the motion was noticeably unnatural. The cyclist's legs appeared to glitch mid-pedal, and the overall movement felt disjointed. Image to video fared better when creating abstract or background footage, but realistic human action remained a challenge. The output currently feels more like digital experiments than polished, usable content. On the positive side, Firefly's interface is intuitive. The built-in controls for adjusting camera angles, motion paths, and shot sizes make experimenting with different styles relatively simple. After generating two free videos, I was prompted to upgrade to either Firefly Standard or Pro for additional generations. While Firefly is enjoyable to explore and has clear creative potential, I’ll stick with more reliable alternatives for projects that need high-quality, natural-looking results. The best AI video generators for social media and YouTube content Fl‎exClip PlayHow to use FlexClip's AI Video Creator Verdict: User-friendly video tool with innovative AI features Link: ‎https://www.flexclip.com/ FlexClip is highly user-friendly platform that excels at helping you create professional-looking videos quickly and efficiently. I love the drag-and-drop editor. It’s perfect for creating videos on the fly without needing to spend hours on intricate editing. I’ve used it to create everything from social media content to promotional videos. The AI-powered text-to-video tool allows you to input simple text prompts, and the AI generates video clips based on the text, matching stock footage, adding text overlays, and even suggesting music. It's perfect for social media clips. While the AI can be a little hit or miss when it comes to perfectly matching footage to specific content, it’s an amazing tool for creating videos when you’re short on time or just need a draft to build upon, and I typically only need to make a few adjustments after generation. The AI script generator is another great feature. While the scripts are generally a good starting point, they often need a little fine-tuning to match the specific tone of the brand or subject matter. This is definitely a time-saver, though, especially when you’re stuck trying to put ideas into words. Another feature that impressed me was the AI background remover. It works surprisingly well. For most images, the background removal is clean, though it sometimes struggles with more intricate details like hair or small objects. It’s a great time-saver when you’re working with product images or need transparent backgrounds quickly. FlexClip also offers an auto-subtitle generator, which is a great tool for improving accessibility and engagement on social media platforms. It’s surprisingly accurate, and I’ve used it for videos on YouTube and Instagram. However, it does occasionally struggle with fast speech or complex accents, so if you’re working with content that has unclear audio, this may not always be 100% reliable. One area where FlexClip could improve is its media library. While it offers a decent range of stock footage and images, it’s not as extensive as some other platforms I’ve used. For niche content, I’ve often had to source additional media from other places. The stock library is good for general-purpose videos, but it may not always have exactly what you need. Ve‎ed PlayHow to Make a YouTube Intro Verdict: User-friendly browser-based video editor that streamlines social media content creation Link: ‎https://www.veed.io/ Veed is a user-friendly, browser-based video editor that made creating social media content incredibly easy for me. The intuitive layout and drag-and-drop functionality let me start projects quickly, and I loved using features like automatic subtitles, text-to-speech, and background removal to give my videos a professional touch. The templates and filters helped keep my style consistent, and with auto-translate, creating multilingual content was straightforward. The only downside I found was that the free plan includes a watermark, and complex scenes sometimes required a bit of manual tweaking to get the AI effects like background removal just right. Overall, Veed offered everything I needed for quick, polished videos with minimal effort. Ca‎nva PlayCreate content fast with Canva Video Verdict: AI-powered video editing with versatile templates Link: ‎https://www.canva.com/video-editor/ai/ Canva is not only a design tool; it’s also a great alternative for creating social media and YouTube videos. I tried its video editor, and I was impressed by how well it adapts to video creation. Canva’s templates make it easy to start projects tailored for platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. One of my favorite features is the automatic resizing, which lets me quickly reformat videos for different platforms without needing to start from scratch. The AI-powered suggestions for text and animations are also handy—it feels like Canva’s tools know how to keep my content consistent and visually engaging. With access to a vast library of stock media and music, I could easily enhance my videos, and the new AI text-to-speech and captioning features were a nice bonus, especially for making my videos more accessible. Overall, Canva’s video editing tools made it simple to produce polished, shareable content that looks just as good as anything created with dedicated video editors. The best AI-powered video editors Fi‎lmora PlayFilmora 14 is HERE! | Introducing a NEW way to edit Verdict: An affordable and user-friendly video editor with robust AI features Link: ‎https://filmora.wondershare.com/ When I first tried Filmora, I was immediately struck by how easy it was to navigate. The drag-and-drop functionality and straightforward interface made it simple to start editing, even without much prior experience. Filmora offers a robust library of transitions, effects, and templates, allowing me to quickly put together visually appealing videos, which is ideal for creating content for social media and YouTube. I appreciated how the platform balances usability with a range of features, making it suitable for both beginners and intermediate users who want to produce polished videos without a steep learning curve. Filmora’s pricing is also accessible, with options that cater to different types of users. They offer an annual subscription starting at around $49.99 per year, and for those looking for more flexibility, a lifetime license is available for around $79.99. There’s also a free version, which is great for testing the software before committing, but it does add a watermark to videos. For creators looking to edit consistently without major financial commitments, Filmora’s pricing offers a good balance of affordability and value, especially considering the powerful AI tools it includes. These plans are well-suited for individuals and small business owners who need regular access to professional-grade video tools without breaking the bank. Filmora's AI-powered tools bring a lot of convenience and creativity to the editing process. I'll run through each one. The AI Smart Cutout feature, for example, allows you to cut objects out of scenes by painting over the area, which is perfect for isolating specific subjects without complex masking. I also found AI Audio Denoise to be extremely useful for cleaning up background noise in my videos, especially when I recorded in less-than-ideal environments. The AI Audio Stretch tool was another handy feature that let me extend background music to match scene transitions, saving me the hassle of remixing or finding perfectly timed tracks. These AI tools are not only time-saving but also elevate the overall quality of the final video, helping users create professional-looking content with minimal effort. The AI Motion Tracking tool was a lot of fun to experiment with—it can be used to track faces or moving objects, allowing for privacy blurring or creative effects like pasting funny stickers over someone’s face to make meme-style videos. Another feature I really enjoyed was AI Remove Background, which made it easy to change the background of my videos without needing a green screen. I could, for instance, place a runner in an outer-space setting, which opens up endless creative possibilities. Additionally, Filmora’s AI Silence Detection tool helped speed up my editing by automatically removing pauses and hesitations, making it effortless to create snappy jump cuts. These tools make Filmora an efficient, AI-enhanced option for quick edits and visually dynamic effects. However, while these AI tools are great for general use, there are a few limitations. The precision of features like Smart Cutout and Remove Background isn’t perfect and might require manual touch-ups for complex scenes. Additionally, while Filmora handles most tasks smoothly, rendering can slow down when working with high-resolution files or when using multiple AI features in one project. This might be a drawback for users with demanding workflows or those creating high-quality, professional-grade content. Overall, though, Filmora’s AI tools make it an impressive choice for social media creators and hobbyists. In summary, Filmora is an accessible, budget-friendly video editor that packs a lot of AI-driven functionality into an affordable package. It’s particularly suited for those creating content for social media, YouTube, or personal projects. With its range of pricing options, Filmora offers a lot of value, especially for casual and intermediate creators who don’t need the high-end features of more advanced (and expensive) software. To‎paz PlayExperience Wonder by Topaz Labs Verdict: A premium AI-driven enhancer that delivers cinematic upscaling and noise reduction for professional-quality footage Link: ‎‎https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-video-ai Topaz Video AI is an advanced video enhancement tool that uses AI to upscale, stabilize, and improve video quality. When I tried it, I was impressed by how well it upscaled footage, even to resolutions as high as 16K, adding a cinematic clarity to older or lower-quality clips. The AI-driven noise reduction made a noticeable difference, effectively removing grain and artifacts that I struggled with in other software. I also found the frame rate enhancement and slow-motion features to be smooth and natural, making it ideal for creating professional-quality slow-motion shots or restoring archival footage. Priced at $299 for personal use and $1099 for commercial licensing, Topaz Video AI is an expensive but valuable investment for filmmakers, content creators, and digital archivists looking to elevate their work with high-end upscaling and video repair capabilities. Ca‎pCut PlayLearn How to Create Amazing Content using CapCut Web Version | CapCut Verdict: A free and versatile editor with intuitive AI tools that make crafting polished content effortless across devices Link: https://www.capcut.com/ CapCut is a free, all-in-one video editing tool that I found easy to use across mobile, desktop, and browser platforms. The array of AI-powered features—like background removal and automatic upscaling—made editing quick and straightforward, especially for creating social media content. The audio-to-text transcription was a time-saver, automatically adding captions that boosted accessibility and engagement on my videos. I liked tools like video stabilization and text-to-speech, which let me enhance video quality without needing complex software. CapCut’s collaborative features were also helpful, especially when working on shared projects, and the library of templates gave me plenty of creative options. Overall, CapCut’s versatility and ease of use make it a great choice for both personal and professional video editing. The best AI video generators for video repurposing Op‎usClip PlayOpusClip 3.0: The smartest AI clipping tool just got smarter Verdict: A smart and time-saving tool that repurposes long videos into engaging, platform-ready clips with minimal effort Link: ‎https://www.opus.pro/ Opus Clip has quickly become one of my favorite tools for repurposing long videos into social media-friendly clips. The AI-driven clip generation feature is surprisingly accurate, identifying the most engaging parts of my videos and saving me the time I’d usually spend sorting through footage. I appreciate how it automatically resizes clips to fit different platforms like TikTok and Instagram without any manual adjustments. Adding captions and even emojis is simple, and I noticed it makes the videos more engaging, especially for viewers who watch without sound. One of the standout features is the \"hook\" identification, which picks out key moments to grab attention quickly. Overall, Opus Clip made it easy to create compelling, shareable content from my existing videos, and the AI features really lightened my workload. Mu‎nch PlayMeet Munch Verdict: Efficiently converts long-form content into shareable social snippets using AI Link: ‎https://www.getmunch.com/ Munch is an AI-based tool for repurposing long-form video content into shorter clips suited for social media platforms. It identifies key moments in videos and includes features like auto-cropping, subtitles, and format adjustments to help optimize content for platforms such as Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok. Munch offers a streamlined way to create shareable content from existing videos, aimed at enhancing reach and engagement across various channels. I found the interface clean and easy to navigate, allowing me to jump right in without needing tutorials. One feature I particularly liked was the automatic detection of key moments. Munch’s AI identifies engaging segments, which saved me the time of manually sifting through my footage to find the best parts to share. For anyone looking to repurpose content across platforms, this automation is a real time-saver. Munch’s formatting tools also make it easy to resize videos for different social platforms. The auto-cropping options adjust clips to fit Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and more, making cross-platform distribution simpler. I appreciated the automatic subtitle feature, which made my videos accessible to a broader audience without much additional work. However, while these features are useful, they lack some customization. I couldn’t manually adjust the selected clips as much as I’d like, and sometimes the AI would pick sections that didn’t feel as relevant or engaging as I had hoped. One limitation I noticed is that the output quality and customization options are fairly basic compared to more advanced editing software. While auto-cropping and subtitles are convenient, the styling options for subtitles are limited, and I missed having more flexibility with transitions and effects. This might be a drawback if you’re aiming for highly polished, branded content, as Munch is more focused on speed and efficiency than fine-tuning. Overall, though, it’s a solid tool for quickly repurposing long videos into social-friendly snippets. If you need a quick way to generate clips from existing content and don’t require advanced editing, Munch is a handy addition to your toolkit. Wi‎secut PlayTurn long videos into shorts with Wisecut AI Verdict: Wisecut streamlines editing by automatically trimming dead space and adding professional touches Link: ‎https://www.wisecut.ai/ Wisecut automatically finds interesting moments in long clips and cuts them, adding music and subtitles. I tested it by uploading a raw clip full of awkward pauses and unnecessary dead spots, and Wisecut’s smart editing removed all the fluff. The auto-cut feature was spot-on, leaving me with a much tighter, more engaging video without having to painstakingly cut it all myself. The tool is super intuitive. It offers handy features like background noise cancellation and even let me choose whether to add background music, which really helped polish the final product. I also appreciated the straightforward interface—it made setting up projects and tweaking settings a breeze. In short, Wisecut has saved me a significant amount of time, letting me focus more on creating content rather than getting bogged down in editing. If you’re looking to streamline your workflow and produce cleaner, more professional videos, I’d highly recommend giving it a try. How did I decide on the best AI video generators? I focused on the following factors when building this list: Quality of Output – I evaluated whether each tool produces videos with the resolution, length, and overall quality required for professional results Ease of Use and Customization – I looked for an intuitive interface and flexible customization options to accommodate different skill levels and creative needs Platform Compatibility and Export Options – I checked if the tool is compatible across devices and offers export options suitable for various platforms Pricing and Free Plan Limitations – I compared pricing structures and the limitations of free plans to ensure they offer good value for different budgets AI Capabilities and Features – I specifically assessed the AI-driven features About the author Content Writer & Marketing Expert Ema Lukan Ema Lukan is a seasoned Content Writer and Marketing Expert with a rich history of collaborating with marketing agencies, SaaS companies, and film studios.

Text-to-Video and Image-to-Video Overview and Prompt Tips Text-to-Video Text-to-video AI models generate video content based on textual descriptions provided by the user. This technology translates written prompts into moving images, creating dynamic visual stories or scenes from simple text inputs. Prompt Tips Be Specific Provide clear and detailed descriptions to get accurate results. For example, \"A young man walking on a beach at sunset\" is better than \"A man on a beach.\" Include Context Adding context helps the model understand the setting and mood. For instance, \"in a foggy, mystical forest\" or \"during a bustling city night.\" Action Verbs Use action-oriented verbs to describe movements or activities, such as \"running,\" \"dancing,\" or \"flying.\" Describe Characters and Objects Give detailed descriptions of characters and objects, including their appearance and actions. For example, \"A pirate with a wooden leg and a parrot on his shoulder.\" Scene Composition Mention the composition elements like camera angles, lighting, and background details to enhance the video's quality. Image-to-Video Image-to-video AI models generate video sequences from static images. Users upload an image, and the model animates it, creating motion and dynamic elements that bring the picture to life. Prompt Tips High-Quality Images Use high-resolution and clear images to ensure better video quality. Describe Actions Clearly state what you want the animated image to do. For example, \"The cat in the image jumps through the TV and becomes a real cat.\" Specify Background and Environment Indicate the setting or background changes you want. For example, \"Transform the image of a knight into an action scene in a medieval battlefield.\" Detail Movements Describe the movements and actions in detail, such as \"The woman in the image turns around and smiles.\" Enhance with Additional Elements Mention any additional elements you want to be included, like \"add fireworks in the background\" or \"create a zoom-in effect.\" Summary Summary Both text-to-video and image-to-video models offer unique ways to create engaging visual content. The key to successful generation is providing clear, detailed, and context-rich prompts that guide the AI in producing the desired output.

Make a Video Updated: 12/10/24 Published: 06/16/23 Videos are integral to any marketing campaign; however, they can be tedious and difficult to create if you aren’t savvy with editing or are short on time. Fortunately, you can leverage many AI video generators to streamline your production and create content that engages your audience. But what’s the best AI video generator for your tasks? This article will explore 12 different AI video generators, their features, and how you can best use them in your next video marketing campaign. Time to press play on easier video creation. Table of Contents Can AI make videos? How to Make AI Videos Transforming Text to Video With AI What makes a great AI video generator? Best AI Video Generators Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video Can AI make videos? Yes, AI can make videos. AI video generators can instantly produce basic presentation slides with text, B-roll, and background music, all the way up to advanced videos of lifelike AI avatars “speaking” to you. AI’s impressive — but it’s not perfect. What works well with AI video generators: Video scripts. Being able to generate video scripts in a few seconds is incredible and saves so much time. Stock imagery, B-roll, and background music. Even though it still requires editing, having multimedia pulled automatically for you by the video generator makes it feel like you have an assistant. Video editing. The video editing capabilities are incredible and often beginner-friendly, which is a huge leap in the video editing world. What isn’t working (yet): Believability. The realistic AI avatars are incredibly advanced, but the mannerisms and articulation make it obvious that they're, well, AI. Pacing. Much research has been done on how quickly a video moves from scene to scene to hold viewers’ attention, and I found that not all generators factored this into their algorithms. Decision overload. The number of video templates, AI avatars, and effects available can overwhelm the editing process. AI is rapidly advancing, and some of these quirks will soon be passé. How to Make AI Videos The process for making an AI video will vary depending on the tool or platform you're using. Some generators work by analyzing and creating a video based on the script you uploaded, while others will follow a prompt typed in by the user. The key is to find a tool or generator with the features you need to create the kind of content you want. Transforming Text to Video With AI When ChatGPT catapulted to popularity in 2022, I don’t think the average marketers knew just how quickly AI video would follow. It needs to be used ethically to be useful to society, but when leveraged correctly, it’s an incredible tool. The most sought-after AI video feature is the text-to-video generator. This allows you to type in a sentence and, in a few seconds, be presented with an editable AI-generated video. I tested this feature using two different prompts: A vague prompt: “I’d like to educate viewers about AI-generated video.” A specific prompt: “I’d like to inspire beginner marketers to try AI video generation. The video should explain the benefits of AI video generators and should inspire viewers to try this new video tool.” I used HubSpot’s free AI video generator Clip Creator, and here’s what I saw. They were both high-quality videos. Both videos had appropriate stock images and music tailored to human behavior. The content was very similar for both videos. After testing many AI generators, I’ve found that a marketer’s time is better spent editing rather than making their prompt more specific. No matter how perfect your prompt feels, the end result will still require edits.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now What makes a great AI video generator? So, how does one evaluate all of the different software on the market? The best AI video tools all have a mix of these different features. Intuitive User Interface While most platforms list a long list of fancy AI features, users need an easy-to-use AI studio first and foremost. This enables a quick editing process. AI Scripts Automatically-generated video scripts save an incredible amount of time when producing video content. They turn written content (such as a blog post, email, etc.) or a prompt into spoken language. Sometimes, they even use an AI narrator to read it out loud for you. Not all software can generate video scripts, but it’s an enormous time saver. To be fair to the software that doesn’t offer this, it’s replaceable with a few clicks in ChatGPT. After trying more than a dozen AI video generators, I found the AI scripts were one of the features that made the greatest difference, along with the next feature. Factoring in Human Behavior Some software have tailored their AI to match user behavior, and some haven’t. For example, most people prefer videos with a brisk pace and visuals that don’t stay on the screen too long. In the video world, this is referred to as “pacing.” Not all software is tailored for this, and as a result, it will produce slow, lengthy slides that feel like a bad PowerPoint presentation. This isn’t a detail that software companies list on their “features” page, but it’s something that’s apparent based on the first draft of the video that the software gives you. Template Library Start from scratch? What is it, 2018? There’s no need to start from scratch with video anymore, as most platforms have built-in template libraries. Bonus points if these libraries include variation in: Intended audience. Aspect ratio. Project type. Editing Capabilities It’s normal for different software to offer different editing options, but most AI studios will cover the basics, such as: Text. Fonts. Music. Colors. Timing. Transitions. Animations. Stock footage. Different video styles. Pricing Tiers (or Free Plan) An AI video generator costs $0 to $50 a month (paid annually). All paid software includes a discount when purchasing an annual package, and the cost of month-to-month service is always higher. I know you’re on a budget — all of the suggested AI tools below are either free or include a free trial/demo. Multilingual Look for software that supports multiple languages if your business requires it. A chart comparing 11 AI Video Generators Chart comparing AI video generators Best AI Video Generators AI video generators have come extremely far in a short time. You can now make professional videos with the numerous text-to-video generation tools on the market. I’ve tried all the most popular AI video generators, so you don’t have to. Here’s what I found. 1. Clip Creator Source Clip Creator is the best AI video generator for beginners. It can be used by someone with no video experience and walks you through the video creation process painlessly. You start by answering a few basic questions (like video type), then provide a brief overview of the video you’d like to create. You can choose from video templates, which are oriented for both landscape videos and vertical videos. Then, Clip Creator uses AI to generate the text on your slides, plus the background imagery. You’re instantly given a video with editable text, stock images, background music, etc. The video creation workflow is very intuitive. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video My experience: I love how streamlined this AI video creator is. Instead of bombarding you with endless features, options, and pop-ups, Clip Creator starts simple and allows you to make any edits you need after it generates the video. Source Pros: Incredibly intuitive user interface, great customization options, and makes for a very fast and efficient AI video creator. Cons: Smaller template library than paid AI video generators, and no advanced features like realistic AI avatars. Best for: Video creation beginners and marketers on a budget. Most user-friendly interface and best free AI video generator. 2. Pictory Source Pictory is an excellent AI video generator for creators and marketers who don’t have experience creating videos. All you have to do is provide a script or article to guide your video content. For example, you can submit a blog post to the AI video creator, and Pictory will create a video based on the post that can be used for social media or your website. Furthermore, you can edit videos in minutes by using text. Pictory also includes a feature that creates shareable video highlight reels that can be used as a trailer or a short-form video for social media such as a Reel. Even better, Pictory can automatically caption and summarize your videos.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: I provided the same prompt for Pictory as I did for the Clip Creator video, and it initially generated much less content (only 1 slide). I went back and instead provided a URL of a blog post and tested the blog-to-video generator. This feature automatically creates video scripts based on a blog post, and using their realistic AI voices, I could have it automatically narrated too. The writing on every slide needed to be edited significantly to be useful, but I was impressed with the options. Pictory supports multiple languages (currently English, Spanish, French, and German) and has a huge library of AI voices. Source Prices for Pictory start at $19 per month, and users can try a 2-week free trial. Pros: Users have a lot of options for how to begin their AI-generated videos, and they can thoroughly customize the video output. Cons: The first draft of the automatically-generated videos needs heavy editing. It may be faster to let ChatGPT write a script for you and use that. Best for: Marketers and creators with limited video editing experience who want to convert content like blog posts or webinars into shareable video content. 3. Simplified Source The Simplified AI video generator transforms a long-form video into multiple AI-enhanced clips with just one click. This allows users to create videos from text and make an entirely new video using its accessible editing interface. Simplified simplifies the way we produce content by providing users with easy access to an expansive in-app library that hosts thousands of templates, all available for free. I like that it guarantees exceptional video quality and pairs this with an intuitive, user-friendly interface, ensuring that users can craft high-quality videos without sacrificing ease of use. Its comprehensive suite of features goes beyond basic editing options to include animation enhancements and multilingual translation capabilities, making it a versatile all-in-one tool for video creation. Users can save their brand settings in Simplified’s “brand book” is a great time-saving feature. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just starting, this platform equips you with everything you need to bring your vision to life. Brands like Bloomberg, DuckDuckGo, and Cashify use Simplified for their marketing needs. My experience: I prompted Simplified the same way I prompted the other video generators, and I was immediately asked to describe my target audience and provide my video topic. This was a nice step toward more personalized videos, but it required more user-generated input than Clip Creator, which had a multiple-choice intake process. If you stick to the free plan, it’s time-consuming to sift through all the features to see what’s free to use. Source Prices for Simplified include a forever-free plan. Paid plans start from $15.20 a month and are billed annually. Pros: If you pay for this AI video creator, you have many creation options at your disposal that not all other platforms offer (AI meme creation, AI image generation, AI carousel maker, etc.). Cons: Not the best free AI video generator; other platforms are more generous with their features. You’re not able to test the text-to-video generator without joining a paid plan, as you’re about to do with other features. Best for: Creators who want to create, edit, and schedule videos for all social media platforms. 4. Movavi Video Editor Source Rather than generating AI videos from scratch, the Movavi Video Editor uses AI to make video editing easier. Video editing can be a time-consuming chore; for many, it’s the less enjoyable side of content creation. However, with Movavi Video Editor’s nonlinear AI technique, you’re not just replicating traditional tool functions but also enhancing your videos through advanced AI video editing. With AI background removal, you can cut out and replace backgrounds, adding a new dimension to your visuals. Plus, the AI noise removal feature enhances audio quality by automatically eliminating unwanted sounds, ensuring your videos are of the highest standard. Source The app also offers a host of advanced options like PiP, chroma-key, titles, keyframing, motion tracking, and more. Following the free 7-day trial, paid plans start at $49.95 per year. Pros: The presence of built-in training rapidly familiarizes you with the software, and it has features that many other AI video editors don’t. Cons: This AI video editor brings high-level tools (like color correction) to marketers, but total video newbies may be overwhelmed with some of the more advanced features. Best for: Creators and marketers who already have video footage and want help editing videos to be more engaging (or who just need to speed up the editing process). 5. Fotor AI Video Generator Source Fotor is an image and video editing platform that integrates various AI features, known for its creativity, intelligence, flexibility, and convenience. Its AI video generator fully utilizes advancements in AI technology, making video creation more efficient and enjoyable. Video creation is often a complex and professional process, but Fotor simplifies the steps. You just need to describe your creative ideas in text form and choose your desired style. AI will automatically analyze and generate a video you’ll be satisfied with. You can also upload images and add descriptions to generate a video. Whether you're an amateur video maker, a professional creator, or someone learning video production with no skills, AI will help you enjoy the efficiency and fun of video creation. Inspiration is important for video creators. Fotor AI video generator provides preset prompts and images, helping creators find more inspiration for their videos. My experience: Fotor’s interface is very user-friendly and simple. you can quickly find the features you need without any distracting ads or clutter. It also provides detailed step-by-step instructions, making it easy for new creators to get started. While creating videos, its preset text descriptions and high-quality images inspired me creatively. They also saved me time and greatly boosted my production efficiency. Source What I found most convenient was that after generating a video, I could perform basic edits directly in Fotor and I could also use their rich AI video tools, like one-click enhancement and beautification, background removal, and object elimination. Pros: The AI video generator supports creating videos in various styles, including Photography, Cinematic, Digital Art, Anime, Neopunk, Game Art, Illustration Art, and more. Catering to various creative ideas and needs. Cons: AI may not always fully understand textual descriptions or emotions and feelings, so some videos may not appear as realistic. Best for: Professional video creators, video creation beginners, social media video influencers, and users who enjoy trying and testing trendy and interesting features. 6. AI Studio Source With AI Studio, users can create videos by uploading their script and using the text-to-speech feature. The platform will then generate a video in five minutes or less. You can manually type in the script or copy and paste it into the platform. From there, you just need to select the appropriate language and AI model and finish editing. AI Studio allows users to select a custom-made avatar that suits their brand.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: New users can input a 300-character script, and an AI avatar will read your script using the AI text-to-video generator. I found the AI models to be less convincing than others; the mouths sometimes moved between sentences, and I think all viewers could identify these as AI. However, since the advent of TikTok’s text-to-speech narration feature, the public has become more accustomed to artificial narration, and there are many situations where this type of AI would work well. Source Prices for AI Studio start at $30 per month. Pros: The platform’s intuitive features make it excellent for beginners with limited or no video creation experience. Cons: The AI Studio avatars are identifiable as being artificial. Best for: Marketing videos that need text-to-speech narration and have visuals for B-roll. 7. Veed.io Source With Veed.io, you can use custom text, colors, font, and music to create a unique video for your brand. One of its standout features is Auto Transcribe. You can upload your video, hit the Auto Transcribe button, and immediately download the script. Even better, there is no software to download, and the platform is easy to use for those without video editing experience. My experience: I entered my “Pinterest marketing for beginners” prompt, and Veed.io quickly generated a short vertical video. The AI video generator automatically provided the script, AI narration, background music, stock videos, and close captioning. The on-screen captions were really engaging, using color-changing text and emojis — perfect for social media. Source Veed.io is free to use for videos under 10 minutes. To access more features, prices start at $18 per month (when billed annually) and go all the way up to enterprise custom pricing. Pros: The pacing, on-screen captions, slang, and approach were very engaging. Cons: The stock video that was automatically inserted into the video was off-topic at times but can be easily edited. Best for: Short-form videos designed to hold attention on social media. 8. Synthesia Source Synthesia's AI video generator enables users to create professional videos without requiring cameras, actors, or studios. Users can generate videos featuring realistic AI avatars that deliver content in over 140 languages by simply inputting text. This makes it an ideal tool for efficiently and at scale creating training materials, sales and marketing content, and internal communications. My experience: Synthesia's intuitive interface and extensive customization options make video creation straightforward. The platform's diverse range of avatars and multilingual support allowed me to produce engaging content tailored to a global audience. The quality of the AI-generated avatars is impressive, closely mimicking human expressions and speech patterns. Synthesia offers a free plan that includes 3 minutes of video per month, 9 AI avatars, and access to AI voices in 140+ languages. Paid plans are available for users requiring more features. Pros: Synthesia simplifies video creation with its intuitive interface and realistic AI avatars. Its support for over 140 languages makes it an excellent tool for creating global content. Cons: The free plan has limited features and is suitable only for basic use. Best for: Businesses and individuals seeking to create professional training videos, marketing content, or internal communications featuring AI avatars, especially when targeting a multilingual audience. 9. Elai.io Source Elai is simple and requires no video editing skills. To use Elai, copy and paste a blog post URL or HTML text, choose a template from its library, and let the generator do the rest. This AI video maker is specialized in corporate learning. Once the video is complete, review it to make any changes before rendering and downloading it. My experience: I found that Elai's format is unique. Even though the AI avatar doesn’t pass as a real human, its small display size makes it feel less distracting. The avatar compliments these videos instead of dominating them. I also really like the audio options: you can upload an audio file of you speaking, and Elai will generate a realistic AI avatar to narrate the text. Source Elai has over 60 languages and 25 avatars to choose from. You can use Elai for free with a 1-minute credit. For more features, Elai’s plans start at $23 per month (billed annually). Pros: As a specialized AI video generator, this tool allows you to quickly create training videos for new hires or product onboarding videos. Cons: Being a platform specialized for educational videos, it would be more time-consuming to create general marketing videos. Best for: Generating videos at scale and creating training videos and product videos. 10. Colossyan Source Colossyan provides a diverse range of avatars who can recite your script in various languages. You can also customize your avatar’s outfit. Colossyan’s key features are auto translations, subtitles, and the ability to enhance messages via screen recording. My experience: The AI avatar options from Colossyan are advanced. You can add multiple AI avatars to a single video screen in the video creation workflow, starting a “conversation.” You can even customize the pauses between speakers. Source There’s a free trial, and the prices start at $19 per month (when billed annually). Pros: The advanced avatar options make this a highly customizable AI video generator. Cons: The sound of the AI narrators isn’t the most natural-sounding. Best for: Creating training videos and explainers for workplace learning. 11. FlexClip Source This AI video generator features hundreds of video templates, AI-generated subtitles, background remover, and a text-to-speech engine. And its intuitive interface makes it simple for creators at any skill level. My experience: I created my video by inputting a URL and letting FlexClip automatically pull content from my website. The AI generator took an enormous amount of work out of the video creation process, but still required editing. The pacing of the video was slower than other AI tools, but I was able to easily customize all elements of the video. Source After the free plan, pricing starts at $9.99 per month (when billed annually, which saves 50%). Pros: The basic plan's price point makes this a very budget-friendly AI video generator. It is also a great, straightforward option for beginners who don’t want to feel overwhelmed. Cons: The AI-generated first draft requires more editing than some of the other platforms. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. 12. Wave Video Source Wave Video is a popular choice among content creators thanks to its many tools, which include image and video assets, text overlay effects, audio, and captions. The platform also provides a variety of video formats for Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and website-based applications. Other key features are: Text-to-video AI. Video hosting. Voiceovers. Text-to-speech. Millions of stock assets. My experience: I tested Wave Video by inserting a blog post URL and letting the AI video generator populate text and graphics based on the content. The video background graphics, pacing, and text populated on the slides needed significant editing to be ready for viewers. I like how easy it is to change the video format and edit any of the content. Wave Video also has many live-stream video tools. Source Wave Video is free, with monthly plans starting at $16 (paid annually). Pros: The features of this software are very beginner-friendly, and the user interface doesn’t feel overwhelming. Cons: The stock images it pulled were lower quality than the other AI tools. The images were blurry and stayed on screen much too long before switching slides (video pacing needed editing). Best for: Livestream videos. Making the Most of AI Video How will AI-generated video help your brand? With just a few clicks, you can create amazing videos, which was unimaginable a few years ago.
