As we write this blog in February 2024, OpenAI recently introduced Sora (not available to public use yet), a text-to-video AI model that can generate realistic videos up to a minute long. Meanwhile, the Google Research team aims to push the boundaries of AI video creation with its ongoing project Lumiere. Consider entering this growing realm? Our blog can act as your guide. We’ve listed 10 AI video generators for beginners with a particular focus on text-to-video tools. We also shared the best practices for AI video making so you can make most of these tools while using them responsibly. Let’s dig in. What is an AI video generator? An AI video generator is a software tool that leverages artificial intelligence technology to create video content from an input. The user provides a text or image, and the AI generates corresponding visuals, select appropriate music and add voiceovers. AI video generators use advanced machine learning techniques to understand and analyze visual and auditory elements. The AI model is trained on vast amounts of data so it can learn patterns, styles and even contextual nuances. Once trained, an AI video maker can generate highly realistic and tailored videos based on input. Pros and Cons of AI Video Generators While AI video generators offer numerous advantages, they also come with certain drawbacks. These tools can significantly speed up the video creation process and make the practice accessible to those who lack advanced editing skills. They also automate repetitive and tedious tasks, allowing more time for creativity. Yet AI-generated videos may lack the human touch, which is essential for building a genuine connection with an audience. They can be misused to create misleading and deceptive content with deepfake technology, a major ethical issue. Therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance between harnessing the power of AI video generators and addressing societal concerns. What’s the best AI video generator? There’s no single best AI video generator as this depends on three main factors: the content type you wish to produce, your level of expertise and your budget. AI video generators excel in different areas. Some specialize in explainer videos while others in social media content. The best tool must align with your content needs. You should also consider your level of expertise and choose a simpler tool if you have no technical background. Finally, you must take your budget into account and decide how much you can invest. Still, whatever your needs are, keep in mind that best AI video generators share certain qualities that make them loved by many. These are: User-friendliness: Is the tool’s interface easy to navigate? This will save a lot of time and reduce the learning curve, especially for those without prior experience. Speed: How quickly can the generator process your input and create a video draft? This is particularly essential for users working with tight deadlines. Compatibility: Is the AI video generator compatible with the software, devices and platforms you commonly use? A versatile tool must easily work with your existing resources and improve the overall quality. Quality of output: Are these AI-generated videos realistic and visually appealing? The tool must deliver high-quality results with accurate scene transitions, realistic animations and clear visuals. Customization: What level of control do you have over the visuals, sound and transitions? Look for a tool that allows you to tailor the output and maintain creative control. Pricing: Does the tool offer flexible pricing plans? It’s important to find a balance between features and affordability. 10 Best AI Video Generators for Beginners Now we’ve covered the key qualities to look for in an AI video generator, let’s move to our list curated for those who are entering the realm of AI video creation.

AI should be viewed as a tool to amplify creativity, not replace it. Guide the tools to enrich your unique ideas and add personal touches to make your video distinctive. Craft well-written prompts. The outcome of your video heavily depends on the quality of your input as AI video generators rely on them to understand what you want. Write specific prompts that articulate your desired content, style and tone. Maintain brand consistency. Whether your videos are for marketing, education or entertainment, this practice will foster brand recognition and trust. Choose an AI video generator that provides customization elements that can reflect your brand’s personality. Add subtitles to prioritize accessibility.

The tool can add auto subtitles to your video in 125+ languages and maximize your reach while staying true to your content. Review your video carefully. Creators must meticulously check the content for accuracy, coherence and alignment with the intended message. Don’t forget to fine-tune elements where needed and consider getting feedback from others before hitting that publish button. Use AI responsibly. Stay away from deepfakes or video manipulations that deliberately distort reality or misrepresent people. Be transparent about the use of AI in your video generation and address ethical concerns if they arise. Experiment, experiment, experiment. The landscape of AI is dynamic, and continuous learning is essential to keep up. Be open to exploring new AI software and their creative applications as they emerge. Frequently Asked Questions Is there a free AI video generator? Synthesia, Invideo and Kapwing are some of the AI video generators that offer free versions with limited features. Remember; trial versions can include watermarks, limit the length of generated videos or reduce access to customization options. We recommend you experiment with different tools before sticking to one. Is AI content copyright free? This is a complex matter but one thing is certain: The rules of the specific AI tool you’re using is crucial. Be cautious and don’t assume that AI-generated content is automatically copyright-free. Always make sure you understand the terms of service of the AI tools you use. Can AI generate a video from a photo? It is possible to transform photos into a video with AI technology. AI can analyze your photo, predict how elements within the photo can move and create a short video with motions by manipulating the image. It can also generate a 3D model from your photo and generate short videos by moving the camera around the object. Can AI create animation videos? Absolutely! Animaker is just one AI animation video generator that serves course creators, HR teams, marketing professionals and more. For example, you can build an AI avatar for your brand, choose from various video templates and let AI work its magic. Does ChatGPT make videos? No, ChatGPT does not directly make videos.

Let’s dive into the exciting world of AI video creation and see how it can transform your content production experience. 2. Understanding Basic Concepts and Tools in AI Video Generation To begin with AI video generation, it’s essential to understand some foundational concepts and familiarize yourself with the tools that will assist you in this creative process. Here are the key concepts and tools to get you started: Key Concepts Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. In the context of video generation, AI algorithms analyze and reproduce elements of video production, such as motion, voice, and visual effects. Machine Learning (ML): This is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions based on data. According to IBM, machine learning models are trained on large datasets to recognize patterns and automate complex tasks. Deep Learning: A specialized form of machine learning, deep learning utilizes neural networks with many layers (hence “deep”) to process data in complex ways. The MIT Technology Review explains how this technology is crucial for generating realistic video content. Neural Networks: These are the backbone of deep learning models. According to Stanford’s AI Lab, neural networks are designed to mimic the way human brains process information, making them highly effective in recognizing patterns and generating new content based on those patterns. Essential Tools AI Video Generation Software: There are several user-friendly AI video generation tools designed for beginners, such as PopAi, Lumen5, Magisto, and Animoto. These platforms provide templates and intuitive interfaces to streamline the video creation process. Text-to-Video Tools: Tools like PopAi AI Writing and InVideo convert text into engaging video content. These tools are particularly useful for turning blog posts, articles, or scripts into animated videos in just a few clicks.

Voiceover Software: AI-driven voiceover tools like WellSaid Labs and Murf AI can generate realistic voiceovers from text, providing a professional touch to your videos without needing a recording studio. Editing Suites: AI-assisted editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro X integrate AI features to automate tedious editing tasks, enhance video quality, and suggest improvements. By understanding these concepts and tools, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge necessary to start your AI video generation journey. In the next section, we will walk you through a step-by-step guide to creating your first AI-generated video. 3. Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Your First AI-Generated Video Now that we have a solid understanding of the basic concepts and tools involved in AI video generation, it’s time to put that knowledge into practice. In this section, we will guide you through a simple, step-by-step process to create your very first AI-generated video. Follow these steps closely, and you’ll have a polished video ready to share in no time. Step 1: Plan Your Video Content Before diving into the tools, it’s important to plan out the content of your video. Consider the following elements: Purpose: Determine the goal of your video. Are you trying to educate, entertain, or promote something? Audience: Identify who your target audience is. This will help shape the tone and style of your video. Message: Decide on the key message or story you want to convey. Keep it clear and concise. Script: Write a simple script or outline for your video. This will serve as a blueprint for your AI video generation process. Step 2: Select an AI Video Generation Tool Choose a beginner-friendly AI video generation tool from the options discussed earlier. For this guide, we’ll explore PopAi, a versatile AI video generation platform that offers: Text-to-video conversion capabilities Image-to-video transformation Custom text-to-image generation Flexible style and size options Easy sharing features with friends and colleagues While we’ll focus on PopAi, the principles can be applied to other tools as well. Step 3: Create a New Project Once you’ve signed up and logged in to PopAi: Choose Your Creation Type: Select whether you want to: Generate a video from text Transform existing images into videos Create custom images from text prompts Configure Your Settings: Select your preferred: Style preferences Output size and format Additional customization options Step 4: Input Your Script Using your prepared script, input the text into the tool. Lumen5 offers a simple way to do this: Copy and Paste Your Script: Paste your script into the text box provided. The tool will automatically divide your script into scenes based on natural pauses and sentence breaks. Refine Scene Text: Adjust the text for each scene to ensure it’s concise and impactful. You can edit it directly within the tool. Step 5: Choose Media Elements Next, you’ll want to choose images, video clips, and other media to accompany your text. Lumen5 provides a vast library of royalty-free media assets: Search for Media: Use the search bar to find relevant images and video clips. Keywords related to your script can help filter the results. Drag and Drop: Simply drag and drop the selected media into the corresponding scenes. The tool will help format them to fit the template. Step 6: Add Voiceover and Music To enhance your video, consider adding a voiceover and background music: Voiceover Tool: If using a text-to-speech tool like Murf AI or WellSaid Labs, input your script and generate a voiceover. Download the audio file and upload it to your video project. Background Music: Browse the provided music library within Lumen5 or upload your own music. Keep in mind the mood and tone you want to set for your audience. Step 7: Customize and Preview Make final adjustments to your video to ensure it meets your vision: Edit Scenes: Rearrange, add, or delete scenes as needed. Fine-tune the text, media, and timing for each scene. Preview: Use the preview function to watch your video. Look for any inconsistencies or areas that need improvement. Apply Effects: Add transition effects, filters, and other visual enhancements to make your video more dynamic. Step 8: Export and Share Once satisfied with your video, it’s time to export and share it: Export Settings: Choose the appropriate export settings (resolution, format, etc.) based on where you plan to share the video (e.g., social media, websites, presentations). Download: Download the finalized video file to your computer or directly link it to your social media accounts for instant sharing. By following these steps, you have created an engaging AI-generated video from scratch. Whether it’s for a personal project, marketing campaign, or educational content, AI tools make the video creation process accessible and efficient for beginners.

Exploring Features and Customization Options AI video generation tools come packed with a variety of features and customization options that can help you create unique and professional videos. In this section, we’ll delve into some of the key features available on most platforms and how you can use them to enhance your video content. Customizable Templates One of the biggest advantages of AI video generation tools is the availability of customizable templates. These templates are designed to suit different types of videos, such as promotional content, educational tutorials, social media posts, and more. Here’s how to make the most of customizable templates: Theme Selection: Choose a theme that aligns with your video’s purpose and brand identity. Themes often come with pre-set color schemes, fonts, and styling that can save you time. Personalization: Modify the template to fit your specific needs. You can change colors, fonts, and layouts to reflect your brand or the message of your video. Scene Adaptation: Tailor the scenes within the template to better convey your story. Replace placeholder text and images with your own content, and rearrange scenes as necessary. Advanced Editing Tools While AI tools automate much of the video creation process, they also offer advanced editing features for those who want more control over their final product. Here are some of those tools: Timeline Editing: This feature allows you to precisely control the timing of each scene, transition, and media element. You can adjust the duration of scenes and the pace of transitions to better align with your narrative flow. Text Animations: Enhance your text with animation effects. You can add motion to your titles, subtitles, or any on-screen text to make it more engaging. Layering: Some AI tools allow you to layer different media elements, such as images, video clips, and text. This can help you create a more complex and visually appealing video. Interactive Elements To make your videos more engaging, explore adding interactive elements: Clickable Links: Include clickable elements within your video that direct viewers to additional resources, your website, or social media profiles. Surveys and Polls: Some platforms allow you to incorporate interactive polls or surveys to get feedback from your audience or gather data. Call-to-Action Buttons: Incorporate call-to-action buttons that encourage specific actions, such as subscribing to your channel, downloading a resource, or making a purchase.

Adobe Premiere Pro | Best AI Software to Create Videos Pros Best all round video editor Cloud-syncing for backups Free trial available Colour matching speeds up edits Auto reframing useful for social media Cons Subscription based model Steep learning curve Requires high computer specs download Not only is Premiere Pro my pick of the best video editing software, but it’s now my favourite AI video app too. With the latest version you can download using the button above, you’ll get some crazy powerful AI tools to make creating high quality videos a cinch. Colour Match allows you to match the colours in two different clips in your sequence to help get rid of any discrepancies between different shots in the same scene – really useful if you use two different cameras. The Auto Reframe tool is a godsend for social media video content, allowing you to change horizontal 16:9 video footage into a tall 9:16 aspec ratio, perfect for instagram Stories or YouTube Shorts. If you shoot interviews, the auto audio ducking feature uses AI to lower the volume of music when dialogue is happening Adobe Sensei is the ‘brain’ behind the AI in Premiere Pro, providing other features such as Auto Classification which tags your footage and Morph Cut which smoothes out jump cuts. Overall, even if you didn’t use any of the AI video features in Premiere Pro, you’d still be left with the top editing software of the year – start by downloading a free trial and see what you think. How to Download Adobe Premiere Pro 2. Topaz Video AI | Photography AI Tool for Enlargements Pros Extremely powerful video editing tool Free trial available Upscaling, image stabilization, and slow-motion capabilities Can generate multiple previews at the same time Cons Relatively expensive download Simply put, Topaz Video AI is a standalone desktop video editing application that makes your videos look better. Drag and drop your video into the software, select from the menu of presets, and let the deep-learning robot minds cast their magic. You can even upscale your footage. That means that all your grainy, blurry old 1080p film can now be enhanced to 4K or 8K. You can also render your footage in slow motion which can be handy if you forgot to shoot in the correct frame rate: Let’s say you shot at 24 fps – give Topaz that video and the AI will create new frames between the actual frames you shot, so your 24 fps could become 60 fps, and you can slow it right down. The program also has two types of image stabilization to help you produce engaging videos: The first crops into your footage to create this effect, and the other is image-aware and will fill in the missing gaps around the edges of your video so that the field of view doesn’t change. With this powerful AI video editing software, you can tweak just about any setting you’d want to use to enhance the quality of your footage – the frame rate, the amount of grain, or the sharpness. Not only that, you can create your own custom presets for adding to future videos. Topaz Video AI Review 3. Filmora | Affordable AI Video Maker Pros Simple, easy-to-use interface Good suite of AI tools Subscription or perpetual license options Affordable Cons Doesn’t have the slick feel of some competitors download As well as giving you all the tools you’d expect from a video editing suite, for adding templates, titles and subtitles, and for making adjustments to the video and audio tracks, Filmora also has some fantastic AI tools. You can adjust your footage’s aspect ratio, upscale video resolution from lowly 1080p to, for example, 4K, and change your frame rate to make fast video slow and slow video fast. Other AI tools include their chroma key, which enables you to remove specific background colours. This is especially useful for green screen footage, to make the background transparent so that you can add other media. AI portrait does essentially the same thing and removes even complex backgrounds from behind subjects. Added to that, Filmora has AI image stabilization, and lens correction to help you sort out any irritating distortion your lens might have gifted you. In general, Filmora is my recommended video editing software for beginners – it may not have every feature of Final Cut or Adobe Premiere for video creation, but for the price, it can’t be beaten. Filmora Review Best green screen software 4. Deep Brain | Text to Speech AI Video Tools Pros Innovative AI human technology Multi-language text-to-speech solutions Wide application across sectors Free online AI video editor Highly customizable avatars Cons Learning curve download DeepBrain AI stands out in the field of artificial intelligence with its cutting-edge AI human technology. It excels at creating real-time, interactive artificial humans that can be employed in various domains, such as customer service, virtual assistance, and educational content delivery. Their service enables the use of AI avatars that are customizable to suit different business needs, providing a unique interactive experience for end-users. It’s particularly beneficial for enterprises looking to scale their operations with AI while maintaining a human-like touch in their customer engagement strategies. 5. Fliki | Best AI Video Generator Pros Simple workflow to convert ideas, scripts, blogs, PPT, product URLs, and tweets into videos 2000+ AI voices in 75+ languages and 100+ dialects First in the industry to offer AI-generated video clips High-quality avatars with voice cloning in 29 languages Translate/Dub videos in 75+ Languages Intuitive and easy-to-use interface Cons Require a paid subscription for premium features download Fliki is a groundbreaking text to video AI tool perfect for transforming text into engaging videos with professional voiceovers. Its user-friendly design makes it accessible even to those with little technical experience, allowing them to produce high-quality video content effortlessly. Fliki’s extensive voice selection, available in 75+ languages and over 100 dialects, provides unparalleled personalization options. It also offers advanced voice cloning in 29 languages, and it leads the industry with its unique AI video clips—just input text and watch as Fliki’s AI crafts distinct video content akin to OpenAI’s Sora technology. Whether you’re a content creator, a marketer, or just someone with a personal project, Fliki AI Video Generator provides the tools and flexibility needed to produce visually appealing and impactful videos. 6. Veed.io Pros Good for beginners Easy to learn Range of templates and tools Speech to subtitles feature Cons Some features are only available in higher price plans download One of the best AI video editing options for beginners is Veed.io. It has an extremely simple and easy-to-learn interface, but despite this, it still packs a punch. Veed.io has many of the features of the previous two video editing software programs in this article. With it, you can change the frame rate to speed up or slow down your footage, and you can also remove backgrounds with a single click. Something it’s well-known for is its AI-powered speech to subtitles tool, which accurately transcribes in moments, saving you potential hours of work. And there’s also the text-to-speech feature. With this, you can give your video a voiceover without manually recording your own voice, and you can choose from a range of voice profiles and accents. I’ve included Veed in this list of the best AI video software because I’ve spent many a day transcribing videos manually, and know how frustrating it can be. What is an AI camera? 7. Synthesia Pros Easy way to make presentations Powerful, simple-to-use tool Impressive range of features Affordable AI video creation platform Cons Limited, specialized use case download Synthesia specializes in speech-to-video creation using artificial intelligence to create engaging videos. They give you a range of templates and amazingly lifelike avatars which you can make say anything you want – ideal for creating YouTube videos you don’t want to appear in. Whatever you type, they can say in a range of accents, using diction and, in the most recent iteration, gestures. It’s spooky how realistic it all sounds – even if you don’t have any staff or any desire to appear in YouTube videos yourself, Synthesia can help with your video creation. You can add a background behind your avatar, add a music track, and use a range of other tools to make the video your own. How can AI benefit photography? 8. InVideo Pros Easy to use and learn Simple but powerful Simple, two-tier pricing Article-to-text feature Cons Only the highest membership tiers have access to the best video and image libraries download This software shares a lot in look and feel with Veed.io. It has a super-simple, clean interface that is very easy to navigate. It also has a vast bank of templates for a range of needs from sports to marketing, to help you kick things off. One of its most impressive features is the AI-powered article-to-text tool. With this, you can copy and paste an article into the tool, and it will scrape the text to extract the main ideas, and then create concise content around these. It can create a unique video from an article too. Let’s say I wanted to make a video from this article – I could just paste the URL into InVid, and the video would be created for me! This makes it the best AI video tool for batch creating multiple clips from a blog. Like Veed.io, InVideo also offers automated text-to-speech. No more need to record voiceovers, all thanks to the power of video artificial intelligence. What’s the best mobile video editing app for iPhone and Android? 9. Descript Pros Unique product Powerful editing tools Edit video with text Slick interface Cons It’s not for everyone, but that’s just me trying to find something to say download One for the podcasters. A powerful speech-to-text editor that will save you time by allowing you to edit automatically transcribed text and video voiceover at the same time. Simply put, you can record yourself, your voice and your face, and Descript uses AI to make a video and a written script from this. You can then edit that script, for example shortening long pauses in your speech, removing filler and thinking words, or removing whole phrases. Whatever you remove is also removed from the recorded footage, thereby seamlessly editing your video with AI. The software also allows you to sync your visuals with specific moments in the script, and there’s a toolbar to help you collaborate on a project with a team. Add to that powerful video editing features such as the ability to grade colours, remove backgrounds, and beef up sound quality, and you have yourself a winner. 10. FlexClip Pros Interface good for beginners Great template and stock library AI speech to text AI text to speech Cons Limited tools for pros Only exports to 1080p download This software is rich in templates and has an impressive amount of stock imagery and video you can use to inspire or pad out your videos. The interface is very simple – it’s the best AI video editing software I tested for beginners, who will get the hang of it very easily. Once you have your footage uploaded, you have the standard range of editing tools to work with, to make your video look exactly as you want it to. You can adjust the brightness, and the speed, you can flip it around, trim it, or use FlexClip’s range of filters to automatically adjust the colours. In terms of AI video creation features, there’s speech-to-text, which can quickly generate subtitles, and text-to-speech, which can help you make natural-sounding voiceovers. 11. Rawshorts Pros Good library of resources Timesaver for small businesses Text to animation Automatic voice generator Cons Free version is quite limited download This powerful tool is specifically for people who want to make video animations. Write a script (or get ChatGPT to do that for you!) and paste it into the program. The software will then generate a voiceover, scrape your text for the main ideas, and then use those to make a coherent, animated storyboard. You’ve probably seen these types of animations used on software product sales pages to explain how to use the software. This type of animation can cost thousands of dollars to produce (not to mention countless hours of drawing), but now thanks to AI, you can do it for a fraction of the time and cost. If you need to create videos for small businesses, you can imagine how much easier this clever AI video tool can make your work. 12. Lumen 5 Pros Quick and easy tool to use Text to video Good range of editing tools Cons Free version is very limited download This nifty AI video editing softwa re software helps you automatically transform blog posts, Zoom calls, or articles, into video. It’s super easy to do. For example, just paste your blog article URL into the program, and it will extract the key points to match them with relevant text and video. From there, you can tweak what you want, edit text, and swap out photos and videos from Lumen 5’s online library. You can also make talking head videos and enhance your videos with callouts and cutaways. My favourite feature is the ability to select words in the transcript (auto-generated by AI, of course!), then match the visuals directly to the timing of the audio. For video creation for social media, which often needs captions timed to voice over or talking heads, this AI video app is insanely useful. 13. SyntheSys Pros Professional-level software Text-to-video capabilities Easy-to-use dashboard Cons More expensive than other text-to-video competitors download Using SyntheSys, you can get a lifelike avatar to present a video for you, generated from text, or create a natural-sounding voiceover track. They have a library of male and female avatars, and their technology allows them to use gestures, and natural voice tones, and speak in 145 languages. It’s a great tool for businesses, or anyone wanting to quickly create human-looking and -sounding content for commercial purposes. Whether you want to remain anonymous in your video clips or simply prefer to use someone else, AI video generators like this can help speed up your video creation process. What Is the Best AI Tool to Create Videos? It really depends on what kind of video you want to create, as there is quite a diverse range of AI video generators out there for different use cases. A cinematographer or videographer is more likely to need a tool with the power and scope of Topaz Video AI or Filmora. These can really help you dive deep into your footage and create something extraordinary for professional videos. Veed.io and InVid are best for beginners or those who perhaps need video clips for personal use or smaller scale production edits. Then there are the tools that are better for small businesses, YouTubers, or for commercial use. Descript is a great tool for Youtubers and podcasters to clean up their script and video, whereas Rawshorts will help you create an animation from your script. Those looking for AI to make them a voiceover or a complete presentation with a video or even an avatar will need something different again. Lumen 5, for example, will help you create high quality videos like these, while Synthesia or SyntheSys will generate a presentation for you with a human-ish presenter. How Does an AI Video Generator Work? The computer science behind the nuts and bolts of AI video generation is beyond both my human intelligence and the scope of this article. But in simple terms, what I understand of it is that machine-learning, the machine who has learned – which is a way of saying ‘an extremely powerful computer’ – knowing language on some robotic, mathematical level, scrapes the text and converts it into computer language: numbers. As computers understand everything in these terms, the combinations of numbers it receives from the text will correspond to number patterns within videos that express the same ideas as the text. They will match. And thus, a video is born. AI Video Editing Software FAQ s What is the best AI tool to create videos? For creating videos and ease of use, I’d have to say Lumen 5 for enabling you to quickly make a coherent video from text, or SyntheSys for creating realistic avatar-led video presentations. For specific edits, Topaz Video AI can’t be beaten. Is there an AI that edits videos? Yes. For example, Topaz AI and Filmora both help you edit your videos. You can use image stabilization, change the frame rate to create natural-looking slow-motion effects, upscale your videos, and do many more things that only a year or so ago, weren’t possible. How do I know if a video was created by AI? With many ai video editing tools, you simply won’t know, and that’s increasingly the case. The AI tools in Topaz Video AI are so powerful there’s really no way of telling if that slow-motion video was originally filmed at 60 fps or 24 fps. Likewise, the human avatar you can use to give your video presentations can use natural gestures, voice tones and intonation, which can make it very difficult to know if they’re real or not. Take for example, the Deep Fake video below: It’s certainly very hard to spot if the video creation was by AI or if it was actual footage. What AI video app is everyone using? Everyone is using all of them! All of the video apps in this article are being used by someone, somewhere to save time, to be more efficient, and to create something more compelling for a variety of use cases. If I had to choose one, I’d say it was Topaz Video AI, just because that’s the world I come from, and I know that it’s a very popular resource. For another use case, I’d find it hard to believe that most podcasters weren’t using Descript, as it’s such a powerful and powerfully specialised tool. Is Synthesia Ai video free to use? No, it’s not. Synthesia is only offered on a subscription basis. AI Video Editing Tools: Final Words So there you go. Honestly, even though I wrote this article myself, my mind is a little blown. AI is so new, but it can already do so much. It’s hard to know where it’s going to lead, but although that’s a little terrifying, it’s also exciting. Especially if you’re working with video. The AI video generators and tools available to you are so powerful that they will change the way you film and the way you think about filming. Cinematographers can make 8K cinematic, slow-motion, fully stabilized footage from 1080p footage filmed on an old camera. YouTubers can make video content of themselves with all their thinking words removed. Businesses can make promo videos, voiceovers or video presentations without hiring voiceover artists. It’s head-spinning! Doesn’t it make you want to create AI generated videos just to see how incredible the technology has become? If you’re not already using AI video generators in some form, it definitelt feels like right now is the time to start.

Generate Al videos with just text Create AI-Generated Videos Using Simple Prompts Try for free 1. Invideo AI Ready to make pro-level videos without the pro-level stress? Things are about to get easier with invideo AI by your side (even if you’re an absolute beginner). Forget the hefty investment in cameras and gear. With invideo AI, all you need to do is “imagine” what kind of video you want to produce and give a prompt based on that (e.g. create a video on “5 productivity tips and use American male accent”, and voilà – it’ll transform your ideas into stunning videos within minutes! So whether you're a budding entrepreneur, a content creator, or a marketer aiming to build your online presence, invideo AI will be your go-to tool. Best For: Pretty much everything! With invideo AI you can make professional-quality videos for YouTube channel, Instagram reels, TikTok, and other purposes such as social media posts, marketing campaigns, and product demos. Top Features: 1. Extensive Stock Media Library Invideo's artificial intelligence video generator gives you access to more than 16 million stock photos and videos. This helps you easily search and put the right video clips into any part of your video. If you need a specific picture or multiple photos, it quickly looks through this big collection pile and picks the best ones. This makes sure your video looks good and matches the requirements. 2. Text Prompt Video Editing This tool makes video editing easier by letting you fix things with easy words or phrases. It's like telling a human video editor what to do, but it's even easier with a tool. Need to remove a scene, use different stock footage, or change the accent? Just give a prompt, and the AI will do the rest. This makes editing easier, even if you don't know much about editing. 3. AI-Powered Script Generation Invideo's AI script maker helps you make interesting, custom scripts for any video project, which saves you a lot of time in writing scripts. This tool is especially useful for platforms like YouTube, where your content needs to be intriguing enough to engage people & grow your channel. 4. Affordable Voiceover Alternatives The AI voiceover generator is a cheaper option than paying for professional voice actors. It makes a speech that sounds like a human in multiple accents, understanding the feeling, intent, and emotion behind each word. This function makes your videos feel alive, adding a professional look without costing too much. Pros It quickly changes your words into videos, making creating content more manageable. You can spend more time on your work and less on technical stuff. With more than 16 million stock media choices, you have access to a unique selection of pictures. This is perfect if you want to create top-notch quality videos without investing hours in creating them. AI-powered script generation can save you a lot of time in making regular, good-quality video content. It's especially helpful if you often face writer's block or have tight schedules. The AI voiceover generator tool can save money while still giving a good sound experience. This is really helpful if you own a small business or are an individual creator. Cons Initially, you might need some time to learn how to interact with the AI well to get the results you want. However, as you proceed, this eventually gets easier as the interface itself is pretty user-friendly. The free version includes watermarks. But, this is a small worry because the paid version starts at just $25/month and gives you a ton of premium features. Pricing Basic: Free Plus: $25/month Max: $60/month (The yearly plans start as low as $20/month) Sign up for invideo AI and start creating high-quality videos within minutes. Try online AI video maker Create high-quality videos for your business with AI video maker easily Get Started Now 2. Descript Do you need help with problems like evoking human facial expressions and emotional responses or the technical bottlenecks that make the video generation process time-consuming? If yes, Descript can help your creative workflow and enrich the quality of your output, making it more high-end and appealing. Moreover, it also realizes the significance of the human side of video production as it's not designed to replace human creativity but to make it better, to give you a vision, and to let the AI do the heavy lifting. Best For: As such, it's best suited to content creators, podcasters, and filmmakers who need to save time and get things done the right way. Because it is a text-based editing system, even the not-so-tech-savvy can use it. Top Features: 1. Automated Transcription Manually transcribing audio and video is time-consuming. To save time, Descript automatically transcribes all your recordings. Since the transcription is merely a text file, if you edit the transcription content, you can also edit the audio or video file itself. 2. Overdub Voice Cloning With Descript's Overdub function, you can type in the missing or correct text and then artificially generate the new audio in your voice or that of the guest. Creating a voice clone of this type involves using a voice sample to make the process convenient and smooth. 3. Studio Sound Editing Poor audio quality can negatively impact great content. Descript tackles this problem with its Studio Sound feature, which applies state-of-the-art AI to enhance the sound quality of audio files. It eliminates noise, hum, and distortion, giving a cleaner and more professional studio-type sound. 4. Video Green Screen and AI Eye Contact The green screen background editor lets you change the environment behind the video, just like a Zoom feature, so you can have more control over how you present your content. This facilitates the humanizing of the video and adds to its realism. Pros It offers a fantastic transcription tool that can automatically transcribe audio and video files into text in 23 languages. It's a handy platform that lets you cut, rearrange, or alter the contents and simplifies editing. It improves the recorded audio quality by making the spoken words much clearer. This makes your content sound super-smooth without you having to edit out one word at a time. Descript also integrates with other platforms such as Slack (a team communication tool), Podbean (podcast hosting platform), Restream (a LIVE streaming studio), and even Final Cut Pro (a professional video editing application), to name a few. You also get tutorials on using the platform to help you quickly master the features and make the most of it. Cons The learning curve for Descript isn't very gentle for someone used to text-based editing. At first, this may seem patchy, but it is difficult for users of conventional timeline-based editing tools to work. Descript boasts a full range of powerful tools but may not meet the requirements of professional-level video editing. It doesn’t even provide the convenient access to advanced effects and controls that a professional editing package would provide. Pricing is a per-person, per-month fee. This can be costly for teams or organizations with many people, primarily if more than one person uses the software. Pricing Free Tier Creator Tier: $15 per user per month Pro Tier: $30 per user per month Enterprise Tier: Custom 3. Runway Runway is an advanced AI text-to-video generator that challenges how creative content is produced and edited. With more than 30 AI-powered creative tools on offer, it is a versatile product, capable of meeting the needs of filmmakers, artists, graphic designers, and content creators for YouTube and TikTok.

These tools help you create all sorts of different content, such as videos, images, and so on. 2. Text to Video Generation (Gen-2) This is a game changer for video creation.

High-Resolution Image Synthesis With Runway ML, you can make extremely high-resolution images with latent diffusion models. This is a valuable feature that lets you produce high-quality images, making it most suitable for tasks needing fine detail work. 4. Noise Reduction and Image Stabilization Noise reduction cleans up noisy or grainy photos, and image stabilization smoothes out shaky videos. Working together, they make your content refined and stylish. 5. Research and Innovation With generative AI, Runway ML will continue to be at the leading edge. As a user, you can enjoy the most advanced and revolutionary developments in this discipline. This means you are always testing the limits of possibility in generative A.I. Pros You can make your creative ideas into reality just by putting them in text. It provides unprecedented freedom of video creation, making it easy to think of and do any style or concept. The platform allows you to apply the style of any one image or prompt to every frame of your video. This is a very important feature in terms of maintaining your visual style consistency across all your video production. Based on mockups, Runway ML can turn out fully stylized and animated renders. This is especially helpful to designers and creators in creating a vibrant, engaging way to present their ideas. It’s easy to cut out subjects in your video and change them as you like with simple text commands. This lets you easily make specific modifications to individual elements in your video. By inputting an image or prompt, Runway ML can increase the realness of untextured renders. This is useful in creating realistic-looking images. Cons You might require a lot of computing resources and time. More complex tasks or high resolutions result in higher resource costs, and this may restrict its availability to users with less powerful hardware.

This lets you use storytelling and communication techniques with greater precision and effectiveness! Best For: Visla is the perfect option for developing and producing videos for marketing and sales, engineering, content creation, social media, team communications, customer service, and even personal branding. This is precisely what makes it so useful for professionals and teams to develop their own strategies for using storytelling to interact with audiences. Top Features: 1. Collaboration and Feedback Visla makes it simple to share your videos with your team or readers. In other words, you can use videos with other people, and you can receive others’ feedback. 2.

Teleprompter Mode Afraid you might have forgotten something or won't do a good job of expressing what is on your mind? This is where the teleprompter mode helps by letting you read from your marks instead of into the lens. This makes you look more confident and you don't lose your audience as you can make eye contact. 6. Community Hub Within the community hub, you can participate in discussions, seek advice, exchange experiences, and even receive ideas from other users. It's a place where you can get to know people using Visla too, help, and learn from one another. Pros Visla gives users the ability to create high-quality videos, working from the most minimal of ideas, perhaps even just a script. The platform can also be used to cover such tasks as writing scripts, narrating in its own voice, choosing the right pieces of video to show, and so on. Its AI-assisted editing functionality can even remove unwanted portions of video with an automatic effect. It has a comprehensible, easy interface, despite its many functions, which means that it can be used by people at every skill level. It allows a first-time user to become proficient with it only really requiring a timer, so that after only 2-3 minutes one can become accustomed. Visla's free subscription plan is particularly generous, as it allows publishers up to 50 minutes of video free of charge every month. This time is longer than most. Of course, there is also a great deal of access to the free version, which offers many of the platform’s main functions. It also comes with all the tools to aid in video production. With narration-assistance features powered by AI, screen recording functions for demonstration videos, text overlays for social media interviews, and so much more. Cons The inability to generate images is one major shortcoming of Visla compared to tools using coherent AI. To make up for this shortcoming, users who want to add this functionality have to feed suitable images to an external AI image generator before importing them into Visla. Exporting videos before downloading them can be very time-consuming. Likewise, the download speeds are quite slow. Even when Visla generates videos itself, it doesn't happen instantaneously, and it can still take a couple of minutes. The computer-generated script might contain mistakes that must be checked and corrected by a human. In addition, since the AI voiceover sometimes pronounces words incorrectly, this might affect the quality of the narrative. Pricing Basic: Free Plan Premium: $24 per month 6. Opus Clip Opus Clip converts full-length videos into short viral videos, and it shines through its comprehensive video content analysis capability. It also determines which parts are most effective and assembles them in easily digestible short clippings. It also employs cutting-edge artificial intelligence-enhanced functions such as AI Curation, AI Virality Score, and AI Emoji Generator to boost the attractiveness and virality of the content. All in all, it provides a great balance between accessibility and advanced, AI-assisted functionality, for newbies and experienced users too! Best For: Converting long-form video content into short clips that can go viral. It uses AI to help you create fun short videos with little effort. Top Features: 1. AI Curation This feature uses GPT-4 Turbo, the most advanced artificial intelligence, to take a long video and pick out the most intriguing segments. The selected parts are then crafted together into an attention-grabbing and compact short clip. Not only can it intelligently choose the segments, but it can also put this into a narrative framework, presenting the video in an organized, entertaining manner. 2. AI Virality Score Using AI and big data analysis of thousands of viral videos, Opus Clip attaches a score for its virality to each clip. With this score, you get a better idea of the potential impact of the cut, and you can use data to make decisions on the best way to maximize reach and engagement. 3. AI Co-Pilot With this feature, you have greater control over the video editing process. You can specify the time frames in your video to clip and make more focused and accurate content. 4. Active Speaker Detection Using predictive AI, Opus Clip analyzes and follows moving faces in the video.

This is particularly helpful for creators of content and content generators for whom English is their main language and they’re targeting an international audience or simply working in a multilingual environment. Its useful first paragraph-generating capabilities alone make it a game-changer when it comes to attracting viewers from the start. Cons Opus Clip may be a powerful software, but you would have to invest significant time and effort far beyond just learning how to use the product before you can master its full range of features. This learning curve could be an obstacle for those who need to quickly produce results without going into too much technical detail. Its effectiveness depends on the quality of the input video. If the original content was lousily shot or edited, it might not be able to finely tune it. While customization options are there, they may not meet all requirements or individual preferences of users. For some, this is a drawback, especially if highly personal or unique video styles are needed. The default caption may not be to everyone's tastes and could undermine creative expression. Pricing Free plan Starter Plan: $9 per month Pro: $ 19 per month 7. Colossyan Looking for the best AI music video generator? Colossyan can be just the right choice!

Cons The actors are advanced AI-generated avatars, looking and sounding highly lifelike, but the platform is limited to these digital actors. This limitation does not allow users to directly incorporate live human actors or their own recordings into the platform.

Matt D., Copywriter Sign up Today, creators can find artificial intelligence tools for nearly everything—from writing your YouTube descriptions to adjusting your eye contact in a video. Generative AI, which produces new content based on a single prompt, has changed the game for video generation. It’s made visual storytelling a more accessible task to creators from all backgrounds. It has also made it even more essential for creators to stay in the loop when it comes to AI video generation tools. Because these tools come with a wide range of capabilities: some can generate whole videos from a few words, just like an image generator might. Others use AI for smaller but equally important pieces of the video production process, like background removal. This guide highlights a range of the best AI video generators, outlining their best features and unique benefits they offer when creating videos. What is an AI-generated video? An AI-generated video is a type of video created with machine learning software. These automated systems use algorithms to assemble video elements like images, audio files, and text into a cohesive narrative based on a creator’s prompt. 3 benefits of AI-powered video generators Now we know what an AI video generator is, let’s explore the advantages of using one in your video production process. Efficiency and time savings Unlike traditional manual editing and assembly methods, you don’t need advanced video editing skills to create AI-generated videos. Using AI tools, you can get more done faster. In the past, you'd have to spend hours making videos by meticulously editing footage frame by frame. Today, AI-powered video generators like Synthesia, Descript, and Pictory assemble and make quality videos in a fraction of the time, so you can ship new content to various platforms quickly. Consistency and error reduction A good AI video generator doesn’t glance over tiny details.

Metadata aspects, such as subtitles and additional video data, are handled with the same level of accuracy. The end result: create content that’s not just good, but structurally great and accessible to all viewers. Customizable versatility across formats The real beauty of AI video generators lies in their flexibility. Need an Apple-friendly Quicktime video? Done. A Windows Media video for Microsoft users? No problem. Some generators can even support less common video formats, including MOV, AVI, WMV, and MPEG-4. With added functionality like customizable video templates and transitions, you have a lot of leeway in personalizing videos to your liking using an AI video template.

Whether it's social media content, training videos, or explainer videos, each objective requires different features.

Take advantage of them and test each generator to check whether they meet your objectives and requirements. Be mindful of any watermarks or other limitations that come with the free plan, too, since these could impact the professional look of your videos.

BasedLabs AI 5. Synthesia.io Below you will find more tools and me using each tool and sharing my results and opinions. This article is supported by readers. If you choose to make a purchase using the links below, I might earn a small commission at no cost to you! 1. Colossyan AI 👉 Free trial and 10% off using code ARTTURI Colossyan is an AI video generation platform designed to simplify the process of creating professional videos. It caters to individual content creators, professionals, small teams, and large enterprises, offering a range of tools and features to enhance video production. Let’s see how it performs in my hands! Highlight Features Prompt to Video: Enables creating complete videos from a simple script written by the user. Custom Voice and Avatars: Offers the ability to create custom voices and avatars, including lite avatars for quick recording using a web camera. Avatar Conversations: Supports scenario-based training videos with multiple avatars per scene. Icon Library: Provides a collection of professionally crafted icons. Auto-Translations: Offers automatic translations for videos in different languages. Export Options: Allows exporting in various formats like MP3, SRT, and PDF. Enterprise Features: Includes SCORM export, enhanced security options like SAML/SSO, and collaboration tools. Comprehensive Free Trial: Offers a complete free to try most features for free without signing up. My Experience I extensively tested Colossyan and created some scenes to see how it performs. If you want to get a hunch without having to do anything, just preview one of the ready-made projects on the homepage. But I recommend giving it an actual try. You don’t even need an account to start using the tool which is unlike most tools on this list. Just open up the creator and start creating. Awesome! If you want a detailed guide, you can check the video Colossyan has created. They’ve used their tool to narrate that scene, pretty cool, isn’t it? I’ll share my experiences with the tool below. So first, you need to create the script for the video actor to play. I generated mine with ChatGPT. If you haven’t signed up, there are some heavy limits, though. Just sign up to get more characters to use. Then, it’s time to place the avatar in the right position. I like the ability to freely customize it. For example, you can have a full body shot or just a Bubble-like presentation. Then you can change the background or even place an image or video on it. This way you can make your video look exactly like you want to. The customizations don’t stop at the character. You can do editing on your slides. For example, here I’ve changed the slide background to something nicer: To make the presentation more visually pleasing, you can always add those shapes and other elements to it. Heck, you can even play a song in the background. To this point, I’ve just edited the opening slide and script for the video. To make the video more interesting, you should add more slides to it. This is easy on Colossyan. Just click add more to add more slides and scenes to your presentation. This opens up a scene options view from where you can pick different types of scenes for your project. For example, on this one, I’m adding a guest speaker on the video side by side with my main avatar: Then, you can do the same customizations for the guest avatar as you’ve done with the main one, such as tweak the script. change position, and so on. The only downside I found was that sometimes the software gives me an unexpected error. This is a bit frustrating as you can’t tell what’s causing it. But luckily, you can always save and refresh. Or if you’re stuck, the team will help you resolve any issues right away. Other than that, what a journey! This tool lets you create amazing videos and presentations with AI. Notice how I haven’t even signed up at this point. Yet I was able to create a comprehensive video with all sorts of customizations and perks along the way! You can even try it for free, so why not give it a shot? I cannot recommend this enough. Pros Versatile: Suitable for individuals to large enterprises. The tool can create simple explainer videos as well as more detailed full-on presentations with guests etc. Customization: Extensive options for custom voices, avatars, and imagery. The tool doesn’t just create a video. In addition, you can use it to create a full presentation from start to finish with all the customizations you’ll ever need. Multilingual Support: Offers over 70 languages and auto-translation features. User-Friendly: Simplifies complex video production tasks and more importantly, saves a boatload of time and money. Amazing Free Trial: You can test the tool extensively without even signing up for free. This is unlike most AI video makers on the market. Cons Learning Curve: The tool has all the bells and whistles, so it can take a bit longer to learn how to use it than your average AI video tool. Don’t know if it’s a con, though. Occasional Slowness. I tried choosing templates and the UI froze for a couple of seconds. Nothing too serious but can be a bit confusing. Pricing: May be expensive for individuals or small teams, especially for high-end features. Pricing Starter: $19 per month (billed annually). Pro: $61 per month (billed annually). Enterprise Plan: Custom pricing for extensive features and unlimited video creation. Free Trial: Free, with limited features and video creation minutes. Get 10% off with code ARTTURI Bottom Line Colossyan is the most comprehensive AI video generation tool on the market. It offers a broad range of features suitable for various users. I also had a chat with their team and founders. They’re such a helpful bunch of people! Colossyan’s strength lies in its customization options and ease of use. This in my opinion makes it a valuable tool for creators looking to create high-quality videos with minimal effort and cost. I’d give it a shot! You can try it for free with this link.

I Tried 15 AI Headshot Generators. Here’s My Verdict ---------------------------------------------------- ### I spent $2,000 to find the best AI headshot generator on the market. In this post, I will show you my results medium.com 2. HeyGen AI HeyGen is one of the most impressive uses of AI video I’ve ever seen. This tool allows you to create a perfect clone of yourself. One that talks like you and acts like you. It even speaks in different languages. Here’s how my AI version compares to the real me. You can watch a short video of myself using the tool and what it’s capable of here: Try HeyGen for Free Key Features Let’s take a short look at the features of HeyGen. AI Video Creation: HeyGen turns text into presentation-style videos. Customizable AI Avatars: HeyGen has 100+ AI avatars you can customize. Cloning. This tool allows you to clone yourself with AI and make it speak any language. Templates: HeyGen comes with templates for marketing, presentations, and more. LLM Integration: HeyGen has a ChatGPT integration you can use for scripting. This smoothens the process of video creation for you. Plus a lot more. My Experience Let me show you what the tool did for me. Although there are lots of features, I think the best way to demonstrate this one is by showing how AI cloning works. Feel free to follow along or just read along. If you want to create an avatar for yourself, sign up here. You can skip the introduction videos and instructions as I will show you everything here. Next, let’s create an AI clone for you. Go to the home view (where you’ll land automatically.) Then click on “Create Instant Avatar:” Next, it’s time to submit a video of yourself. This is so the AI can learn how you sound and move. Make sure that these are good in your video: Good lighting Quiet space Be as natural as you can Make gestures below your chest Have a longer pause between each sentence You can use your smart device's camera Look at the camera as you speak Film for 2–5 minutes. You can speak in any language. Then just submit your clip to HeyGen. It can take a while for the AI to process. This takes about 5–10 minutes. You can exit the screen. HeyGen will let you know when the AI clone has been created via email. Once the AI avatar is ready, it appears in the “My Avatar” section in the main view of HeyGen. Just click on it! It will greet you :) Impressive, isn’t it? But let’s start using it! Go to the main view of HeyGen, and click on “Create with AI Studio.” Then, add a script from the left-hand side. This can be any text that you want the AI to speak on your behalf (in your character.) You can use AI to generate the script too! Remember to include your avatar in the scene. To do this, click on the “Avatar” on the left and click on your image to use your AI clone. Unfortunately, you cannot preview your video before the AI has created it. (You can preview your voice, though.) Also, it takes a while (and costs a bit) to create the video, so make sure that before you generate these things are in place: Your AI avatar is in use and is added to the blank canvas (as I mentioned before) Your voice clone is activated. Click your avatar and choose your voice if it’s not already. At this point, you can change your language if you want to! Then hit the “Submit” button to generate the video. This will send your script to HeyGen AI which will then use your avatar to render a video. This takes 5–10 minutes again. Once the video is ready, HeyGen sends you a message through email. Enjoy! Pros Realistic AI. Oh my, how realistic those AI speakers are—needless to mention how good the AI clone was. Wow! No useless features to make the tool look more impressive. It’s straight to the point, simple, and powerful! Easy to use—although it takes a bit time to render the videos and upload your video. There’s a free trial you can use. Not on cloning, though :( Try HeyGen for Free! Cons Expensive for individuals. I calculated that at the moment a 10-minute video with my AI clone costs about $40. Slow. It took about 30 minutes from sign-up to create my clone that spoke a 30-second script. Impractical. Although it’s powerful, I cannot see myself using it because it takes time and costs a lot. It’s easier for me to just film those videos myself. Pricing Free: $0 Creator: $24/mo Team: $120/mo Enterprise: Contact sales Bottom Line I love HeyGen. The cloning thing is perhaps the most impressive use of AI I’ve seen. Although it’s a bit slow and impractical, it’s scary good, and accurate. I’d definitely give it a try. If you’re shy in front of a camera or if you’ve always wanted to speak different languages, this is the tool for you. You can generate realistic presentations with the pre-built actors too! Try HeyGen for Free 3. DeepBrain AI Best Overall — Start a Free Trial Using This Link! DeepBrain AI is one of the best AI video-generating tools out there! You can use this tool to generate many types of videos from advertisements to greetings to sales pitches. No matter what business/individual use you have in your mind, this tool has got your back. DeepBrain AI is a simple text-to-video generator that uses the latest advancements in AI. Although the tool is already impressive, thanks to the massive developments in AI, it will probably improve. In my eyes, this tool could be one of the go-to AI video generators of the future. My Experience with Deepbrain AI DeepBrain has a ton of cool presets to use. You can choose from a presentation to a sales pitch to a greeting. Many options give me a great variety of choices for different use cases. Here’s an example presentation I’m generating on DeepBrain AI: The UI flows smoothly, although there is a small lag when moving from one scene to another. Also, at first, it wasn’t quite clear to me how you insert the script but once I realized how it’s done it became super easy to use the tool. This is a test of using the presentation feature of DeepBrain AI. This tool converts text to speech in a video format that looks nice and professional. One cool feature of this tool is you don’t even need to create the scripts yourself — you can use AI to do that. For example, here I ask AI to generate a sales pitch about what types of houses to live in: Once you’ve done this step, you can just insert the AI-generated text into the script. Once this is done, the video reads the generated text. Pretty sleek, isn’t it? This is where AI is taking us :) If you’re not happy with the presets, you can always customize or edit things around, such as: Voice actor Background Fonts and colors Add music and sound effects Notice that this tool doesn’t generate arbitrary videos (at least not yet), but instead, you can generate those awesome presentation videos where a person speaks your text out. BTW, this applies to all the AI video-generating tools. This will likely change drastically in the next 2–3 years. Speaking of features, let’s take a closer look at what DeepBrain AI comes with. Key Features Supports a ton of languages GPT-powered text generator for generating scenes A ton of AI voice actors Accurate text-to-video Realistic videos and voice actors Support for multiple use cases Affordable pricing 24/7 support chat Pricing DeepBrain has three pricing plans: $29/month for basic use Custom for power users and enterprises (contact the sales team) Free trial with the link below Try DeepBrain AI 4. BasedLabs AI Try free with this link BasedLabs.ai is a platform focused on AI-generated images and video content. Unlike most video generators on this list, BasedLabs focuses on creating short videos about anything, not just presentations. For most visitors who aren’t looking for pitches and presentations, this is the best video maker tool online. It offers a variety of tools and features for generating and exploring AI-generated visual content. Let’s see how this tool performs. Key Features AI tools for visual content creation Intuitive interface A community for sharing and exploring content 👉 Get 10% off all plans with code ARTTURI My Experience It’s been all hype and promises for now. But let’s see how the tool actually performs. I will show you how I was able to generate these two videos with the tool and assess the quality and overall process at the same. To start creating videos with AI, just hit the “Generate” button on the homepage. Then you need to create an account. I used Google to sign up to make it faster. I just gave it a generic name like “AIvideotester”: Once your account is created, you can start making videos with AI. If you don’t have an input image, you can use AI to generate images in BasedLabs. For example, here I create one. Just a simple prompt will do, no need to make it this complex if you don’t want to. Then it takes about 15 seconds to generate those images. And here’s the resulting image set: I chose the top-most one. I think it looks good for now. Then it’s time to start converting the image to a video. Just hit next. This opens up the video view. For now, you can just use a basic motion slider to increase/decrease movement in the video. There’s no input for the video creator to tell what to do in the video. So you will need to let the AI do the work here. Just hit “Make Video” and it starts doing its magic. This took about 30 seconds for me. Don’t be confused if the loading bar sticks at 0% for about 10–20 seconds. That’s normal! After waiting for a while, here’s the result video: Pretty impressive, isn’t it? Although the video is short, this is something I made completely out of thin air in just 2 minutes or less. That’s awesome. This already gives you an idea of what the tool can do. But let me try another feature just to show how awesome it is. Let’s try to drop an image into the video editor and turn it into a video. Here’s an image from Finland that a photographer has taken. I want to turn this into a video. So here’s what I did. I dropped this image to the BasedLabs video generator view. Then it verified if I wanted to proceed with this image: Once again, now there are no controls for me to use. So this image is automatically converted to a video by the AI now. It took about 30–40 seconds this time. Here’s the result: Just wow! The clouds look very realistic and the movement looks smooth and real. I’m shocked at how well this tool performed. Of course, this clip is still short and for example, the water is still. But that’s nonetheless very impressive. I can just imagine what this tool can do in a year or two… 👉 Get 10% off all plans with code ARTTURI Pros User-friendly and very easy to use Free trial to experiment with different videos and creations High-quality AI-generated videos Community from which you can draw inspiration Amazing results (although short) Cons Limitations in the toolset, for example, you cannot tell what to do in the video Not for long-form videos, those are just 1–2 seconds in length. Some performance issues as I had to wait almost a minute for a short clip to generate Some videos look unrealistic and robotic Pricing Creator: $12/mo Pro: $28/mo 👉 Get 10% off all plans with code ARTTURI Bottom Line BasedLabs is awesome. Better yet, it’s free to try. It’s the first tool that I encountered that makes these short AI clips that people have been craving for for a long time now. The tool was awesome. It was relatively quick, the results were good (although short), and the quality was amazing. Oh, and by the way, you can also create images with this one. If you don’t have an input image, you can generate one with BasedLabs and then turn it into a video. Try Basedlabs for FREE 5. Synthesia.io 👉 Try for free and get 10% off with code ARTTURI Synthesia is an AI-based video generator that uses state-of-the-art AI algorithms to produce unique and realistic videos. Not only is it a great tool for generating videos, but it offers you a good video editor solution for the post-production phase. This way you can make your generated videos even better. There are multiple styles of videos you can choose from. For example, you can use Synthesia to generate videos for product demos, marketing, greetings, and much more. Notice that Synthesia is by no means restricted to English content only. The tool supports 60+ languages which makes it a great choice for someone to create videos for clients in pretty much any country. Synthesia works for all kinds of businesses. You don’t need any experience in video editing or speaking in front of a camera. Instead, you can let the AI do the heavy lifting. To create a video, all you need to do is enter a text input that will be spoken on the video. Also, you need to choose the style of the video and the AI speaker for it. 👉 Activate your free trial My Experience with Synthesia Here’s an example video I just generated to praise my imaginary colleague: It was pretty simple to create a video with Synthesia for free. All I had to do was enter a short text prompt to view and choose the type of video to generate. This quite literally took 30 seconds to do. Once you have requested Synthesia to generate a free video, you need to wait for a minute or two. To access the video, you need to enter your email address where the new video will be sent after it has been completed. Of course, the video content must be appropriate. Otherwise, Synthesia won’t generate it for you. So please, only use it professionally! After a couple of minutes of waiting, Synthesia sent me an email with the video. Not only could I watch the video but also share it here on this blog post. Synthesia makes it easy to share your videos on social platforms and blog posts if you wish. I think using Synthesia is seamless and the free trial version is worth trying. The result is unbelievable — something I would think to be impossible just a couple of years back! 👉 Activate your free trial Key Features Here are some of the most notable features of Synthesia. The free trial you can play with before purchasing a paid plan. Easy to use interface. Natural video and voice. Different video styles and voices to choose from.

The tool intelligently splits your input script into logical parts. Besides, the tool chooses matching visuals to the scenes that you can adjust. There are lots of templates, workflows, and assets to choose from. With InVideo, you can create high-quality videos to meet your professional needs. One thing I like about this solution is you can try InVideo for free. Of course, there will be a watermark on the exported video. But if you like the quality of the videos, you can consider subscribing to a paid plan to get rid of the watermarks. My Experience with InVideo Here is an example video I generated with InVideo in 2 minutes. ✅ I’m amazed by the accuracy of the InVideo video visuals. The tool picked these automatically without my input! I’m talking about AI in the video, and the tool chose visuals about AI and human evolution towards AI. Let me briefly show you my experience with InVideo. You can try InVideo for free. Before creating your first clip, you need to sign up for a free trial and answer a quick quiz. For me, the sign-up took about a minute among the quiz. Once you’ve signed up, the video editor pops up. From the video editor view, you can choose a workflow that best meets your demand. The options are: Templates Text-to-video Stock media Editor To test the InVideo, I picked Text-to-Video. Then you can enter the text script into the tool and it will convert it into a video. I wrote a small script for my brand new video about AI video generation and how it will disrupt the video industry. The tool intelligently splits the text input into different scenes. For example, one of my paragraphs was too long to fit one scene. The tool resolved this by splitting it into two sections. You can make adjustments yourself if you don’t like the automated edits made by InVideo. Once the video is complete, you can download and share it. For me, it took about 30 seconds to render my short 30-second clip or so. The free version has watermarks on it. To get rid of the watermarks, you need to subscribe to a paid plan. Overall the experience with InVideo is great. It didn’t take longer than 2 minutes to produce a nice 30-second clip that normally would take me 15–30 minutes to produce. Key Features Let’s take a look at some of the most notable features of InVideo. AI-powered video generation capabilities with great automated decision-making make the videos look professional. There is a free trial you can try (although there will be watermarks on your videos). Great sharing capabilities for making your video go live on social channels as well as shareable through links. A bunch of themes, workflows, and templates to choose from. Affordable pricing models. Pricing There are three plans to choose from on InVideo: Free: A free trial with watermarks on the videos. Business: $15/month with no watermarks and 60 video exports. Unlimited: $30/month with unlimited video exports. Try Invideo for Free 7. Pictory Best for Quick Access. Pictory is an AI video generator that lets you both create and edit high-quality videos with ease. To use the tool, you don’t need any background in video editing or design. You can let the tool do the heavy lifting for you. The best part is you can try the tool for free. All you need to do is create a free account and start creating. Pictory asks you for either a script or an article based on which you want to create a video.

Using Pictory is intuitive and easy. It’s meant for those who have no video-making background. To get started, all you need to do is create an account. You don’t even need to verify the account to start generating. The first thing the tool asks is based on what you want to generate the video.

There are many quality templates to choose from. After choosing the template, the editing window opens up. In this view, you can make quick and easy edits to your video.

Recently, OpenAI released a video generator called Sora. Currently (March 2024), the tool is still unavailable for general use, and OpenAI is experimenting with it. That’s why it’s not on the list! What Is the Best Sora Alternative? If you like to create videos like Sora by OpenAI, you can use a tool like BasedLabs. BasedLabs.ai | AI video powerhouse and community ------------------------------------------------ ### BasedLabs is your go to source for AI video and tools. Join our community of thousands of AI enthusiasts and creators. www.basedlabs.ai However, this tool is not even close to what OpenAI’s Sora can do based on their demos.

An AI video generator is a tool that generates videos from descriptions using artificial intelligence algorithms. These text-to-video generators use AI to create or enhance video content from text inputted by users. AI video generation helps craft high-quality videos without the need for expensive equipment, actors, or even video editing skills. What is the best AI video generator? The text-to-video feature in the AI video creator quickly generates videos from text with AI avatars and voices, making it the best text-to-video generator AI. Choose your ideal avatar, type your script, and generate talking head videos for your product releases, explainer videos, and more in minutes. What is a talking head video? A talking head video is one of the most common types of video used for e-Learning. It features a person, or the “Subject-Matter Expert” (SME), who directly addresses the viewer in an interview-like format. This video type is often shot from the chest or waist upwards, with the presenter either standing or sitting. Because of their human elements, talking head videos are suitable for building trust and connection with the target viewers. What differentiates talking head videos from other video types? What sets talking head videos apart from other video types is they let SMEs or instructors communicate directly through the camera, as if they're having a one-to-one conversation with learners. Talking head videos are ideal for brief and straightforward learning sessions, which users can access on their own time. With tools like an AI video generator from text, you can break down lengthy presentations into a series of shorter clips. Can AI create videos from text? Yes, it can! Type in the script you want the avatar to narrate or speak and choose from 300+ voices available in 40+ languages. Then, watch as AI generates your video in minutes. Use the AI video maker to turn your script into talking head videos with customizable AI avatars. Omg I love you guys! Thanks for making it so easy for me to use your templates.
