I’ve tested most well-known (and some not so well-known) platforms out there in order to make this list of my top favorites. My goal is to make it easy for you to find the right video generator for your needs. Best AI Video Generators – Summary Synthesia had the most realistic avatars in this comparison, largely due to the detailed gestures, timely lip syncing and realistic voices. The 140 avatars look lifelike, speak 120+ languages and could be well-suited for content creation for your business, particularly training videos, product demos and marketing videos. Runway boasts an impressive set of tools for high-quality text to video generation. Some features are quite advanced, which is great for getting just the right look for your video. While the platform has some learning curve, the well-designed user interface and informative tutorials makes it possible to quickly become proficient with the basics. OpusClip specializes in repurposing long-form videos into engaging short clips optimized for social media platforms. It’s well-suited for video podcasts, educational and commentary videos, and similar content. The ease of use and the automatic generation of clips make it a time-saving tool for content creators. In this article: Best AI Video Generators – Summary What is an AI video generator? How I tested these AI tools? When to Use an AI Video Generator? Why Use An AI Video Generator? Comparison Table What are the best AI Video Generators for 2023? FAQ Conclusion Toggle What is an AI video generator? AI video generators are tools that help you make, edit and improve videos using the power of AI. The AI tools for video in this list fall into one of four categories: Animated avatars: Text-to-video generators that make videos with talking AI avatars. Useful for making training videos, presentations, and more. Text-to-video generators: Video makers that allow you to enter a prompt and get a brand new video as output, similar to what AI image generators like Midjourney and DALL-E do for pictures. AI video editors: Video editing tools that use AI features to help you quickly edit or repurpose your videos. Slideshow creators: Platforms that use a written prompt or script to generate a complete video with stock footage and realistic voiceovers. Go to the top How I tested these AI tools? For deciding which tools to include in this list I looked particularly at the usefulness of the AI features they offered, the quality of video outputs and level of user friendliness. I tested each tool with the following approach: Using templates (wherever possible), as well as starting from scratch with my own uploaded content Using the libraries of stock videos and images where available Editing the video using the platform’s own interface Testing different voices and narration settings (where possible) Testing the export functionality and quality for the finished videos Go to the top When to Use an AI Video Generator? AI video generators are great for making your content creation with video more effective. Which tools to use largely depends on your use case. If you’re looking to create explainer videos, product demos, and the like for your business creating animated avatars serve as a solid and scalable alternative to traditional filming. Text-to-video generators, apart from being a fantastic avenue to explore the latest in AI technology, empower you to rapidly create stunning clips for content marketing or social media posts. Other platforms specialize in repurposing longe-form content into engaging short-form, which could help you double down on your existing content. Why Use An AI Video Generator? Producing video can be an incredibly time-consuming process. Planning, filming, and editing usually entail a slow process requiring equipment, people, and coordination. Artificial intelligence has ways of making some, if not all, of these steps swift and easy, and there is a range of tools on the market to choose from. The right I video creation tool can be an amazing asset, helping you produce engaging YouTube videos, taking the legwork out of video editing or allowing you to easily repurpose your video content across multiple social media channels in a breeze.

Synthesia Synthesia is a popular platform for generating animated, talking avatar videos, reportedly used by over 50,000 teams worldwide. Synthesia stands out among other animated avatar generators for its ability to create lifelike avatars. A key advantage lays in the micro-gestures Synthesia’s avatars are able to do, such as nodding and raising eyebrows. Additionally, the lip sync is great, further giving the avatar a realistic look. Another notable feature about Synthesia is that it has a huge gallery of 140+ realistic AI avatars to choose from. You simply select your avatar of choice and type in the text you want. The platform supports more than 120 languages, with different accents and styles of narration. Synthesia’s video templates are easily modifiable to suit your business, making it straightforward and scalable to produce AI avatar videos that fit your brand. Changing the background, fonts, transitions, and adding a soundtrack are all easily done within the user interface. Pricing Personal: $22.50/month, 120 mins video/year Enterprise: Custom pricing Pros Excellent for fast, professional and on-brand talking avatars to use in your business and marketing 140+ avatars to choose from and many supported languages and accents Cons Very limited trial feature, lets you generate only one demo video using your own video script Who is it best for Businesses seeking to use animated avatars in their business, such as for training videos, product demos and marketing. What we think of Synthesia? Synthesia does a great job at what it’s intended to do, creating professional videos with avatars in a way that makes it easy to make content for your business. The customisable templates, combined with the lifelike avatars and the strong text-to-speech functionality embedded in the platform, makes it one of the best platforms for this use-case. It should be mentioned that even though Synthesia does great at generating highly realistic avatar videos, the AI generated aspect of it still shines somewhat through for a discerning eye. This has less to do with Synthesia in particular and more an observation of where AI-generated video technology currently stands. Given the rapid advancements in this space over recent months, it’s likely that such videos will soon become indistinguishable from clips of regular people talking. Go to the top 2. HeyGen HeyGen has grown fast in the AI video generation space, currently boasting over 7 million monthly website visitors. The platform is a video production studio for animated avatar creation, letting you create avatars with realistic voices that can be used standalone or within a customizable background template. The platform has 130+ pre-existing avatars, but what makes it stand out against similar platforms is its capabilities for creating personalized avatars, for which it has three modes: Photo Avatar: Easily upload any photo, even a generated image from platforms like Midjourney, to create a simple animated avatar. Instant Avatar: Upload a 2-minute clip of yourself talking, and HeyGen will transform this footage into a realistic avatar. Studio Avatar: Upload 5-10 minutes of high-quality footage to create a high-resolution 4k avatar. The personalization aspect is further augmented with some really neat additional features: Face swapping: enables you to imprint your face (or a face from any photo) on any avatar from its gallery. Generative outfit: allows the creation of new clothing for your avatar with simple prompts, perfect for content creators seeking contextual or varied attire for their avatars. HeyGen also has a pretty amazing video translate feature that retains your own voice; it lets you translate a video of someone speaking (could be an avatar or just a regular video), and it uses AI voice cloning and lip syncing to make it all sound natural. Pricing Free: 1 free credit Creator: 48$ for 30 credits/month Business: 144$ for 60 credits/month Enterprise: Custom pricing Pros Exceptional options for crafting a personalized avatar clone. Face swapping and generative outfit features enhance avatar personalization. Video translate feature that offers natural-looking and sounding translations. Cons The cost can escalate quickly as various generative features need credits. Who is it best for Companies and content creators looking to create a personalized avatar for use in their business and marketing. What we think of HeyGen? HeyGen’s features for making your own avatar based on uploaded footage, combined with natural sounding voices (powered by a leader in the text-to-speech space, ElevenLabs) make a powerful case for HeyGen as a choice for anyone looking to make an avatar clone of themselves to use for content creation purposes. The free tier gives you just enough credits to test out the core functionality of testing pre-existing animated avatars a couple of times, before you need to upgrade to a paid plan. Though Synthesia offers better realism with its pre-made avatars (due to their micro-gestures making them more lifelike), HeyGen’s personalized avatar creation might align more closely with creators or businesses seeking something more unique to their brand. Go to the top 3. Elai.io Elai.io is a tool that blends video generation with animated avatars, as well as the ability to transform written content into narrated videos (with or without avatars). Out of the box, it’s not as advanced when it comes to avatar creation and customisation as other comparable platforms in this comparison, namely Synthesia and Heygen. It does services for custom avatar and voice cloning, but at an additional cost. However, Elai.io is more versatile than these platform in that it has a good capabilities for creating other kinds of presentations from your written content as well, all in a beginner friendly interface. The use-case for creating slideshow-type presentations with Elai.io are similar to that of Fliki, but the video creation process is more hands-on, as it doesn’t auto-select images or video clips to use. This can definitely be an advantage in terms of the quality and tailored look of your videos, but perhaps not quite as efficient. The platform lets you edit and arrange all visual elements of the video by scene, and the user interface is surprisingly intuitive. Pricing Free: 1 minute credit Basic: 29$ for 15 video minutes/month Advanced: 125$ for 50 video minutes/month Enterprise: Custom pricing Pros Quite realistic avatars with good lip syncing Intuitive video creation for presentations tailored to your brand Cons Custom avatars and voice cloning are not out-of-the-box features, requiring an additional cost which can be quite pricey. Less possible automation in the creation process compared to platforms like Fliki Who is it best for Elai.io fits well for those seeking a both to created animated high quality avatar videos as well as slideshow-type presentations, all in the same platform. What we think of Elai.io? Elai.io combines some of the strong sides of platforms for creating realistic avatars with high-quality voice narration, with a broader range of time-saving features for creating presentations. Albeit Elai.io stands as a viable choice for those looking for everything under one platform, there are better platforms when it comes to the specific tasks of animated avatar creation or automated presentations. Go to the top 4. Runway Runway could be called an established platform in the space of text-to-video generation, having released their Gen-1 text-to-video model as early as in March (which is a long time compared to competitors which have literally only been around for weeks). The platform has quickly garnered popularity and is now getting nearly 8 million monthly visitors to its website. Within its impressive suite of AI tools for content creation, the Gen-1 and Gen-2 models for text-to-video stand out. While Gen-1 required a video for creating new videos, Gen-2 can realistically and consistently synthesize new videos from purely text. Gen-1 and Gen-2 offer four ways to generate videos: Video to video: Change the style of a video using text or image Text to video: Generate new video from text prompt Image to video: Animate an image without providing further instructions Text + image to video: Create a new video from a reference image, guiding the creation with a prompt The video creation modes also offers a lot of configuration options to help you get just the result you want, such as motion intensity, scales for consistency against reference images, upscaling, camera motion, and much more. Pricing Basic: Free for 125 credits/month Standard: 15$ for 625 credits/month Pro: 35$ for 2,250 credits/month Unlimited: 95$ for unlimited video generations Enterprise: custom pricing Pros Impressive, high-quality generated videos Easy to use interface, complemented by informative video tutorials Ample configuration options to get the desired look Available on iOS in addition to its runwayml.com web app Cons Struggles with accurate rendering of faces and hands (a common issue for still image generators as well) Definitely has a learning curve to use the platform’s to its full potential Who is it best for Runway is a solid choice for content creators wanting top-tier videos. It’s suitable for a variety of creators, particularly film makers, artists, or just anyone wanting to experiment with generative AI for video. While it doesn’t provide production-ready video content similar to some other platforms, its performance for text-to-video generation is undeniable. What we think of Runway? Runway’s ability to render realistic videos coupled with a clean user interface places it a cut above the rest in our text-to-video platform comparison. Although initial prompt didn’t always yield the result I was looking for, a little tinkering with configurations significantly improved the outputs. Runway’s suite also encompasses over a dozen other AI tools for both image and video generation and editing, which makes it not just the best text to video generation platform in this comparison, but more generally a versatile platform for scalable content creation. Go to the top 5. Pika Labs Pika Labs emerged in the video generation in July 2023, quickly gaining traction as an alternative to Runway. The platform is still in Beta and is fully operated via Discord, using the /create command to transform text or images into vivid videos. Pika Labs gives users a fair degree of customization options. These are the basic ones: Guidance Scale: Dictate how closely the video should adhere to your prompt. Aspect Ratio: Options include 16:9, 1:1, 4:5, and others. Seed: Ensure consistency across video generations. Motion: Control the level of movement in the video. Camera: Direct the camera’s movements. The platform also offers an additional layer of creativity by letting you use images together with your text prompt, turning static images into animated visuals. In my testing, I used a pre-generated image from Midjourney as the reference image, which resulted in a polished and cinematic clip. A unique feature of the Pika Labs is the /encrypt_text command, which subtly embeds a text (up to 20 characters) within the video, akin to a subliminal message. Pricing Currently, Pika Labs is free during its Beta phase, allowing 5 generations every 10 minutes. However, I expect this to change as the platform evolves and moves out of Beta. Pros High-quality with decent level of customisation For the time being, it is completely free to use Cons The Discord-based operation has a learning curve, especially for those unfamiliar with command-based video generation There’s a 3-second video generation limit which feels somewhat restrictive, though it’s possible to extend videos by leveraging the last frame as a starting point for the next video. Who is it best for Pika Labs is best for content creators seeking a free, yet powerful, platform for text-to-video generation, especially those who are used to Discord. What we think of Pika Labs? Pika Labs makes high quality text-to-video, offering a broad range of configuration options and is currently free. The platform runs on Discord and uses commands which can be somewhat unintuitive and has a bit of a learning curve. The 3-second limit on videos was a bit annoying, although there exists a somewhat tedious technique to extend video length (tutorial available on YouTube), which requires to stitch videos together in an external video editor. It was easiest for me to get good results when using a reference image along with a text prompt, but I’m sure with more tweaking, great results can be achieved using text-only prompts as well. In conclusion, Pika Labs is a great place to get started experimenting with AI generated video and learning how to tune prompts to get impressive results. Go to the top 6. Genmo Genmo pioneered image-to-video with its model Alpha earlier this year, allowing users to create dynamic videos from still image. The company further stepped up the game when, in the end of September, it launched Replay, a model able to synthesize impressive videos purely from text prompts. Genmo is web-based and offers a user-friendly interface for generating videos. Here are some of the basic controls available: Aspect Ratio: Tailor the dimensions of your video to fit various platforms. Duration: Control the length of the generated video. Motion Intensity: Adjust the level of movement within the video. Preserve (for image to video): How closely the video resembles the uploaded image A standout feature is the live preview, letting users observe the rendering process and a get a clear idea on what the final video will look like. Another feature I liked was the ability to submit up to 3 renderings at once; this is useful as the output of a prompt for video generation is always going to be somewhat unpredictable, and might require multiple renderings to get the desired result. By default videos have a watermark, which can be disabled by upgrading to Turbo, which also gives you a 10x boost in “fuel” (credits for video generations) compared to the free plan. Like the other text-to-video generators in this comparion, Runway and Pika Labs, Genmo offers the ability to upload a reference image and get a video in a similar style. Pricing Free: 100 daily fuel Turbo mode: 10$/month for 1000 daily fuel Pros High-quality videos at a very reasonable price User-friendly interface making it easy to tweak basic settings for the video generation Cons Restriction on video length, has to be 2, 4 or 6 seconds Lacks the granular control over settings of some higher priced platforms like Runway Who is it best for Content creators looking for a high value-for-money platform for text-to-video generation, either to experiment with or use in their business. What we think of Genmo? Genmo impressed me by the quality of the generated videos, both when starting from mere text prompts as well as when using text + image as the base. Unsurprisingly, results got notably better as I tinkered with the settings, and did multiple renderings. The free tier offers more than enough credits to experiment and evaluate if you want to upgrade (and the Turbo version is very reasonably priced as well). All in all, Genmo should be a strong contender for those wanting to use AI generated video in their business, or just for experimentation purposes. Go to the top 7. OpusClip OpusClip is tailored for effortlessly converting your long-form videos into engaging shorts. Repurposing existing content is a smart business strategy as it allows for maximizing the value of already invested resources. Since it’s highly automated and use friendly, the platforms enables even people with little or no video editing experience to create professional-grade shorts. Uploading a file on OpusClip is uncomplicated, with a variety of formats supported or direct links from Google Drive or YouTube. The platform performs well with talking videos as it leverages the video transcript for editing, aligning well with: Video Podcasts Educational Videos Commentary Videos Product Reviews Motivational Speeches However, it might not be the first choice for Vlogs, Gaming Videos, or Music Videos. By indicating the type of video uploaded, you can help optimize the processing. Generation can take a while for lengthy videos like a 1-hour+ podcast. You have the choice to preset your preferred clip length or set it to auto, with a waiting page keeping you updated on the generation status. In my test, OpusClip did a good job dividing the video, although the auto-gen titles look very much AI. Each newly created video is assigned a virality score from 0-100, hinting at its potential to go viral on platforms like Shorts/Reels/TikTok, which can be a useful indicator for social media engagement. A useful and well-executed feature on the generated shorts are the engaging subtitles that animate with each spoken word. Additionally, emojis occasionally appear with sentiments in the talk – a heart emoji when someone said the word love, for instance, which added a nice touch without being distracting. The original video displays the interviewer and interviewee side by side, and OpusClip adeptly adapts this to a portrait-mode video, which appears totally natural. Pricing Free: 60 upload minutes / month Essential: $19 for 200 upload minutes / month (~80 HD clips) Pros Effortless repurposing of long-form video Generated clips are optimised for specific social media platforms for easy shareability Cons Somewhat limited customisation possibilities Can get expensive if you have a lot of content Who is it best for OpusClip is ideal for content creators and businesses aiming to effortlessly repurpose long-form content into engaging short clips for social media. What we think of OpusClip? OpusClip impressed me with how easy it turns long videos into engaging shorts. It’s algorithm is smart at breaking down videos into different topics, and the virality score for each clip makes it easier to prioritise which shorts to use. The 7-day trial offers 90 minutes of free credits, letting you try out the platform; the only things you won’t be able to access without upgrading are the Fast Queue and Auto Post features. Go to the top 8. Fliki Fliki is a useful AI tool for turning your written content into shareable slideshow-type videos, coupled with high-quality voice narration. It has an AI-powered “convert” function which lets you easily turn a variety of written content into videos: Ideas Blogs PowerPoint presentations Tweets It generates a video from your uploaded content and automatically selects videos and images to match the context of the text. If you often need to make this type of video presentations in your job or for your business, Fliki could potentially be a big time saver. There’s a good degree of customisation possible for the presentations you generate, apart from just switching out the videos and images (you can upload your own or use any of Fliki’s large database of royalty-free stock footage and pictures). For example, Fliki gives you granular control over the audio layer, with music/sounds separated from the voice layer. When it comes to voices, it’s easy to add in realistic sounding voices, which you can also adjust for things like tune, pauses and pronounciation. Pricing Free: 5 minutes of credits / month Standard: 28$ for 180 minutes of credits / month Premium: 88$ for 600 minutes of credits / month Pros Efficiently converts various types of written content into easily shareable slideshow-videos Comprehensive features for editing the content and the voice narration Cons The auto-pick media function misses the mark sometimes, requiring manual selection to get a good result Who is it best for Fliki caters to marketing professionals and content creators seeking to repurpose existing text content into engaging videos, specifically slideshow-type videos. What we think of Fliki? The presentations generated by Fliki do not (yet) look as good as a carefully crafter presentation someone has put together the traditional way. The editing and particularly the stock footage gives it a bit of a generic feel. However, it does a decent job of giving context to the text, and could be useful if you need to make such presentations at scale, such as for a faceless YouTube channel. While the platform can seem less impressive than other platforms in this comparison, as it essentially just creates a slideshow presentation, it could still potentially be a big time-saver if you often need to make presentations of this format.

What are the benefits of using AI video editors? Do you need editing experience to use an AI video editor? Are there limitations to AI video editors? Let us help you with your video marketing strategy Video Marketing 6 AI Video Editors That We Love [2024] Andi Graham | Mar 14, 2024 In this Post: 1. Runway ML 2. Descript 3. Synthesia 4. InVideo AI 5. Pictory 6. Sora (OpenAI) Guide to AI Video Editors Is AI video editing the same thing as text-to-video? Do AI video editors cost money? What are the benefits of using AI video editors? Do you need editing experience to use an AI video editor? Are there limitations to AI video editors? Let us help you with your video marketing strategy In the fast-paced world of digital marketing, creating engaging video content consistently can be a challenge. But what if there was a tool that could automate repetitive tasks, free up your editors for their creative work, and even help you pump out quality videos more quickly? Enter the age of the AI video editor. AI-powered tools are revolutionizing how content is created. At Big Sea, we’ve been diving deep into the world of AI video editors, and we’re excited to share some of our favorites that can help you take your video marketing to the next level. So, without further ado, here are 6 AI video editors that we love at Big Sea. 1. Runway ML Cost: The standard plan is $12 a month for 625 credits. Plans range from free to $76 a month for unlimited and enterprise offerings. The free plan includes 125 credits. Great feature: Training for custom AI generators Runway ML stands out as a video editor because It offers over 30 AI-powered creative tools for manipulating content, generating new scenes, and adding special effects that can be applied to both photos and videos. From style transfers to motion tracking, Runway ML empowers content creators to infuse their videos with AI-driven enhancements. Designed to be accessible, even for those with little editing experience, Runway ML’s tools are great for exploring creative possibilities and generating unique content. Runway ML is a compelling option for creators and marketers who want to explore the potential of AI in their video content. But because its focus is on experimentation, it isn’t always the best option for those looking for a professional-grade video editor. However, If you’re looking for a user-friendly platform to experiment with creative video editing and infuse your content with special effects, Runway ML is definitely worth checking out. To show how easy it is to use (and that you really can create video with their “free” version), we took an extremely simple prompt and produced this cool 4 second clip, which you can view on RunwayML’s platform. Our prompt was simply “Please prepare four seconds of an introduction to an advertisement for the rainforest.” 2. Descript Cost: Plans range from free to $24 a month for pro and enterprise offerings. The free plan comes with 1 hour of transcription & 1 hour of recording. The creator plan is $12 a month for 10 hours. Great feature: Powerful text-based video editing and podcasting Descript is an AI-powered platform that really shines when it comes to text-based editing. Editing a video with Descript is like editing a document. You can see the words spoken in your video and change them directly. This is different from most video editors where you have to move clips of video around on a timeline. It’s a faster and more intuitive way to make cuts, rearrange sections, and fix mistakes. Descript also utilizes AI to streamline audio editing tasks like removing silences or background noise reduction. As a bonus, editors using Descript can record themselves or their screens directly within the program, collaborate easily with team members, and publish and integrate video within existing platforms or marketing tools.

Guide to AI Video Editors Navigating the vast landscape of AI video editors can be overwhelming. To simplify your journey, we’ve put together a comprehensive guide to explore the pros and cons of AI video editors and answer other pertinent questions you might have about them. Hopefully, we’ll be able to help you discover the perfect AI companion for your content creation and video editing needs. Is AI video editing the same thing as text-to-video? While AI video editing encompasses a broad spectrum of tools, text-to-video is a specific aspect within this domain. Text-to-video utilizes AI algorithms to convert written content into visual sequences. AI video editing, on the other hand, includes a wider array of features, incorporating various technologies to enhance and streamline the video production process. Do AI video editors cost money? Yes, most AI video editors come with a cost. While some offer free versions with limited features, premium plans unlock the full potential of these tools. Investing in a paid subscription often grants access to advanced features, increased processing power, and built-in support or resources for a more well-rounded and satisfying editing experience. What are the benefits of using AI video editors? AI video editors offer a variety of benefits that can streamline workflows, boost content creation, and potentially improve the quality of your videos. Here’s a list of some of the key advantages to using an AI video editor: Increased Efficiency: AI automates repetitive tasks like scene identification, transcription, and highlight creation. This frees up editors to focus on the creative aspects of video editing and storytelling. Faster Content Creation: By automating tasks and offering pre-made templates, AI editors can significantly speed up the video creation process, so you can produce more content in less time. Improved Quality: AI can assist with functions like color correction, noise reduction, and even adding subtitles, leading to a more polished and consistent look across your videos. Greater Accessibility: AI editors are often designed with user-friendly interfaces, which makes video creation more accessible to those with less editing experience. Data-Driven Insights: Some AI editors offer features that analyze video performance, helping you understand what resonates with viewers and optimize future content for better engagement. It’s important to remember that AI video editing is still a developing field, and while these tools are powerful, they likely won’t replace the need for human editors entirely. Creativity, editorial judgment, and a strategic approach are still invaluable when crafting truly compelling video content. Do you need editing experience to use an AI video editor? No, AI video editors are designed for user-friendly experiences, so even beginners can produce high-quality content. The intuitive interfaces and automated features of AI-editing tools eliminate complex technicalities, allowing users to try their hand at video editing without a steep learning curve. It is important to note, however, that some AI video editors may require you to spend more time figuring out their more complex editing features. Are there limitations to AI video editors? AI video editors are great for many things, but they’re not perfect for every project. If your video involves a lot of creative choices and really detailed editing, a more traditional video editing program might be a better fit. Also, some complex tasks can take a long time for AI editors to process. Knowing these limitations will help you use AI tools smartly, letting them handle the easy stuff while you focus on the trickier parts of the editing process.

Matt D., Copywriter Sign up Today, creators can find artificial intelligence tools for nearly everything—from writing your YouTube descriptions to adjusting your eye contact in a video. Generative AI, which produces new content based on a single prompt, has changed the game for video generation. It’s made visual storytelling a more accessible task to creators from all backgrounds. It has also made it even more essential for creators to stay in the loop when it comes to AI video generation tools. Because these tools come with a wide range of capabilities: some can generate whole videos from a few words, just like an image generator might. Others use AI for smaller but equally important pieces of the video production process, like background removal. This guide highlights a range of the best AI video generators, outlining their best features and unique benefits they offer when creating videos. What is an AI-generated video? An AI-generated video is a type of video created with machine learning software. These automated systems use algorithms to assemble video elements like images, audio files, and text into a cohesive narrative based on a creator’s prompt. 3 benefits of AI-powered video generators Now we know what an AI video generator is, let’s explore the advantages of using one in your video production process. Efficiency and time savings Unlike traditional manual editing and assembly methods, you don’t need advanced video editing skills to create AI-generated videos. Using AI tools, you can get more done faster. In the past, you'd have to spend hours making videos by meticulously editing footage frame by frame. Today, AI-powered video generators like Synthesia, Descript, and Pictory assemble and make quality videos in a fraction of the time, so you can ship new content to various platforms quickly. Consistency and error reduction A good AI video generator doesn’t glance over tiny details. Programmed with set guidelines, AI video software delivers consistent and virtually error-free video content, making it invaluable for producing any type of video content—from training webinars to—from training webinars to YouTube channel content. Metadata aspects, such as subtitles and additional video data, are handled with the same level of accuracy. The end result: create content that’s not just good, but structurally great and accessible to all viewers. Customizable versatility across formats The real beauty of AI video generators lies in their flexibility. Need an Apple-friendly Quicktime video? Done. A Windows Media video for Microsoft users? No problem. Some generators can even support less common video formats, including MOV, AVI, WMV, and MPEG-4. With added functionality like customizable video templates and transitions, you have a lot of leeway in personalizing videos to your liking using an AI video template.

We’ve summed it up in three steps below. Define your objectives and requirements First, clarify what you want to achieve with an AI video generator. Whether it's social media content, training videos, or explainer videos, each objective requires different features.

Try before you commit Top-of-the-line video generators like Descript have free plans or trial periods. Take advantage of them and test each generator to check whether they meet your objectives and requirements. Be mindful of any watermarks or other limitations that come with the free plan, too, since these could impact the professional look of your videos.

BasedLabs AI 5. Synthesia.io Below you will find more tools and me using each tool and sharing my results and opinions. This article is supported by readers. If you choose to make a purchase using the links below, I might earn a small commission at no cost to you! 1. Colossyan AI 👉 Free trial and 10% off using code ARTTURI Colossyan is an AI video generation platform designed to simplify the process of creating professional videos. It caters to individual content creators, professionals, small teams, and large enterprises, offering a range of tools and features to enhance video production. Let’s see how it performs in my hands! Highlight Features Prompt to Video: Enables creating complete videos from a simple script written by the user. Custom Voice and Avatars: Offers the ability to create custom voices and avatars, including lite avatars for quick recording using a web camera. Avatar Conversations: Supports scenario-based training videos with multiple avatars per scene. Icon Library: Provides a collection of professionally crafted icons. Auto-Translations: Offers automatic translations for videos in different languages. Export Options: Allows exporting in various formats like MP3, SRT, and PDF. Enterprise Features: Includes SCORM export, enhanced security options like SAML/SSO, and collaboration tools. Comprehensive Free Trial: Offers a complete free to try most features for free without signing up. My Experience I extensively tested Colossyan and created some scenes to see how it performs. If you want to get a hunch without having to do anything, just preview one of the ready-made projects on the homepage. But I recommend giving it an actual try. You don’t even need an account to start using the tool which is unlike most tools on this list. Just open up the creator and start creating. Awesome! If you want a detailed guide, you can check the video Colossyan has created. They’ve used their tool to narrate that scene, pretty cool, isn’t it? I’ll share my experiences with the tool below. So first, you need to create the script for the video actor to play. I generated mine with ChatGPT. If you haven’t signed up, there are some heavy limits, though. Just sign up to get more characters to use. Then, it’s time to place the avatar in the right position. I like the ability to freely customize it. For example, you can have a full body shot or just a Bubble-like presentation. Then you can change the background or even place an image or video on it. This way you can make your video look exactly like you want to. The customizations don’t stop at the character. You can do editing on your slides. For example, here I’ve changed the slide background to something nicer: To make the presentation more visually pleasing, you can always add those shapes and other elements to it. Heck, you can even play a song in the background. To this point, I’ve just edited the opening slide and script for the video. To make the video more interesting, you should add more slides to it. This is easy on Colossyan. Just click add more to add more slides and scenes to your presentation. This opens up a scene options view from where you can pick different types of scenes for your project. For example, on this one, I’m adding a guest speaker on the video side by side with my main avatar: Then, you can do the same customizations for the guest avatar as you’ve done with the main one, such as tweak the script. change position, and so on. The only downside I found was that sometimes the software gives me an unexpected error. This is a bit frustrating as you can’t tell what’s causing it. But luckily, you can always save and refresh. Or if you’re stuck, the team will help you resolve any issues right away. Other than that, what a journey! This tool lets you create amazing videos and presentations with AI. Notice how I haven’t even signed up at this point. Yet I was able to create a comprehensive video with all sorts of customizations and perks along the way! You can even try it for free, so why not give it a shot? I cannot recommend this enough. Pros Versatile: Suitable for individuals to large enterprises. The tool can create simple explainer videos as well as more detailed full-on presentations with guests etc. Customization: Extensive options for custom voices, avatars, and imagery. The tool doesn’t just create a video. In addition, you can use it to create a full presentation from start to finish with all the customizations you’ll ever need. Multilingual Support: Offers over 70 languages and auto-translation features. User-Friendly: Simplifies complex video production tasks and more importantly, saves a boatload of time and money. Amazing Free Trial: You can test the tool extensively without even signing up for free. This is unlike most AI video makers on the market. Cons Learning Curve: The tool has all the bells and whistles, so it can take a bit longer to learn how to use it than your average AI video tool. Don’t know if it’s a con, though. Occasional Slowness. I tried choosing templates and the UI froze for a couple of seconds. Nothing too serious but can be a bit confusing. Pricing: May be expensive for individuals or small teams, especially for high-end features. Pricing Starter: $19 per month (billed annually). Pro: $61 per month (billed annually). Enterprise Plan: Custom pricing for extensive features and unlimited video creation. Free Trial: Free, with limited features and video creation minutes. Get 10% off with code ARTTURI Bottom Line Colossyan is the most comprehensive AI video generation tool on the market. It offers a broad range of features suitable for various users. I also had a chat with their team and founders. They’re such a helpful bunch of people! Colossyan’s strength lies in its customization options and ease of use. This in my opinion makes it a valuable tool for creators looking to create high-quality videos with minimal effort and cost. I’d give it a shot! You can try it for free with this link.

I Tried 15 AI Headshot Generators. Here’s My Verdict ---------------------------------------------------- ### I spent $2,000 to find the best AI headshot generator on the market. In this post, I will show you my results medium.com 2. HeyGen AI HeyGen is one of the most impressive uses of AI video I’ve ever seen. This tool allows you to create a perfect clone of yourself. One that talks like you and acts like you. It even speaks in different languages. Here’s how my AI version compares to the real me. You can watch a short video of myself using the tool and what it’s capable of here: Try HeyGen for Free Key Features Let’s take a short look at the features of HeyGen. AI Video Creation: HeyGen turns text into presentation-style videos. Customizable AI Avatars: HeyGen has 100+ AI avatars you can customize. Cloning. This tool allows you to clone yourself with AI and make it speak any language. Templates: HeyGen comes with templates for marketing, presentations, and more. LLM Integration: HeyGen has a ChatGPT integration you can use for scripting. This smoothens the process of video creation for you. Plus a lot more. My Experience Let me show you what the tool did for me. Although there are lots of features, I think the best way to demonstrate this one is by showing how AI cloning works. Feel free to follow along or just read along. If you want to create an avatar for yourself, sign up here. You can skip the introduction videos and instructions as I will show you everything here. Next, let’s create an AI clone for you. Go to the home view (where you’ll land automatically.) Then click on “Create Instant Avatar:” Next, it’s time to submit a video of yourself. This is so the AI can learn how you sound and move. Make sure that these are good in your video: Good lighting Quiet space Be as natural as you can Make gestures below your chest Have a longer pause between each sentence You can use your smart device's camera Look at the camera as you speak Film for 2–5 minutes. You can speak in any language. Then just submit your clip to HeyGen. It can take a while for the AI to process. This takes about 5–10 minutes. You can exit the screen. HeyGen will let you know when the AI clone has been created via email. Once the AI avatar is ready, it appears in the “My Avatar” section in the main view of HeyGen. Just click on it! It will greet you :) Impressive, isn’t it? But let’s start using it! Go to the main view of HeyGen, and click on “Create with AI Studio.” Then, add a script from the left-hand side. This can be any text that you want the AI to speak on your behalf (in your character.) You can use AI to generate the script too! Remember to include your avatar in the scene. To do this, click on the “Avatar” on the left and click on your image to use your AI clone. Unfortunately, you cannot preview your video before the AI has created it. (You can preview your voice, though.) Also, it takes a while (and costs a bit) to create the video, so make sure that before you generate these things are in place: Your AI avatar is in use and is added to the blank canvas (as I mentioned before) Your voice clone is activated. Click your avatar and choose your voice if it’s not already. At this point, you can change your language if you want to! Then hit the “Submit” button to generate the video. This will send your script to HeyGen AI which will then use your avatar to render a video. This takes 5–10 minutes again. Once the video is ready, HeyGen sends you a message through email. Enjoy! Pros Realistic AI. Oh my, how realistic those AI speakers are—needless to mention how good the AI clone was. Wow! No useless features to make the tool look more impressive. It’s straight to the point, simple, and powerful! Easy to use—although it takes a bit time to render the videos and upload your video. There’s a free trial you can use. Not on cloning, though :( Try HeyGen for Free! Cons Expensive for individuals. I calculated that at the moment a 10-minute video with my AI clone costs about $40. Slow. It took about 30 minutes from sign-up to create my clone that spoke a 30-second script. Impractical. Although it’s powerful, I cannot see myself using it because it takes time and costs a lot. It’s easier for me to just film those videos myself. Pricing Free: $0 Creator: $24/mo Team: $120/mo Enterprise: Contact sales Bottom Line I love HeyGen. The cloning thing is perhaps the most impressive use of AI I’ve seen. Although it’s a bit slow and impractical, it’s scary good, and accurate. I’d definitely give it a try. If you’re shy in front of a camera or if you’ve always wanted to speak different languages, this is the tool for you. You can generate realistic presentations with the pre-built actors too! Try HeyGen for Free 3. DeepBrain AI Best Overall — Start a Free Trial Using This Link! DeepBrain AI is one of the best AI video-generating tools out there! You can use this tool to generate many types of videos from advertisements to greetings to sales pitches. No matter what business/individual use you have in your mind, this tool has got your back. DeepBrain AI is a simple text-to-video generator that uses the latest advancements in AI. Although the tool is already impressive, thanks to the massive developments in AI, it will probably improve. In my eyes, this tool could be one of the go-to AI video generators of the future. My Experience with Deepbrain AI DeepBrain has a ton of cool presets to use. You can choose from a presentation to a sales pitch to a greeting. Many options give me a great variety of choices for different use cases. Here’s an example presentation I’m generating on DeepBrain AI: The UI flows smoothly, although there is a small lag when moving from one scene to another. Also, at first, it wasn’t quite clear to me how you insert the script but once I realized how it’s done it became super easy to use the tool. This is a test of using the presentation feature of DeepBrain AI. This tool converts text to speech in a video format that looks nice and professional. One cool feature of this tool is you don’t even need to create the scripts yourself — you can use AI to do that. For example, here I ask AI to generate a sales pitch about what types of houses to live in: Once you’ve done this step, you can just insert the AI-generated text into the script. Once this is done, the video reads the generated text. Pretty sleek, isn’t it? This is where AI is taking us :) If you’re not happy with the presets, you can always customize or edit things around, such as: Voice actor Background Fonts and colors Add music and sound effects Notice that this tool doesn’t generate arbitrary videos (at least not yet), but instead, you can generate those awesome presentation videos where a person speaks your text out. BTW, this applies to all the AI video-generating tools. This will likely change drastically in the next 2–3 years. Speaking of features, let’s take a closer look at what DeepBrain AI comes with. Key Features Supports a ton of languages GPT-powered text generator for generating scenes A ton of AI voice actors Accurate text-to-video Realistic videos and voice actors Support for multiple use cases Affordable pricing 24/7 support chat Pricing DeepBrain has three pricing plans: $29/month for basic use Custom for power users and enterprises (contact the sales team) Free trial with the link below Try DeepBrain AI 4. BasedLabs AI Try free with this link BasedLabs.ai is a platform focused on AI-generated images and video content. Unlike most video generators on this list, BasedLabs focuses on creating short videos about anything, not just presentations. For most visitors who aren’t looking for pitches and presentations, this is the best video maker tool online. It offers a variety of tools and features for generating and exploring AI-generated visual content. Let’s see how this tool performs. Key Features AI tools for visual content creation Intuitive interface A community for sharing and exploring content 👉 Get 10% off all plans with code ARTTURI My Experience It’s been all hype and promises for now. But let’s see how the tool actually performs. I will show you how I was able to generate these two videos with the tool and assess the quality and overall process at the same. To start creating videos with AI, just hit the “Generate” button on the homepage. Then you need to create an account. I used Google to sign up to make it faster. I just gave it a generic name like “AIvideotester”: Once your account is created, you can start making videos with AI. If you don’t have an input image, you can use AI to generate images in BasedLabs. For example, here I create one. Just a simple prompt will do, no need to make it this complex if you don’t want to. Then it takes about 15 seconds to generate those images. And here’s the resulting image set: I chose the top-most one. I think it looks good for now. Then it’s time to start converting the image to a video. Just hit next. This opens up the video view. For now, you can just use a basic motion slider to increase/decrease movement in the video. There’s no input for the video creator to tell what to do in the video. So you will need to let the AI do the work here. Just hit “Make Video” and it starts doing its magic. This took about 30 seconds for me. Don’t be confused if the loading bar sticks at 0% for about 10–20 seconds. That’s normal! After waiting for a while, here’s the result video: Pretty impressive, isn’t it? Although the video is short, this is something I made completely out of thin air in just 2 minutes or less. That’s awesome. This already gives you an idea of what the tool can do. But let me try another feature just to show how awesome it is. Let’s try to drop an image into the video editor and turn it into a video. Here’s an image from Finland that a photographer has taken. I want to turn this into a video. So here’s what I did. I dropped this image to the BasedLabs video generator view. Then it verified if I wanted to proceed with this image: Once again, now there are no controls for me to use. So this image is automatically converted to a video by the AI now. It took about 30–40 seconds this time. Here’s the result: Just wow! The clouds look very realistic and the movement looks smooth and real. I’m shocked at how well this tool performed. Of course, this clip is still short and for example, the water is still. But that’s nonetheless very impressive. I can just imagine what this tool can do in a year or two… 👉 Get 10% off all plans with code ARTTURI Pros User-friendly and very easy to use Free trial to experiment with different videos and creations High-quality AI-generated videos Community from which you can draw inspiration Amazing results (although short) Cons Limitations in the toolset, for example, you cannot tell what to do in the video Not for long-form videos, those are just 1–2 seconds in length. Some performance issues as I had to wait almost a minute for a short clip to generate Some videos look unrealistic and robotic Pricing Creator: $12/mo Pro: $28/mo 👉 Get 10% off all plans with code ARTTURI Bottom Line BasedLabs is awesome. Better yet, it’s free to try. It’s the first tool that I encountered that makes these short AI clips that people have been craving for for a long time now. The tool was awesome. It was relatively quick, the results were good (although short), and the quality was amazing. Oh, and by the way, you can also create images with this one. If you don’t have an input image, you can generate one with BasedLabs and then turn it into a video. Try Basedlabs for FREE 5. Synthesia.io 👉 Try for free and get 10% off with code ARTTURI Synthesia is an AI-based video generator that uses state-of-the-art AI algorithms to produce unique and realistic videos. Not only is it a great tool for generating videos, but it offers you a good video editor solution for the post-production phase. This way you can make your generated videos even better. There are multiple styles of videos you can choose from. For example, you can use Synthesia to generate videos for product demos, marketing, greetings, and much more. Notice that Synthesia is by no means restricted to English content only. The tool supports 60+ languages which makes it a great choice for someone to create videos for clients in pretty much any country. Synthesia works for all kinds of businesses. You don’t need any experience in video editing or speaking in front of a camera. Instead, you can let the AI do the heavy lifting. To create a video, all you need to do is enter a text input that will be spoken on the video. Also, you need to choose the style of the video and the AI speaker for it. 👉 Activate your free trial My Experience with Synthesia Here’s an example video I just generated to praise my imaginary colleague: It was pretty simple to create a video with Synthesia for free. All I had to do was enter a short text prompt to view and choose the type of video to generate. This quite literally took 30 seconds to do. Once you have requested Synthesia to generate a free video, you need to wait for a minute or two. To access the video, you need to enter your email address where the new video will be sent after it has been completed. Of course, the video content must be appropriate. Otherwise, Synthesia won’t generate it for you. So please, only use it professionally! After a couple of minutes of waiting, Synthesia sent me an email with the video. Not only could I watch the video but also share it here on this blog post. Synthesia makes it easy to share your videos on social platforms and blog posts if you wish. I think using Synthesia is seamless and the free trial version is worth trying. The result is unbelievable — something I would think to be impossible just a couple of years back! 👉 Activate your free trial Key Features Here are some of the most notable features of Synthesia. The free trial you can play with before purchasing a paid plan. Easy to use interface. Natural video and voice. Different video styles and voices to choose from.

InVideo.io InVideo offers a powerful AI for generating videos for marketing and explanations. To create with InVideo, you don’t need to have a video creation or video editing background. The tool intelligently splits your input script into logical parts. Besides, the tool chooses matching visuals to the scenes that you can adjust. There are lots of templates, workflows, and assets to choose from. With InVideo, you can create high-quality videos to meet your professional needs. One thing I like about this solution is you can try InVideo for free. Of course, there will be a watermark on the exported video. But if you like the quality of the videos, you can consider subscribing to a paid plan to get rid of the watermarks. My Experience with InVideo Here is an example video I generated with InVideo in 2 minutes. ✅ I’m amazed by the accuracy of the InVideo video visuals. The tool picked these automatically without my input! I’m talking about AI in the video, and the tool chose visuals about AI and human evolution towards AI. Let me briefly show you my experience with InVideo. You can try InVideo for free. Before creating your first clip, you need to sign up for a free trial and answer a quick quiz. For me, the sign-up took about a minute among the quiz. Once you’ve signed up, the video editor pops up. From the video editor view, you can choose a workflow that best meets your demand. The options are: Templates Text-to-video Stock media Editor To test the InVideo, I picked Text-to-Video. Then you can enter the text script into the tool and it will convert it into a video. I wrote a small script for my brand new video about AI video generation and how it will disrupt the video industry. The tool intelligently splits the text input into different scenes. For example, one of my paragraphs was too long to fit one scene. The tool resolved this by splitting it into two sections. You can make adjustments yourself if you don’t like the automated edits made by InVideo. Once the video is complete, you can download and share it. For me, it took about 30 seconds to render my short 30-second clip or so. The free version has watermarks on it. To get rid of the watermarks, you need to subscribe to a paid plan. Overall the experience with InVideo is great. It didn’t take longer than 2 minutes to produce a nice 30-second clip that normally would take me 15–30 minutes to produce. Key Features Let’s take a look at some of the most notable features of InVideo. AI-powered video generation capabilities with great automated decision-making make the videos look professional. There is a free trial you can try (although there will be watermarks on your videos). Great sharing capabilities for making your video go live on social channels as well as shareable through links. A bunch of themes, workflows, and templates to choose from. Affordable pricing models. Pricing There are three plans to choose from on InVideo: Free: A free trial with watermarks on the videos. Business: $15/month with no watermarks and 60 video exports. Unlimited: $30/month with unlimited video exports. Try Invideo for Free 7. Pictory Best for Quick Access. Pictory is an AI video generator that lets you both create and edit high-quality videos with ease. To use the tool, you don’t need any background in video editing or design. You can let the tool do the heavy lifting for you. The best part is you can try the tool for free. All you need to do is create a free account and start creating. Pictory asks you for either a script or an article based on which you want to create a video. The article option converts your blog post into a compelling and engaging video that fits your social media or website. All you need to do is tell Pictory the link to the blog post you want to convert to a video. The Pictory library comes with 3M+ royalty-free clips and photos you can choose from. This ensures the videos are on brand and look professional. My Experience with Pictory You can watch my example video here. It took about 3 minutes to generate this one. Using Pictory is intuitive and easy. It’s meant for those who have no video-making background. To get started, all you need to do is create an account. You don’t even need to verify the account to start generating. The first thing the tool asks is based on what you want to generate the video. You have two options: Script Article In my case, I chose the script as I wanted to generate a video based on my simple text input. After inserting the script, I got to choose from video templates. There are many quality templates to choose from. After choosing the template, the editing window opens up. In this view, you can make quick and easy edits to your video. For example, you can choose the visuals for your video background. There is a big library of visuals to choose from. When the video is ready, all you need to do is wait for it to export.

Recently, OpenAI released a video generator called Sora. Currently (March 2024), the tool is still unavailable for general use, and OpenAI is experimenting with it. That’s why it’s not on the list!
