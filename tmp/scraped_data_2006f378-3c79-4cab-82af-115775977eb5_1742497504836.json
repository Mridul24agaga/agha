An AI video tool is software that uses artificial intelligence to assist in creating, editing, or refining video content. These tools use advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to automate complex tasks, improve efficiency, and improve the overall quality of video production. AI video generator capabilities often include automatic editing, scene detection, video summarization, special effects, and personalized content recommendations, making video production more accessible for users with varying levels of expertise. Benefits of using an AI Video tool for content creation According to a recent report, about 92% of video marketers think video content results in increased return on investment (ROI). AI video tools transform video production by facilitating faster turnaround times, reducing production costs, and increasing experimentation and innovation. Let‚Äôs explore the key benefits of AI video generators for content creators. 1. Increased efficiency AI automates repetitive tasks like editing out pauses and applying effects, reducing production time. Videos that once took days can be completed in hours or even minutes, allowing for faster content creation. 2. Effortless personalization AI can analyze data to tailor videos to individual viewers. Imagine educational content that adjusts difficulty based on a student‚Äôs progress or marketing campaigns with product recommendations specific to a customer‚Äôs browsing habits. Personalization allows deeper engagement and increases the impact of your message. 3. Accessibility for all AI video generators with user-friendly interfaces empower non-technical creators to produce high-quality videos. Pre-built templates and drag-and-drop functionality make video creation intuitive and accessible, democratizing the content creation process. 4. Global reach with localization AI can translate scripts and generate captions, breaking down language barriers and expanding your video‚Äôs reach to a worldwide audience. This allows you to cater to international markets and maximize the potential of your content. 5. Content experimentation at scale AI facilitates A/B testing of different video elements, enabling data-driven decisions about what resonates best with your audience. This allows you to experiment with various video parts, like introductions or calls to action, to optimize your content marketing for maximum engagement. Potential challenges of using AI video tools for content creation While AI video tools offer compelling benefits, it‚Äôs essential to understand the potential challenges of this evolving technology. Let‚Äôs discuss some key considerations when using AI video generators for content creation. 1. Ethical considerations and bias AI algorithms are trained on existing data, which can perpetuate societal biases. Be aware of potential biases in the AI‚Äôs output, such as gender or racial stereotypes, and actively mitigate them to ensure fair and inclusive content creation. 2. Copyright concerns AI tools that generate content based on existing data can raise copyright issues. Understand the legalities of using copyrighted material within your AI-generated videos and ensure proper attribution where necessary. Also, consider AI privacy and consider the ethical implications of using AI in your creations to avoid stepping into legal gray areas. 3. Creative control and nuance While AI excels at automation, capturing the human touch of storytelling and emotional resonance can be challenging. Nuances in humor, sarcasm, or cultural references may be missed by AI, requiring creators to carefully curate the creative direction and emotional tone of their videos. 4. Quality concerns AI-generated videos often struggle with maintaining consistency and realism, particularly in complex scenes or with nuanced human expressions. Additionally, AI systems are susceptible to hallucinations, fabricating details or producing false information. Key factors to consider when choosing an AI video tool A recent study shows that as many as 91% of consumers want to see more online video content from brands, To harness the full potential of AI for your video creation needs, here are some key factors to consider as you choose the right AI video tool for your business: 1.

It can speak, present, and more. I have used all of these tools so you don‚Äôt have to. Top picks Here are the links to the free trials of each tool: 1. Colossyan AI 2. HeyGen AI 3. DeepBrain AI 4. BasedLabs AI 5. Synthesia.io Below you will find more tools and me using each tool and sharing my results and opinions. This article is supported by readers. If you choose to make a purchase using the links below, I might earn a small commission at no cost to you! 1. Colossyan AI üëâ Free trial and 10% off using code ARTTURI Colossyan is an AI video generation platform designed to simplify the process of creating professional videos. It caters to individual content creators, professionals, small teams, and large enterprises, offering a range of tools and features to enhance video production. Let‚Äôs see how it performs in my hands! Highlight Features Prompt to Video: Enables creating complete videos from a simple script written by the user. Custom Voice and Avatars: Offers the ability to create custom voices and avatars, including lite avatars for quick recording using a web camera. Avatar Conversations: Supports scenario-based training videos with multiple avatars per scene. Icon Library: Provides a collection of professionally crafted icons.

Enterprise Features: Includes SCORM export, enhanced security options like SAML/SSO, and collaboration tools. Comprehensive Free Trial: Offers a complete free to try most features for free without signing up. My Experience I extensively tested Colossyan and created some scenes to see how it performs. If you want to get a hunch without having to do anything, just preview one of the ready-made projects on the homepage. But I recommend giving it an actual try. You don‚Äôt even need an account to start using the tool which is unlike most tools on this list. Just open up the creator and start creating. Awesome! If you want a detailed guide, you can check the video Colossyan has created. They‚Äôve used their tool to narrate that scene, pretty cool, isn‚Äôt it? I‚Äôll share my experiences with the tool below. So first, you need to create the script for the video actor to play. I generated mine with ChatGPT. If you haven‚Äôt signed up, there are some heavy limits, though. Just sign up to get more characters to use. Then, it‚Äôs time to place the avatar in the right position. I like the ability to freely customize it. For example, you can have a full body shot or just a Bubble-like presentation. Then you can change the background or even place an image or video on it. This way you can make your video look exactly like you want to. The customizations don‚Äôt stop at the character. You can do editing on your slides. For example, here I‚Äôve changed the slide background to something nicer: To make the presentation more visually pleasing, you can always add those shapes and other elements to it. Heck, you can even play a song in the background. To this point, I‚Äôve just edited the opening slide and script for the video. To make the video more interesting, you should add more slides to it. This is easy on Colossyan. Just click add more to add more slides and scenes to your presentation. This opens up a scene options view from where you can pick different types of scenes for your project. For example, on this one, I‚Äôm adding a guest speaker on the video side by side with my main avatar: Then, you can do the same customizations for the guest avatar as you‚Äôve done with the main one, such as tweak the script. change position, and so on. The only downside I found was that sometimes the software gives me an unexpected error. This is a bit frustrating as you can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs causing it. But luckily, you can always save and refresh. Or if you‚Äôre stuck, the team will help you resolve any issues right away. Other than that, what a journey! This tool lets you create amazing videos and presentations with AI. Notice how I haven‚Äôt even signed up at this point. Yet I was able to create a comprehensive video with all sorts of customizations and perks along the way! You can even try it for free, so why not give it a shot? I cannot recommend this enough. Pros Versatile: Suitable for individuals to large enterprises. The tool can create simple explainer videos as well as more detailed full-on presentations with guests etc. Customization: Extensive options for custom voices, avatars, and imagery. The tool doesn‚Äôt just create a video. In addition, you can use it to create a full presentation from start to finish with all the customizations you‚Äôll ever need. Multilingual Support: Offers over 70 languages and auto-translation features. User-Friendly: Simplifies complex video production tasks and more importantly, saves a boatload of time and money. Amazing Free Trial: You can test the tool extensively without even signing up for free. This is unlike most AI video makers on the market. Cons Learning Curve: The tool has all the bells and whistles, so it can take a bit longer to learn how to use it than your average AI video tool. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a con, though. Occasional Slowness. I tried choosing templates and the UI froze for a couple of seconds. Nothing too serious but can be a bit confusing. Pricing: May be expensive for individuals or small teams, especially for high-end features. Pricing Starter: $19 per month (billed annually). Pro: $61 per month (billed annually). Enterprise Plan: Custom pricing for extensive features and unlimited video creation. Free Trial: Free, with limited features and video creation minutes. Get 10% off with code ARTTURI Bottom Line Colossyan is the most comprehensive AI video generation tool on the market. It offers a broad range of features suitable for various users. I also had a chat with their team and founders. They‚Äôre such a helpful bunch of people! Colossyan‚Äôs strength lies in its customization options and ease of use. This in my opinion makes it a valuable tool for creators looking to create high-quality videos with minimal effort and cost. I‚Äôd give it a shot! You can try it for free with this link.

I Tried 15 AI Headshot Generators. Here‚Äôs My Verdict ---------------------------------------------------- ### I spent $2,000 to find the best AI headshot generator on the market. In this post, I will show you my results medium.com 2. HeyGen AI HeyGen is one of the most impressive uses of AI video I‚Äôve ever seen. This tool allows you to create a perfect clone of yourself. One that talks like you and acts like you. It even speaks in different languages. Here‚Äôs how my AI version compares to the real me. You can watch a short video of myself using the tool and what it‚Äôs capable of here: Try HeyGen for Free Key Features Let‚Äôs take a short look at the features of HeyGen. AI Video Creation: HeyGen turns text into presentation-style videos. Customizable AI Avatars: HeyGen has 100+ AI avatars you can customize. Cloning. This tool allows you to clone yourself with AI and make it speak any language. Templates: HeyGen comes with templates for marketing, presentations, and more. LLM Integration: HeyGen has a ChatGPT integration you can use for scripting. This smoothens the process of video creation for you. Plus a lot more. My Experience Let me show you what the tool did for me. Although there are lots of features, I think the best way to demonstrate this one is by showing how AI cloning works. Feel free to follow along or just read along. If you want to create an avatar for yourself, sign up here. You can skip the introduction videos and instructions as I will show you everything here. Next, let‚Äôs create an AI clone for you. Go to the home view (where you‚Äôll land automatically.) Then click on ‚ÄúCreate Instant Avatar:‚Äù Next, it‚Äôs time to submit a video of yourself. This is so the AI can learn how you sound and move. Make sure that these are good in your video: Good lighting Quiet space Be as natural as you can Make gestures below your chest Have a longer pause between each sentence You can use your smart device's camera Look at the camera as you speak Film for 2‚Äì5 minutes. You can speak in any language. Then just submit your clip to HeyGen. It can take a while for the AI to process. This takes about 5‚Äì10 minutes. You can exit the screen. HeyGen will let you know when the AI clone has been created via email. Once the AI avatar is ready, it appears in the ‚ÄúMy Avatar‚Äù section in the main view of HeyGen. Just click on it! It will greet you :) Impressive, isn‚Äôt it? But let‚Äôs start using it! Go to the main view of HeyGen, and click on ‚ÄúCreate with AI Studio.‚Äù Then, add a script from the left-hand side. This can be any text that you want the AI to speak on your behalf (in your character.) You can use AI to generate the script too! Remember to include your avatar in the scene. To do this, click on the ‚ÄúAvatar‚Äù on the left and click on your image to use your AI clone. Unfortunately, you cannot preview your video before the AI has created it. (You can preview your voice, though.) Also, it takes a while (and costs a bit) to create the video, so make sure that before you generate these things are in place: Your AI avatar is in use and is added to the blank canvas (as I mentioned before) Your voice clone is activated. Click your avatar and choose your voice if it‚Äôs not already. At this point, you can change your language if you want to! Then hit the ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù button to generate the video. This will send your script to HeyGen AI which will then use your avatar to render a video. This takes 5‚Äì10 minutes again. Once the video is ready, HeyGen sends you a message through email. Enjoy! Pros Realistic AI. Oh my, how realistic those AI speakers are‚Äîneedless to mention how good the AI clone was. Wow! No useless features to make the tool look more impressive. It‚Äôs straight to the point, simple, and powerful! Easy to use‚Äîalthough it takes a bit time to render the videos and upload your video. There‚Äôs a free trial you can use. Not on cloning, though :( Try HeyGen for Free! Cons Expensive for individuals. I calculated that at the moment a 10-minute video with my AI clone costs about $40. Slow. It took about 30 minutes from sign-up to create my clone that spoke a 30-second script. Impractical. Although it‚Äôs powerful, I cannot see myself using it because it takes time and costs a lot. It‚Äôs easier for me to just film those videos myself. Pricing Free: $0 Creator: $24/mo Team: $120/mo Enterprise: Contact sales Bottom Line I love HeyGen. The cloning thing is perhaps the most impressive use of AI I‚Äôve seen. Although it‚Äôs a bit slow and impractical, it‚Äôs scary good, and accurate. I‚Äôd definitely give it a try. If you‚Äôre shy in front of a camera or if you‚Äôve always wanted to speak different languages, this is the tool for you. You can generate realistic presentations with the pre-built actors too! Try HeyGen for Free 3. DeepBrain AI Best Overall ‚Äî Start a Free Trial Using This Link! DeepBrain AI is one of the best AI video-generating tools out there! You can use this tool to generate many types of videos from advertisements to greetings to sales pitches. No matter what business/individual use you have in your mind, this tool has got your back. DeepBrain AI is a simple text-to-video generator that uses the latest advancements in AI. Although the tool is already impressive, thanks to the massive developments in AI, it will probably improve. In my eyes, this tool could be one of the go-to AI video generators of the future. My Experience with Deepbrain AI DeepBrain has a ton of cool presets to use. You can choose from a presentation to a sales pitch to a greeting. Many options give me a great variety of choices for different use cases. Here‚Äôs an example presentation I‚Äôm generating on DeepBrain AI: The UI flows smoothly, although there is a small lag when moving from one scene to another. Also, at first, it wasn‚Äôt quite clear to me how you insert the script but once I realized how it‚Äôs done it became super easy to use the tool. This is a test of using the presentation feature of DeepBrain AI. This tool converts text to speech in a video format that looks nice and professional. One cool feature of this tool is you don‚Äôt even need to create the scripts yourself ‚Äî you can use AI to do that. For example, here I ask AI to generate a sales pitch about what types of houses to live in: Once you‚Äôve done this step, you can just insert the AI-generated text into the script. Once this is done, the video reads the generated text. Pretty sleek, isn‚Äôt it? This is where AI is taking us :) If you‚Äôre not happy with the presets, you can always customize or edit things around, such as: Voice actor Background Fonts and colors Add music and sound effects Notice that this tool doesn‚Äôt generate arbitrary videos (at least not yet), but instead, you can generate those awesome presentation videos where a person speaks your text out. BTW, this applies to all the AI video-generating tools. This will likely change drastically in the next 2‚Äì3 years. Speaking of features, let‚Äôs take a closer look at what DeepBrain AI comes with. Key Features Supports a ton of languages GPT-powered text generator for generating scenes A ton of AI voice actors Accurate text-to-video Realistic videos and voice actors Support for multiple use cases Affordable pricing 24/7 support chat Pricing DeepBrain has three pricing plans: $29/month for basic use Custom for power users and enterprises (contact the sales team) Free trial with the link below Try DeepBrain AI 4. BasedLabs AI Try free with this link BasedLabs.ai is a platform focused on AI-generated images and video content. Unlike most video generators on this list, BasedLabs focuses on creating short videos about anything, not just presentations. For most visitors who aren‚Äôt looking for pitches and presentations, this is the best video maker tool online. It offers a variety of tools and features for generating and exploring AI-generated visual content. Let‚Äôs see how this tool performs. Key Features AI tools for visual content creation Intuitive interface A community for sharing and exploring content üëâ Get 10% off all plans with code ARTTURI My Experience It‚Äôs been all hype and promises for now. But let‚Äôs see how the tool actually performs. I will show you how I was able to generate these two videos with the tool and assess the quality and overall process at the same. To start creating videos with AI, just hit the ‚ÄúGenerate‚Äù button on the homepage. Then you need to create an account. I used Google to sign up to make it faster. I just gave it a generic name like ‚ÄúAIvideotester‚Äù: Once your account is created, you can start making videos with AI. If you don‚Äôt have an input image, you can use AI to generate images in BasedLabs. For example, here I create one. Just a simple prompt will do, no need to make it this complex if you don‚Äôt want to. Then it takes about 15 seconds to generate those images. And here‚Äôs the resulting image set: I chose the top-most one. I think it looks good for now. Then it‚Äôs time to start converting the image to a video. Just hit next. This opens up the video view. For now, you can just use a basic motion slider to increase/decrease movement in the video. There‚Äôs no input for the video creator to tell what to do in the video. So you will need to let the AI do the work here. Just hit ‚ÄúMake Video‚Äù and it starts doing its magic. This took about 30 seconds for me. Don‚Äôt be confused if the loading bar sticks at 0% for about 10‚Äì20 seconds. That‚Äôs normal! After waiting for a while, here‚Äôs the result video: Pretty impressive, isn‚Äôt it? Although the video is short, this is something I made completely out of thin air in just 2 minutes or less. That‚Äôs awesome. This already gives you an idea of what the tool can do. But let me try another feature just to show how awesome it is. Let‚Äôs try to drop an image into the video editor and turn it into a video. Here‚Äôs an image from Finland that a photographer has taken. I want to turn this into a video. So here‚Äôs what I did. I dropped this image to the BasedLabs video generator view. Then it verified if I wanted to proceed with this image: Once again, now there are no controls for me to use. So this image is automatically converted to a video by the AI now. It took about 30‚Äì40 seconds this time. Here‚Äôs the result: Just wow! The clouds look very realistic and the movement looks smooth and real. I‚Äôm shocked at how well this tool performed.

Also, you need to choose the style of the video and the AI speaker for it. üëâ Activate your free trial My Experience with Synthesia Here‚Äôs an example video I just generated to praise my imaginary colleague: It was pretty simple to create a video with Synthesia for free. All I had to do was enter a short text prompt to view and choose the type of video to generate. This quite literally took 30 seconds to do. Once you have requested Synthesia to generate a free video, you need to wait for a minute or two. To access the video, you need to enter your email address where the new video will be sent after it has been completed. Of course, the video content must be appropriate. Otherwise, Synthesia won‚Äôt generate it for you. So please, only use it professionally! After a couple of minutes of waiting, Synthesia sent me an email with the video. Not only could I watch the video but also share it here on this blog post. Synthesia makes it easy to share your videos on social platforms and blog posts if you wish.

InVideo.io InVideo offers a powerful AI for generating videos for marketing and explanations. To create with InVideo, you don‚Äôt need to have a video creation or video editing background. The tool intelligently splits your input script into logical parts. Besides, the tool chooses matching visuals to the scenes that you can adjust. There are lots of templates, workflows, and assets to choose from. With InVideo, you can create high-quality videos to meet your professional needs.

My Experience with InVideo Here is an example video I generated with InVideo in 2 minutes. ‚úÖ I‚Äôm amazed by the accuracy of the InVideo video visuals. The tool picked these automatically without my input! I‚Äôm talking about AI in the video, and the tool chose visuals about AI and human evolution towards AI. Let me briefly show you my experience with InVideo. You can try InVideo for free. Before creating your first clip, you need to sign up for a free trial and answer a quick quiz. For me, the sign-up took about a minute among the quiz. Once you‚Äôve signed up, the video editor pops up. From the video editor view, you can choose a workflow that best meets your demand. The options are: Templates Text-to-video Stock media Editor To test the InVideo, I picked Text-to-Video. Then you can enter the text script into the tool and it will convert it into a video. I wrote a small script for my brand new video about AI video generation and how it will disrupt the video industry. The tool intelligently splits the text input into different scenes. For example, one of my paragraphs was too long to fit one scene. The tool resolved this by splitting it into two sections. You can make adjustments yourself if you don‚Äôt like the automated edits made by InVideo. Once the video is complete, you can download and share it. For me, it took about 30 seconds to render my short 30-second clip or so. The free version has watermarks on it. To get rid of the watermarks, you need to subscribe to a paid plan. Overall the experience with InVideo is great. It didn‚Äôt take longer than 2 minutes to produce a nice 30-second clip that normally would take me 15‚Äì30 minutes to produce.

Load More Results Home Marketing Disruptive AI Video Trends that are Transforming Marketing in 2024 Disruptive AI Video Trends that are Transforming Marketing in 2024 Written by: Kipp Bodnar and Kieran Flanagan THE STATE OF AI IN 2024 New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing with AI. Download the Free Report Updated: 08/01/24 Published: 07/23/24 AI-generated video content is turning the marketing world on its head. But what trends should marketers be focusing on to stay ahead of the competition? If you've been following the latest buzz in AI marketing trends ‚Äî and you should be ‚Äî you know that AI video tools are at the forefront of this change. Whether it‚Äôs trained ad avatars or hyper-personalized video scripts, these technologies are irreversibly changing how we create content and engage with our audiences. But with such rapid innovation, what‚Äôs actually worth the hype? Kieran and I experimented with some of these new developments in a recent episode of Marketing Against the Grain, including a viral AI video on Twitter and an AI-generated ad created in less than 15 minutes. Among the many AI video options available, these four trends have been particularly notable ‚Äî and are worth paying close attention to. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video 1. Avatar actors and likeness licensing are the new norm. Instead of hiring an actor to read a script or act in an ad, businesses can now license an actor‚Äôs likeness, use it to train an AI model, and then use that model to create ads and avatars. This enables marketers to quickly generate a variety of content, testing, and refining different approaches and messages without the logistical constraints of traditional video shoots. For example, this viral video ad features a woman casually talking about a product while seated inside her car. What‚Äôs so significant about it, however, is that while she‚Äôs a real actress hired off of Fiverr, the video itself is generated by AI video, using tools like Arcads. \"This produces video content that is human-trained but AI-agent delivered,\" Kieran explains. \"That‚Äôs quite an unbelievable concept to think through.\" 2. Low-quality but authentic content is driving engagement. Polished, high-budget video ads are quickly becoming a thing of the past ‚Äî or at least, less favored by audiences. Instead, low-production, personable videos are taking the lead, outperforming traditional ads on platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels. Take, for example, the viral video I mentioned above: it‚Äôs not polished or high-budget. Instead, it‚Äôs set in a poorly-lit car, with an unflattering angle. Yet people are more likely to engage with it. Why? \"Because it feels authentic, relatable, and personable,\" Kieran explains. \"It‚Äôs how a real person would talk about a product.\" For marketers, this shift means experimenting with AI tools like HeyGen and InfinityAI, which quickly create videos that drive engagement, despite ‚Äî or even because of ‚Äî their imperfections. 3. Video personalization and customization are must-haves. Hyper-personalized videos that cater to customers‚Äô accessibility needs, languages, and preferences are essential for successful marketing campaigns. During the episode, we highlighted how AI tools can use customer data from your CRM platform ‚Äî like call logs, support tickets, and emails ‚Äî to craft personalized video scripts. This enables marketing teams to deliver tailored content that feels uniquely targeted and relevant to each individual viewer. We also experimented with HeyGen‚Äôs groundbreaking Avatar in Motion, which creates customized avatars based on your own likeness. Move your hands, make gestures, or use unique tones of voice, and HeyGen will flawlessly track, translate, and lip-sync your video with any customizable input text. 4. Accelerated iteration is driving innovation. AI tools significantly speed up the iteration cycle for creative video content and limit lengthy and expensive production cycles. For example, during the episode, I showed Kieran how I designed and launched a video ad in less than 15 minutes. To stay ahead, marketers need to quickly and constantly innovate, as the ease of copying and templatizing creative work will lead to a rapid commoditization of content. Standard approaches to AI-powered video content may outperform current methods in the short term because they‚Äôre new and different. But effectiveness is likely to peak within the first six to twelve months. Then, it will taper off as audiences get used to it and become aware of its widespread use. \"Your best-performing content will now be ‚Äòbest-performing‚Äô for a much shorter period of time,\" says Kieran. In other words: your iteration of ‚Äòcreative‚Äô as a marketer will have to increase exponentially. Differentiation will rely heavily on the unique 10-20% of creative input, putting increased pressure on marketers to continually produce new and distinctive ideas. Three Tips for Integrating AI into Your Video Marketing Strategy Learn how to incorporate AI into your video workflow by downloading our AI Guide for Marketers and following the tips below. 1. Experiment. Experiment. Experiment. Test different AI video tools to understand their benefits and limitations, helping you find the best fit for your campaign needs and goals. This keeps your team ahead of the competition, identifying new opportunities to capture the attention of your customers. 2. Enhance the Tools You Already Use Not sure where to start? Try using AI video features that already exist in your current marketing tech stack. For example, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Mailchimp offer AI-powered capabilities that boost your marketing effectiveness by automating production processes and offering more detailed performance insights for iteration. 3. Monitor Legal and Ethical Considerations As AI video production becomes more prevalent, legal considerations around likeness licensing and content use will become increasingly important. Invest in the proper training and resources now to ensure you are using AI effectively and ethically in the future.

With this, you can give your video a voiceover without manually recording your own voice, and you can choose from a range of voice profiles and accents. I‚Äôve included Veed in this list of the best AI video software because I‚Äôve spent many a day transcribing videos manually, and know how frustrating it can be. What is an AI camera? 7. Synthesia Pros Easy way to make presentations Powerful, simple-to-use tool Impressive range of features Affordable AI video creation platform Cons Limited, specialized use case download Synthesia specializes in speech-to-video creation using artificial intelligence to create engaging videos. They give you a range of templates and amazingly lifelike avatars which you can make say anything you want ‚Äì ideal for creating YouTube videos you don‚Äôt want to appear in. Whatever you type, they can say in a range of accents, using diction and, in the most recent iteration, gestures. It‚Äôs spooky how realistic it all sounds ‚Äì even if you don‚Äôt have any staff or any desire to appear in YouTube videos yourself, Synthesia can help with your video creation. You can add a background behind your avatar, add a music track, and use a range of other tools to make the video your own. How can AI benefit photography? 8. InVideo Pros Easy to use and learn Simple but powerful Simple, two-tier pricing Article-to-text feature Cons Only the highest membership tiers have access to the best video and image libraries download This software shares a lot in look and feel with Veed.io. It has a super-simple, clean interface that is very easy to navigate. It also has a vast bank of templates for a range of needs from sports to marketing, to help you kick things off. One of its most impressive features is the AI-powered article-to-text tool. With this, you can copy and paste an article into the tool, and it will scrape the text to extract the main ideas, and then create concise content around these. It can create a unique video from an article too. Let‚Äôs say I wanted to make a video from this article ‚Äì I could just paste the URL into InVid, and the video would be created for me! This makes it the best AI video tool for batch creating multiple clips from a blog. Like Veed.io, InVideo also offers automated text-to-speech. No more need to record voiceovers, all thanks to the power of video artificial intelligence. What‚Äôs the best mobile video editing app for iPhone and Android? 9. Descript Pros Unique product Powerful editing tools Edit video with text Slick interface Cons It‚Äôs not for everyone, but that‚Äôs just me trying to find something to say download One for the podcasters. A powerful speech-to-text editor that will save you time by allowing you to edit automatically transcribed text and video voiceover at the same time. Simply put, you can record yourself, your voice and your face, and Descript uses AI to make a video and a written script from this. You can then edit that script, for example shortening long pauses in your speech, removing filler and thinking words, or removing whole phrases. Whatever you remove is also removed from the recorded footage, thereby seamlessly editing your video with AI. The software also allows you to sync your visuals with specific moments in the script, and there‚Äôs a toolbar to help you collaborate on a project with a team. Add to that powerful video editing features such as the ability to grade colours, remove backgrounds, and beef up sound quality, and you have yourself a winner. 10. FlexClip Pros Interface good for beginners Great template and stock library AI speech to text AI text to speech Cons Limited tools for pros Only exports to 1080p download This software is rich in templates and has an impressive amount of stock imagery and video you can use to inspire or pad out your videos. The interface is very simple ‚Äì it‚Äôs the best AI video editing software I tested for beginners, who will get the hang of it very easily. Once you have your footage uploaded, you have the standard range of editing tools to work with, to make your video look exactly as you want it to. You can adjust the brightness, and the speed, you can flip it around, trim it, or use FlexClip‚Äôs range of filters to automatically adjust the colours. In terms of AI video creation features, there‚Äôs speech-to-text, which can quickly generate subtitles, and text-to-speech, which can help you make natural-sounding voiceovers. 11. Rawshorts Pros Good library of resources Timesaver for small businesses Text to animation Automatic voice generator Cons Free version is quite limited download This powerful tool is specifically for people who want to make video animations. Write a script (or get ChatGPT to do that for you!) and paste it into the program. The software will then generate a voiceover, scrape your text for the main ideas, and then use those to make a coherent, animated storyboard. You‚Äôve probably seen these types of animations used on software product sales pages to explain how to use the software. This type of animation can cost thousands of dollars to produce (not to mention countless hours of drawing), but now thanks to AI, you can do it for a fraction of the time and cost. If you need to create videos for small businesses, you can imagine how much easier this clever AI video tool can make your work. 12. Lumen 5 Pros Quick and easy tool to use Text to video Good range of editing tools Cons Free version is very limited download This nifty AI video editing softwa re software helps you automatically transform blog posts, Zoom calls, or articles, into video. It‚Äôs super easy to do. For example, just paste your blog article URL into the program, and it will extract the key points to match them with relevant text and video. From there, you can tweak what you want, edit text, and swap out photos and videos from Lumen 5‚Äôs online library. You can also make talking head videos and enhance your videos with callouts and cutaways. My favourite feature is the ability to select words in the transcript (auto-generated by AI, of course!), then match the visuals directly to the timing of the audio. For video creation for social media, which often needs captions timed to voice over or talking heads, this AI video app is insanely useful. 13. SyntheSys Pros Professional-level software Text-to-video capabilities Easy-to-use dashboard Cons More expensive than other text-to-video competitors download Using SyntheSys, you can get a lifelike avatar to present a video for you, generated from text, or create a natural-sounding voiceover track. They have a library of male and female avatars, and their technology allows them to use gestures, and natural voice tones, and speak in 145 languages. It‚Äôs a great tool for businesses, or anyone wanting to quickly create human-looking and -sounding content for commercial purposes. Whether you want to remain anonymous in your video clips or simply prefer to use someone else, AI video generators like this can help speed up your video creation process. What Is the Best AI Tool to Create Videos? It really depends on what kind of video you want to create, as there is quite a diverse range of AI video generators out there for different use cases. A cinematographer or videographer is more likely to need a tool with the power and scope of Topaz Video AI or Filmora. These can really help you dive deep into your footage and create something extraordinary for professional videos. Veed.io and InVid are best for beginners or those who perhaps need video clips for personal use or smaller scale production edits. Then there are the tools that are better for small businesses, YouTubers, or for commercial use. Descript is a great tool for Youtubers and podcasters to clean up their script and video, whereas Rawshorts will help you create an animation from your script. Those looking for AI to make them a voiceover or a complete presentation with a video or even an avatar will need something different again. Lumen 5, for example, will help you create high quality videos like these, while Synthesia or SyntheSys will generate a presentation for you with a human-ish presenter. How Does an AI Video Generator Work? The computer science behind the nuts and bolts of AI video generation is beyond both my human intelligence and the scope of this article. But in simple terms, what I understand of it is that machine-learning, the machine who has learned ‚Äì which is a way of saying ‚Äòan extremely powerful computer‚Äô ‚Äì knowing language on some robotic, mathematical level, scrapes the text and converts it into computer language: numbers. As computers understand everything in these terms, the combinations of numbers it receives from the text will correspond to number patterns within videos that express the same ideas as the text. They will match. And thus, a video is born. AI Video Editing Software FAQ s What is the best AI tool to create videos? For creating videos and ease of use, I‚Äôd have to say Lumen 5 for enabling you to quickly make a coherent video from text, or SyntheSys for creating realistic avatar-led video presentations. For specific edits, Topaz Video AI can‚Äôt be beaten. Is there an AI that edits videos? Yes. For example, Topaz AI and Filmora both help you edit your videos. You can use image stabilization, change the frame rate to create natural-looking slow-motion effects, upscale your videos, and do many more things that only a year or so ago, weren‚Äôt possible. How do I know if a video was created by AI? With many ai video editing tools, you simply won‚Äôt know, and that‚Äôs increasingly the case. The AI tools in Topaz Video AI are so powerful there‚Äôs really no way of telling if that slow-motion video was originally filmed at 60 fps or 24 fps. Likewise, the human avatar you can use to give your video presentations can use natural gestures, voice tones and intonation, which can make it very difficult to know if they‚Äôre real or not. Take for example, the Deep Fake video below: It‚Äôs certainly very hard to spot if the video creation was by AI or if it was actual footage. What AI video app is everyone using? Everyone is using all of them! All of the video apps in this article are being used by someone, somewhere to save time, to be more efficient, and to create something more compelling for a variety of use cases. If I had to choose one, I‚Äôd say it was Topaz Video AI, just because that‚Äôs the world I come from, and I know that it‚Äôs a very popular resource. For another use case, I‚Äôd find it hard to believe that most podcasters weren‚Äôt using Descript, as it‚Äôs such a powerful and powerfully specialised tool. Is Synthesia Ai video free to use? No, it‚Äôs not. Synthesia is only offered on a subscription basis. AI Video Editing Tools: Final Words So there you go. Honestly, even though I wrote this article myself, my mind is a little blown. AI is so new, but it can already do so much. It‚Äôs hard to know where it‚Äôs going to lead, but although that‚Äôs a little terrifying, it‚Äôs also exciting. Especially if you‚Äôre working with video. The AI video generators and tools available to you are so powerful that they will change the way you film and the way you think about filming. Cinematographers can make 8K cinematic, slow-motion, fully stabilized footage from 1080p footage filmed on an old camera. YouTubers can make video content of themselves with all their thinking words removed. Businesses can make promo videos, voiceovers or video presentations without hiring voiceover artists. It‚Äôs head-spinning! Doesn‚Äôt it make you want to create AI generated videos just to see how incredible the technology has become? If you‚Äôre not already using AI video generators in some form, it definitelt feels like right now is the time to start.
