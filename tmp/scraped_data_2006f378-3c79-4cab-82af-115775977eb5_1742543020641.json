At the click of a button, they turn ideas into full-fledged videos with visuals, narration and even music. These generators are democratizing video production, making the creation of high-quality videos for marketing, social media or educational purposes accessible to everyone with a computer. At this stage, there are three types of AI tools to take note of. 1. Text-to-video AI generators Text-to-video AI generators are all the rage. These platforms use natural language processing (NLP) and AI algorithms to transform written descriptions into full video clips. You simply feed the AI tool a text prompt or video script outlining the desired content. Next, the AI engine analyzes the script, identifies key elements like scenes, characters and actions, and pairs it with video assets from its vast datasets. From here, the tool generates video using techniques like image generation or animation. These graphics can range from simple shapes to complex scenes with characters and objects. The tool can also generate a voiceover that narrates the story, add background music or sound effects, and even incorporate transitions between scenes. The end result? A video that closely resembles your initial vision. (Insider tip: Generative AI is one of the main types of AI we use at Superside.) 2. Video editors with AI capabilities Video editors with AI capabilities are the next generation of video editing. They leverage machine learning algorithms to automate repetitive tasks, enhance video quality and assist users in editing. These tools can analyze video footage and automatically identify elements like scene changes, cuts or objects to help organize and navigate footage more efficiently. AI can also analyze editing choices and offer suggestions for transitions, pacing or music selection based on the video type or content style. AI can automate repetitive tasks, such as color correction, noise reduction or basic stabilization, and even curate snippets for social media platforms or trailers. 3. Video productivity platforms with AI capabilities Video productivity platforms with AI capabilities are extremely powerful. They combine traditional video editing tools with cutting-edge AI features to supercharge the entire video production process. How AI Streamlines Video Production Workflows If you’re wondering about the return on investment of using AI video creators, take a look at the following factors. Quicker turnaround times AI is streamlining video production workflows and making processes more efficient. Its ability to create videos from text inputs slashes production time by reducing the need for traditional filming while automating repetitive tasks, like scene detection and color correction. Real-time feedback and suggestions from AI algorithms also empower video makers and creators to make immediate adjustments, accelerating the iteration cycle and ultimately delivering high-quality video at a faster rate. These are no idle claims. At Superside, we’ve experienced these AI-enhanced turnaround times firsthand, delivering high-quality design projects 30%-60% faster with the help of AI. Synthesia boasts even better results, saying they’ve reduced their average video production time by eight days (62%) with the use of modern AI tools. A Superside case study illustrating the efficiency of our video production is the personalized wrap-up videos we created for each of our 450+ customers in just one week (we didn’t use AI here). Cost-effectiveness Research shows companies that use AI tools instead of traditional methods to create videos experience a massive 80% reduction in time and budget. AI-powered video production tools make quality video content accessible to businesses without a dedicated video team, sidestepping the need for advanced filming and editing expertise. Not having to outsource video production leads to substantial cost savings. Here at Superside, we’ve also experienced the massive cost difference AI can make. Within three months of integrating AI into our design workflows, we achieved a remarkable $1M saving for customers from over 500 AI-enhanced projects, which underscores the significant impact AI can have on production budgets.

Creative video scalability Scaling video marketing is good for business. It’s the quickest way to connect emotionally with target customers bombarded with content and can amplify your brand messaging with motion. AI’s ability to speed up video production is a powerful tool that can truly set you apart from your competitors. Superside’s collaboration with Synthego on an animated video for World CRISPR Day exemplifies the power of AI-driven scalability. With a five-day deadline to create a visually engaging video with text and voiceover, Superside leveraged AI for rapid asset generation. While still adhering to traditional animation project stages, AI proved its worth by generating new assets and missing pieces in bulk—all within seconds. This led to the on-time delivery of a high-quality promotional video, with the AI-enhanced process saving a significant 39% in design hours and $5K for Synthego. This collaboration underscores AI’s true value proposition in creating videos: The technology doesn’t replace human creativity; rather, it empowers creators to achieve more in less time. By streamlining workflows, automating tasks and generating content, AI creates a dynamic environment where creative video production teams can scale to meet the growing demand for high-quality video content. Hands-On Tutorial: How to Create Videos With AI in 5 Steps Ready to experience the magic of AI-powered video firsthand? Let’s walk you through the steps of how to make videos using AI.

I've had multiple experiences with ElevenLabs, and it has served us well overall. Using it often involves a fair amount of trial and error to achieve the desired export quality. Despite this, I believe ElevenLabs is a valuable AI tool, albeit one that may require the expertise of a skilled engineer to fine-tune the final output.

Step 2: Create your video prompts Once you’ve selected the appropriate platform for your AI-generated video, the next step is to feed it a video prompt—the descriptive text you enter into the AI video generator that serves as a guideline of what you want. The better the prompt, the closer the video will be to what you envision. A few tips on how to prompt the AI video generator: The quality of videos generated with AI varies depending on the tool you use; newer engines often produce good videos regardless of prompt detail, but for more specific results, your prompt should include detailed guidelines. Step 3: Input your text into the AI tool Now, it’s time to feed your description into the AI video generator. Most platforms have a dedicated interface for entering prompts. Normally, this involves a text box labeled “Prompt,” “Script” or “Description.” Some platforms also allow you to upload a pre-written video script or integrate with third-party applications for content import. Once you’ve inserted your prompt or video script, you simply click “Generate Video” or “Create Video” to initiate the AI process. The tool will then analyze your prompt and generate a video based on your specifications. Step 4: Customize the video settings Most AI video tools offer customization options alongside the prompt section. These might be under separate tabs labeled “Settings,” “Customize” or “Video Options.” The available options can vary between tools, but here are some you can expect to find: Some platforms offer more advanced tools for more granular control. Some also provide video templates or presets for common video formats to streamline the customization process. Step 5: Review and iterate for perfection While AI is powerful, it’s far from perfect, and achieving your creative vision often requires an iterative process. Carefully review the generated video output to ensure it accurately reflects your text input and effectively communicates your message. At this stage at Superside, we have not yet used an AI video generator capable of crafting a complete story or creating an entire video independently. Human intervention has always been necessary to refine the output into a polished final product suitable for public sharing. Pay attention to details such as visual coherence, text readability, audio quality and overall pacing. Iterate on the video as needed, making adjustments and refinements to ensure high-quality AI-generated videos that accurately portray your vision. AI Video Technology: Looking Ahead What can you expect from AI video tech in the next few years? Let’s take a look. 1. Challenges of AI video production While offering exciting possibilities, AI video production faces numerous hurdles regarding technical limitations and ethical considerations. AI models require vast amounts of high-quality training data to function effectively. This “data hunger” can be challenging, as collecting and annotating large volumes of video data can be expensive and time-consuming. Processing data demands significant computational resources, making real-time AI video generation challenging for current systems. Generating a video is one thing; telling a well-crafted story is another. AI hasn't reached the point where it can do all of this based on a single prompt—we're still waiting to see that happen. Beyond the technical hurdles, ethical considerations loom large. AI video processing raises privacy concerns, especially if personal data is collected and manipulated during the creation process. Additionally, biases presented in the training data can be inadvertently perpetuated by the AI, potentially leading to discriminatory or unfair representations in the generated videos. The potential for misuse of AI video generation, such as creating deepfakes for malicious purposes, is another significant concern. 2. AI is making video more inclusive and far-reaching AI is starting to play a critical role in making videos more inclusive and accessible to wider audiences. According to Wistia’s 2024 State of Video Report, there’s been a significant surge in using AI for video accessibility, with a 59% increase in videos receiving higher accessibility scores compared to 2023. This leap is largely driven by AI’s ability to break down language barriers and personalize content for a global audience. AI automates caption and transcript generation, making videos accessible to viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing. The report highlights a 254% increase in businesses using closed captions, demonstrating the growing adoption of this technology. This technology benefits not only those with hearing impairments but also viewers who speak different languages or prefer to follow along with text. 3. Sora OpenAI, the innovative force behind ChatGPT and DALL-E 3, is introducing Sora—a groundbreaking AI video generator poised to revolutionize the text-to-video landscape. Anticipated for release in the second half of 2024, Sora promises to usher in a new era of AI video generation. While text-to-video generation is nothing new, Sora transcends current solutions by establishing a new benchmark for visual quality and complexity. It surpasses its predecessors through its ability to craft highly detailed, realistic scenes. Although you'll still need someone to craft and edit a narrative, the visuals Sora has produced in the demos we've seen are truly impressive and are essentially limited only by the user's imagination and creativity. Once Sora irons out the issues (such as the six-finger glitches), it has the potential to disrupt the stock-footage market significantly. Additionally, Sora executes intricate camera movements within generated videos, resulting in dynamic and captivating visuals that far surpass the basic panning or zooming offered by other tools. The platform’s capacity to generate videos featuring multiple characters with emotions suggests a sophisticated understanding of human interaction and expression, potentially exceeding the capabilities of existing AI video generators.

Creative activity is no exception. What are the main advantages of generating videos with artificial intelligence? More information is provided in the following article. Author Kamila Rollerová More Advantages of AI in Video Creation The presence of an expert artist is still irreplaceable, but it is already proven that artificial intelligence can create remarkably high-quality and content-rich videos. What are the main advantages of AI image generation? Speed and Efficiency AI systems can process a large amount of video material relatively quickly and efficiently. Machine learning-based algorithms perform automatic processing, saving substantial time for human colleagues. This naturally leads to increased productivity and acceleration of the entire video creation process. Enhanced Quality Thanks to advanced algorithms, AI systems can automatically improve the quality of individual videos. They can remove unwanted noise, stabilize shaky footage, adjust inappropriate lighting and contrast, or make other enhancements that improve the overall visual quality of videos. Task Automation Another advantage of using AI for video creation may be the automation of certain routine tasks, such as automatic recognition and labeling of objects or the creation of subtitles and captions. This capability also saves considerable time for human colleagues. Ability to Generate Content The last major advantage of inviting artificial intelligence to generate videos is the fact that it can generate new content based on existing videos. For example, it can create videos with various stylizations, add special effects to them, or create new scenes based on specific instructions. Disadvantages of AI in Video Creation Every coin has two sides. Similarly, video creation with artificial intelligence also has its drawbacks. The main ones include the following two. Lack of Creativity and Originality AI can generate videos that are too similar to existing content, AI has a limited range of ideas and inspiration, absence of human intuition and creative thinking. Danger of Spreading Disinformation the possibility of misuse of generated videos to manipulate information and subsequently spread false news, AI can be used to create realistic deepfake videos, which can seriously damage the reputation of specific individuals. Caution and Cleverness As the ancient King Solomon aptly said, \"The naive believe every word, but the wise consider their steps.\" When using artificial intelligence, caution and cleverness are always desirable.

The stage is set, the cameras are rolling and AI is stealing the show in the world of video production. From transforming communication to redefining entertainment, it's no secret that technology pushes the boundaries of creativity and efficiency across various industries. Video production is no exception. With features like automated editing processes and groundbreaking visual effects, AI is changing the game in creating high-quality video content. As we dive further into how to use AI in filmmaking, prepare to be dazzled by the possibilities and innovations reshaping the editing process. Viewing AI through a cinematic lens AI is every filmmaker’s new best friend in the editing room, revolutionizing the process of bringing creative visions to life. Forget the days of slogging through endless editing tasks; with AI by your side, you'll be producing cinematic masterpieces in no time. AI in video production marks the fusion of advanced algorithms with the artistry of filmmaking, where technology seamlessly complements human creativity. So, how does it all work, anyway? AI algorithms dive headfirst into your video footage, analyze every frame with lightning speed and make editing decisions based on predefined parameters. It's like having a film-savvy robot assistant by your side, ensuring your editing process is efficient and allowing you to focus on your artistic insight. Here are some features you can use to revamp your video production process: 1. Scene detection AI swiftly identifies transitions between scenes in video footage, using advanced algorithms to distinguish changes in location, lighting and subject. With the help of AI, we’ve moved past manually scrubbing through endless footage – now, you can sit back and watch as your footage is magically sorted into neat, organized segments, ready for editing with just a click of a button. 2. Automatic trimming and cutting Whether it's a moment of shaky camera work or an accidental pause in dialogue, AI can seek out our human imperfections and get rid of them. Well, not all of them. But at least the ones that hinder the flow of video content! Meticulously sifting through each frame, AI can find and eliminate awkward pauses and other distractions, leading to a more polished final product. 3. Color correction Thanks to AI, every hour can be golden hour as filmmakers can effortlessly enhance the visual quality and customize the mood of videos through color correction. Analyzing factors such as color balance, saturation and lighting conditions, AI identifies areas where colors may appear dull or unbalanced and applies adjustments to achieve vibrant, lifelike tones. 4. Audio Editing An expert in noise reduction and audio leveling, AI can remove unwanted background noise as well as balance sound levels across different clips to maintain a consistent and clear listening experience. By studying the mood and tone of a video, AI can suggest an appropriate soundtrack or even curate the perfect musical accompaniment. 5. Motion tracking AI brings a new level of precision to video editing through its excellent motion-tracking abilities. Acting as a virtual cameraperson, AI follows the movement of objects or individuals within the frame. This enables the automated placement of graphics or effects and ensures that these elements stay synchronized with the action. Tools and platforms powered by AI We’ve established the range of capabilities offered by current AI, but the burning question remains: Where can I access these handy features? Filmmakers have a variety of options to choose from when it comes to utilizing AI in video production. While beta software might not be ready for commercial use just yet, powerhouses like Adobe are leading the charge with AI-powered features that streamline numerous aspects of the editing and production process. We’ve gathered a list of tools and platforms where you can tap into the potential of AI to revolutionize your video productions: Adobe Premiere Pro: Adobe's Sensei AI technology offers features like Auto Reframe, which automatically adjusts aspect ratios for different platforms, and Scene Edit Detection, which identifies cuts in edited footage. Final Cut Pro: Apple's software incorporates machine learning algorithms for tasks like audio cleanup, color grading and creating Smart Collections—a tool for organizing media based on content. Blackbird: This cloud-based video editing platform employs AI for rapid editing, allowing for real-time collaboration and quick turnaround times. OpenAI’s Sora: Newer to the scene, Sora is a text-to-video model that can generate high-quality videos up to a minute long based on the user’s prompt. Benefits and remaining uncertainties It’s clear AI changes the game in terms of saving time. Automating tedious video editing tasks, AI makes the entire video editing process more efficient. It’s also accessible, meaning individuals with varying levels of editing experience can use AI to create professional-quality videos without the need for extensive technical expertise. Equipped to handle large volumes of video content efficiently, AI editing tools are suited for large projects. However, some uncertainties regarding the technology continue to linger. Copyrighting is one of the primary concerns about the use of AI. Just like the transition from film to digital photography sparked debates, the rise of AI in video production has raised questions about ownership and creative control. It’s also important to note that AI isn’t always consistent, and any work edited with AI should still be reviewed and fine-tuned by human editors to ensure quality and accuracy. Ultimately, navigating AI-assisted video editing requires a careful balancing act between innovation and regulation. So, what’s next? As AI technology continues to advance, it will undoubtedly play a central role in shaping the future of the video production industry, transforming the way content is created, consumed and distributed. In just the past year, the strides made in AI have been nothing short of astounding, altering everything from automating editing processes to pioneering text-to-video prompting technology. As our creative ally, AI is driving us into a new era of video production, and we’re thrilled to see where it goes! Learning to use new AI tools and work through their quirks can be challenging. If you’re looking for guidance and support as you incorporate AI into your video production, look no further. We’re excited to help make your editing process smoother and more efficient!

It's like telling a human video editor what to do, but it's even easier with a tool. Need to remove a scene, use different stock footage, or change the accent? Just give a prompt, and the AI will do the rest. This makes editing easier, even if you don't know much about editing. 3. AI-Powered Script Generation Invideo's AI script maker helps you make interesting, custom scripts for any video project, which saves you a lot of time in writing scripts. This tool is especially useful for platforms like YouTube, where your content needs to be intriguing enough to engage people & grow your channel. 4. Affordable Voiceover Alternatives The AI voiceover generator is a cheaper option than paying for professional voice actors. It makes a speech that sounds like a human in multiple accents, understanding the feeling, intent, and emotion behind each word. This function makes your videos feel alive, adding a professional look without costing too much. Pros It quickly changes your words into videos, making creating content more manageable. You can spend more time on your work and less on technical stuff. With more than 16 million stock media choices, you have access to a unique selection of pictures. This is perfect if you want to create top-notch quality videos without investing hours in creating them. AI-powered script generation can save you a lot of time in making regular, good-quality video content. It's especially helpful if you often face writer's block or have tight schedules. The AI voiceover generator tool can save money while still giving a good sound experience. This is really helpful if you own a small business or are an individual creator. Cons Initially, you might need some time to learn how to interact with the AI well to get the results you want. However, as you proceed, this eventually gets easier as the interface itself is pretty user-friendly. The free version includes watermarks. But, this is a small worry because the paid version starts at just $25/month and gives you a ton of premium features. Pricing Basic: Free Plus: $25/month Max: $60/month (The yearly plans start as low as $20/month) Sign up for invideo AI and start creating high-quality videos within minutes. Try online AI video maker Create high-quality videos for your business with AI video maker easily Get Started Now 2. Descript Do you need help with problems like evoking human facial expressions and emotional responses or the technical bottlenecks that make the video generation process time-consuming? If yes, Descript can help your creative workflow and enrich the quality of your output, making it more high-end and appealing. Moreover, it also realizes the significance of the human side of video production as it's not designed to replace human creativity but to make it better, to give you a vision, and to let the AI do the heavy lifting. Best For: As such, it's best suited to content creators, podcasters, and filmmakers who need to save time and get things done the right way. Because it is a text-based editing system, even the not-so-tech-savvy can use it. Top Features: 1. Automated Transcription Manually transcribing audio and video is time-consuming. To save time, Descript automatically transcribes all your recordings. Since the transcription is merely a text file, if you edit the transcription content, you can also edit the audio or video file itself. 2. Overdub Voice Cloning With Descript's Overdub function, you can type in the missing or correct text and then artificially generate the new audio in your voice or that of the guest. Creating a voice clone of this type involves using a voice sample to make the process convenient and smooth. 3. Studio Sound Editing Poor audio quality can negatively impact great content. Descript tackles this problem with its Studio Sound feature, which applies state-of-the-art AI to enhance the sound quality of audio files. It eliminates noise, hum, and distortion, giving a cleaner and more professional studio-type sound. 4. Video Green Screen and AI Eye Contact The green screen background editor lets you change the environment behind the video, just like a Zoom feature, so you can have more control over how you present your content. This facilitates the humanizing of the video and adds to its realism. Pros It offers a fantastic transcription tool that can automatically transcribe audio and video files into text in 23 languages. It's a handy platform that lets you cut, rearrange, or alter the contents and simplifies editing. It improves the recorded audio quality by making the spoken words much clearer. This makes your content sound super-smooth without you having to edit out one word at a time. Descript also integrates with other platforms such as Slack (a team communication tool), Podbean (podcast hosting platform), Restream (a LIVE streaming studio), and even Final Cut Pro (a professional video editing application), to name a few. You also get tutorials on using the platform to help you quickly master the features and make the most of it. Cons The learning curve for Descript isn't very gentle for someone used to text-based editing. At first, this may seem patchy, but it is difficult for users of conventional timeline-based editing tools to work. Descript boasts a full range of powerful tools but may not meet the requirements of professional-level video editing. It doesn’t even provide the convenient access to advanced effects and controls that a professional editing package would provide. Pricing is a per-person, per-month fee. This can be costly for teams or organizations with many people, primarily if more than one person uses the software. Pricing Free Tier Creator Tier: $15 per user per month Pro Tier: $30 per user per month Enterprise Tier: Custom 3.

As a user, you can enjoy the most advanced and revolutionary developments in this discipline. This means you are always testing the limits of possibility in generative A.I. Pros You can make your creative ideas into reality just by putting them in text. It provides unprecedented freedom of video creation, making it easy to think of and do any style or concept. The platform allows you to apply the style of any one image or prompt to every frame of your video. This is a very important feature in terms of maintaining your visual style consistency across all your video production. Based on mockups, Runway ML can turn out fully stylized and animated renders. This is especially helpful to designers and creators in creating a vibrant, engaging way to present their ideas. It’s easy to cut out subjects in your video and change them as you like with simple text commands. This lets you easily make specific modifications to individual elements in your video. By inputting an image or prompt, Runway ML can increase the realness of untextured renders. This is useful in creating realistic-looking images. Cons You might require a lot of computing resources and time. More complex tasks or high resolutions result in higher resource costs, and this may restrict its availability to users with less powerful hardware. At times, the input prompt is vague or contradictory, whereas Runway ML may produce artifacts or inconsistencies in the generated content. It may still need further smoothing out and cutting. Pricing Basic: Free Standard: $15 per user per month Pro: $35 per user per month Unlimited: $95 per user per month Enterprise: Custom 4. Fliki Fliki is another great free AI text-to-video generator that also has paid versions, letting you create videos as easily as sitting down and writing a few sentences.

These sounds are human-like, which gives a realistic touch to your videos and doesn’t make them sound mechanical. Pros The tool's interface is quite simple and easy. You won't be distracted by technical difficulties but can focus on your creativity. The audio quality of the voiceover is very natural and professional. This gives your videos a real feel to them, increasing the satisfaction of their viewers. It is also replete with a vast stock library for your creativity, which is one of the tool's real treasures. You'll find a diverse selection of images, video clips, and music alike. This library saves you from the trouble of searching for the right file everywhere by making it easier to track down materials from various places. Cost-wise, the tool is quite economical. You can even get better results with it than hiring professionals to do voice-over work. This reasonably priced special feature makes it ideal for any creators with limited amounts of money but ample amounts of content. Cons It does not offer great variety in pictorial variations. Though many options are there, these still might need to fit exactly your creative vision. You might experience glitches and bugs. These technical fumblings can be a bit of a roadblock to your work but are often just remediable with updates or support services. It provides a limited number of minutes per month at no charge. But that's a limit if you are doing really large projects or creating lots of output. Perhaps you would have to limit yourself and decide when to use it or spend extra for a paid plan. Convert text to video with AI Generate a video with just text Try Text to Video Pricing Free Plan Standard Plan: $21 per month for annual plan Premium Plan: $66 per month for annual plan 5. Visla Looking for the best AI video generator from text? Visla can be your right choice for a storytelling tool powered by AI that makes the entire process simpler. It has been fashioned as an easily accessible and powerful platform for a wide variety of users engaged in marketing, education, and other activities. Its most noteworthy feature is the ability to promote collaboration and improve workflow efficiency to quickly turn your ideas into videos. This lets you use storytelling and communication techniques with greater precision and effectiveness! Best For: Visla is the perfect option for developing and producing videos for marketing and sales, engineering, content creation, social media, team communications, customer service, and even personal branding. This is precisely what makes it so useful for professionals and teams to develop their own strategies for using storytelling to interact with audiences. Top Features: 1. Collaboration and Feedback Visla makes it simple to share your videos with your team or readers. In other words, you can use videos with other people, and you can receive others’ feedback. 2. Versatility for Various Industries Whether you work in marketing, sales, teaching, entertainment, or some other field, it's made to fit in wherever people work. 3. Diverse Use Cases Visla is just good for a variety of these video activities. You can create videos for social media, record personal messages to customers, recap meetings, convert old videos into new uses, or shoot videos for teaching and learning. It's like having one tool to deal with just about any job! 4. AI Summary Visla provides a feature that allows the main points of a text to be immediately grasped. Using AI, it discovers the key points, such as the keywords or main topics, or otherwise makes a long transcript short. 5. Teleprompter Mode Afraid you might have forgotten something or won't do a good job of expressing what is on your mind? This is where the teleprompter mode helps by letting you read from your marks instead of into the lens. This makes you look more confident and you don't lose your audience as you can make eye contact. 6. Community Hub Within the community hub, you can participate in discussions, seek advice, exchange experiences, and even receive ideas from other users. It's a place where you can get to know people using Visla too, help, and learn from one another. Pros Visla gives users the ability to create high-quality videos, working from the most minimal of ideas, perhaps even just a script. The platform can also be used to cover such tasks as writing scripts, narrating in its own voice, choosing the right pieces of video to show, and so on. Its AI-assisted editing functionality can even remove unwanted portions of video with an automatic effect. It has a comprehensible, easy interface, despite its many functions, which means that it can be used by people at every skill level. It allows a first-time user to become proficient with it only really requiring a timer, so that after only 2-3 minutes one can become accustomed. Visla's free subscription plan is particularly generous, as it allows publishers up to 50 minutes of video free of charge every month. This time is longer than most. Of course, there is also a great deal of access to the free version, which offers many of the platform’s main functions. It also comes with all the tools to aid in video production. With narration-assistance features powered by AI, screen recording functions for demonstration videos, text overlays for social media interviews, and so much more. Cons The inability to generate images is one major shortcoming of Visla compared to tools using coherent AI. To make up for this shortcoming, users who want to add this functionality have to feed suitable images to an external AI image generator before importing them into Visla. Exporting videos before downloading them can be very time-consuming. Likewise, the download speeds are quite slow. Even when Visla generates videos itself, it doesn't happen instantaneously, and it can still take a couple of minutes. The computer-generated script might contain mistakes that must be checked and corrected by a human. In addition, since the AI voiceover sometimes pronounces words incorrectly, this might affect the quality of the narrative. Pricing Basic: Free Plan Premium: $24 per month 6. Opus Clip Opus Clip converts full-length videos into short viral videos, and it shines through its comprehensive video content analysis capability. It also determines which parts are most effective and assembles them in easily digestible short clippings. It also employs cutting-edge artificial intelligence-enhanced functions such as AI Curation, AI Virality Score, and AI Emoji Generator to boost the attractiveness and virality of the content. All in all, it provides a great balance between accessibility and advanced, AI-assisted functionality, for newbies and experienced users too! Best For: Converting long-form video content into short clips that can go viral. It uses AI to help you create fun short videos with little effort. Top Features: 1. AI Curation This feature uses GPT-4 Turbo, the most advanced artificial intelligence, to take a long video and pick out the most intriguing segments. The selected parts are then crafted together into an attention-grabbing and compact short clip. Not only can it intelligently choose the segments, but it can also put this into a narrative framework, presenting the video in an organized, entertaining manner. 2. AI Virality Score Using AI and big data analysis of thousands of viral videos, Opus Clip attaches a score for its virality to each clip. With this score, you get a better idea of the potential impact of the cut, and you can use data to make decisions on the best way to maximize reach and engagement. 3. AI Co-Pilot With this feature, you have greater control over the video editing process. You can specify the time frames in your video to clip and make more focused and accurate content. 4. Active Speaker Detection Using predictive AI, Opus Clip analyzes and follows moving faces in the video. This enables you to keep your guests' (or, if you decide to take your own) face in the middle of the video frame. It makes your content more concentrated and professional-looking. 5. AI Keyword Highlighter With this tool, your video captions' important keywords are automatically selected and highlighted which can help to attain higher viewer engagement rates. 6. AI Emoji Generator The power of emojis is not lost on Opus Clip, which automatically adds suitable emojis to your video content. Pros It makes the video production process much faster. In other words, if a video project normally takes an hour, with Opus Clip it could be done in a few minutes. Part of the timesaving potential is especially useful for those who have to produce large amounts of video regularly. With the free trial, you can test the tool without risking any money. You can upload up to 120 minutes of video for free to test its features and determine whether or not it is right for you. This multi-language support makes the tool easier to use in different regions and audiences. This is particularly helpful for creators of content and content generators for whom English is their main language and they’re targeting an international audience or simply working in a multilingual environment. Its useful first paragraph-generating capabilities alone make it a game-changer when it comes to attracting viewers from the start. Cons Opus Clip may be a powerful software, but you would have to invest significant time and effort far beyond just learning how to use the product before you can master its full range of features. This learning curve could be an obstacle for those who need to quickly produce results without going into too much technical detail. Its effectiveness depends on the quality of the input video. If the original content was lousily shot or edited, it might not be able to finely tune it. While customization options are there, they may not meet all requirements or individual preferences of users. For some, this is a drawback, especially if highly personal or unique video styles are needed. The default caption may not be to everyone's tastes and could undermine creative expression. Pricing Free plan Starter Plan: $9 per month Pro: $ 19 per month 7. Colossyan Looking for the best AI music video generator? Colossyan can be just the right choice! It is an AI-assisted video creation tool for streamlining the video-creating process.

The platform allows for smooth scene transitions, and the high-resolution output helps to raise the quality and professional image of videos. With a range of pricing plans available to suit various needs and budgets, Colossyan provides an economical solution for many users. Cons The actors are advanced AI-generated avatars, looking and sounding highly lifelike, but the platform is limited to these digital actors. This limitation does not allow users to directly incorporate live human actors or their own recordings into the platform. As comfortable and convenient as Colossyan is, the more sophisticated its customization capabilities are as they need a learning curve. Pricing Starter Plan: $35 per month Pro Plan: $120 per month Enterprise Plan: Customizable Generate AI videos quickly Generate Al videos like magic Get Started Now 8.

One special feature of the platform is the presence of a face swap function which allows you to easily merge your own face with the AI avatars.

There are a range of flexible pricing plans, suited to your particular needs and budget. Whether you're a person or a business, you can benefit from the platform's features without the rigidity of a set pricing structure. Cons It has no integration with other software or platforms. This limitation might be inconvenient if you need integration with other tools or services for an enhanced video production environment. If you are on a team or need to collaborate with others on video projects, you might feel frustrated because there is no such mechanism in the platform. Pricing Starter Plan: $30 per month Pro Plan: $225 per month Enterprise Plan: Customizable 9.

In this way, with very little input, you can have a completed video that demonstrates what the AI can do. You're likely to find the platform convenient and fast. If you don't like to learn too much or spend too much time waiting for your videos to process, this might be just the ticket. You can spice up your performance with the built-in voice modulations. This lets you experiment with different voices depending on what you're shooting. Cons If you choose the personal plan, the maximum video quality is limited to 720p. This may be a drawback if you are after a high-definition video. The platform's content moderation system is probably not 100% foolproof, so there is a possibility of inappropriate content slipping through the net. On Windows and Android, you may encounter problems when it comes to feature recognition. If you're using these platforms and want complete compatibility, then this could be a potential drawback. Pricing Basic Plan: Free Lite: $30 per month Business: $112 per month Enterprise: Custom 10.
