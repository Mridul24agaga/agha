Updated: 03/12/25 Published: 08/15/24 I've been editing videos for almost a decade, both professionally and for my passion projects. So, believe me when I say I know how tedious editing even the shortest videos can be. Fortunately, many AI video editing tools can help speed up the process of editing, whether you're a beginner or an expert videographer. Here are 11 of the best AI video editing tools I've found and what I like most about them. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Best AI Video Editing Tools 1. Adobe Premiere Pro I've been using Adobe Premiere Pro for work and for my own passion projects for 10 years, so I was intrigued when the video editing software announced that new AI tools are available on its platform and that more are on the way. These are a few of my favorite AI tools within Adobe Premiere Pro: This feature allows users to auto-generate their transcripts, highlight text to add clips to their timeline, edit, reorder, and refine their clips like they would a text document. I love this feature because it makes audio editing a breeze by recognizing if a clip is music, sound effects, dialogue, or ambient sound and providing access to relevant tools for editing based on the sound type. To make your videos more accessible, Adobe Premiere Pro‘s speech-to-text feature automatically generates transcripts in up to 18 languages. It can also distinguish between speakers and create captions that match the video’s cadence and speech pattern. Price: Plans start at $22.99 per month. Best For: Intermediate to professional video editors. Though beginners can use Adobe Premiere, it does have a bit of a learning curve. 2. DaVinci Resolve DaVinci Resolve has many AI tools and has incorporated AI into its platform for years. The one I find the most interesting is its facial recognition. Now, bear in mind I have very minimal experience with DaVinci Resolve, so I don't have much experience with this feature. That said, its facial recognition allows users to group clips based on the people who appear in them. All I'd have to do is select a group of clips and right-click to select “Analyze Clips for People.” From there, DaVinci Resolve will scan the clips, assess the faces that appear, and group clips with the same faces together. If you're editing video of an event with a lot of people and you want to narrow down your clips to include a specific group, this feature will save time and effort. Price: Users can download DaVinci Resolve for free, or buy the studio version for $295. Best for: Beginner to expert video editors. 3. CapCut I can‘t scroll through TikTok for over a minute without seeing a video edited with CapCut. I’ve never used CapCut, but I'm truly amazed by the quality of the videos people churn out using the app. CapCut is known for being a user-friendly video editing app that is suitable for anyone, regardless of their level of editing experience. Part of what makes CapCut so easy to use is its AI tools, which can do most of the work for you. For example, let's say I have a long-form video I want to shorten so I can upload it to a short-form video platform like Instagram Reels or YouTube Shorts. I can take that long-form video, upload it to CapCut, and identify standout moments, and the app will generate a shorter version of the video. Price: CapCut is free to use but paid options start at $20.84 per month. Best for: Short-form video editing for platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts. 4. Runway Runway is a platform specializing in creating AI tools for video editing and other aspects of visual art. To be honest, I wouldn't recommend Runway for beginner video editors or those with no experience at all. The platform can do a lot, but its plethora of tools and their uses can be overwhelming. Even I, an experienced video editor, was only able to assess the tip of the iceberg of what Runway can do. That said, its AI video generator is simple to use. To test it out, I entered a prompt asking for a video of a cat frolicking in a forest and chasing after a butterfly. The images weren't perfect, but I can see them being used to figure out concepts or inspiration for shots or art. Price: Runway is free with limited features, and paid plans start at $12 per user per month. Best for: Expert video editors. 5. Recast Studio Recast Studio is an AI-powered video editor specifically designed for marketing teams, particularly those who work with podcast content. It focuses on making it easy to repurpose and edit video and audio content, even without prior video editing skills. I am particularly interested in its ability to create multiple pieces of content from one single video or audio file, which can be a big time saver for marketing teams. Here are a few key features that stand out: Price: Recast Studio offers a free plan with limited features. Paid plans start at $17 per month. Best for: Marketing teams and podcasters who want an easy way to repurpose long-form audio and video content into social media-ready short clips, blog posts, and other marketing assets. 6. Goldcast's Content Lab If you’re sitting on a lot of video content, then Goldcast’s Content Lab is the AI video editing tool you should consider looking into. It’s a great tool to use if you have a lot of longer-form videos—think webinars and podcasts—that you want to repurpose into short videos and text-based content. What I like best is you can make video edits from the transcript, making it a super easy tool to get up and running with. Content Lab also has a Brand Voice tool that trains the AI on your brand voice, ensuring any copy it creates from your videos aligns with your brand voice, tone, and style. For those who have lots of video content, the AI Search function is also incredibly helpful when creating content from your video library. It allows you to search across your videos for the best clips and moments relating to a particular keyword or search query. Price: Free accounts offer one hour of video uploads per month with unlimited video clipping and copy generation. Best for: Beginners who want to repurpose long-form videos into short clips, blog posts, and social posts. Image Source 7. InVideo I'm pretty familiar with InVideo after using it to create a TikTok video a while back. You can read all about it here if you want to know my experience with InVideo. In short, I enjoy InVideo because it's very simple to use. Unlike Runway, I definitely recommend it for marketers and creators who want to churn out simple short-form videos with little to no video editing experience. My favorite feature of InVideo is its AI text-to-video tool. When I used InVideo to create a TikTok, I entered a script into the text box, selected a few images, and the platform generated a video based on the script in just a minute. Price: InVideo is Free, and price plans start at $15 per month. Best for: Editing and generating short-form videos on a tight schedule with little to no experience. 8. FlexClip When I first tried FlexClip AI Video Editor, I was amazed at how effortless video creation could be. The platform blends simplicity with powerful AI features, making it a dream tool for both beginners and professionals. With its AI-driven tools, you can generate text-to-video content in just minutes. Simply input your text, and FlexClip transforms it into a polished video with dynamic visuals and perfectly synced background music. What stood out to me were the AI features for editing, like automatic subtitles, text-to-speech, video translator, and image generator. These tools saved me hours of tedious work and let me focus on the creative aspects of my project. Plus, their templates are flexible, modern, and easy to customize. Price: Free for beginners, and prices start at $9.99 per month. Best for: Quick video creation, marketing and social media content, AI-powered video editing, personal projects, educational and training materials. 9. ClipChamp Clipchamp is a video editing app by Microsoft that allows users to easily make videos even if they have no video-editing experience. A standout AI tool is its AI text-to-speech, which boasts over 400 voice styles in 170 languages. Users can choose a mood, pitch, accent, and gender for the voice. Price: Free for beginners, and prices start at $11.99 for everyday editors. Best for: Beginners looking to make short-form videos. Image Source 10. Descript I found Descript to be pretty easy to use. It‘s a platform boasting a variety of AI tools, and one I find the most convenient is its AI transcript generator. Uploaded a video of myself talking to my cat (don’t judge me), and the AI transcribed it perfectly. I then uploaded a clip from a concert I went to where the singer shouted the name of the next song over a crowd of screaming fans. The AI misheard the singer, so the transcription was incorrect (the song's name is actually “Space Ghost Coast to Coast”). However, Descript allows me to edit the transcription so it's correct. Price: Limited features available for free and pricing starts at $12 per person per month. Best for: Beginners editing quick-hit videos. 11. Wondershare Filmora Wondershare Filmora is a cross-platform video-editing software that is known to be ideal for beginner and intermediate video editors and creators. I was impressed by the number of versatile AI tools available I found while browsing its site. One tool that sticks out to me is the AI Frame Interpolation. This feature enhances video visuals without losing quality, increases low frame rate automatically, and supports a variety of video formats including GIFs. If I want to slow down a video without deteriorating its appearance, the AI Frame Interpolation would be most useful. Wondershare Filmora's AI Vocal Remover is also interesting. User can separate vocal and music from a song and keep high quality audio while removing vocals. Price: There is free version with limited features, and pricing starts at $49.99 per year. Best for: Beginners and intermediate editors looking to create long or short-form videos. Video editing can take anywhere from from several minutes to a few hours, depending on the project. If you're curious about how AI can streamline the process for you and give some of your time back, you now have new tools you can test out for yourself.

Vidyo.ai 10 tips for maximizing efficiency with AI video toolsCreate impactful videos effortlessly with the right AI tools Share this article: Humans have always been visual creatures. From cave paintings to the latest viral TikTok trend, visuals have been our go-to mode of communication. Creating engaging videos can still seem daunting with the hours required for scripting, filming, and editing. Luckily, AI is here to change that. Imagine entering a text-based script, and moments later, a professional-looking video appears, complete with voiceovers, background music, and engaging visuals. Or picture yourself removing awkward pauses from a video clip with just a click of a button. These are not futuristic concepts—they’re the capabilities many AI-powered video tools like Loom’s screen recorder and Synthesia’s text-to-speech tools offer today. Explore the best AI video tools for content creation and discover what features to consider when selecting one. What to look for in an AI video tool When choosing an AI (artificial intelligence) video tool, consider factors like ease of use, AI-powered video editing, and automatic caption and transcription generation. All these elements help you create high-quality video content, including explainer videos, social media posts, and tutorials, without extensive editing or technical expertise. Here’s a closer look at the features to look for in an AI video creation tool: User-friendly interface In a world where time is money, AI video tools automate editing and make the video creation process seamless and quick. They allow you to focus on the creative side of production rather than worrying about complex tasks or software features. Look for a platform that offers a clean, intuitive interface, including a simple layout with easy-to-navigate menus and clear instructions, allowing even beginners with minimal technical skills to create professional videos. AI-powered video editing features You just finished recording a video presentation for your team. As you’re watching it, you notice a few awkward pauses, some “ums” and “ahs,” and a couple of lengthy segments that could be trimmed. In the past, this meant spending hours sifting through footage to make those edits. Today, AI video tools like Loom have AI-powered video editing features that automatically detect and remove awkward pauses, improve audio quality, and trim unnecessary sections, reducing considerable editing time. Loom’s AI video tools automatically remove filler words from your video It’s equally important to look for features like automatic transcription and caption generation to make your videos more engaging and accessible. Customization options While AI tools automate editing, look for ample customization options to tweak elements like text, colors, and transitions to maintain creative control, including your branding and style. AI tools like Pictory and Descript even offer editable templates to accelerate the content creation process while still giving you control over your content and branding. Collaboration features Collaboration features are essential when working with a team to streamline communication and feedback. Consider tools that allow multiple users to edit videos in real time, provide feedback directly on specific moments, and offer cloud-based storage for easy access and sharing, especially in remote or hybrid work workspaces. With Loom, teams can react to videos with emojis, add time-stamped comments, and share video content with a single click across platforms like Slack, Gmail, and more. 1.

Understanding what role videos play in your business is key to choosing the right AI video maker for the job. If you’re focused on internal communications and personalized outreach, a tool like Loom is best. But if your goal is to create quick clips for social media, you might prefer Opus Clip. Brainstorm scripts. Even if you’re using an AI-generated video script, customization is essential for keeping your videos focused and cohesive. Keep it concise. The Sprout Social Index Report found that two-thirds of consumers find short-form videos to be the most engaging form of content on social media. Keep your content short and sweet to maintain attention. Use high-quality visuals. Look for video creation tools that record in at least high definition (HD). For example, the Loom free plan records in HD, while paid plans record in up to 4K resolution. If you use AI video generators, look for libraries of professional-level stock footage or high-quality, AI-generated videos that look realistic. Add a CTA. Make it clear what you want your viewers to do after they watch your video by adding a CTA. Some AI video editors, like Loom, allow you to embed auto-CTA links directly into your videos to make it even easier for viewers to take the next step. Track your results. Keep an eye on how your videos perform and adjust as necessary. Measuring video engagement is also important for training videos and team updates. Tools like Loom allow you to see who hasn’t watched your video yet, giving you a chance to follow up. Start small. You don’t need to overhaul your entire video strategy or team collaboration workflow overnight. Start with small steps to gradually integrate AI tools into your process, gain confidence, and experiment with different ways to use AI to your advantage. Create impactful videos effortlessly with the right AI tools You post an engaging video on your social media channels. The next thing you know, everyone’s sharing, commenting, and creating their own interpretations. This is the kind of buzz that great video content generates—captivating, memorable, and, most importantly, shareable. With AI video tools in your tool kit, your video marketing strategy can produce that level of excitement effortlessly, and within a few minutes. You can streamline your video creation process and turn recording and editing into a seamless, one-click task. To create high-quality videos with realistic AI avatars and voiceovers, Synthesia is a suitable option. Pictory and Lumen5 are solid text-to-video AI video makers. For those seeking a tool that lets you add a personal touch to your content, Loom stands out from the rest. The AI screen recorder captures your webcam, your screen, or both simultaneously, making it perfect for adding cues, gestures, and a level of engagement that feels personalized and authentic. When you’re finished recording, Loom’s AI-powered features handle the editing, adding speech-to-text captions and transcriptions, removing filler words and pauses, and adding other enhancements to make your video polished and ready to share. Forget long-winded meetings or static presentations—unleash the power of AI in your video production with Loom.

But what if there was a tool that could automate repetitive tasks, free up your editors for their creative work, and even help you pump out quality videos more quickly? Enter the age of the AI video editor. AI-powered tools are revolutionizing how content is created. At Big Sea, we’ve been diving deep into the world of AI video editors, and we’re excited to share some of our favorites that can help you take your video marketing to the next level. So, without further ado, here are 6 AI video editors that we love at Big Sea. 1. Runway ML Cost: The standard plan is $12 a month for 625 credits. Plans range from free to $76 a month for unlimited and enterprise offerings. The free plan includes 125 credits. Great feature: Training for custom AI generators Runway ML stands out as a video editor because It offers over 30 AI-powered creative tools for manipulating content, generating new scenes, and adding special effects that can be applied to both photos and videos. From style transfers to motion tracking, Runway ML empowers content creators to infuse their videos with AI-driven enhancements. Designed to be accessible, even for those with little editing experience, Runway ML’s tools are great for exploring creative possibilities and generating unique content. Runway ML is a compelling option for creators and marketers who want to explore the potential of AI in their video content. But because its focus is on experimentation, it isn’t always the best option for those looking for a professional-grade video editor. However, If you’re looking for a user-friendly platform to experiment with creative video editing and infuse your content with special effects, Runway ML is definitely worth checking out. To show how easy it is to use (and that you really can create video with their “free” version), we took an extremely simple prompt and produced this cool 4 second clip, which you can view on RunwayML’s platform. Our prompt was simply “Please prepare four seconds of an introduction to an advertisement for the rainforest.” 2. Descript Cost: Plans range from free to $24 a month for pro and enterprise offerings. The free plan comes with 1 hour of transcription & 1 hour of recording. The creator plan is $12 a month for 10 hours. Great feature: Powerful text-based video editing and podcasting Descript is an AI-powered platform that really shines when it comes to text-based editing. Editing a video with Descript is like editing a document. You can see the words spoken in your video and change them directly. This is different from most video editors where you have to move clips of video around on a timeline. It’s a faster and more intuitive way to make cuts, rearrange sections, and fix mistakes. Descript also utilizes AI to streamline audio editing tasks like removing silences or background noise reduction. As a bonus, editors using Descript can record themselves or their screens directly within the program, collaborate easily with team members, and publish and integrate video within existing platforms or marketing tools. There is a bit of a learning curve to mastering all of Descript’s features, however. If you’re looking for a streamlined workflow, powerful audio editing tools, and easy collaboration features, Descript could be the ideal AI editor for you. 3. Synthesia Cost: Plans range from $22 a month to enterprise offerings. The starter plan comes with 1 editor, 3 guests, and 120 hours of editing per year. Great feature: Custom AI avatars Synthesia is a game-changer in the AI video editing sphere, particularly for its ability to create over 160 AI-powered avatars. With its user-friendly interface and dynamic features, Synthesia empowers creators to produce stunning videos effortlessly. In addition to its digital avatars, Synthesia excels at text-to-speech generation, allowing you to deliver your message in your preferred language, accent, and tone of voice. Starting Synthesia is as easy as typing your text script. While integrating Synthesia with your existing marketing tools is no problem, it’s important to remember that the best use of this tool is in generating script-based videos. You can incorporate your own footage, but that’s not what Synthesia excels at. If your marketing strategy involves creating script-driven videos or leveraging the power of avatars, then Synthesia could be a great fit for your needs. 4. InVideo AI Cost: Plans range from free to $48 a month. The free plan comes with 10 minutes a week of AI generation. Great feature: YouTube optimized videos InVideo AI is a dynamic AI video editor that offers an array of templates and intuitive controls to help content creators craft professional videos effortlessly. One of the core features of InVideo AI is its prompt-to-video creation. Simply provide a text prompt describing your video concept, and InVideo AI will generate a script, create video scenes with relevant media, add a voiceover, and even incorporate text overlays. Invideo’s AI gets you started with your video creation, but your editing options are endless. You can customize your script, include your own images or footage, change the voiceover narration, and fine-tune other details of your video. You can even collaborate on editing directly in InVideo with your teammates. Whether you’re a seasoned video editor or a beginner, InVideo AI will help you create videos that not only look professional but also resonate with your target audience. 5. Pictory Cost: Plans range from $19 to $99 per month. The starter plan comes with 30 videos per month and 600 minutes of transcription. Great feature: Video makers specifically for social media (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn) Pictory is an AI video editor that caters specifically to content marketers, making it easy for you to transform your content into shareable and engaging videos. Pictory is especially great for turning existing content like blog posts, articles, or even podcasts into video format. You can paste text, upload a video file, or provide a link to online content, and Pictory will automatically generate a video storyboard with relevant visuals and music. Pictory also makes it easy to customize or edit your videos and even optimize them for social media by offering various aspect ratio options and pre-designed templates. One big benefit for content marketers is that some Pictory plans offer integration with analytics tools, allowing you to track your video performance and gain insights into audience engagement. Overall, Pictory is a solid choice for content marketers looking to streamline video creation and leverage existing content to create fresh video assets. 6. Sora (OpenAI) Cost: Currently limited access Great feature: Powered by one of the most advanced LLMs available today Sora, the latest project from the creators of ChatGPT, turns imagination into striking videos with groundbreaking AI technology. This innovative platform lets you describe the scene you have in mind, and Sora generates polished videos to match. While it’s still in limited access, we wanted to mention it because It’s powered by one of the most groundbreaking AI engines out there. Sora’s flexibility is a key benefit. Enter a few descriptive words or detailed paragraphs, and it will work its magic. Experiment with different art styles, moods, and visual effects to find exactly what sparks your inspiration. While it’s still in development, Sora’s potential is huge – it represents a new frontier in creative expression through artificial intelligence. Guide to AI Video Editors Navigating the vast landscape of AI video editors can be overwhelming. To simplify your journey, we’ve put together a comprehensive guide to explore the pros and cons of AI video editors and answer other pertinent questions you might have about them. Hopefully, we’ll be able to help you discover the perfect AI companion for your content creation and video editing needs. Is AI video editing the same thing as text-to-video? While AI video editing encompasses a broad spectrum of tools, text-to-video is a specific aspect within this domain. Text-to-video utilizes AI algorithms to convert written content into visual sequences. AI video editing, on the other hand, includes a wider array of features, incorporating various technologies to enhance and streamline the video production process. Do AI video editors cost money? Yes, most AI video editors come with a cost. While some offer free versions with limited features, premium plans unlock the full potential of these tools. Investing in a paid subscription often grants access to advanced features, increased processing power, and built-in support or resources for a more well-rounded and satisfying editing experience. What are the benefits of using AI video editors? AI video editors offer a variety of benefits that can streamline workflows, boost content creation, and potentially improve the quality of your videos. Here’s a list of some of the key advantages to using an AI video editor: Increased Efficiency: AI automates repetitive tasks like scene identification, transcription, and highlight creation. This frees up editors to focus on the creative aspects of video editing and storytelling. Faster Content Creation: By automating tasks and offering pre-made templates, AI editors can significantly speed up the video creation process, so you can produce more content in less time. Improved Quality: AI can assist with functions like color correction, noise reduction, and even adding subtitles, leading to a more polished and consistent look across your videos. Greater Accessibility: AI editors are often designed with user-friendly interfaces, which makes video creation more accessible to those with less editing experience. Data-Driven Insights: Some AI editors offer features that analyze video performance, helping you understand what resonates with viewers and optimize future content for better engagement. It’s important to remember that AI video editing is still a developing field, and while these tools are powerful, they likely won’t replace the need for human editors entirely. Creativity, editorial judgment, and a strategic approach are still invaluable when crafting truly compelling video content. Do you need editing experience to use an AI video editor? No, AI video editors are designed for user-friendly experiences, so even beginners can produce high-quality content. The intuitive interfaces and automated features of AI-editing tools eliminate complex technicalities, allowing users to try their hand at video editing without a steep learning curve. It is important to note, however, that some AI video editors may require you to spend more time figuring out their more complex editing features. Are there limitations to AI video editors? AI video editors are great for many things, but they’re not perfect for every project. If your video involves a lot of creative choices and really detailed editing, a more traditional video editing program might be a better fit. Also, some complex tasks can take a long time for AI editors to process. Knowing these limitations will help you use AI tools smartly, letting them handle the easy stuff while you focus on the trickier parts of the editing process.
