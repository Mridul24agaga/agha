Load More Results Home Marketing Disruptive AI Video Trends that are Transforming Marketing in 2024 Disruptive AI Video Trends that are Transforming Marketing in 2024 Written by: Kipp Bodnar and Kieran Flanagan THE STATE OF AI IN 2024 New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing with AI. Download the Free Report Updated: 08/01/24 Published: 07/23/24 AI-generated video content is turning the marketing world on its head. But what trends should marketers be focusing on to stay ahead of the competition? If you've been following the latest buzz in AI marketing trends — and you should be — you know that AI video tools are at the forefront of this change. Whether it’s trained ad avatars or hyper-personalized video scripts, these technologies are irreversibly changing how we create content and engage with our audiences. But with such rapid innovation, what’s actually worth the hype? Kieran and I experimented with some of these new developments in a recent episode of Marketing Against the Grain, including a viral AI video on Twitter and an AI-generated ad created in less than 15 minutes. Among the many AI video options available, these four trends have been particularly notable — and are worth paying close attention to. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video 1. Avatar actors and likeness licensing are the new norm. Instead of hiring an actor to read a script or act in an ad, businesses can now license an actor’s likeness, use it to train an AI model, and then use that model to create ads and avatars. This enables marketers to quickly generate a variety of content, testing, and refining different approaches and messages without the logistical constraints of traditional video shoots. For example, this viral video ad features a woman casually talking about a product while seated inside her car. What’s so significant about it, however, is that while she’s a real actress hired off of Fiverr, the video itself is generated by AI video, using tools like Arcads. \"This produces video content that is human-trained but AI-agent delivered,\" Kieran explains. \"That’s quite an unbelievable concept to think through.\" 2. Low-quality but authentic content is driving engagement. Polished, high-budget video ads are quickly becoming a thing of the past — or at least, less favored by audiences. Instead, low-production, personable videos are taking the lead, outperforming traditional ads on platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels. Take, for example, the viral video I mentioned above: it’s not polished or high-budget. Instead, it’s set in a poorly-lit car, with an unflattering angle. Yet people are more likely to engage with it. Why? \"Because it feels authentic, relatable, and personable,\" Kieran explains. \"It’s how a real person would talk about a product.\" For marketers, this shift means experimenting with AI tools like HeyGen and InfinityAI, which quickly create videos that drive engagement, despite — or even because of — their imperfections. 3. Video personalization and customization are must-haves. Hyper-personalized videos that cater to customers’ accessibility needs, languages, and preferences are essential for successful marketing campaigns. During the episode, we highlighted how AI tools can use customer data from your CRM platform — like call logs, support tickets, and emails — to craft personalized video scripts. This enables marketing teams to deliver tailored content that feels uniquely targeted and relevant to each individual viewer. We also experimented with HeyGen’s groundbreaking Avatar in Motion, which creates customized avatars based on your own likeness. Move your hands, make gestures, or use unique tones of voice, and HeyGen will flawlessly track, translate, and lip-sync your video with any customizable input text. 4. Accelerated iteration is driving innovation. AI tools significantly speed up the iteration cycle for creative video content and limit lengthy and expensive production cycles. For example, during the episode, I showed Kieran how I designed and launched a video ad in less than 15 minutes. To stay ahead, marketers need to quickly and constantly innovate, as the ease of copying and templatizing creative work will lead to a rapid commoditization of content. Standard approaches to AI-powered video content may outperform current methods in the short term because they’re new and different. But effectiveness is likely to peak within the first six to twelve months. Then, it will taper off as audiences get used to it and become aware of its widespread use. \"Your best-performing content will now be ‘best-performing’ for a much shorter period of time,\" says Kieran. In other words: your iteration of ‘creative’ as a marketer will have to increase exponentially. Differentiation will rely heavily on the unique 10-20% of creative input, putting increased pressure on marketers to continually produce new and distinctive ideas. Three Tips for Integrating AI into Your Video Marketing Strategy Learn how to incorporate AI into your video workflow by downloading our AI Guide for Marketers and following the tips below. 1. Experiment. Experiment. Experiment. Test different AI video tools to understand their benefits and limitations, helping you find the best fit for your campaign needs and goals. This keeps your team ahead of the competition, identifying new opportunities to capture the attention of your customers. 2. Enhance the Tools You Already Use Not sure where to start? Try using AI video features that already exist in your current marketing tech stack. For example, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Mailchimp offer AI-powered capabilities that boost your marketing effectiveness by automating production processes and offering more detailed performance insights for iteration. 3. Monitor Legal and Ethical Considerations As AI video production becomes more prevalent, legal considerations around likeness licensing and content use will become increasingly important. Invest in the proper training and resources now to ensure you are using AI effectively and ethically in the future.

These generators use sophisticated algorithms to convert written text into dynamic video sequences, effectively automating the video production process. This innovation significantly reduces the time and resources required for video creation, making high-quality video content more accessible to a broader audience. Moreover, the ability to quickly produce videos from text enables rapid iteration and customization, catering to the evolving needs of digital marketing, education, and entertainment industries. One of the latest advancements in this field is Sora, an AI-powered text-to-video generator that exemplifies the potential of this technology. Sora leverages deep learning models to understand and interpret complex narratives, translating them into engaging video content with remarkable accuracy. It can generate videos that align closely with the input text’s tone, style, and context, offering a seamless and efficient solution for content creators. Additionally, Sora’s ability to integrate various multimedia elements, such as images, sound effects, and interactive components, enhances the overall viewer experience. As AI continues to evolve, tools like Sora are set to revolutionize the video production landscape, offering unprecedented creative possibilities and efficiency. The tool is currently not yet available to the general public as developers work through some of the potential risks given it’s high capabilities. Scriptwriting One of the most prominent use cases for AI in production is scriptwriting. It can be difficult to understand how to pack all the relevant information into a short video script, and AI tools can help craft the right narrative. Just make sure to have a human copywriter review the AI-driven script to clean up any “robot speak” and add personality as needed. Skilled copywriters bring a unique set of capabilities to the table, including a deep understanding of language nuances, the ability to decipher creative decisions, contextual adaptation, and a collaborative mindset. Their expertise enhances the effectiveness and emotional resonance of video content, ultimately connecting with viewers on a profound level that AI alone cannot achieve. Voice-over Many videos involve voice-over, and AI has made it possible to get instant voice-over audio based on provided text. While you may experience some pronunciation hiccups with words that aren’t found in the dictionary, it’s one of the most popular uses of AI in today’s production space. How does it work, you ask? With AI, speech synthesis models can generate high-quality, natural-sounding voice-overs in a fraction of the time it would take for human voice actors. This expedites the production timeline and enables rapid iteration and experimentation. AI algorithms can be trained on vast amounts of data, allowing them to mimic various accents, tones, and styles, providing video producers with a wide range of options to choose from. Additionally, AI-powered voice-over tools offer the convenience of customization, as parameters such as pacing, emphasis, and pronunciation can be easily adjusted to match specific project requirements. The speed, versatility, and efficiency brought by AI in the voice-over process empower video producers to deliver compelling content more efficiently than ever before. If you’re not ready to commit to full AI voice-over, you can also use AI tools to test the feel of different voices quickly. Pre-AI, you’d have to request a sample audio file from a variety of voice artists to experiment with your video’s tone, but AI can be used to speed up that testing process. Transcriptions and Subtitles The concept of using AI for subtitles and transcriptions isn’t exactly new (it’s what YouTube’s automated closed caption generator was already using), but it’s too useful not to mention here. When you provide a video file, AI can auto-generate captions and transcriptions for all your audio content. A few caveats: AI tools are unlikely to fully capture sound effects and other audio elements that aren’t voice-over, and you should definitely still review the automated text to make sure it’s accurate. Despite these final steps, using AI for your transcriptions is a huge time saver and a win for accessibility! Analytics Last but not least, AI can help you dig into your video analytics to understand what’s working and what’s not working in your current video marketing strategy. Your insights could be as granular as “videos do best when a product shot is the first frame” or “14 seconds is our optimal video length.” If you’re guilty of publishing video content and never giving the results much thought, AI can definitely help you understand your performance and experiment with future content to try to improve. Areas Where AI Falls Short As you might have noticed from the list above, AI has a ways to go when it comes to the creative elements of production. Here are just a few of the areas where we’d recommend sticking with human talent. Creative Concepting When it comes to the concept behind your video campaign, AI pales in comparison to world-class creative teams. Brainstorming at this stage requires a deep understanding of each client and their goals, general industry knowledge, up-to-date awareness of video trends, and the ability to work with inherently human concepts like memes, metaphors, and other forms of creative thinking. This stage of the production process is too abstract and open-ended for AI tools to handle effectively. While AI may still may a helpful role in your brainstorming process, it’s just not ready to handle the concepting stage independently. This stage demands human ingenuity, intuition, and expertise. Creative teams bring a wealth of experience and a keen eye for identifying unique and compelling ideas that resonate with the target audience. They can leverage their knowledge of storytelling techniques, cultural references, and current events to create a concept that is not only visually captivating but also emotionally engaging. The interplay of different perspectives within a creative team fosters dynamic discussions and sparks innovative ideas, fueling the generation of fresh and impactful concepts. Storyboarding Storyboarding is where your final video starts to really take shape, and it’s another area where we’d recommend sticking with real-life artists and producers. Successful storyboarding brings the script, creative concept, and on-set visuals together in a cohesive and compelling way, and it’s just too much to attempt to integrate automatically. Again, AI tools can be used to gain inspiration, but the final storyboard should be crafted manually if you want high-quality content. Working with real-life artists and producers for storyboarding ensures that the final result is unique, tailored to your specific video, and meets your creative vision. They can interpret the script, consider the desired tone and atmosphere, and incorporate on-set visuals, props, and locations into the storyboard. Their expertise allows them to create a cohesive and visually captivating representation of the final video. Furthermore, collaborating with artists and producers during the storyboarding process fosters communication and alignment among the creative team. It enables discussions and revisions, ensuring that everyone involved shares a clear understanding of the video’s direction and aesthetics. Real-time feedback and adjustments can be made, resulting in a refined storyboard that accurately captures the desired narrative and visual style. Editing While there are AI tools that make editing easier, editors are still irreplaceable in the production world. Imagine giving the same storyboard and footage to three different editors with different backgrounds and visual styles. Despite having the same input—like the prompt or instruction you might give an AI tool—you’ll likely end up with three unique videos. So, while AI may be able to support basic editing functions and speed up some of the manual elements, there’s just no replacement for the human eye and creative expression. When in doubt, the more creative a task is, the less likely AI is to deliver the results you want. To AI or Not to AI? AI is quickly transforming the professional landscape for all kinds of careers, but if you’re ready to outsource all your work to the robots, you’re going to be disappointed for now. There’s still immense value in having human minds execute the creative process, especially if you’re working with unique products or theoretical concepts that are hard for AI tools to contextualize. Plus, remember that AI tools are built on pattern recognition and extrapolating from existing context. If your goal is to come up with a novel video concept that’s never been seen before, AI tools just aren’t built to help you reinvent the wheel. Our takeaway? Lean into AI for the elements of production where it’s most useful, and rely on human talent for the rest. If scriptwriting and voice-over are common roadblocks for your team, AI may be the perfect solution to help you churn out more content. Just remember that a streamlined, automated process isn’t necessarily an effective process. If your AI-driven content isn’t performing, it may be time to go back to basics! Try Lemonlight!

Form Type utm_campaign utm_source utm_medium utm_content A Decade of Stories: Pioneering Video Production Across Industries The journey of Lemonlight began with a vision that was both ambitious and deeply needed in the marketplace. From our humble beginnings in a small bedroom in 2014, our mission was clear: to revolutionize video production, making video content accessible for brands of all sizes. This vision was born out of a realization that while the demand for digital advertising solutions—particularly in video—was skyrocketing, small and medium-sized businesses were significantly underserved. The statistics were compelling, with predictions that 74% of all internet traffic would be video by 2017, and evidence that video significantly boosted engagement rates in marketing communications. Yet, the costs and logistics of video production were prohibitive for most, averaging $300,000 for a 30-second commercial. Our approach—offering transparent, predetermined video packages—was revolutionary at the time. It allowed clients to choose a price point they were comfortable with, breaking down the barriers that had kept high-quality video out of reach for so many. Over time, this approach evolved into robust content packages that worked for brands of all sizes. As video content became more important across all industries, brands rushed to figure out how to get more. Witnessing the success of our early clients, particularly the mom-and-pop shops that had previously thought high-quality video content was beyond their reach, was among the most rewarding experiences of our journey. Their stories of increased engagement, boosted sales, and enhanced brand recognition validated our belief in the power of accessible video content. These successes not only propelled our growth but the growth of our early clients as well. Since then, Lemonlight has matured from a small startup to a leader in the video production industry.

      "content": "Top Predictions for AI | IBM My IBM Log in Subscribe Top 6 predictions for AI advancements and trends in 2024 Tags Artificial Intelligence 9 January 2024 4 min read Link copied In 2024, the initial cultural fascination with early generative AI yields tangible business results. This technology, which includes the ability to process and generate text, voice and video content, is revolutionizing how companies enhance productivity, foster innovation and stimulate creativity. According to McKinsey & Company (link resides outside of ibm.com), these AI applications have the potential to contribute between USD 2.6 trillion and 4.4 trillion annually to the global economy through various business scenarios. Using insights from extensive collaborations with customers and partners in more than 25 countries, we’re excited to share well-informed predictions and emerging trends for 2024. This global perspective enabled us to observe how diverse industries both influence and are influenced by the evolving technology landscape. Here’s a glimpse into what the future holds. 1. Customization of enterprise AI Enterprise AI customization is on the rise, with businesses embracing tailored generative AI applications. These applications are designed to meet specific business needs by integrating proprietary data and help to ensure more accurate and relevant responses. This trend signals a move toward more efficient and personalized AI-driven business solutions. For example, a global retail chain might adopt region-specific AI models that are trained on data, such as customer preferences and cultural nuances. This approach results in highly personalized customer interactions. In Japan, AI prioritizes efficiency and precision, while in Brazil, it emphasizes warmth and engagement, reflecting each market’s cultural values. This trend is expected to extend to various industries, transforming AI from a generic tool into a vital strategic asset. Businesses increasingly rely on AI for customer engagement, operational efficiency and market competitiveness, leading to a dynamic business landscape where AI fuels innovation and addresses specific market and operational challenges. 2. Open source AI models In 2024, open source pretrained AI models gain significant traction, empowering businesses to accelerate growth by combining these models with private or real-time data. This synergy enhances productivity and cost-efficiency. IBM actively contributes to open source AI models, which are exemplified by its collaboration with NASA. A noteworthy contribution is the geospatial AI foundation model, the largest of its kind on the Hugging Face platform and a pioneering open source AI foundation model created in partnership with NASA. This model expands access to NASA’s earth science data, particularly for geospatial intelligence and advancing climate-related research. Derived from NASA’s satellite data, this model demonstrates the commitment by IBM to use open source technologies for critical areas such as climate change. By making this model available on Hugging Face, a well-known repository for transformer models, IBM and NASA aim to democratize access and encourage its application in climate and earth science innovations. The model has shown impressive results, achieving a 15% improvement over state-of-the-art techniques (link resides outside of ibm.com) with only half the labeled data, making it a potent tool for tasks like deforestation tracking, crop yield prediction and greenhouse gas detection and monitoring. 3. API-driven AI and microservices The proliferation of application programming interfaces (APIs) will simplify the creation of complex AI-driven applications, boosting productivity across various sectors. IBM developed a suite of custom AI microservices for a retailer, accessible through APIs. These services included customer behavior analysis, inventory management and personalized marketing tools. A key feature was the integration of IBM’s AI-powered intelligent assistants into the retailer’s customer service system. These assistants, capable of handling numerous customer inquiries in real time, provided tailored responses based on individual customer data. Additionally, the retailer used IBM’s AI-driven summarization tools to efficiently analyze customer feedback and sales data, enabling swift and informed decision-making. The impact was significant: customer service efficiency improved, marketing strategies became more data-driven and inventory management was optimized. The flexibility and scalability of these API-driven solutions enabled the retailer to adapt rapidly to market changes. 4. AI as a national priority Recognizing AI’s immense potential, nations worldwide are expected to prioritize its development in a manner reminiscent of a new space race. This heightened focus drives significant advances in research, science and economic growth, firmly establishing AI as a strategic global asset. In 2023, the European Union demonstrated its commitment to elevating AI as a national priority by progressing toward the finalization of the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act). This historic legislation represents the world’s inaugural comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence, categorizing AI systems into different risk levels (unacceptable risk, high risk and limited risk) and imposing corresponding obligations. The EU AI Act legislation represents a significant step in the regulation of AI deployment within the EU, encompassing a wide array of AI applications, ranging from high-risk scenarios like AI usage in sensitive systems such as welfare, employment, education and transport, to low-risk applications like chatbots. Also, the EU AI Act prohibits certain AI applications that are considered to pose unacceptable risks, including the use of emotion recognition in the workplace and social scoring based on social behavior or personal characteristics. 5. Multimodal generative AI Transitioning from text-based generative AI to multimodal language, the integration of text, speech and images promises contextually relevant responses and fosters innovation across diverse sectors. For instance, during a customer service call, AI can analyze a client’s spoken request, interpret their financial documents and assess their facial expressions in a video consultation. By synthesizing these data points (speech, text and visual cues), AI can provide more personalized financial advice and enhance creditworthiness assessments with precision. 6. AI safety and ethics As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, the focus on AI safety and ethics intensifies. Leading AI organizations are collaborating to develop robust AI systems with standardized safety protocols and best practices to help ensure ethical AI usage.

It assists with developing ideas and writing dialogues. It converts audio into text in real-time. Additionally, this provide voice-overs for the recording, such as smart voices, and improve performances. Also helps in the post-production workflow with short content containing visuals. It also helps in detecting music and creating virtual characters. In the traditional processes, there was labor involvement with many tasks. Artificial Intelligence handles these repetitive tasks. By using these tools, it simplifies the process with efficiency, innovation, and personalization. Understanding of Artificial Intelligence content technologies and platforms Generally, Machine learning is used to generate custom video experiences and deep learning helps in image and video recognition. It is able to detect faces and tag people and is also used in the development of deep fake technology. Hence, Adobe Sensei tool helps in audio enhancements and removing of unnecessary content. Magisto, which is an AI-powered tool helps in creating music and transitions. In Addition, Runway is used in playing background effects. Artificial intelligence is used in editing video files and arrangement of scene videos according to the patterns. It helps with selecting various filters to improve post-production. Machine learning algorithms are used for video scripts and writing the dialogues which improvises the story. Animations are used for the descriptions of text and visualization of concepts. It creates realistic videos and characters for the movies. It makes corrections by saving time in post-production and generating subtitles for the content it is able to add effects to the characters and track the motions. Essential elements that impact the traditional video industry There are many tasks such as the generation of scripts and storyboarding. The usage of advanced natural language processing helps the writers to write the dialogues and give the props. The storyboarding tools help with the generation of scripts at the representation play, saving time for the directors. It improves filming and camera techniques for shooting purposes and helps with exposure to lighting. In video editing for post-production, this helps with color correction and sound mixture by using various artificial intelligence tools of the systems. It uses various techniques to adjust the lighting, balance the color and take videos without any human effort. It makes use of various sound effects to improve the quality of the audio it generates, AI-assisted sound mixtures. Generally, the VFX helps to generate 3D and 2D images and add character animations by making use of facial expressions. It also detects weather conditions in the videos, and it also replaces the faces. Making recommendations based on the specified preferences. It uses customized content suggestions (Zeligs, 2024). It also recommend learning systems and various workplaces. Therefore it uses customer segmentation and targeting. The AI-powered chat boards help with recommendations and content to customer service by delivering personalized interactions It gives assistance based on the relevant information. Benefits of Artificial intelligence in the video industry In video production, artificial intelligence uses to decrease the labor cost in which editing is done in post-production. Sometimes there is a requirement of humans for color correction mixer of songs but by usage of AI, it becomes easy. The small enterprises which are small studios and independent creators require very little cost for the post-production activities so in that case automation uses to reduce the overall production cost. It takes so many days to edit and correct scenes and grade the colors so these are all repetitive tasks that lead to time wastage. So, to deliver the content faster and meet the deadlines in a limited time frame AI enhances the creation of the content process. Earlier for creating high-quality content of videos there was a lot of expensive equipment needed for learning the processes and executing. But now driven platforms are helping in creating videos and automated video editing is used which makes it easy to arrange the videos and cut down videos (Ota, Ray, & Alli, 2024). Creators make use of many editing techniques with innovative ideas capture motions with various usage of graphics and reduce rich effects in the visuals. AI in video industry Source Risks and challenges of Artificial Intelligence content in traditional Industry Traditionally, there were professionals for editing and designers for sound, and VFX creators, but now the usage of AI tools reduces the demand for humans and there are many job opportunities. Artificial intelligence creates more videos and scripts and even increases performance with more effects. Thus it also decreases human creativity by increasing usage. It produces high quality content for the repetition of the task, and it engages with managing the tones in the videos and increases overall content quality. There is manipulation of the truth, such as deepfake videos, and privacy violations take place. Deep fakes also spread misinformation regarding political campaigns and challenges related to reputational damage (Jaiman, 2020). There is also some risk with sound designs and the chance of a decrease in innovative thinking. Artificial intelligence offers new possibilities and maintain expertise.
