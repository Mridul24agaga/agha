This article will let us know the position of YouTube video idea generator AI in generating engaging video content using Artificial Intelligence. Nowadays, these tools also help add audio/video summary and animations for the videos. In this article Part 1 What's Video Ideas Generator and How to Use This Tool to Get More Views It's not enough to create a YouTube channel and post some video that does not have informative content. Sometimes, even though the video has informative content, the content might not be attractive to the viewers for various reasons, like the content might be routine and does not have more reach, likes, or shares. Along with good content, we also need new and creative ideas to get more viewers. Thus, we have some tools to provide unique and innovative ideas based on the niche you choose. Videos Idea Generator is a tool that gives ideas for YouTube videos, and it works based on AI technology (Neural Networks). This tool will be more beneficial for the content creators to get moreÂ AI video ideas. Naturally, you might be out of ideas for your channel, or sometimes it takes more time to get an idea, or it could be a routine idea that does not sound interesting to the viewers. In such cases,Â an AI video idea generatorÂ is more helpful in suggesting new and innovative ideas for the content creators based on their interesting topics. Some of the advantages of a video idea generator are: â Time-saving â as one can utilize the time in other work, such as editing the video/ adding subtitles, etc., instead of thinking of an idea. â Engaging with the audience â can utilize the time in engaging with the audience by answering their questions. â Promote videos â can utilize time to promote their videos on other social media platforms or collaborate with other content creators for promotions. â Add animationsÂ â animations and other visual effects can be added to the videos using AI. Also, we can add video and audio summaries after each video so that the viewers can get brief detailing of the whole video. How to use Videos Idea Generator: There are differentÂ AI video idea generatorÂ tools, and most of them work similarly. The most common steps are: Step 1: Provide Topic Here you need to provide the topic's name on which we are planning to create the video. Step 2: Provide Keywords After providing a topic, give the keywords required for publishing. The video needs to have all the keywords so that the main content of the video can project adequately. Based on the topic name and keywords, the tool will generate suggestions for the video ideas using the Neural Network concept of Artificial Learning. Part 2 12 Great AI Video Ideas to Bring More Traffic Now, let us know 12Â AI video ideasÂ that can become viral and get more likes and views : 01Idea 1: Know your Interest Before starting a YouTube channel or posting a video, know your area of interest first. Once you get clarity on the area of interest, it's easy to pick a topic from that and create an innovative video. Try to be more specific in the topic you choose. Also, have clarity on the section of audience you want to target. For example, if your topic is more related to children, add more animations of animals/ cartoons that interest children. If you choose a related topic, do not add more animations that might confuse the audience. Add more reference links so that they can refer to those and be more particular on the specific topic you are trying to explain through the video. Similarly, if you choose a gaming-related topic, do not be more general about gaming. Be specific towards a particular section of games like mobile gaming/ desktop/ virtual to reach more audience, and it does not seem boring to the audience. 02Idea 2: Interview Questions As many students graduate every year, the competition for jobs has increased. People are more interested in getting an appointment as soon as possible, and for that, they need to prepare for the interview thoroughly. A video containing the main topics for the discussion that has references for the interview questions would benefit the students. It can engage with people within no time. Also, if the video is more specific to the department-wise interview questions/ job-level interview questions, it would reach more people and be more helpful to them. 03Idea 3: Full Course in Any Technology Apart from the entertainment-related videos, education-related videos will be more helpful and engaging. Any video related to any technology course can get more views. UsingÂ the YouTube video idea generator AIÂ tool, you can generate more unique videos related to education. Instead of giving a brief idea of the technology, it's better to pick up a few topics and explain them in detail so that it would be helpful for interviews too. You can use AI technology to add a voice-over and a small summary at the end of the video so that the main points get revised once again.Â 04Idea 4: Cooking Ideas Cooking is one of the most trending topics on YouTube. Whatever the language might be, cooking-related videos can get more views, create more creativity, and engage with the audience. You can choose a dish from any cuisine and make a video. You can add slow motion/ fast forward actions and small creative animations using AI. UsingÂ AI video ideasÂ tools, you can get more creative ideas related to cooking that can increase views, as viewers will be more interested if the videos are innovative.Â Â 05Idea 5: Art and Craft ideas Recently, people have seem more interested in the interior design of the house. For such people, art and craft ideas might be more helpful. Also, nowadays, schools are encouraging students in other circular activities and studies. These videos might be more attractive to the school's students. Also, in crafts, select a specific area and make videos on that so that the video will be short and crisp, and easily understandable to the viewers. You can also add a voice-over while doing the craftwork to make it more transparent for the viewers. 06Idea 6: Photo and Video Editing Related Videos People have become more addicted to taking photos and storing them. Any video related to editing the photos/ videos will engage more with viewers as it is not associated with any section of people. Anyone from any place and with any qualification can understand such videos. Consider a few topics related to the editing and give a detailed description/ explanation of those ideas, or consider any photo/ video editing app and explain how the app works in the video so that it might be helpful for the people who are using the app for the first time. Also, please reply to the frequently asked questions related to the app in the form of comments or summary so that it can reach more people, and there is a chance that the viewers might suggest the video to others who are about to use the app. 07Idea 7: Movies Related Videos In every country, people are more addicted to movies regardless of language. Movies have become a part of daily life for almost all people. Some of the movie-related video ideas can be: â Video regarding actor interviews. â Video regarding the movie review/ collections. â Video regarding highlights/ mistakes in the movie. â Video related to small clips/ songs in the film. â Video related to the spoof of the central theme of the film. Any video related to a movie can be more viral.

People enjoy watching and playing these sports regularly from young to old age. It will be a good idea if you can try videos on sports. Using theÂ video generator AI,Â you can generate animation videos playing cricket and add small clips of old generation cricket players as examples. You may also create small teaching videos on other sports for children. Through animation, giving the latest sports updates worldwide will also be a better idea to get more views for videos. 11Idea 11: Current Affairs Related Videos Current affairs and general knowledge-related videos will be more helpful to people preparing for competitive exams as most people are learning through the internet rather than from books. If you can take a specific subject and give a detailed description of its past and current updates, it can be helpful for many people. And also, while doing such information-related videos, you get a chance to research it, and it will help improve your knowledge of the subject and searching skills. 12Idea 12: Gadget And Product Review Ideas Reportedly, there has been a tremendous increase in new products related to mobiles, laptops, TV, other hardware tools, skin, hair care products, etc. You can take a specific product and create innovative ideas on how to use the product using animations/ cartoons and give a short review of the product. Through this, you can earn as you promote a company product, and people will know about the product. This is beneficial in both ways. If the product is related to electronic gadgets, make a video explaining the product's features and how to use them. If it is hair or skincare related, include the ingredients used, advantages of the product, how to use the product, and any disadvantages, etc. Based on the product you choose, the content of the video should change.

Today we're going to look at the five best AI video generators. These tools let you turn simple text into stunning visuals, and many of these are free to try. So, you could follow along. I partnered with Zapier on this video, so let's check these out. First up, we have Synthesia. This is a powerful AI video generator that lets you create videos using realistic AI avatars and voiceovers in over 140 different languages. Synthesia offers a free plan so you can test it out. You get three minutes of video generation per month. And I know that's not very much; however, it is enough to get a feel for whether you want to shell out $18 per month for the starter plan. With free, you get nine AI avatars, and if you go with one of the paid plans, you get lots more video generation and also many more different avatars to choose from. Once you finish signing up, you'll land here in the main Synthesia workspace, and building an AI avatar video is very similar to pulling together a PowerPoint presentation. Right up on top, you can start a new video from a template or from scratch. You can also turn files and links into a video. You can dub a video or translate a video into another language, and over here, you can even turn a PowerPoint presentation into a video. Let's test this out with just a blank canvas. Let's click on this option. Here, we see lots of different templates with AI avatars, and keep in mind, we can customize all of these avatars, and we can also specify what the avatar should say. Right up on top, let's go with this new one right here. Let's click on Use Template. This drops us into the editor that you can use to build out your AI avatar video. Over on the left-hand side, you can add additional scenes. This is kind of like PowerPoint, where you could add additional slides to your presentation. Here, we see a few different examples. I'll click out of this. Over here, we have the main scene. You can click within the scene, and you can edit any of these different objects. For example, I could edit the text. Over here, I could select this shape. Up on top, you can also add additional objects to your slide. For example, you can add another avatar. You can add text, shapes, media, and you can even record your screen. When you select any of the objects in your scene, for example, I selected the AI avatar, over on the right-hand side, we have all the different properties related to this avatar. Let's say that maybe I want to change out the avatar. Here, I could click on Alex, and I could see all the different options. I'm on a free plan, so I'm limited by what I can choose, but you get a feel for all the different options that are here. For now, I'll stick with Alex. And here, we could adjust other properties as well. Now, down at the bottom, I can also see the talk track that the avatar will say within this scene. So over here, let's delete the text that's just placed here, and let me type in my own. Welcome to the Kevin Cookie Company. I'll have Alex say this. Now, up on top, we can preview her saying this text, or I could also generate it where it'll turn this into a video and she'll actually speak this text. Let's test that out. Once the video is all done generating, let's preview how it turned out. Welcome to the Kevin Cookie Company, where we believe that every great day starts with a cookie. We're thrilled to have you on board as part of our growing team. Let's now take this to the next level by automating video creation using Synthesia. Zapier connects Synthesia to thousands of apps. You can get started with Zapier for free at the link below. You can set it up so when you get a new lead in an app like HubSpot, Zapier detects this and then triggers Synthesia to generate a personalized video. Then Zapier can connect to your email and automatically send this video to the lead. The lead gets a customized video from you without needing your involvement. This isn't something that you could do with just HubSpot or just Synthesia. It's the connection that Zapier makes between all of these different apps. With Zapier, you can connect apps like Synthesia to Trello, ClickUp, Google Sheets, Monday.com, and thousands more, even if the apps weren't designed to speak with one another. Zapier lets you set up these automations just by describing what you need. No coding needed. At number two, we have Sora. This is OpenAI's video generation tool. You'll need a premium subscription starting at $20 per month to be able to use it. Once you finish signing up, you'll land here in the main Sora interface. Sora is a generative AI tool. What that means is it's generating new video based on all of its training data. Over on the left-hand side, we land in the featured view and here we can see all sorts of different videos that other Sora users have pulled together. Over on the right-hand side, I see one of a mouse with some interesting ears. If I'm curious about what type of prompt someone typed in to get this video clip, here I could click on it. This opens up a larger view of that video and down at the bottom, I can see the prompt. Maybe that serves as some inspiration. I'll close out of this view. Back on the main screen, we have what's called the composer and this is where you can describe the video that you would like Sora to make. I'll type in a description, a warm and cozy Kevin Cookie Company shop filled with freshly baked cookies. Down below, we have a few different options. Over here, you can upload an image if you'd like to incorporate that into the video. You could also set the style of your video, the aspect ratio, the resolution, also the length of the clip. With the $20 per month plan, you can only generate up to 10 seconds and you need a higher plan if you would like additional time. Over here, you could also select the number of variations. I'll stick with two and then you also have a storyboard option if you would like more control over what happens within the generated clip. For now, I'm good with just this prompt. So over here, let's send that to Sora. And once it's all done, you can preview how the clips turned out and look at all of that steam coming out of the cookies. You might want to wait a minute or two before you take a bite. At the very bottom, you have a few different options. You could go back, you could edit the prompt again. You could also recut it. Maybe you want to extend the clip. Here, you could remix it if you want to change anything that appears within the clip. For example, maybe instead of having these jars, I want a different shape to show up. You could also blend two different clips together and here you could set it up as a looping clip. Let's say you really like one of these clips and you'd like to download it. Here, I could simply click on the clip and right up on top, we have the option to download. Third on our list is invideo AI V3. This is a generative AI tool that creates full length videos rather than short clips like Sora. invideo offers a variety of different plans and you can get started for free and you get a generous 10 minutes per week of AI generation. So, what does that mean? You can type in a prompt for the video that you would like to create, it'll write a script, generate voiceovers, and also find matching stock media. However, it won't generate any new clips from scratch using AI. For that, you need one of the premium plans. You have the plus plan and the max plan which give you 60 seconds of generative credits. That's not very much, so if you're planning on creating lots of clips from scratch using AI, you'll have to go with the generative plan which starts at $96 per month and that gives you 15 minutes of generative credits. I'm now here in the main interface and we have a text field where you can type in your prompts for the video that you would like to create. Now, the beautiful thing is you can type in anything that you've ever imagined and using generative AI invideo will make it for you. So, it makes video creation accessible to anyone. Let's test this out. Create a 30 second ad video for YouTube promoting the Kevin Cookie Company. Use a friendly teddy bear as the mascot. Use wide cinematic shots and close-ups of chocolate chip cookies from time to time. Let's see what it comes back with. On this next screen, we can choose whether we want to use stock media or generative media. Again, with generative media, the AI is creating the video clips from scratch. We have a few different settings here. I think all these look good, so let's continue. It finished generating the video, let's now preview how it turned out. In a world of rushing and noise, there’s a place where warmth awaits. Meet our cuddly bear who knows the best moments are shared. Hehe. With finest ingredients, and a dash of magic, we bake cookies that bring people together, Kevin Cookie Company, where every bite tells a story. Mmm. Visit KevinCookieCompany.com and taste the love today. That is very impressive. I really liked how it turned out. Down below, we could also continue refining the video simply by using natural language and the AI will make changes. So, let's test this out. Use epic rock music as the background music and let's see if it can make that change. Let's have a quick listen. I'll go back just a little bit and let's play it. Mmm. Visit KevinCookieCompany.com and taste the love today. It's subtle, but I like it. Once you're ready to download, simply click on the download icon. Here, you could select various settings. I'll go with 1080p and let's continue and we now have a finalized video. At number four, we have Pika. An accessible and also fun AI video tool that's free to try. Once you finish signing up for an account, you'll land here on the main Pika interface. Similar to what we saw with Sora and some of the other video generators, down at the very bottom, we have a text field where you can type in a prompt describing the video that you would like to create. In the bottom right-hand corner, if you click on this icon, Pika offers a few different models. With a free account, you can use the 1.5 model. With a paid account, which starts at $8 per month, you get access to their more advanced models, which they say have better motion and Pika scene support. So, let's go with 1.5 with a free account to test it out. Underneath the text field, Pika offers a few different modes. For example, we have something called Pikaffect and when I click on that you can upload a video or photo and then you can apply different effects to that video. For example, one of my favorites. You can generate a proposal video. Try pulling that one on your girlfriend. That'd be a lot of fun. Over here, you have something called Pikascenes. This is where you can upload a character an object or location and it'll use that as part of your AI generated video. And lastly, there's also something called Pikaddition. You can upload a video and a photo and it'll incorporate that photo into your video. Let's test this one out because I think it's a lot of fun. Let me select a video and over here. I'll select an image. Now that I've selected both a video and an image, let's combine them. Down below, let's click on this icon. And let's now play the video. Not bad. Next up is Runway ML. They offer a suite of AI video editing tools along with the generative AI video capabilities. Once you finish signing in, you'll land in the main Runway ML interface, and if you've never heard of it before, it's a creative AI platform that offers a variety of different tools that you can use to generate, edit, and also enhance your multimedia projects all using machine learning. Let's take a quick look at what some of those tools are. Over on the left-hand side, let's click into all tools. Up on top, let's start by clicking into video tools and here we see all the different video tools that leverage AI. First up we have generative session. This is where you could generate video from scratch. You could use AI to remove the background of a video. They have something called frame interpolation. That's where you can fill in missing frames to make it smoother. You could color grade. They even have in painting and the list goes on and on. Lots of different tools that are well worth experimenting with. Let's close out of this and then click into some of the image tools. You also have a variety of different image tools. For example, if you want to expand the borders of an image, they have something called infinite image. Here you have something called expand image and the list goes on. Up on top, if we close out of this, you also have a variety of different audio tools and at the very end, they also offer different 3D tools. The beautiful thing about Runway ML is you can experiment with AI in your projects and you don't need extensive technical expertise. Let's test out Runway’s generative session. I'll click on this. First, we need to select an asset. I'll click on select asset and let's go with this picture of a handsome guy. I’ll double click on that and now I see my picture. Down below we can now describe the shot that we would like. I'll type in some text. This person works at a cookie store and is serving fresh cookies to customers. Down below we have a variety of different settings. As an example, here you can control the camera. I'll leave it set to the defaults. You can adjust the aspect ratio. Down below, you can select the model and also how long you want the clip to be. With Runway ML, you can only select up to 10 seconds. For now, I'll leave it set to 5 and then let's click on generate. Over on the right-hand side, it's now generated our video. Let's play back to see how it turned out. There's the picture input and here's the output. Look at that. He looks a little bit like me. Not exactly, but pretty close, and it also has the red shirt. It's a polo shirt, so it doesn't match my shirt, but that's pretty close. I like that. Right over here. We have a variety of different actions that you could take. For example, if you want to upscale to 4k, you have that option and over on the right-hand side, if you'd like to download the video clip, simply click here and that'll download the clip to your computer. And that's it. Five of the best AI video generators available today. Big thanks to Zapier for sponsoring today's video.

Types of AI video generation Text-to-video Veo 2 is PURE FIRE 🔥 \"A small pink liquid monster, styled like a rapper with a backward cap and chunky gold chain, performing a kickflip down a flight of stairs. The skateboard spins multiple times underneath as the liquid creature's form ripples and splashes dynamically in… pic.twitter.com/0EEeWlPcHE — Javi Lopez ⛩️ (@javilopen) January 13, 2025 Text-to-video AI video generation allows users to create videos simply by describing a scene in text. The AI interprets the prompt and generates a matching video, complete with movement, lighting, and even physics. This is by far the most popular type of AI video generation. Image-to-video Look at that VEO 2 animates windows wallpaper! pic.twitter.com/qL51V8S4oA — testtm (@test_tm7873) December 26, 2024 Image-to-video AI video generation animates static images, bringing them to life with motion effects. AI can generate smooth transitions, camera movements, or even animate characters from a few frames. Image-to-video models are popular with AI video creators because they allow you to maintain character, scene and object consistency throughout your video. You would typically use these tools alongside an AI image generator like Midjourney. Video-to-video @runwayml has 4K upscaling now! 🤯 I did a comparison between Runway GEN-3 and Topaz Video AI's upscaler, from HD to 4K. Runway's file size footprint is 40% of Topaz (using the Theia model), and after reviewing the results on a 40\" monitor, there's little to no difference in… pic.twitter.com/GamPOXq9mr — Tom Blake (@Iamtomblake) January 9, 2025 Video-to-video AI video generation uses AI to enhance, modify, or transform existing videos rather than creating new ones from scratch. This can include improving video quality, changing styles, adding special effects, or even altering elements within the footage—like removing objects, or replacing backgrounds. Some good examples of video-to-video includes Synthesia's AI dubbing (with lip sync) or Topaz's video upscaling. Th‎e best AI video generator for studio-quality videos with AI avatars Synthesia PlayCreate an AI Video in 4 Minutes with Synthesia ⚡️ Verdict: Easy to use and great for training, internal communications, marketing, outreach and localisation/translation ‎Link: ‎https://www.synthesia.io/ Synthesia is a leading AI video generator that allows you to create studio-quality videos with AI avatars that can narrate your text. It includes more than 60 video templates you can start from, and you can choose between more than 230 AI avatars that speak more than 140 languages and accents. Here's an example video I made for a product launch: PlayProduct Introduction (Free AI Video Template) Synthesia can be used to create a variety of video types, with the most common use cases being learning and development videos, including training videos and other eLearning video production. It also excels at producing onboarding videos and video content for internal communications, as well as marketing and outreach videos. Synthesia is a top-ranked AI software, with 1150+ reviews on G2 and has a rating of 4.7 out of 5. The platform is being used by 50,000 companies of all sizes, with many big names among them, such as Reuters, Zoom, and Amazon. Synthesia is a browser-based platform and I found it easy to set up my first video. I simply typed in my script, selected an avatar from their library, customized my video with the AI video editor, and then Synthesia generated a polished video featuring one of its realistic AI avatars. With over 230 avatars to choose from, I easily found options that fit different tones and purposes. You can also make a custom avatar that looks like you. Synthesia supports over 140 languages, and I was able to create localized versions of my video with ease. The platform even has a multilingual video player that automatically translates videos to viewers’ preferred languages, making it useful for global audiences. I tried adding multiple avatars on screen to simulate conversations, which worked smoothly and could be helpful for training scenarios or role-playing videos. The platform has over 60 professionally designed video templates that make it easy to produce polished content quickly. Features like live collaboration tools allow teams to work together seamlessly, while detailed video analytics provide insights into video performance. Altogether, these capabilities make Synthesia a practical, efficient choice for professional projects. One of its most popular use cases is as training video software, but it's also great for other sales and marketing videos and multilingual content. Th‎e best AI video generators for creative video production Here's my rundown of the best text-to-video and image-to-video AI video generators for creative video production. Hailuo Hailuo Director Mode is so fun. Being able to combine camera shots is just fantastic. Here shaky camera and push in. pic.twitter.com/MfqBA22vm8 — Jerrod Lew (@jerrod_lew) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best free option for creative video production Link: ‎https://hailuoai.video/ Hailuo AI is an AI video generator that delivers high-quality 6-second video clips at 720p resolution. It offers text-to-video, image-to-video and a subject reference feature. Hailuo offers a 3-day free unlimited generation period so that you can generate a bunch of videos for free and really test the tool. Subject reference is a particularly cool feature. It lets you upload a photo of a character and then generate a scene with that character in it. I found the output to be pretty accurate, although I often needed to do some manual editing to maintain coherence. The model can also take multiple attempts to get it right, which will eat into your credits. The feature also often fails at close-ups (wide shots tend to work better but lose fine details). One of the first things that stood out to me was how well it understands prompts. Hailuo seemed to nail camera movements and scene composition accurately. The image quality is also noticeably high. However, generation times are limited to 6 seconds, which makes creating longer sequences more tedious. Al‎ibaba Qwen Another day, another release. Alibaba have quietly included video generation in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max and it's really good. Here are a few examples - check them out. pic.twitter.com/u6qptO59ai — TomLikesRobots🤖 (@TomLikesRobots) January 30, 2025 Verdict: Completely free and produces high quality videos, but often with unreliable generation Link: ‎‎‎‎https://chat.qwenlm.ai/ Alibaba included an AI video generator in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max. It’s a text-to-video only tool, but it’s completely free and I’ve been impressed by the quality. The one catch is that the generation is kind of unreliable. I often enter my prompt and the video generates up to 99% complete and then gets stuck for quite a while. In my experience the videos do eventually finish generating but be prepared to wait a little. The output quality seems to be really good, and while the functionality is limited, it’s completely free and the videos have no watermark. Kl‎ing If you’re looking to combine character consistency with high-quality VFX, @Kling_ai is the best choice. 🎥✨ Version 1.5 absolutely nails VFX. A true must-have! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/rO1WvmLj3k — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) January 12, 2025 Verdict: High quality output, but very long free plan generation wait times Link: ‎https://www.klingai.com/ Kling offers text-to-video and image-to-video features, along with free video generation credits for users who log in each month. Kling brings an impressive level of fluidity and realism to movement in videos. I found the adjustable creativity and relevance slider particularly useful for fine-tuning outputs. Its biggest strength lies in image-to-video generation (and in particular its elements feature), which is far superior to tools like Runway. The motion is smoother, and the AI follows prompts accurately. When I asked for a character to blink or walk forward while the camera zoomed in, Kling delivered exactly what I asked for. If you need storytelling or consistency between frames, Kling is a great option. Kling 1.5 also supports HD, which is a nice bonus. Kling has some drawbacks, the biggest being generation speed. On the free version, I sometimes had to wait an hour or more for a single clip, and I’ve heard of free users waiting a full day for results. This is a major issue if you need quick iterations. On a paid plan the generations are quicker, but I also noticed that Kling sometimes gets stuck at 99% completion and wastes credits. At the end of the day, if you prioritize quality, accuracy, and motion control, Kling is a great choice. The motion brush tool adds extra control, and the first-attempt success rate is high, meaning I spent less time fighting the AI to get what I wanted. Ru‎nway When setting up a shot in Runway, think carefully about where to put the camera. Consider what the camera placement tells the audience about the story, about the character, and about the moment. Every angle is a decision that affects how the audience will experience it. pic.twitter.com/XnijHcb0Jv — Cristóbal Valenzuela (@c_valenzuelab) November 11, 2024 Verdict: The Gen-3 model gives you great results and some amazing advanced features that come with a bit of a learning curve Link: ‎https://runwayml.com/ Runway’s latest Gen-3 model offers a comprehensive suite of creative tools, such as text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video, alongside advanced features like motion brush, keyframes, camera controls and inpainting. On the free basic plan, you can create short text-to-video clips (up to 10 seconds long or 16 seconds using the \"extend video\" feature in the older Gen-2 model) but can’t upscale resolution or remove watermarks. You also can’t generate videos directly from text using their Gen-3 Alpha model on the free plan (only images to video). However, you can still make great videos with just the image-video feature. Here's an example workflow to show you how I use Runway’s free plan to create AI-generated short story videos: Midjourney to generate images Runway for image-to-video Suno to generate music Elevenlabs for some effects Topaz for video upscaling Capcut for editing I found Runway’s advanced features to be pretty amazing. Camera control lets you adjust angles, focus, and movement to achieve a polished, professional look. The Motion brush tool allows you to add motion and direction to specific parts of a video, which is great for creating visually dynamic social media content. Keyframes allow you to configure the starting, middle, and ending frames to create smooth transitions between them. Inpainting lets you automatically remove unwanted objects throughout your clip. This tool handled complex scenes surprisingly well; I could remove background elements without affecting the continuity of the video, something that would usually require a lot of time and expertise. However, I found that these advanced features come with a learning curve, so if you’re new to video editing you might need a bit of practice to fully utilize Runway’s capabilities. I found Runway’s video generation process to be fast and reliable. I think the pricing is reasonable given the platform’s capabilities, especially for creators, filmmakers, and digital artists who want more control and creative freedom. However, the costs might feel high if you’re only looking for basic AI video generation, as Runway is designed for those looking to push creative boundaries and explore the possibilities of AI in video production. Go‎ogle Veo Been generating impossibly dangerous stunts with veo 2 using text prompts. Still surprising how realistic they can look (though not perfect yet). pic.twitter.com/0gETBwGH5y — Ethan Mollick (@emollick) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best option for creative video production, but limited access for now (US only waitlist) Link: ‎https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/ I was blown away by Google Veo 2’s realistic video generation capabilities. Every clip I produced, from a misty jungle scene to a foggy wildlife sequence, was rendered in stunning detail, and the visual fidelity was top-notch. One of the aspects that stood out for me was the advanced cinematic controls. I could specify everything from lens types to shot angles and even adjust depth-of-field effects, which made it feel like I had an entire professional film crew at my fingertips. The dolly zoom and pan shot features, in particular, added that extra layer of cinematic flair that really brought my scenes to life. In my tests, Veo 2 consistently produced more “correct” results compared to other tools like OpenAI’s Sora. The physics simulation is fantastic with objects and characters that move and interact in a way that feels natural and true to real-world behavior. I found that character consistency was excellent too; no matter how complex the scene, the generated characters maintained their look and identity throughout the video. Veo 2 supports high-resolution outputs (up to 4K) and longer video durations too, which simplifies your workflow as you won’t need upscaling tools. The only reason why Veo 2 isn’t my top pick for creative video production is because it’s still not publicly available - you have to join a waitlist and it’s still US only. There’s also room for improvement still, and I sometimes saw some strange character movements in my generated videos. Op‎enAI Sora 🚨 It’s crazy! #Sora just dropped, and it’s already blowing everyone’s minds! 😱🎥 Here are 10 mind-blowing examples showcasing its insane possibilities. 🔥 The future of video is here. 🚀👇 pic.twitter.com/Mcq2OepO3R — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Fun to play around with but needs to improve Link: ‎https://sora.com/ Sora is OpenAI’s entry into text-to-video AI video generation, and after spending some time with it, I’ve found it to be a mixed bag. On the one hand, when Sora works, it can deliver stunning, lifelike visuals, especially for abstract or artistic scenes. Its storyboard functionality is one of my favorite features, as it lets you prompt multiple shots in a single generation, and the “Blend” option adds a fun layer of creativity, allowing you to combine visual elements in unexpected ways. However, in my experience the model struggles with some critical aspects. Sora consistently fails when it comes to physics, general body movements, and character consistency. For example, I tried generating scenes as simple as making cats dance, only to be met with choppy motion, glitches, and overall results that were far from convincing. In several cases, the outputs felt like a gamble: some generations might be passable, but most of the time, prompts didn’t translate well into the expected actions or camera movements. I found that free or cheaper alternatives outperform Sora in accuracy and usability. There’s a steep learning curve, and despite the potential of the video-to-video remix functionality (which I’ve used to remaster some older AI-generated clips), the overall inconsistency is hard to overlook. You can access Sora on the plus plan ($20/month) which gives you 50 videos up to 720p resolution and 5 seconds long, or the pro plan ($200/month) for 500 videos up to 1080p resolution and 20 seconds long. Pi‎ka I had early access to the Pika 2.1 Model, A new journey begins, More clips to follow! @pika_labs pic.twitter.com/rN5OfMacoo — Stevie Mac (@StevieMac03) January 23, 2025 Verdict: The free plan isn’t great, but the premium plans have very good image-to-video features Link: ‎https://pika.art/ Pika offers a free plan that gives you access to Pika 1.5, which has text-to-video and image-to-video features and 150 monthly video credits. Videos can be downloaded without a watermark on the free plan. I wasn’t super impressed with the quality of the generated videos though. However, while Pika 1.5’s video output is nothing special, Pika 2.1 (available on the paid plan) offers an image-to-video feature called scene ingredients, which I think is pretty amazing. With scene ingredients you can build a shot from the exact character, object, wardrobe, and setting you want. It works by using reference images of each element and then providing a prompt. It’s similar to Kling’s elements feature in that it allows you to ensure creative consistency between scenes, which I found made it a super useful tool to produce actually usable videos. Lu‎ma First impression Luma > Sora pic.twitter.com/R2pXVsAesw — The Retro Burn (@burntheretro) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Their new Ray 2 model is great, but it’s a premium feature and it doesn’t offer image-to-video Link: ‎https://lumalabs.ai/ Luma's Ray 2 model has great motion realism and the physics feel really natural. The frame-to-frame consistency is a clear improvement over previous versions and it does an excellent job with cinematic elements, responding impressively to lighting, contrast, film formats, and camera motion. At times, it even seemed to intelligently structure shots. By using highly detailed prompts and running multiple generations, I found that it’s possible to create some truly stunning videos, though it does require some cherry-picking to get the best results. When I tested a sports car driving through snowy mountains at dawn, the scene composition was spot on and the snow, warm light, and camera tracking all felt smooth and natural. I also experimented with close-up shots of faces, and I was surprised by how well it captured emotional expressions, particularly in an extreme sadness prompt, where the eye movements and facial subtleties felt incredibly lifelike. Where Luma stands out is its ability to generate dynamic camera movements while keeping the scene coherent. It understands cinematic depth and framing in a way that makes it ideal for dramatic shots. I found that Luma is great at handling large-scale scene changes. For example, when I asked it to generate a collapsing building Luma delivered a convincing destruction sequence. Currently, Luma’s Ray 2 is only available to paid users and is capped at 720p resolution. Videos can be up to 10 seconds long, but I noticed that after about 7 seconds, scene consistency can start breaking down, occasionally shifting in unintended ways. Ad‎obe Firefly Here's another video created by Adobe Firefly.. a 3D printer, printing a car. Very impressed by the results. https://t.co/L5d8zf3TGv pic.twitter.com/ySylkRlDMS — techAU (@techAU) February 13, 2025 Verdict: Inconsistent motion and limited free use (only 2 free generations) make it hard to recommend Link: ‎‎https://firefly.adobe.com/ Adobe Firefly offers both text to video and image to video, both capable of producing 1080p clips from simple prompts or static images. Firefly struggles with distortion. I tested it by generating a video of \"a cyclist riding through a mountain trail in autumn,\" and while the colors and scenery were nice, the motion was noticeably unnatural. The cyclist's legs appeared to glitch mid-pedal, and the overall movement felt disjointed. Image to video fared better when creating abstract or background footage, but realistic human action remained a challenge. The output currently feels more like digital experiments than polished, usable content. On the positive side, Firefly's interface is intuitive. The built-in controls for adjusting camera angles, motion paths, and shot sizes make experimenting with different styles relatively simple. After generating two free videos, I was prompted to upgrade to either Firefly Standard or Pro for additional generations. While Firefly is enjoyable to explore and has clear creative potential, I’ll stick with more reliable alternatives for projects that need high-quality, natural-looking results. The best AI video generators for social media and YouTube content Fl‎exClip PlayHow to use FlexClip's AI Video Creator Verdict: User-friendly video tool with innovative AI features Link: ‎https://www.flexclip.com/ FlexClip is highly user-friendly platform that excels at helping you create professional-looking videos quickly and efficiently. I love the drag-and-drop editor. It’s perfect for creating videos on the fly without needing to spend hours on intricate editing. I’ve used it to create everything from social media content to promotional videos. The AI-powered text-to-video tool allows you to input simple text prompts, and the AI generates video clips based on the text, matching stock footage, adding text overlays, and even suggesting music. It's perfect for social media clips. While the AI can be a little hit or miss when it comes to perfectly matching footage to specific content, it’s an amazing tool for creating videos when you’re short on time or just need a draft to build upon, and I typically only need to make a few adjustments after generation. The AI script generator is another great feature. While the scripts are generally a good starting point, they often need a little fine-tuning to match the specific tone of the brand or subject matter. This is definitely a time-saver, though, especially when you’re stuck trying to put ideas into words. Another feature that impressed me was the AI background remover. It works surprisingly well. For most images, the background removal is clean, though it sometimes struggles with more intricate details like hair or small objects. It’s a great time-saver when you’re working with product images or need transparent backgrounds quickly. FlexClip also offers an auto-subtitle generator, which is a great tool for improving accessibility and engagement on social media platforms. It’s surprisingly accurate, and I’ve used it for videos on YouTube and Instagram. However, it does occasionally struggle with fast speech or complex accents, so if you’re working with content that has unclear audio, this may not always be 100% reliable. One area where FlexClip could improve is its media library. While it offers a decent range of stock footage and images, it’s not as extensive as some other platforms I’ve used. For niche content, I’ve often had to source additional media from other places. The stock library is good for general-purpose videos, but it may not always have exactly what you need. Ve‎ed PlayHow to Make a YouTube Intro Verdict: User-friendly browser-based video editor that streamlines social media content creation Link: ‎https://www.veed.io/ Veed is a user-friendly, browser-based video editor that made creating social media content incredibly easy for me. The intuitive layout and drag-and-drop functionality let me start projects quickly, and I loved using features like automatic subtitles, text-to-speech, and background removal to give my videos a professional touch. The templates and filters helped keep my style consistent, and with auto-translate, creating multilingual content was straightforward. The only downside I found was that the free plan includes a watermark, and complex scenes sometimes required a bit of manual tweaking to get the AI effects like background removal just right. Overall, Veed offered everything I needed for quick, polished videos with minimal effort. Ca‎nva PlayCreate content fast with Canva Video Verdict: AI-powered video editing with versatile templates Link: ‎https://www.canva.com/video-editor/ai/ Canva is not only a design tool; it’s also a great alternative for creating social media and YouTube videos. I tried its video editor, and I was impressed by how well it adapts to video creation. Canva’s templates make it easy to start projects tailored for platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. One of my favorite features is the automatic resizing, which lets me quickly reformat videos for different platforms without needing to start from scratch. The AI-powered suggestions for text and animations are also handy—it feels like Canva’s tools know how to keep my content consistent and visually engaging. With access to a vast library of stock media and music, I could easily enhance my videos, and the new AI text-to-speech and captioning features were a nice bonus, especially for making my videos more accessible. Overall, Canva’s video editing tools made it simple to produce polished, shareable content that looks just as good as anything created with dedicated video editors. The best AI-powered video editors Fi‎lmora PlayFilmora 14 is HERE! | Introducing a NEW way to edit Verdict: An affordable and user-friendly video editor with robust AI features Link: ‎https://filmora.wondershare.com/ When I first tried Filmora, I was immediately struck by how easy it was to navigate. The drag-and-drop functionality and straightforward interface made it simple to start editing, even without much prior experience. Filmora offers a robust library of transitions, effects, and templates, allowing me to quickly put together visually appealing videos, which is ideal for creating content for social media and YouTube. I appreciated how the platform balances usability with a range of features, making it suitable for both beginners and intermediate users who want to produce polished videos without a steep learning curve. Filmora’s pricing is also accessible, with options that cater to different types of users. They offer an annual subscription starting at around $49.99 per year, and for those looking for more flexibility, a lifetime license is available for around $79.99. There’s also a free version, which is great for testing the software before committing, but it does add a watermark to videos. For creators looking to edit consistently without major financial commitments, Filmora’s pricing offers a good balance of affordability and value, especially considering the powerful AI tools it includes. These plans are well-suited for individuals and small business owners who need regular access to professional-grade video tools without breaking the bank. Filmora's AI-powered tools bring a lot of convenience and creativity to the editing process. I'll run through each one. The AI Smart Cutout feature, for example, allows you to cut objects out of scenes by painting over the area, which is perfect for isolating specific subjects without complex masking. I also found AI Audio Denoise to be extremely useful for cleaning up background noise in my videos, especially when I recorded in less-than-ideal environments. The AI Audio Stretch tool was another handy feature that let me extend background music to match scene transitions, saving me the hassle of remixing or finding perfectly timed tracks. These AI tools are not only time-saving but also elevate the overall quality of the final video, helping users create professional-looking content with minimal effort. The AI Motion Tracking tool was a lot of fun to experiment with—it can be used to track faces or moving objects, allowing for privacy blurring or creative effects like pasting funny stickers over someone’s face to make meme-style videos. Another feature I really enjoyed was AI Remove Background, which made it easy to change the background of my videos without needing a green screen. I could, for instance, place a runner in an outer-space setting, which opens up endless creative possibilities. Additionally, Filmora’s AI Silence Detection tool helped speed up my editing by automatically removing pauses and hesitations, making it effortless to create snappy jump cuts. These tools make Filmora an efficient, AI-enhanced option for quick edits and visually dynamic effects. However, while these AI tools are great for general use, there are a few limitations. The precision of features like Smart Cutout and Remove Background isn’t perfect and might require manual touch-ups for complex scenes. Additionally, while Filmora handles most tasks smoothly, rendering can slow down when working with high-resolution files or when using multiple AI features in one project. This might be a drawback for users with demanding workflows or those creating high-quality, professional-grade content. Overall, though, Filmora’s AI tools make it an impressive choice for social media creators and hobbyists. In summary, Filmora is an accessible, budget-friendly video editor that packs a lot of AI-driven functionality into an affordable package. It’s particularly suited for those creating content for social media, YouTube, or personal projects. With its range of pricing options, Filmora offers a lot of value, especially for casual and intermediate creators who don’t need the high-end features of more advanced (and expensive) software. To‎paz PlayExperience Wonder by Topaz Labs Verdict: A premium AI-driven enhancer that delivers cinematic upscaling and noise reduction for professional-quality footage Link: ‎‎https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-video-ai Topaz Video AI is an advanced video enhancement tool that uses AI to upscale, stabilize, and improve video quality. When I tried it, I was impressed by how well it upscaled footage, even to resolutions as high as 16K, adding a cinematic clarity to older or lower-quality clips. The AI-driven noise reduction made a noticeable difference, effectively removing grain and artifacts that I struggled with in other software. I also found the frame rate enhancement and slow-motion features to be smooth and natural, making it ideal for creating professional-quality slow-motion shots or restoring archival footage. Priced at $299 for personal use and $1099 for commercial licensing, Topaz Video AI is an expensive but valuable investment for filmmakers, content creators, and digital archivists looking to elevate their work with high-end upscaling and video repair capabilities. Ca‎pCut PlayLearn How to Create Amazing Content using CapCut Web Version | CapCut Verdict: A free and versatile editor with intuitive AI tools that make crafting polished content effortless across devices Link: https://www.capcut.com/ CapCut is a free, all-in-one video editing tool that I found easy to use across mobile, desktop, and browser platforms. The array of AI-powered features—like background removal and automatic upscaling—made editing quick and straightforward, especially for creating social media content. The audio-to-text transcription was a time-saver, automatically adding captions that boosted accessibility and engagement on my videos. I liked tools like video stabilization and text-to-speech, which let me enhance video quality without needing complex software. CapCut’s collaborative features were also helpful, especially when working on shared projects, and the library of templates gave me plenty of creative options. Overall, CapCut’s versatility and ease of use make it a great choice for both personal and professional video editing. The best AI video generators for video repurposing Op‎usClip PlayOpusClip 3.0: The smartest AI clipping tool just got smarter Verdict: A smart and time-saving tool that repurposes long videos into engaging, platform-ready clips with minimal effort Link: ‎https://www.opus.pro/ Opus Clip has quickly become one of my favorite tools for repurposing long videos into social media-friendly clips. The AI-driven clip generation feature is surprisingly accurate, identifying the most engaging parts of my videos and saving me the time I’d usually spend sorting through footage. I appreciate how it automatically resizes clips to fit different platforms like TikTok and Instagram without any manual adjustments. Adding captions and even emojis is simple, and I noticed it makes the videos more engaging, especially for viewers who watch without sound. One of the standout features is the \"hook\" identification, which picks out key moments to grab attention quickly. Overall, Opus Clip made it easy to create compelling, shareable content from my existing videos, and the AI features really lightened my workload. Mu‎nch PlayMeet Munch Verdict: Efficiently converts long-form content into shareable social snippets using AI Link: ‎https://www.getmunch.com/ Munch is an AI-based tool for repurposing long-form video content into shorter clips suited for social media platforms. It identifies key moments in videos and includes features like auto-cropping, subtitles, and format adjustments to help optimize content for platforms such as Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok. Munch offers a streamlined way to create shareable content from existing videos, aimed at enhancing reach and engagement across various channels. I found the interface clean and easy to navigate, allowing me to jump right in without needing tutorials. One feature I particularly liked was the automatic detection of key moments. Munch’s AI identifies engaging segments, which saved me the time of manually sifting through my footage to find the best parts to share. For anyone looking to repurpose content across platforms, this automation is a real time-saver. Munch’s formatting tools also make it easy to resize videos for different social platforms. The auto-cropping options adjust clips to fit Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and more, making cross-platform distribution simpler. I appreciated the automatic subtitle feature, which made my videos accessible to a broader audience without much additional work. However, while these features are useful, they lack some customization. I couldn’t manually adjust the selected clips as much as I’d like, and sometimes the AI would pick sections that didn’t feel as relevant or engaging as I had hoped. One limitation I noticed is that the output quality and customization options are fairly basic compared to more advanced editing software. While auto-cropping and subtitles are convenient, the styling options for subtitles are limited, and I missed having more flexibility with transitions and effects. This might be a drawback if you’re aiming for highly polished, branded content, as Munch is more focused on speed and efficiency than fine-tuning. Overall, though, it’s a solid tool for quickly repurposing long videos into social-friendly snippets. If you need a quick way to generate clips from existing content and don’t require advanced editing, Munch is a handy addition to your toolkit. Wi‎secut PlayTurn long videos into shorts with Wisecut AI Verdict: Wisecut streamlines editing by automatically trimming dead space and adding professional touches Link: ‎https://www.wisecut.ai/ Wisecut automatically finds interesting moments in long clips and cuts them, adding music and subtitles. I tested it by uploading a raw clip full of awkward pauses and unnecessary dead spots, and Wisecut’s smart editing removed all the fluff. The auto-cut feature was spot-on, leaving me with a much tighter, more engaging video without having to painstakingly cut it all myself. The tool is super intuitive. It offers handy features like background noise cancellation and even let me choose whether to add background music, which really helped polish the final product. I also appreciated the straightforward interface—it made setting up projects and tweaking settings a breeze. In short, Wisecut has saved me a significant amount of time, letting me focus more on creating content rather than getting bogged down in editing. If you’re looking to streamline your workflow and produce cleaner, more professional videos, I’d highly recommend giving it a try. How did I decide on the best AI video generators?

HubSpot research also found that 90% of marketers using short-form video for marketing plan to increase or maintain their video investments in 2023. In the past, the cost and time required to make quality video content was prohibitive. Now, AI video production tools are making it more accessible for any sized marketing team to create video content and hit their goals. Marketing teams everywhere are exploring how AI can help them save time and budget in the video production process, while simultaneously boosting creativity. We’ll get into the ways AI tools can help marketing teams create videos faster, and outline some apps and platforms to try. Let’s go. Ways to streamline the video production process with AI Marketing teams are enlisting the help of AI video production tools to stand out and transform content into new media formats — here’s how. Ideation There’s a lot of pressure on creative teams to develop video content for different departments, concepts, and goals. Product videos have specific considerations and look much different than videos for the careers, customer education, or advertising teams. AI tools can help video teams brainstorm, visualize ideas, and put together scripts. Story/concept Marketing teams have already started using AI brainstorming tools like ChatGPT, NotionAI, and Google Gemini to generate ideas, and they’re using the output as a jumping-off point to direct their efforts. See here how you can use ChatGPT to quickly develop an idea into a story or concept, with suggestions for each frame you can later use in a shot list. Try these prompts with a generative AI tool and see how quickly your imagination can take off: “We want to create a product launch video to showcase the features, use cases, and initial customer reactions and encourage viewers to sign up to receive a sample product. The product is [describe your product here]. Please map out a script for the voiceover and a shot list for a 30 second video, along with suggestions for music, transitions, and lighting.” “Please transform this written interview into a case study video format with shot suggestions, intro copy, and a call to action at the end to read the whole case study.” Script And many marketing teams are using generative AI writing tools like Jasper.ai and Writesonic to create simple scripts to use as a starting point. Consider taking existing content, like blog posts, ebooks, and reports, and using generative AI tools to turn them into video scripts. When creating scripts with AI tools, remember to include: Voice and tone suggestions Intended video length Campaign goals Audience Pre-production During pre-production, AI tools are most helpful for two things — creative development and administrative tasks. Creative teams can use AI to help generate storyboards, illustrate potential video concepts visually, and experiment with visual styles. Assistant directors or project managers can cut down on time spent on the administrative elements of pre-production like call sheets, scheduling, and shot lists. Project planning To get a video from idea to launch, it takes lots of team members from different departments, and they all need to be aligned from the start. AI tools can automatically put together campaign timelines, assign tasks to individuals with deadlines, and help video teams handle more projects at a time with fewer headaches. Art direction Art directors are using AI tools to explore ideas, visualize concepts, and work through potential stories — without spending months developing minimum viable products (MVPs) to see if they’ll work. Michael Kuroda, a Production Manager at HouseFishBalloon, tested out adding AI to the art direction process and shares, “​​Where I would usually spend hours mocking up picture variations, trying different color schemes, and adding environmental depth, I can now spend that time adding effects and billboards. As a result, this new painting…is much more lively than my previous attempt while simultaneously taking much less time.” Source: House Fish Balloon Midjourney is an AI text to image generator, like StableDiffusion, that lets the user iterate on previously generated images, making it easy to show a variety of visual styles that stakeholders can choose from. Deforum is an AI image and animation generator that lets users quickly create simple animations out of text queries. Source: Midjourney Storyboarding Storyboarding is one of the most exciting places to use AI for video production. AI tools are ideal for visualizing video concepts without taking up too much creative bandwidth, giving brand teams more room to play with ideas and test out more of their “outside the box” pitches. Arturo Tedeschi, an Italian artist, is using DALL-E to transform descriptive text from classic movies into visual storyboards for films. “The art of storyboarding deserves attention not only for graphic quality…but as a creative bridge between screenplay and film, as a link between language and images. Cutting-edge systems like DALL-E have learned the relationship between image and text,” shared Tedeschi. Source: designboom. Location scouting Video teams can enlist ChatGPT and other tools as a research assistant. Ask conversational AI tools which locations are best for video shoots based on permit requirements, weather conditions, availability, and any other considerations you’re thinking about to get a sample list. Then, go through the proposed locations and fact-check, or draw inspiration from the ideas. Shot list Use AI tools to turn a script into a shot list, making sure to instruct generative AI tools to capture the flow and keep it within the desired timeframe. StudioBinder is an AI tool that generates shot lists and it’s specifically designed for filmmaking. Call sheet and scheduling Rather than spending hours manually creating call sheets, prepping scheduling emails, and creating workback schedules, set up AI prompts to automate administrative tasks. Here’s an example prompt for an AI-generated call sheet: “Take all characters from the pages of this script and organize them into a call sheet with character, actor name, time needed, scenes to be rehearsed and schedule, and location.” Production AI generated video production is new and companies are still working through some of the early bugs, like unnatural voice overs. And there’ll always be a place for on-camera talent. But for certain video styles like animations, talking head videos, avatar videos, social media clips, and more, AI tools and templates can align creative teams and provide first drafts that are easier to edit. AI generated videos AI video generation tools like InVideo, Pictory, and RawShorts can fully create a video from start to finish, using AI-generated voice-over (VO), avatars, stock footage, video templates, and animations to dynamically communicate ideas. For Staff-Picked filmmaker Paul Trillo, the draw of AI is in its aesthetic ticks — and the new visual style that’s being created as it goes mainstream. “I’m leaning into the natural aesthetic that the AI videos are creating, rather than pushing against it,” he says. “Right now, it’s more interesting as its own aesthetic.” Explainer videos for newsletters, internal sharing, or social media Explainer videos can outline new product features, teach a concept to help an audience grow, or deliver company updates. Typically, these kinds of videos are composed of talking head footage interspersed with images and other short clips — but AI tools like Synthesia can save teams the hours of filming a busy VP or CEO talking, and just create an avatar to deliver the script instead. Social media videos Social media videos (and video ads) are excellent at grabbing attention whether they’re made for Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or TikTok. RawShorts, InVideo, Canva and Pictory all have AI-powered options for social media video creation. AI video tools AI video tools help out at a certain point in the video generation process, like turning text to video or adding animation. Synthesia is an AI video generator where users can upload their scripts and have them read by one of 140 diverse avatars. The team at Forecast, a project management tool, is using AI to build out Forecast Academy, a learning library with multimedia educational tools — now featuring AI-generated educational videos made with Synthesia. “Before, producing videos was a long, multi-staged process, now many of those stages are condensed within a single software,” shared Ryan McMeekin on the Forecast Academy team. Source: Forecast Academy InVideo is an AI text to video generator that helps marketers create video ads and social media videos. It also helps teams create video scripts, and quickly repurpose blog content into videos. AI video templates Video templates can serve as a storyboard, guide for timing or cuts, or the first draft of a video. Canva has free customizable video templates (like Vimeo!) and AI-powered writing and image generation tools built right into the platform, along with creative approval processes and collaborative team features. And Raw Shorts has video templates that you can use in their AI video maker. Source: Raw Shorts AI visual effects Snapchat and Instagram changed the game with responsive augmented reality filters, and now some of the technology behind VR/AR is coming to video production through AI tools. One tool, Gen-1, which writer Loz Blain refers to as “like DALL-E for moving pictures” can apply visual video effects to video files and generate new videos in different styles and formats. AI audio syncing and sound effects Sound engineers have been waiting for this one. AI tools can now match audio up to video and provide suggested background noises and other sound effects. Here’s an example of a Soundify video with AI-generated audio. Post-production We’ve only begun to explore the impact of AI tools on post-production and video editing, but organizations like the Associated Press, that manage thousands of hours of live footage every year, are already seeing the benefits of AI-automated video management. AP’s VP of News, Sandy MacIntyre is spearheading efforts to use AI to automatically pull out great photos and sound-bites, and reduce overall production ‘grunt work’, as a way of “liberating people to do more creative things with the editing and production time.” The AP team has found that AI-powered speech-to-text transcription has been working well so far, but sentiment analysis and video searchability have a ways to go. Video editing In the video editing process, AI-powered tools help teams with color correction, inpainting, background removal, jump cuts, sound and voiceover (VO) editing, and much more. ElevenLabs is a text-to-speech AI software that takes a written script and instantly turns it into a natural-sounding voice-over to use in videos. “Text-to-speech AI tools are powerful for timing scripts and making sure everything sounds good before going into a recording,” says Odette Santos, Principal Cinematographer at HubSpot. AI-powered video editors like Runway ML have video inpainting, effective video background removers, and a text-to-color grade function that lets video editors color grade through queries like “make this clip look like an old silent film” or “make the clip cooler-toned”. AI tools can also automatically create jump cuts, remove silence, speed up scenes, and cut commentary in video and podcasts. They can also remove bad takes or identify the best version of a clip. Timebolt, an AI video editor, even has an “Umcheck” feature that helps cut out filler words, and a tool to cut recorded Zoom meetings into condensed, distilled explainers that make for great product walkthroughs and internal training videos. Voice over During the voice-over phase, there are a few ways to use AI tools: Generate a voice-over track from scratch using an AI voice. Generate foreign language voice overs using AI. Smooth out or edit voice overs — cut “ums”, dead air, etc. Think about your audience and region when choosing an AI-generated voice. Audio cleanup Adobe Podcast is an AI-powered podcast production platform that includes powerful AI speech enhancement features, making subpar audio clear as day — and it lets users edit audio by cutting and reordering transcript text. Music and sound beds Music composition can take a long time, even just to search for royalty-free sounds for quick product videos. With AI tools like Orb Producer Suite, you can create your own music or background sounds, or edit the sound throughout a video file for consistency. Color-grading Want to achieve the Wes Anderson color grading effect in your next video? Wes Anderson-style videos have cropped up across social media in a delightful way, showcasing creativity. Even brands like Paramount Pictures have jumped on the Wes Anderson trend. AI tools can now copy the color grading from images and apply them to video, and automatically adjust an entire file with a new style. Rotoscoping “Things like rotoscoping and inpainting, which took a lot of hours, computing power, and focus, are now possible in a browser with limited technical ability. We’re just seeing the beginnings of how workflows will be transformed,” shared Matthew Watkins, Creative Director at HubSpot. Logging and tagging Logging and tagging is one of the more technical aspects of video production. AI-powered content analysis tools like Google’s Video AI require the user to train the model, but then they can create custom tags and access rich analytics — then more quickly create highlight reels, clips, and more. Repurposing and distribution The power of video lies in its ability to spread far and wide and reach new audiences. Creating, editing, and finishing videos isn’t the end of the road, but the beginning of the distribution process. Let’s look at how AI can help get your video content in front of more folks. Transforming content between media formats Work smarter, not harder. Turn podcasts into videos, add summary videos along with written content, and create explainer videos for new product features. Cutting and resharing videos for different channels Take long-form video content and repurpose it for social media — create a few Reels, TikTok videos, or YouTube Shorts from every longer video. Think about where your audience lives online, though, and don’t just create new social video content because you can. Or, turn educational videos into courses and join clips together to create longer lessons, like Forecast Academy is doing. Creating trailers and short-form clips Video content performs extremely well — videos help increase traffic, drive leads, and drive better engagement. Cut quick clips, highlight reels and trailers from longer videos using Vimeo AI to use for short-form content like social media video ads, promotional assets for a big campaign, or even in your internal video communication strategy. Cathy McPhillips, from Marketing AI Institute, is using AI to turn webinars into short-form content for YouTube. She paired a few tools together to transcribe a webinar video, edit the video by cutting text using an AI tool, then automatically match the transcriptions to the video clips. “Using AI-powered tech for these projects saved me probably a good day’s worth of work,” she shared. How brands can strategically use AI tools for marketing video production AI video production tools are helping marketers make more brand-ready videos than they ever thought possible — and they’re only just getting started.

An AI video tool is software that uses artificial intelligence to assist in creating, editing, or refining video content. These tools use advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to automate complex tasks, improve efficiency, and improve the overall quality of video production. AI video generator capabilities often include automatic editing, scene detection, video summarization, special effects, and personalized content recommendations, making video production more accessible for users with varying levels of expertise. Benefits of using an AI Video tool for content creation According to a recent report, about 92% of video marketers think video content results in increased return on investment (ROI). AI video tools transform video production by facilitating faster turnaround times, reducing production costs, and increasing experimentation and innovation. Let’s explore the key benefits of AI video generators for content creators. 1. Increased efficiency AI automates repetitive tasks like editing out pauses and applying effects, reducing production time. Videos that once took days can be completed in hours or even minutes, allowing for faster content creation. 2. Effortless personalization AI can analyze data to tailor videos to individual viewers. Imagine educational content that adjusts difficulty based on a student’s progress or marketing campaigns with product recommendations specific to a customer’s browsing habits. Personalization allows deeper engagement and increases the impact of your message. 3. Accessibility for all AI video generators with user-friendly interfaces empower non-technical creators to produce high-quality videos. Pre-built templates and drag-and-drop functionality make video creation intuitive and accessible, democratizing the content creation process. 4. Global reach with localization AI can translate scripts and generate captions, breaking down language barriers and expanding your video’s reach to a worldwide audience. This allows you to cater to international markets and maximize the potential of your content. 5. Content experimentation at scale AI facilitates A/B testing of different video elements, enabling data-driven decisions about what resonates best with your audience. This allows you to experiment with various video parts, like introductions or calls to action, to optimize your content marketing for maximum engagement. Potential challenges of using AI video tools for content creation While AI video tools offer compelling benefits, it’s essential to understand the potential challenges of this evolving technology. Let’s discuss some key considerations when using AI video generators for content creation. 1. Ethical considerations and bias AI algorithms are trained on existing data, which can perpetuate societal biases. Be aware of potential biases in the AI’s output, such as gender or racial stereotypes, and actively mitigate them to ensure fair and inclusive content creation. 2. Copyright concerns AI tools that generate content based on existing data can raise copyright issues. Understand the legalities of using copyrighted material within your AI-generated videos and ensure proper attribution where necessary. Also, consider AI privacy and consider the ethical implications of using AI in your creations to avoid stepping into legal gray areas. 3. Creative control and nuance While AI excels at automation, capturing the human touch of storytelling and emotional resonance can be challenging. Nuances in humor, sarcasm, or cultural references may be missed by AI, requiring creators to carefully curate the creative direction and emotional tone of their videos. 4. Quality concerns AI-generated videos often struggle with maintaining consistency and realism, particularly in complex scenes or with nuanced human expressions. Additionally, AI systems are susceptible to hallucinations, fabricating details or producing false information. Key factors to consider when choosing an AI video tool A recent study shows that as many as 91% of consumers want to see more online video content from brands, To harness the full potential of AI for your video creation needs, here are some key factors to consider as you choose the right AI video tool for your business: 1.

Pay-per-use options: Are there options for occasional users who only need the tool for specific projects? Scalability: Can the tool handle your current and future video production needs as your business grows? 10 AI video tools to elevate your content creation AI video generators can significantly elevate your video production game from automating tedious tasks to crafting personalized content.

The stage is set, the cameras are rolling and AI is stealing the show in the world of video production. From transforming communication to redefining entertainment, it's no secret that technology pushes the boundaries of creativity and efficiency across various industries. Video production is no exception. With features like automated editing processes and groundbreaking visual effects, AI is changing the game in creating high-quality video content. As we dive further into how to use AI in filmmaking, prepare to be dazzled by the possibilities and innovations reshaping the editing process. Viewing AI through a cinematic lens AI is every filmmaker’s new best friend in the editing room, revolutionizing the process of bringing creative visions to life. Forget the days of slogging through endless editing tasks; with AI by your side, you'll be producing cinematic masterpieces in no time. AI in video production marks the fusion of advanced algorithms with the artistry of filmmaking, where technology seamlessly complements human creativity. So, how does it all work, anyway? AI algorithms dive headfirst into your video footage, analyze every frame with lightning speed and make editing decisions based on predefined parameters. It's like having a film-savvy robot assistant by your side, ensuring your editing process is efficient and allowing you to focus on your artistic insight. Here are some features you can use to revamp your video production process: 1. Scene detection AI swiftly identifies transitions between scenes in video footage, using advanced algorithms to distinguish changes in location, lighting and subject. With the help of AI, we’ve moved past manually scrubbing through endless footage – now, you can sit back and watch as your footage is magically sorted into neat, organized segments, ready for editing with just a click of a button. 2. Automatic trimming and cutting Whether it's a moment of shaky camera work or an accidental pause in dialogue, AI can seek out our human imperfections and get rid of them. Well, not all of them. But at least the ones that hinder the flow of video content! Meticulously sifting through each frame, AI can find and eliminate awkward pauses and other distractions, leading to a more polished final product. 3. Color correction Thanks to AI, every hour can be golden hour as filmmakers can effortlessly enhance the visual quality and customize the mood of videos through color correction. Analyzing factors such as color balance, saturation and lighting conditions, AI identifies areas where colors may appear dull or unbalanced and applies adjustments to achieve vibrant, lifelike tones. 4. Audio Editing An expert in noise reduction and audio leveling, AI can remove unwanted background noise as well as balance sound levels across different clips to maintain a consistent and clear listening experience. By studying the mood and tone of a video, AI can suggest an appropriate soundtrack or even curate the perfect musical accompaniment. 5. Motion tracking AI brings a new level of precision to video editing through its excellent motion-tracking abilities. Acting as a virtual cameraperson, AI follows the movement of objects or individuals within the frame. This enables the automated placement of graphics or effects and ensures that these elements stay synchronized with the action. Tools and platforms powered by AI We’ve established the range of capabilities offered by current AI, but the burning question remains: Where can I access these handy features? Filmmakers have a variety of options to choose from when it comes to utilizing AI in video production. While beta software might not be ready for commercial use just yet, powerhouses like Adobe are leading the charge with AI-powered features that streamline numerous aspects of the editing and production process. We’ve gathered a list of tools and platforms where you can tap into the potential of AI to revolutionize your video productions: Adobe Premiere Pro: Adobe's Sensei AI technology offers features like Auto Reframe, which automatically adjusts aspect ratios for different platforms, and Scene Edit Detection, which identifies cuts in edited footage. Final Cut Pro: Apple's software incorporates machine learning algorithms for tasks like audio cleanup, color grading and creating Smart Collections—a tool for organizing media based on content. Blackbird: This cloud-based video editing platform employs AI for rapid editing, allowing for real-time collaboration and quick turnaround times. OpenAI’s Sora: Newer to the scene, Sora is a text-to-video model that can generate high-quality videos up to a minute long based on the user’s prompt. Benefits and remaining uncertainties It’s clear AI changes the game in terms of saving time. Automating tedious video editing tasks, AI makes the entire video editing process more efficient. It’s also accessible, meaning individuals with varying levels of editing experience can use AI to create professional-quality videos without the need for extensive technical expertise. Equipped to handle large volumes of video content efficiently, AI editing tools are suited for large projects. However, some uncertainties regarding the technology continue to linger. Copyrighting is one of the primary concerns about the use of AI. Just like the transition from film to digital photography sparked debates, the rise of AI in video production has raised questions about ownership and creative control. It’s also important to note that AI isn’t always consistent, and any work edited with AI should still be reviewed and fine-tuned by human editors to ensure quality and accuracy. Ultimately, navigating AI-assisted video editing requires a careful balancing act between innovation and regulation. So, what’s next? As AI technology continues to advance, it will undoubtedly play a central role in shaping the future of the video production industry, transforming the way content is created, consumed and distributed. In just the past year, the strides made in AI have been nothing short of astounding, altering everything from automating editing processes to pioneering text-to-video prompting technology. As our creative ally, AI is driving us into a new era of video production, and we’re thrilled to see where it goes! Learning to use new AI tools and work through their quirks can be challenging.
