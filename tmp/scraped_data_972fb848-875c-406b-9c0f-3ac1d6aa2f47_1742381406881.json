In fact, AI video generators are now so capable that major brands are switching from old video production methods to these modern AI-powered ones. Even the Tribeca Film Festival and other players in the film industry are jumping aboard the AI movement, highlighting just how dynamic and impressive these tools are becoming. But if you're reading this and think it sounds like AI video generators are just for the creative pros, don't worry because that's not the case. With AI text-to-video, AI-generated avatars, and tons of other awesome new AI video features, literally anyone can create unbelievably high-quality content. I made this anime trailer, and I think it’s pretty cool. The pictures, animation, and even the song were all generated by AI. Let me break down the process and tell you how it was done 👇 pic.twitter.com/Y117zidiei — Framer 🇱🇹 (@0xFramer) August 22, 2024 But with so many options flooding the market, it can be tough to figure out which tool is the right fit for you. Each promises to be the best, but how do you know which will deliver on that promise and actually be the best AI video generator? We made this guide to help you navigate the crowded field and find the tool that suits your needs. We've carefully selected and reviewed seven top contenders, focusing on what they offer, where they excel, and where they might fall short. So, if you've ever wondered, \"What is the best AI video generator?\" you're in the right place. What is an AI video generator? In the simplest of terms, an AI video generator is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to automate the video creation process. Instead of manually editing clips, adding effects, and syncing audio, these tools handle the heavy lifting for you. You just input text, images, or other media, and AI turns that into a complete video through text to video generation. By using AI, these tools automatically select the best visuals, create smooth transitions, and even generate voiceovers with realistic AI avatars. This means you can focus more on crafting your message and less on getting bogged down in the technical details. How do AI video generators work? AI video generators work by using advanced algorithms to analyze and process your input, whether it’s text, images, or other media. When you provide the content, the AI interprets it and makes decisions about how to structure the video. This includes selecting visuals, syncing audio, and applying effects—all in a matter of minutes. ✨ From Photo AI image to video with @LumaLabsAI's video model that came out today called Dream Machine It's absolutely state of the art and the best video model available right now I think It's able to highly accurately predict 3d surroundings from just a photo, I think up… pic.twitter.com/KDetDBdGIS — @levelsio (@levelsio) June 13, 2024 At the core of these tools is machine learning, which allows the AI to improve over time. The more data it processes, the better it becomes at making creative decisions that result in high-quality videos. For example, if you input a script, the AI video tool can generate corresponding scenes, choose relevant images or video clips, and even create a voiceover. The process is surprisingly intuitive. You simply provide the material, and the AI organizes it into a cohesive video that aligns with your vision.

Add to that the ability to export videos in multiple formats, and you’ve got a powerful tool for turning ideas into polished videos – fast. Whether you're experimenting with the free plan or scaling up with Team and Enterprise options, the flexibility here ensures there’s something for everyone. Where AI Studios could improve We love the power and usability of this tool, but since they are relatively new to the space, they could benefit from more brand recognition. Once more people are familiar with this tool and how it can help with creative workflow, we are confident it will be a go-to product for designers and creatives of all stripes. Pricing options: Free plan ($0.00) Personal ($24.00/month) Team ($55.00/month) Enterprise (Custom) 2. Luma Dream Machine Dream Machine by Luma Labs is a video creation tool that uses AI to generate extremely lifelike videos. You can quickly turn your images or text prompts into professional-looking clips. The process of creating a video takes just a couple of minutes. Each video is about five seconds long and can include multiple shots, making them richer and more detailed than many competitors’ outputs. During my tests, some videos were ready quickly, while others took longer, but all captured motion better than any other tool I’ve tried. Whether you're crafting an epic scene or a visually intense moment, Dream Machine captures the essence of storytelling with visuals that feel straight out of Hollywood. Created product mockup videos with Luma Dream Machine V1.5 text-to-video model, and I’m really happy with the results. You can find the prompts in the thread, and you can use the same ones with Midjourney or Flux.#LumaDreamMachine pic.twitter.com/VISWZK8TEp — Gizem Akdag (@gizakdag) August 21, 2024 Why we like Dream Machine: Most cinematic If you're a creator with a flair for the cinematic, you're going to love making videos with Dream Machine. What really stands out is that you don't need precise details for motion areas, Dream Machine still manages to capture motion concepts effectively. Itfollows the laws of physics, ensuring that every shot feels grounded and realistic. Plus, it’s super fast! As their website mentions, Dream Machine can currently produce 120 frames in 120 seconds, which is not too shabby to say the least. Where Dream Machine could improve Although Dream Machine is generally fast, some users have experienced slower processing times when working on intricate projects with a lot of elements. The discard rate can be around 98% with Reddit users pointing that most of the videos generated are unusable because of random elements, incorrect motion, or distortion. Pricing options: Free Plan ($0.00) Lite Plan ($7.99/month) Standard Plan ($23.99/month) Plus Plan ($51.99/month) Pro Plan ($79.99/month) 3. Runway Gen-3 Alpha Runway calls their latest model, Gen-3 Alpha, the new frontier for video generation, and we are here to say that they could definitely be right. The Gen-3 Alpha supports text to video, image to video, advanced camera control, multi motion brush, and after testing some of these features out, we were seriously impressed by how smooth and sharp the results are. The video creation workflow feels super streamlined, thanks to the improved fidelity and motion—it’s clear this model was built for powerful things. Add expressiveness and intention to your generations with Multi Motion Brush. Learn how with today's Runway Academy: https://t.co/EUbxc4aA0D pic.twitter.com/qredD7vsXu — Runway (@runwayml) January 23, 2024 Why we like Runway: Most dynamic Runway's Gen-3 Alpha is one of the most impressive AI video generators we’ve come across. Not only is it a powerful tool for video that makes content creation seem limitless, but it has a shockingly friendly interface and is easy to use. With the Multi Motion Brush, you can select up to five areas with independent motion and control across 3 directional axis (x, y, z) for more precise and expressive generations. Another highlight is how well it handles human-like characters. The AI generates lifelike figures with natural expressions and gestures, adding a level of realism that’s hard to beat. We aren't exaggerating when we say you'll likely be blown away by what you generate with this tool. The videos are truly cinematic and offer an exciting glimpse into the future of creativity. Where Runway could improve Runway is an extraordinary tool, so it is hard to say where it can improve. Of course, with such a dynamic AI video generator comes cost, which might be the only thing holding back casual users or if you're on a budget. Plus, it is true that sometimes the final results might look a little \"wonky,\" but overall the quality is top-tier. Pricing options: Basic Plan ($0 per editor per month) Standard Plan ($12 per user per month, billed annually as $144) Pro Plan ($28 per user per month, billed annually as $336) Unlimited Plan ($76 per user per month, billed annually as $912) Enterprise Plan (Customized with Runway team) 4. Hailuo AI Hailuo AI is an AI-powered video generator designed to make content creation simple but still extraordinary. Whether you’re making cinematic videos for marketing, detailedproduct explainers, or social media ads, this tool automates the heavy lifting—giving you professional-looking results in minutes. Instead of spending hours fine-tuning every frame, creators can focus on storytelling while the AI ensures smooth motion, clean edits, and stunning visuals. #Hailuo AI is absolutely insane for creating Hollywood-style blockbuster scenes! 🎬🔥 Every test is a thrill pic.twitter.com/idaAJWb2BZ — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) March 6, 2025 Why we like Hailuo AI: Fast yet eye-popping For businesses and content creators who need speed, flexibility, and truly remarkable videos, Hailuo AI delivers. One of the standout features is its customizable templates, which allow users to tweak layouts, colors, and visual styles without advanced editing skills. So regardless of what kind of content you ar making, whether it's onboarding video or a marketing campaign, Hailuo AI makes sure your content looks tailored, not cookie-cutter. Where Hailuo AI Could Improve While the AI does a great job with automation, some users may find the customization options a bit limited. For example, while templates are helpful, they don’t always allow for fine-grained control over pacing and scene composition. Additionally, industries needing highly specific branding—like film production or high-end advertising—might need more flexibility in motion effects and camera angles. Pricing options: Standard plan ($14.90 per month) Unlimited plan ($94.90 per month) 5. Kling AI The Kling AI video generator produces highly realistic 1080p videos up to two minutes long, all from a single prompt. The key difference? It doesn’t just generate good-looking footage—it ensures movements and physics behave naturally, making everything feel more lifelike. Have an Amazing Day!☀️🙂☕️ Name: Flower Care Made with @Kling_ai 1.6 Text to Video#AIart Good Monday #MondayMotivation #Mondayvibes pic.twitter.com/MEvNj9HVrw — Jay Kay (@JayKay65220066) March 10, 2025 Why we like Kling AI: Smooth, natural motion What sets Kling apart is how well it captures human motion and expression. Thanks to its 3D face and body reconstruction technology, characters move fluidly and show natural emotions—all from a single image. Its physics engine also shines, allowing for believable object interactions and environments that behave like real-world scenes. Whether you're creating short films, virtual influencers, or AI-generated marketing content, Kling delivers a level of realism that’s hard to match. Where Kling AI could improve While Kling is impressive, it’s not perfect. Some users report slow processing times, especially for highly detailed scenes. Occasionally, minor inconsistencies appear, like hand distortions or subtle motion glitches. More control over camera angles and fine-tuning details would make it even stronger for professional creators. Pricing options: Basic (free) Standard ($72.90 yearly) Pro ($293.04 yearly) Premier ($728.64 yearly) 6. revid AI This tool might be new on the scene, but for improving video productivity for socials, revid is quickly becoming one of our favorites. Their mission is all about helping creators like you make short videos that have a potential to go viral. Why we like revid AI: Best for social media What we like most about revid AI is that it has a specific focus. The AI does the heavy lifting from finding ideas, adding sound effects, creating scripts, and then transforming everything into viral videos for your social media content. It’s a company that knows its lane, and we can certainly appreciate its dedication to being the master of one instead of the jack of all AI video trades. Where revid AI could improve The main drawback with revid AI is that it is niche. This is fine if you need this specific type of content, but it may be lacking if you're searching for a more powerful tool. Pricing options Hobby ($49/month) Growth (Launch offer $49/month) Ultra ($199/month) 7. Colossyan Whether you're making screen recordings for employee training, video marketing content for social media platforms, or educational videos for compliance training, Colossyan offers features that simplify video making for established businesses. Why we like Colossyan: Best for large businesses Colossyan is awesome with AI video editing, offering tools like prompt to video and AI script assistants that help you create excellent videos without needing tons of experience. While it is definitely on the more corporate side of video creation, we saw this tool streamline the creation process and make it easy to produce high-quality generated videos super fast and efficiently. Plus, Colossyan’s extensive library of AI avatars and multilingual support make it a nice choice for large companies and diverse clients. Where Colossyan could improve While Colossyan has a ton of cool features, it may require a bit of a learning curve for those new to AI video tools. The sheer number of options, from AI avatars to multiple export formats, can be overwhelming for beginners. Pricing options Starter Plan ($19/month, annually) Pro Plan ($61/month, billed annually) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 8. HeyGen HeyGen is one of the more impressive platforms we tested. A big reason for this is because it is hassle-free and easy to use, so jumping in was a simple process. More specifically, HeyGen is one of the best when it comes to generating AI avatars. The process of creating a HeyGen avatar boils down to three steps: choosing or creating an avatar, recording or choosing a voice to go with it, selecting a video template, then letting HeyGen put it all together in a matter of minutes. Why we like HeyGen: Most intriguing video generator One of the coolest features of HeyGen is its AI avatars, which are constantly evolving. The platform frequently updates these avatars to include enhanced visual details, expanded speech abilities, and more lifelike animations. Another great feature is the change videos to multiple langauges. HeyGen allows you to create videos in over forty languages from your original video, letting you reach audiences from all parts of the world. Where HeyGen could improve While HeyGen offers a lot of flexibility, the pricing for the Team plan might be higher for smaller teams or individual creators. Additionally, the Free plan, although great for beginners, limits users to just 3 videos per month, which may not be enough for those who need to produce content regularly. Pricing options Free Plan ($0) Creator Plan ($24/mo) Team Plan ($69/seat/mo) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 9. Haiper AI After diving into Haiper AI, we quickly realized it’s a promising tool for anyone looking to explore the world of AI-driven video creation. One of the first things that stood out to us is how Haiper AI makes the video creation process both accessible and efficient, even for those just starting. With just 3 images, @escelce transported us through 3 different universes, holy cow! #KeyframeConditioning #AIvideo #MadeWithHaiper https://t.co/6FwlLObhIK pic.twitter.com/JZdJOq3QMb — Haiper AI (@HaiperGenAI) August 19, 2024 Why we like Haiper AI: Best for beginners What we appreciated most about Haiper AI is its flexibility and how user friendly it was. The platform allows for up to 10 creations per day on the Free plan, which is generous for a no-cost option. That, on top of the text-to-speech feature helps make Haiper a solid tool. For those who need more, the Explorer and Pro plans offer expanded features that cater to different levels of use. Where Haiper AI could improve One of the primary limitations is that the Free plan doesn’t allow for commercial use or watermark-free videos. This might be a dealbreaker for users who need to produce content for business purposes but aren’t ready to invest in a paid plan. Pricing options Free Plan (Beta, $0/month): Explorer Plan (Beta, $8/month, billed yearly) Pro Plan (Beta, $24/month, billed yearly) Enterprise APIs (Custom Pricing) ‍ 10. Synthesia Synthesia is a game-changer for simplifying the process of making (sometimes scarily) realistic AI avatars. With simple text-based prompts, Synthesia turns your script into a polished, video ready project featuring life-like avatars. Why we like Synthesia: Excellent for avatars Even if you're new to video Synthesia has an intuitive interface that makes creating and editing your video feel straightforward. You simply choose an avatar, input your text prompts, and watch as the AI works its magic, transforming your words into engaging content.

So whether it is explainer videos, content creation for blog posts, or other marketing projects, Synthesia is excellent for businesses who want to make videos for their products or services. Where Synthesia could improve One of the main limitations is the degree of control available for the AI avatars. The avatars do look polished, but the options for appearance and expressions are somewhat limited compared to more advanced tools. Pricing Options Free Plan (€0/mo) Starter Plan (€20/mo) Creator Plan (€59/mo) Enterprise Plan (custom pricing) ‍ ‍ Wrapping up: The future of AI Video Tools AI in video and avatar creation has come a long way.

An AI video tool is software that uses artificial intelligence to assist in creating, editing, or refining video content. These tools use advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to automate complex tasks, improve efficiency, and improve the overall quality of video production. AI video generator capabilities often include automatic editing, scene detection, video summarization, special effects, and personalized content recommendations, making video production more accessible for users with varying levels of expertise. Benefits of using an AI Video tool for content creation According to a recent report, about 92% of video marketers think video content results in increased return on investment (ROI). AI video tools transform video production by facilitating faster turnaround times, reducing production costs, and increasing experimentation and innovation. Let’s explore the key benefits of AI video generators for content creators. 1. Increased efficiency AI automates repetitive tasks like editing out pauses and applying effects, reducing production time. Videos that once took days can be completed in hours or even minutes, allowing for faster content creation. 2. Effortless personalization AI can analyze data to tailor videos to individual viewers. Imagine educational content that adjusts difficulty based on a student’s progress or marketing campaigns with product recommendations specific to a customer’s browsing habits. Personalization allows deeper engagement and increases the impact of your message. 3. Accessibility for all AI video generators with user-friendly interfaces empower non-technical creators to produce high-quality videos. Pre-built templates and drag-and-drop functionality make video creation intuitive and accessible, democratizing the content creation process. 4. Global reach with localization AI can translate scripts and generate captions, breaking down language barriers and expanding your video’s reach to a worldwide audience. This allows you to cater to international markets and maximize the potential of your content. 5. Content experimentation at scale AI facilitates A/B testing of different video elements, enabling data-driven decisions about what resonates best with your audience. This allows you to experiment with various video parts, like introductions or calls to action, to optimize your content marketing for maximum engagement. Potential challenges of using AI video tools for content creation While AI video tools offer compelling benefits, it’s essential to understand the potential challenges of this evolving technology. Let’s discuss some key considerations when using AI video generators for content creation. 1. Ethical considerations and bias AI algorithms are trained on existing data, which can perpetuate societal biases. Be aware of potential biases in the AI’s output, such as gender or racial stereotypes, and actively mitigate them to ensure fair and inclusive content creation. 2. Copyright concerns AI tools that generate content based on existing data can raise copyright issues. Understand the legalities of using copyrighted material within your AI-generated videos and ensure proper attribution where necessary. Also, consider AI privacy and consider the ethical implications of using AI in your creations to avoid stepping into legal gray areas. 3. Creative control and nuance While AI excels at automation, capturing the human touch of storytelling and emotional resonance can be challenging. Nuances in humor, sarcasm, or cultural references may be missed by AI, requiring creators to carefully curate the creative direction and emotional tone of their videos. 4. Quality concerns AI-generated videos often struggle with maintaining consistency and realism, particularly in complex scenes or with nuanced human expressions. Additionally, AI systems are susceptible to hallucinations, fabricating details or producing false information. Key factors to consider when choosing an AI video tool A recent study shows that as many as 91% of consumers want to see more online video content from brands, To harness the full potential of AI for your video creation needs, here are some key factors to consider as you choose the right AI video tool for your business: 1. Functionality and your business goals AI has made it possible to generate professional-looking videos from scratch. Here are some key functionalities to consider: Text-to-video: This feature allows you to create videos based on a written script or storyboard. The AI engine analyzes the text and generates visuals, music, and even narration, saving you significant time and resources. Consider the level of detail and creative control offered by the text-to-video functionality. Multimodal AI: Does the tool leverage multiple forms of generative AI, such as speech recognition and natural language processing, to improve your video creation process? Multimodal AI can automate tasks like generating captions, translating languages, and optimizing audio for different platforms. Hyper-personalization: This feature allows you to tailor your video content to specific audiences. Can the AI tool personalize visuals, narration, or music based on viewer demographics or preferences? 2. User interface and ease of use Even with powerful AI capabilities, a complex user interface can hinder productivity. Evaluate the tool’s ease of use. Consider factors like: Learning curve: How quickly can you become comfortable using the tool’s core functionalities? Intuitive interface: Is the interface clear, well-organized, and easy to navigate? Drag-and-drop functionality: Does the tool allow intuitive video editing through drag-and-drop actions? Template options: Does the tool offer pre-built templates to jumpstart the creation process, especially for beginners? Collaboration features: Can you easily collaborate with team members on video projects within the tool? 3. Output quality and control The quality of the final video is crucial. Assess the tool’s ability to generate: High-resolution visuals: Does the AI produce crisp, clear video outputs that meet your professional standards? Natural-sounding audio: For narrated videos, is the AI-generated narration clear, and engaging? Or is it artificial and robotic-sounding? Customization options: Does the tool allow you to refine the AI-generated content to your liking? Can you adjust video styles, music choices, or voiceovers? 4. Pricing and scalability AI video generators come with a variety of pricing models. Consider: Subscription plans: Do they offer tiered plans catering to different needs and budgets? Pay-per-use options: Are there options for occasional users who only need the tool for specific projects? Scalability: Can the tool handle your current and future video production needs as your business grows? 10 AI video tools to elevate your content creation AI video generators can significantly elevate your video production game from automating tedious tasks to crafting personalized content.

Make a Video Updated: 12/10/24 Published: 06/16/23 Videos are integral to any marketing campaign; however, they can be tedious and difficult to create if you aren’t savvy with editing or are short on time. Fortunately, you can leverage many AI video generators to streamline your production and create content that engages your audience. But what’s the best AI video generator for your tasks? This article will explore 12 different AI video generators, their features, and how you can best use them in your next video marketing campaign. Time to press play on easier video creation. Table of Contents Can AI make videos? How to Make AI Videos Transforming Text to Video With AI What makes a great AI video generator? Best AI Video Generators Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video Can AI make videos? Yes, AI can make videos. AI video generators can instantly produce basic presentation slides with text, B-roll, and background music, all the way up to advanced videos of lifelike AI avatars “speaking” to you. AI’s impressive — but it’s not perfect. What works well with AI video generators: Video scripts. Being able to generate video scripts in a few seconds is incredible and saves so much time. Stock imagery, B-roll, and background music. Even though it still requires editing, having multimedia pulled automatically for you by the video generator makes it feel like you have an assistant. Video editing. The video editing capabilities are incredible and often beginner-friendly, which is a huge leap in the video editing world. What isn’t working (yet): Believability. The realistic AI avatars are incredibly advanced, but the mannerisms and articulation make it obvious that they're, well, AI. Pacing. Much research has been done on how quickly a video moves from scene to scene to hold viewers’ attention, and I found that not all generators factored this into their algorithms. Decision overload. The number of video templates, AI avatars, and effects available can overwhelm the editing process. AI is rapidly advancing, and some of these quirks will soon be passé. How to Make AI Videos The process for making an AI video will vary depending on the tool or platform you're using. Some generators work by analyzing and creating a video based on the script you uploaded, while others will follow a prompt typed in by the user. The key is to find a tool or generator with the features you need to create the kind of content you want. Transforming Text to Video With AI When ChatGPT catapulted to popularity in 2022, I don’t think the average marketers knew just how quickly AI video would follow. It needs to be used ethically to be useful to society, but when leveraged correctly, it’s an incredible tool. The most sought-after AI video feature is the text-to-video generator. This allows you to type in a sentence and, in a few seconds, be presented with an editable AI-generated video. I tested this feature using two different prompts: A vague prompt: “I’d like to educate viewers about AI-generated video.” A specific prompt: “I’d like to inspire beginner marketers to try AI video generation. The video should explain the benefits of AI video generators and should inspire viewers to try this new video tool.” I used HubSpot’s free AI video generator Clip Creator, and here’s what I saw. They were both high-quality videos. Both videos had appropriate stock images and music tailored to human behavior. The content was very similar for both videos. After testing many AI generators, I’ve found that a marketer’s time is better spent editing rather than making their prompt more specific. No matter how perfect your prompt feels, the end result will still require edits.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now What makes a great AI video generator? So, how does one evaluate all of the different software on the market? The best AI video tools all have a mix of these different features. Intuitive User Interface While most platforms list a long list of fancy AI features, users need an easy-to-use AI studio first and foremost. This enables a quick editing process. AI Scripts Automatically-generated video scripts save an incredible amount of time when producing video content. They turn written content (such as a blog post, email, etc.) or a prompt into spoken language. Sometimes, they even use an AI narrator to read it out loud for you. Not all software can generate video scripts, but it’s an enormous time saver. To be fair to the software that doesn’t offer this, it’s replaceable with a few clicks in ChatGPT. After trying more than a dozen AI video generators, I found the AI scripts were one of the features that made the greatest difference, along with the next feature. Factoring in Human Behavior Some software have tailored their AI to match user behavior, and some haven’t. For example, most people prefer videos with a brisk pace and visuals that don’t stay on the screen too long. In the video world, this is referred to as “pacing.” Not all software is tailored for this, and as a result, it will produce slow, lengthy slides that feel like a bad PowerPoint presentation. This isn’t a detail that software companies list on their “features” page, but it’s something that’s apparent based on the first draft of the video that the software gives you. Template Library Start from scratch? What is it, 2018? There’s no need to start from scratch with video anymore, as most platforms have built-in template libraries. Bonus points if these libraries include variation in: Intended audience. Aspect ratio. Project type. Editing Capabilities It’s normal for different software to offer different editing options, but most AI studios will cover the basics, such as: Text. Fonts. Music. Colors. Timing. Transitions. Animations. Stock footage. Different video styles. Pricing Tiers (or Free Plan) An AI video generator costs $0 to $50 a month (paid annually). All paid software includes a discount when purchasing an annual package, and the cost of month-to-month service is always higher. I know you’re on a budget — all of the suggested AI tools below are either free or include a free trial/demo. Multilingual Look for software that supports multiple languages if your business requires it. A chart comparing 11 AI Video Generators Chart comparing AI video generators Best AI Video Generators AI video generators have come extremely far in a short time. You can now make professional videos with the numerous text-to-video generation tools on the market. I’ve tried all the most popular AI video generators, so you don’t have to. Here’s what I found. 1. Clip Creator Source Clip Creator is the best AI video generator for beginners. It can be used by someone with no video experience and walks you through the video creation process painlessly. You start by answering a few basic questions (like video type), then provide a brief overview of the video you’d like to create. You can choose from video templates, which are oriented for both landscape videos and vertical videos. Then, Clip Creator uses AI to generate the text on your slides, plus the background imagery. You’re instantly given a video with editable text, stock images, background music, etc. The video creation workflow is very intuitive. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video My experience: I love how streamlined this AI video creator is. Instead of bombarding you with endless features, options, and pop-ups, Clip Creator starts simple and allows you to make any edits you need after it generates the video. Source Pros: Incredibly intuitive user interface, great customization options, and makes for a very fast and efficient AI video creator. Cons: Smaller template library than paid AI video generators, and no advanced features like realistic AI avatars. Best for: Video creation beginners and marketers on a budget. Most user-friendly interface and best free AI video generator. 2. Pictory Source Pictory is an excellent AI video generator for creators and marketers who don’t have experience creating videos. All you have to do is provide a script or article to guide your video content. For example, you can submit a blog post to the AI video creator, and Pictory will create a video based on the post that can be used for social media or your website. Furthermore, you can edit videos in minutes by using text. Pictory also includes a feature that creates shareable video highlight reels that can be used as a trailer or a short-form video for social media such as a Reel. Even better, Pictory can automatically caption and summarize your videos.

Marketing AI Tools Practical Tips Trends and Statistics And More! Get Your Free Report Learn more Get Your Free Report Download Free All fields are required. You're all set! Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: I provided the same prompt for Pictory as I did for the Clip Creator video, and it initially generated much less content (only 1 slide). I went back and instead provided a URL of a blog post and tested the blog-to-video generator. This feature automatically creates video scripts based on a blog post, and using their realistic AI voices, I could have it automatically narrated too. The writing on every slide needed to be edited significantly to be useful, but I was impressed with the options. Pictory supports multiple languages (currently English, Spanish, French, and German) and has a huge library of AI voices. Source Prices for Pictory start at $19 per month, and users can try a 2-week free trial. Pros: Users have a lot of options for how to begin their AI-generated videos, and they can thoroughly customize the video output. Cons: The first draft of the automatically-generated videos needs heavy editing. It may be faster to let ChatGPT write a script for you and use that. Best for: Marketers and creators with limited video editing experience who want to convert content like blog posts or webinars into shareable video content. 3. Simplified Source The Simplified AI video generator transforms a long-form video into multiple AI-enhanced clips with just one click. This allows users to create videos from text and make an entirely new video using its accessible editing interface. Simplified simplifies the way we produce content by providing users with easy access to an expansive in-app library that hosts thousands of templates, all available for free. I like that it guarantees exceptional video quality and pairs this with an intuitive, user-friendly interface, ensuring that users can craft high-quality videos without sacrificing ease of use. Its comprehensive suite of features goes beyond basic editing options to include animation enhancements and multilingual translation capabilities, making it a versatile all-in-one tool for video creation. Users can save their brand settings in Simplified’s “brand book” is a great time-saving feature. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just starting, this platform equips you with everything you need to bring your vision to life. Brands like Bloomberg, DuckDuckGo, and Cashify use Simplified for their marketing needs. My experience: I prompted Simplified the same way I prompted the other video generators, and I was immediately asked to describe my target audience and provide my video topic. This was a nice step toward more personalized videos, but it required more user-generated input than Clip Creator, which had a multiple-choice intake process. If you stick to the free plan, it’s time-consuming to sift through all the features to see what’s free to use. Source Prices for Simplified include a forever-free plan. Paid plans start from $15.20 a month and are billed annually. Pros: If you pay for this AI video creator, you have many creation options at your disposal that not all other platforms offer (AI meme creation, AI image generation, AI carousel maker, etc.). Cons: Not the best free AI video generator; other platforms are more generous with their features. You’re not able to test the text-to-video generator without joining a paid plan, as you’re about to do with other features. Best for: Creators who want to create, edit, and schedule videos for all social media platforms. 4. Movavi Video Editor Source Rather than generating AI videos from scratch, the Movavi Video Editor uses AI to make video editing easier. Video editing can be a time-consuming chore; for many, it’s the less enjoyable side of content creation. However, with Movavi Video Editor’s nonlinear AI technique, you’re not just replicating traditional tool functions but also enhancing your videos through advanced AI video editing. With AI background removal, you can cut out and replace backgrounds, adding a new dimension to your visuals. Plus, the AI noise removal feature enhances audio quality by automatically eliminating unwanted sounds, ensuring your videos are of the highest standard. Source The app also offers a host of advanced options like PiP, chroma-key, titles, keyframing, motion tracking, and more. Following the free 7-day trial, paid plans start at $49.95 per year. Pros: The presence of built-in training rapidly familiarizes you with the software, and it has features that many other AI video editors don’t. Cons: This AI video editor brings high-level tools (like color correction) to marketers, but total video newbies may be overwhelmed with some of the more advanced features. Best for: Creators and marketers who already have video footage and want help editing videos to be more engaging (or who just need to speed up the editing process). 5. Fotor AI Video Generator Source Fotor is an image and video editing platform that integrates various AI features, known for its creativity, intelligence, flexibility, and convenience. Its AI video generator fully utilizes advancements in AI technology, making video creation more efficient and enjoyable.

My experience: Fotor’s interface is very user-friendly and simple. you can quickly find the features you need without any distracting ads or clutter. It also provides detailed step-by-step instructions, making it easy for new creators to get started. While creating videos, its preset text descriptions and high-quality images inspired me creatively. They also saved me time and greatly boosted my production efficiency. Source What I found most convenient was that after generating a video, I could perform basic edits directly in Fotor and I could also use their rich AI video tools, like one-click enhancement and beautification, background removal, and object elimination. Pros: The AI video generator supports creating videos in various styles, including Photography, Cinematic, Digital Art, Anime, Neopunk, Game Art, Illustration Art, and more. Catering to various creative ideas and needs. Cons: AI may not always fully understand textual descriptions or emotions and feelings, so some videos may not appear as realistic. Best for: Professional video creators, video creation beginners, social media video influencers, and users who enjoy trying and testing trendy and interesting features. 6. AI Studio Source With AI Studio, users can create videos by uploading their script and using the text-to-speech feature. The platform will then generate a video in five minutes or less. You can manually type in the script or copy and paste it into the platform. From there, you just need to select the appropriate language and AI model and finish editing. AI Studio allows users to select a custom-made avatar that suits their brand.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: New users can input a 300-character script, and an AI avatar will read your script using the AI text-to-video generator. I found the AI models to be less convincing than others; the mouths sometimes moved between sentences, and I think all viewers could identify these as AI. However, since the advent of TikTok’s text-to-speech narration feature, the public has become more accustomed to artificial narration, and there are many situations where this type of AI would work well. Source Prices for AI Studio start at $30 per month. Pros: The platform’s intuitive features make it excellent for beginners with limited or no video creation experience. Cons: The AI Studio avatars are identifiable as being artificial. Best for: Marketing videos that need text-to-speech narration and have visuals for B-roll. 7. Veed.io Source With Veed.io, you can use custom text, colors, font, and music to create a unique video for your brand. One of its standout features is Auto Transcribe. You can upload your video, hit the Auto Transcribe button, and immediately download the script. Even better, there is no software to download, and the platform is easy to use for those without video editing experience. My experience: I entered my “Pinterest marketing for beginners” prompt, and Veed.io quickly generated a short vertical video. The AI video generator automatically provided the script, AI narration, background music, stock videos, and close captioning. The on-screen captions were really engaging, using color-changing text and emojis — perfect for social media. Source Veed.io is free to use for videos under 10 minutes. To access more features, prices start at $18 per month (when billed annually) and go all the way up to enterprise custom pricing. Pros: The pacing, on-screen captions, slang, and approach were very engaging. Cons: The stock video that was automatically inserted into the video was off-topic at times but can be easily edited. Best for: Short-form videos designed to hold attention on social media. 8. Synthesia Source Synthesia's AI video generator enables users to create professional videos without requiring cameras, actors, or studios. Users can generate videos featuring realistic AI avatars that deliver content in over 140 languages by simply inputting text. This makes it an ideal tool for efficiently and at scale creating training materials, sales and marketing content, and internal communications. My experience: Synthesia's intuitive interface and extensive customization options make video creation straightforward. The platform's diverse range of avatars and multilingual support allowed me to produce engaging content tailored to a global audience. The quality of the AI-generated avatars is impressive, closely mimicking human expressions and speech patterns. Synthesia offers a free plan that includes 3 minutes of video per month, 9 AI avatars, and access to AI voices in 140+ languages. Paid plans are available for users requiring more features. Pros: Synthesia simplifies video creation with its intuitive interface and realistic AI avatars. Its support for over 140 languages makes it an excellent tool for creating global content. Cons: The free plan has limited features and is suitable only for basic use. Best for: Businesses and individuals seeking to create professional training videos, marketing content, or internal communications featuring AI avatars, especially when targeting a multilingual audience. 9. Elai.io Source Elai is simple and requires no video editing skills. To use Elai, copy and paste a blog post URL or HTML text, choose a template from its library, and let the generator do the rest. This AI video maker is specialized in corporate learning. Once the video is complete, review it to make any changes before rendering and downloading it. My experience: I found that Elai's format is unique. Even though the AI avatar doesn’t pass as a real human, its small display size makes it feel less distracting. The avatar compliments these videos instead of dominating them. I also really like the audio options: you can upload an audio file of you speaking, and Elai will generate a realistic AI avatar to narrate the text. Source Elai has over 60 languages and 25 avatars to choose from. You can use Elai for free with a 1-minute credit. For more features, Elai’s plans start at $23 per month (billed annually). Pros: As a specialized AI video generator, this tool allows you to quickly create training videos for new hires or product onboarding videos. Cons: Being a platform specialized for educational videos, it would be more time-consuming to create general marketing videos. Best for: Generating videos at scale and creating training videos and product videos. 10. Colossyan Source Colossyan provides a diverse range of avatars who can recite your script in various languages. You can also customize your avatar’s outfit. Colossyan’s key features are auto translations, subtitles, and the ability to enhance messages via screen recording. My experience: The AI avatar options from Colossyan are advanced. You can add multiple AI avatars to a single video screen in the video creation workflow, starting a “conversation.” You can even customize the pauses between speakers. Source There’s a free trial, and the prices start at $19 per month (when billed annually). Pros: The advanced avatar options make this a highly customizable AI video generator. Cons: The sound of the AI narrators isn’t the most natural-sounding. Best for: Creating training videos and explainers for workplace learning. 11. FlexClip Source This AI video generator features hundreds of video templates, AI-generated subtitles, background remover, and a text-to-speech engine. And its intuitive interface makes it simple for creators at any skill level. My experience: I created my video by inputting a URL and letting FlexClip automatically pull content from my website. The AI generator took an enormous amount of work out of the video creation process, but still required editing. The pacing of the video was slower than other AI tools, but I was able to easily customize all elements of the video. Source After the free plan, pricing starts at $9.99 per month (when billed annually, which saves 50%). Pros: The basic plan's price point makes this a very budget-friendly AI video generator. It is also a great, straightforward option for beginners who don’t want to feel overwhelmed. Cons: The AI-generated first draft requires more editing than some of the other platforms. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. 12. Wave Video Source Wave Video is a popular choice among content creators thanks to its many tools, which include image and video assets, text overlay effects, audio, and captions. The platform also provides a variety of video formats for Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and website-based applications. Other key features are: Text-to-video AI. Video hosting. Voiceovers. Text-to-speech. Millions of stock assets. My experience: I tested Wave Video by inserting a blog post URL and letting the AI video generator populate text and graphics based on the content. The video background graphics, pacing, and text populated on the slides needed significant editing to be ready for viewers. I like how easy it is to change the video format and edit any of the content. Wave Video also has many live-stream video tools. Source Wave Video is free, with monthly plans starting at $16 (paid annually). Pros: The features of this software are very beginner-friendly, and the user interface doesn’t feel overwhelming. Cons: The stock images it pulled were lower quality than the other AI tools. The images were blurry and stayed on screen much too long before switching slides (video pacing needed editing). Best for: Livestream videos. Making the Most of AI Video How will AI-generated video help your brand? With just a few clicks, you can create amazing videos, which was unimaginable a few years ago.

Text-to-Video Content Generation Many users do not have coding experience or the time to learn the finer details of video software. That’s why many AI video generation tools include text-to-video content generation capabilities, allowing users to easily turn their scripts or other written text into video content that may include human-looking AI avatars, AI voices, and other elements that create a professional-looking and sounding video. Vocal and Audio Synthesis With an AI video tool, AI speech and audio synthesis make it so any number of videos can be made without a human actor or voice. These platforms take text or rough-spoken recordings and transform them into video-ready voices that are synthetically generated. These voices should be available in a variety of languages and, in most cases, users are able to adjust the tone, pitch, accent, and other elements of speech to make the voice sound more believable. Video Templates A number of AI tools now give users a baseline video template from which to build their video content. These templates may focus on specific industry use cases, a certain social media or digital platform, or a video format with animation or transitional elements. Users can often customize these templates and add their own branding, but the video template gives them the creative ideas and basic design to get started. AI Avatars Many businesses do not have the budgets to pay actors or employees to act as talking heads for brand videos, but they nonetheless want the personal touch of an onscreen personality. AI avatars can be developed to match different appearances, genders, and other expectations, with personalities, tones, accents, and other unique features added to synthetic voices. The best AI avatar solutions create natural-looking avatars and give users the ability to custom-create their own avatars. These avatars can be used for personalized sales and marketing videos, e-learning and training videos, and other forms of media that benefit from a friendly face. Low-Code/No-Code Usability and Video Editing Regardless of how much work AI features can do to put together the final product, users typically want some hands-on control over the video creation and editing process. To make this as simple as possible, most AI video generation tools provide a low-code/no-code user interface, giving customers the ability to adjust slides, audio and visual elements, and other pieces of their video with a drag-and-drop editing tool. How I Evaluated AI Video Generator Tools In comparing and contrasting AI video generator solutions, I scored each option against six key criteria for teams and businesses needing robust yet cost-effective features. From there, I divided each category into weighted subcriteria and assigned an overall score out of five to determine the winner for each category. Evaluation Criteria In scoring the AI video generator solutions, I placed the most emphasis on core features and enterprise features, as top software options should provide standard and advanced capabilities. I also evaluated each platform’s pricing, customization, ease of use, and customer support.

Criteria Winner: Synthesia Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Find answers to some of the most common questions about AI video generators below: *How Do I Choose the Best AI Video Platform for My Business?*Choosing the right AI video software for your business can feel like an overwhelming process, especially in a market that is increasingly saturated with viable solutions. The best way forward is to consider which features are most important to you, who will be using this software, and what your budget looks like for these requirements. Pay close attention to user reviews on each tool you’re considering, particularly noticing any comments on ease of use or team-based capabilities. For the best possible outcome, reach out to your top vendors to request a product demo and, if possible, see if they can cater that demo to your organization’s specific wants and needs. Going through this preselection process will typically save you time and money in the long run, as you’re less likely to make multiple switches mid-subscription. *What Is an AI-Generated Video?*An AI-generated video is a piece of video content with audio, voices, images, footage, graphics, and other elements that are created with AI rather than by human manipulation. The main use cases for AI-generated video include text-to-video generation and AI-driven video editing. *Can I Use ChatGPT to Make Videos?*No, you cannot directly use ChatGPT to make videos. However, you can generate video scripts and images that can be used in AI videos. Some AI video tools are also integrated with ChatGPT to make text and script generation run more smoothly. Bottom Line: AI Video Generators AI video generators simplify digital marketing and communication, helping users complete many of the most complicated video tasks, ranging from editing footage and audio to creating shorter clips and summaries from long-form content. This type of tool enables greater scalability and a simpler approach to multichannel content creation.
