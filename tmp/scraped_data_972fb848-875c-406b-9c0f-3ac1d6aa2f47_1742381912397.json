The Best AI Video Generators You Can Use Right Now Explore five leading AI video models currently available Explore five leading AI video models currently available Matthew S. Smith is a contributing editor for IEEE Spectrum and the former lead reviews editor at Digital Trends. OpenAI Sora has a beautiful user interface. The quality of its video generation, however, often fails to impress. Last year OpenAI finally released Sora, its AI model for video generation. First teased the previous February, Sora was by far the year’s most anticipated video generator. After all, OpenAI’s ChatGPT is the most popular AI chatbot on the planet, and Dall-E is among the best image generators. If anyone could set a new high bar, surely it would be OpenAI? But the release of Sora fell short of expectations. “We were so hyped up for Sora. Then when it came out, we were all like ‘Hmm…I’m not so sure.’ The other tools caught up,” said Chrissie Cremers, cofounder of Aigency Amsterdam. She’s hopeful the tool will live up to OpenAI’s reputation for updating models frequently. For now, though, Sora is frustratingly inconsistent. What are the best alternatives to OpenAI Sora? The reasons for its inconsistency relate to broader problems that challenge most generative AI systems. Video generators, like image generators, typically use a diffusion model trained to create an image from random noise. But video generators face the added hurdle of generating a series of images and presenting them in a sequence. That requires deeper knowledge about how the world works. Your browser does not support the video tag. Sora’s video quality looks good at a glance but rarely makes sense in motion.OpenAI Consider a game of baseball. Does the pitcher throw the ball toward home plate, or does the batter throw it at the pitcher’s mound? Though it’s a simple question for anyone familiar with the sport, answering it also requires an intuitive understanding of linear time and real-world physics that video generators find difficult. And so when an AI makes a video of a baseball play, maybe the catcher throws the pitch, or maybe the ball is thrown before the pitcher moves. Or maybe the ball screams at unreal speed in a random direction. While Sora didn’t live up to expectations, OpenAI’s competitors didn’t sit still in 2024, and many released both new foundation models and new features. These include models that provide higher-resolution outputs, lip-syncing of virtual characters, and fun visual effects. Here are five generators you can start tinkering with right now. 5 AI Video Generators You Can Use Right Now Here are the top AI video generators we tried — plus a couple of honorable mentions1. Runway2. Kling3. Luma Dream Machine4. Hailuo5. PikaHonorable Mentions 5 AI Video Generators You Can Use Right Now Here are the top AI video generators we tried — plus a couple of honorable mentions 1. Runway 2. Kling 3. Luma Dream Machine 4. Hailuo 5. Pika Honorable Mentions Runway https://runwayml.com/ Runway’s Act One can create AI-generated videos based on an actor’s performance.Runway.ai Runway released its first foundation video-generation model in 2023 and immediately established itself as a go-to option for creatives. Its strength is the visual quality of its generation in shorter shots with slow motion. Like Sora, it can struggle with fast motion but does better when asked to generate slow, cinematic shots of static or slow-moving objects. The company also has an impressive video-to-video tool called Act One. Designed for “expressive character performances,” it converts video of an actor’s real-world performance into an AI animated character. Ross Symons, cofounder of creative AI company ZenRobot, said Runway is “very good” at lip syncing, which is critical to a convincing result. Kling https://klingai.com/ Kling is an AI video-generation model with (relatively) consistent and realistic motion.Kuaishou Technology Kling.ai is an AI video-generation model from Kuaishou Technology, a Chinese company best known for its short-form social-media app, Kwai, which has over 200 million users. The company is now making inroads in AI with its own foundation video-generation model, Kling. Symons praised Kling’s ability to generate convincing movement in more-demanding prompts. “I find that it has the ability to create motion that is a lot more natural, in terms of humans moving, or an animal moving,” he said. Kuaishou released its latest model, Kling 1.6, on 19 December 2024. Though available directly from the company’s website, Kling.ai, the model can also be accessed through some third-party partners, such as Krea. Luma Dream Machine https://lumalabs.ai/ Luma’s Dream Machine is a foundation video model paired with a slick, feature-rich user interface. Luma AI Luma AI is a small San Francisco startup that trains foundation models. Its video-generation model, Dream Machine, has carved out a reputation as a go-to tool for discerning creatives. Its following is based less on the quality of its video model (though it’s still competitive) and more on its long list of useful features, which includes AI storyboards, image and video modification, and reference styles of more consistent results. The most notable feature released in 2024, however, was keyframes. The feature lets users prompt the model with a start and an end frame, providing more creative control. Symons, who has a background in animation, said the workflow felt natural and allowed for “subtle transitions between frames.” Luma’s advantage here might not hold, though, as competitors are beginning to add the feature. Hailuo https://hailuoai.video/ Hailuo is a top AI video-generation model for fast action scenes. Minimax Hailuo is a foundation video-generation model from Minimax, a Shanghai-based company backed by giants like Alibaba and MiHoYo. Hailuo has earned praise for high-quality results with convincing action. “It has some good motion, like fighting, which is interesting for filmmakers,” said Cremers. This also highlights how models from companies based in the United States and China often differ in their approach to video generation. OpenAI’s Sora may sometimes generate videos of fights, action scenes, or well-known pop-culture figures, but these prompts often lead to a content policy violation. In other cases, the generated video seems intentionally naïve about the prompt (ask Sora to generate a video of Brad Pitt, for example, and the results show no obvious resemblance). Hailuo seems less discerning, though it will still refuse particularly explicit and violent prompts. Pika https://pika.art/about Pika’s viral Pikaffects received millions of views on social media.Pika All the video-generation models discussed so far have something in common: They skew toward a slick, professional, detailed style. That’s often desirable, but what if you want something a bit more casual? That’s where Pika steps in. “I love Pika’s social-first strategy,” said Cremers. “It’s the model for social media, which is a very smart move.” Pika generated buzz in October of 2024 with Pikaffects, a tool that creates short, sharable clips centered around special effects like squishing, melting, or inflating an object in a photo. Pika’s most popular viral video—a mundane toilet that suddenly does very strange things—received over 19 million views on TikTok, and several more racked up millions. Honorable Mentions Cremers and Symons both mentioned another essential tool for AI video generation: Midjourney. No, you haven’t missed anything. Midjourney’s video-generation tool, though said to be underway, remains unreleased. However, Midjourney is the preferred image-generation tool for many AI creatives, and the images generated by Midjourney can be used for an image-to-video or keyframe prompt. Topaz Labs’ Video AI is another tool worth mentioning. It doesn’t generate videos but instead uses AI to upscale them. That’s valuable for professional work, as AI video generators tend to output video at lower resolutions (between 360p and 1080p). The importance of Midjourney and Topaz Labs’ Video AI highlights features video generators are likely to pursue in 2025. While better motion, consistency, and realistic physics are obvious areas where AI video can improve, there’s also room for them to compete with better storyboarding, higher output resolutions, and better control over camera movement.

      "content": "ByBernard Marr 5 Generative AI Video Tools Everyone Should Know About ByBernard Marr , Contributor. 5 Generative AI Video Tools Everyone Should Know About While last year was all about chatbots and image generators, this year, generative AI tools that help us create and edit videos are all the rage. Now, these aren’t (yet) as advanced as AI image generators, so don’t think you can just type “make a new Star Wars movie,” and it will create a blockbuster for you. Instead, what they do is automate many of the tasks involved in video editing, such as cutting footage to insert, re-ordering scenes, adding audio effects, generating captions, and adding avatars, graphics, or animations. However, they are becoming more powerful and flexible by the day, so who knows what they will be capable of soon? Whether you want to speed up the process of making corporate how-to videos or try your hand at becoming the next Stanley Kubrick, here’s a rundown of some of the top generative AI platforms for creating and editing videos today. Five Of My Favorite Generative AI Video Tools Synthesia Synthesia is a generative AI video tool that is particularly great when it comes to creating digital avatars and bringing them to life with realistic voice and animation. It’s used by businesses to create training materials as well as by marketers for promotional and advertising content, and it would also be a great choice for educational videos. Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 The avatars it creates can speak in multiple languages and accents, with convincingly human gestures and facial expressions. This means it’s easy to create content and then quickly localize it for different markets, products and services. It’s relatively easy to use – you simply type the script and hear it spoken back to you. Like many of the tools here, it offers a free account that gives you access to many of the basic features, meaning you can easily find out if it’s right for you before spending any money. Descript Descript is something of a disruptive player in the generative video market as a startup launched by one of the co-founders of Groupon. By gaining a reputation as a powerful tool for social media content creators and TikTok kids, it’s hit a marketing sweet spot, but it’s also used across a wide range of corporate and educational use cases. Descript users start with a script and then build their video out from there. You just pull in footage that can be manipulated and enhanced with AI, as well as audio that can be imported or generated from text, mimicking the user’s voice. You can then edit and re-arrange the timeline simply by snipping and moving the text. Descript stands out from other AI video editing tools – particularly ones that are available free online – with its user-friendliness and range of features. Everything is set up to make it quick for anybody to start producing and editing videos. Handy features such as eye-contact correction and “one-click” studio-quality sound are signs that the team is looking to add valuable innovations as the tool evolves. Adobe Premiere Pro with Sensei Another example of an industry-standard tool being given a generative AI makeover for the modern age. Adobe Premiere Pro has long been a video editing tool of choice for professionals and enthusiasts and now has a suite of new features powered by Adobe’s Sensei generative AI platform. Functions like transcription, inserting and re-ordering scenes, color correction, and audio adjustment, such as remixing music to match the timing of visuals, can now be streamlined and automated using natural language. It also has a text-to-speech feature that simplifies the process of creating captions and transcripts. This reduces the time that creators need to spend on manual tasks, allowing them to focus on more creative elements of their work. Adobe is going all-in on generative AI, adding tools and capabilities across its entire Creative Cloud suite, and video production is just one area where it is leading the field today. Pictory Pictory aims to automate the process of turning scripts and blogs into videos with minimal user effort. It’s great for those who want to make quick, snappy videos for marketing or just for fun. It can also be used by educators and online course creators to make lively learning material. One of the tasks it specializes in is automatically creating highlight reels showcasing the most important, exciting or interesting moments from longer videos. It then makes it simple to quickly repurpose them as trailers or social clips to engage more viewers. Generative AI is clearly going to make a big splash in the world of marketing, and there are plenty of tools designed to fit the needs of marketers. User-friendliness is a key feature of this platform, which focuses on making it simple to create the type of videos that millions of businesses across the world need every day. Runway Runway is different from the other platforms I’ve highlighted here because it does – to an extent – offer straightforward text-to-video generative AI. This means you can type “Sun rising over a beach at sunset,” and it will create a completely synthetic video. Alternatively, you can upload an image and bring it to life. When I tried it, the results were sometimes not exactly what I was hoping for, but they were impressive nonetheless, and it’s mind-boggling to think what this technology might be capable of in the not-too-distant future. As with ChatGPT and any generative AI tool with language-based input, the results can be greatly improved by taking some time to learn about the best ways to communicate what you want it to do. Other Great Generative AI Video Tools Beyond the five tools listed above, there are many other tools rapidly developing in the field of generative AI video creation, with the most noteworthy ones listed below for their innovative contributions and capabilities. Colossyan: Generate synthetic content tailored for workplace learning. Deepbrain: AI-generated virtual avatars and synthetic media aimed at corporate and business users. Designs.AI: Generate graphics, videos, logos and other design assets. Elai: Generative video tool geared towards designing training videos. Filmora 13: Full AI-powered video editing suite with chatbot co-pilot to help you out. Flexclip: Offers a good range of templates and resources, making it easy to get started with AI video. Fliki: Transform text into lifelike speech and videos; make videos in minutes. Heygen: Create talking photographs and other cool AI video tricks. Invideo: Create videos using a simple interface and pre-made templates. Lumen5: Web-based tool that converts text into engaging videos as well as AI “talking heads.” OpusClip: Automagically transforms long-form videos into short, punchy viral clips. Peech: Create branded videos from your existing content library for podcasts, webinars or social media. Synthesys: Generate professional AI-powered avatars and voiceovers Timebolt: Make videos more exciting by removing silences, rapidly cutting scenes and speeding up when the action is slow. Veed.io: Enhance video content by adding automated captions and subtitles, cleaning up audio issues and AI editing. Visla: Create professional videos with AI functions such as automated generation from scripts, natural language voiceovers and collaborative functionality. As we journey through the landscape of generative AI and its impact on video creation, it's clear that the tools we've explored are just the tip of the iceberg. The array of emerging tools rapidly developing in this space promises to further revolutionize how we create, edit, and envision video content. The potential for generative AI in video creation is vast, and as these tools become more sophisticated and accessible, we stand on the brink of a new era of storytelling and content creation.",

      "content": "Runway vs Pika Labs — which is the best AI video tool? I put them head-to-head to find out When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. There has been a flurry of new artificial intelligence video generators in the past few months. Despite this, Runway’s Gen-2 and Pika Lab’s Pika 1.0 are among the most rounded and high profile, largely because they got there early and through continued innovation. In addition to impressive video generation, both have fine-tuned control over the motion in the video and custom functionality such as Motion Brush in Runway or Modify Region from Pika Labs. Both services have similar price points and commercial agreements. They also produce between 2-3 second clips, have the option to extend clips and take text, image or video inputs when generating a new clip. I’ve put them head to head to see how well they compare. Comparing Runway vs Pika Labs Doing a comparison between two video AI models involves picking a series of prompts and having them both generate output based on that prompt. I’ve tried to come up with a range of ideas testing camera motion, individual item motion and motion among more than one item. With all of the tests there are ways to get better output with custom instructions, better prompting or using the native features within the tools. As both Runway and Pika Labs takes a slightly different approach I made as few changes as possible. Test 1: Drone footage over a forest fire This was a simple text-to-video test on both models, using default settings and no custom camera motion. It presents a chance to test the raw output of the underlying model. I used the prompt for this test: “Drone footage flying over a forest fire. Photorealistic. Flames leaping towards the camera.” This tests different aspects of the model including how it handles the camera motion from the drone, the flames moving and the visuals of trees and fire. Runway was an easy and clear winner on this test. The flames were more natural and it felt closest to a real video. Pika seemed to struggle with realistic flames and it threw the video off. Test 2: A Yeti walking in snow This was a chance to see how well each of the two AI video tools handled animation character movement within a scene. Again it was text-to-video with default settings but with a 4-second extension to see how the models handle consistency. The prompt was created by ChatGPT as I wanted to see how well one AI could instruct another, suggesting they visualize: “An imposing, majestic Yeti, towering at eight feet tall with a thick, shaggy coat of white fur that glistens in the sun, is captured mid-stride as it traverses a narrow, snow-covered mountain pass in the heart of the Himalayas during mid-winter.” The overall scenery for the Runway creation was more photorealistic, but the character animation from Pika Labs was better. I think overall Pika Labs wins this round. Test 3: A future city from an image For this test, I pulled in an image as the prompt rather than using just text. It was a text and image to video but all other settings kept on default. The image was generated in Night Cafe Studio using the SDXL 1.0 model from StabilityAI. The prompt for the video: “The camera moves through the city, showcasing towering skyscrapers with holographic advertisements, flying vehicles zooming past, and a bustling, technologically advanced urban landscape.” Neither provided an outright victory in this round but I’m giving it to Pika Labs as it produced animation closer to the description and the point is a test of motion. It was close though as Runway generated a crisper video closer to the original image. Test 4: Multiple characters in a frame One of the areas all generative video models struggle with is multiple characters moving within a single view. For this experiment, I once again used both text and image but ramped up the motion level on both by two points. I didn’t change any other settings. The prompt for both image and video: “Norman knights charge against Saxon shield wall. The camera pans over clashing swords and spears, focusing on William the Conqueror leading the charge, with Harold Godwinson defending.” Neither won this round. It’s not because the output is similar, as it is surprisingly different given both come from the same source image and text. The issue is that as with all AI video models, neither coped well with multiple characters. Runway would have won if I were using their multi-motion brush feature as it allows you to set motion by region. Test 5: Fish swimming in a clear sea For this test, it was all about the text. A well-formed prompt designed to see how well each of the models handled complex, but less cluttered motion against a simple environment. The prompt: “A vibrant coral reef teeming with marine life. The scene is from the perspective of slowly gliding through the water, with colorful fish darting in and out of the coral, and a gentle current causing the sea plants to sway.” I liked both approaches here and they were distinct from one another. Both also did a great job on diversity of motion, with Pika Labs going down the more diverse but simpler lane and Runway adding considerably more fish into the scene. It was a close call but I gave it to Pika Labs because the Runway video was less consistent in its character motion. Some of the fish merge and others seem to move backwards. Test 6: Unique feature test For the sixth test, I once again turned to image-to-video. Specifically, I had Leonardo.ai generate an image of an alien creature overlooking a vast expanse. The goal of this test wasn’t so much how it handled the motion, as the type of image is normally relatively easy for AI video tools — minimal movement, large background and few characters. The test here was one of the features unique to each of the models and which proved more useful. For Runway it was Multi Motion Brush and for Pika Labs I turned to Modify Region. While I think Modify Region is an impressive feature, especially if you only want to change a small aspect of a source image, Runway’s multi-motion brush is a game changer and that is why I’ve given this round to Runway. Test 7: Video-to-video This final test is one of the video-to-video features available from each model. Runway has a slight edge going into the test as it has a dedicated video-to-video model that includes a range of style options including from a text, image or preset prompt. Both models work by overlaying the uploaded source video with the style from your prompt. For Pika Labs this is only available from a test prompt, although you could use Modify Region to set a specific part of the frame to be changed. As I had the Yeti on my mind from an earlier test I gave it the prompt: “Yeti as a YouTuber,” with a video of me talking to the camera as the source material. Neither did a great job so, to be fair to the test I tried again with the prompt: “Futuristic android character as a YouTuber.” I’ve used video-to-video models before and they’ve managed to make the mouth move in time to the words being spoken but this time around Runway struggled. However, visually it fit the brief well and mirrored the source video movement. Pika Labs failed to create a well-formed character, kept flipping me upside down and didn’t change the overall view by much. Runway was the easy winner in this round. Runway vs Pika Labs: Winner Neither of the models won outright across the board. Runway took three of the tests, Pika Labs also took three and in one category neither model won. However, the one that they both lost would have gone to Runway under normal circumstances thanks to its Multi-Motion Brush. The issue was that characters merged into each other, which can be solved by defining individual motion for each. Sign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox. Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips. While I'm a big fan of Pika Labs and its approach, I think I will give the final victory to Runway, particularly its Gen-2 model largely because of the work on creating new features and refining pre-generation settings.

The AI interprets the prompt and generates a matching video, complete with movement, lighting, and even physics. This is by far the most popular type of AI video generation. Image-to-video Look at that VEO 2 animates windows wallpaper! pic.twitter.com/qL51V8S4oA — testtm (@test_tm7873) December 26, 2024 Image-to-video AI video generation animates static images, bringing them to life with motion effects. AI can generate smooth transitions, camera movements, or even animate characters from a few frames. Image-to-video models are popular with AI video creators because they allow you to maintain character, scene and object consistency throughout your video. You would typically use these tools alongside an AI image generator like Midjourney. Video-to-video @runwayml has 4K upscaling now! 🤯 I did a comparison between Runway GEN-3 and Topaz Video AI's upscaler, from HD to 4K. Runway's file size footprint is 40% of Topaz (using the Theia model), and after reviewing the results on a 40\" monitor, there's little to no difference in… pic.twitter.com/GamPOXq9mr — Tom Blake (@Iamtomblake) January 9, 2025 Video-to-video AI video generation uses AI to enhance, modify, or transform existing videos rather than creating new ones from scratch. This can include improving video quality, changing styles, adding special effects, or even altering elements within the footage—like removing objects, or replacing backgrounds. Some good examples of video-to-video includes Synthesia's AI dubbing (with lip sync) or Topaz's video upscaling. Th‎e best AI video generator for studio-quality videos with AI avatars Synthesia PlayCreate an AI Video in 4 Minutes with Synthesia ⚡️ Verdict: Easy to use and great for training, internal communications, marketing, outreach and localisation/translation ‎Link: ‎https://www.synthesia.io/ Synthesia is a leading AI video generator that allows you to create studio-quality videos with AI avatars that can narrate your text. It includes more than 60 video templates you can start from, and you can choose between more than 230 AI avatars that speak more than 140 languages and accents. Here's an example video I made for a product launch: PlayProduct Introduction (Free AI Video Template) Synthesia can be used to create a variety of video types, with the most common use cases being learning and development videos, including training videos and other eLearning video production. It also excels at producing onboarding videos and video content for internal communications, as well as marketing and outreach videos. Synthesia is a top-ranked AI software, with 1150+ reviews on G2 and has a rating of 4.7 out of 5. The platform is being used by 50,000 companies of all sizes, with many big names among them, such as Reuters, Zoom, and Amazon. Synthesia is a browser-based platform and I found it easy to set up my first video. I simply typed in my script, selected an avatar from their library, customized my video with the AI video editor, and then Synthesia generated a polished video featuring one of its realistic AI avatars. With over 230 avatars to choose from, I easily found options that fit different tones and purposes. You can also make a custom avatar that looks like you. Synthesia supports over 140 languages, and I was able to create localized versions of my video with ease. The platform even has a multilingual video player that automatically translates videos to viewers’ preferred languages, making it useful for global audiences. I tried adding multiple avatars on screen to simulate conversations, which worked smoothly and could be helpful for training scenarios or role-playing videos. The platform has over 60 professionally designed video templates that make it easy to produce polished content quickly. Features like live collaboration tools allow teams to work together seamlessly, while detailed video analytics provide insights into video performance. Altogether, these capabilities make Synthesia a practical, efficient choice for professional projects. One of its most popular use cases is as training video software, but it's also great for other sales and marketing videos and multilingual content. Th‎e best AI video generators for creative video production Here's my rundown of the best text-to-video and image-to-video AI video generators for creative video production. Hailuo Hailuo Director Mode is so fun. Being able to combine camera shots is just fantastic. Here shaky camera and push in. pic.twitter.com/MfqBA22vm8 — Jerrod Lew (@jerrod_lew) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best free option for creative video production Link: ‎https://hailuoai.video/ Hailuo AI is an AI video generator that delivers high-quality 6-second video clips at 720p resolution. It offers text-to-video, image-to-video and a subject reference feature. Hailuo offers a 3-day free unlimited generation period so that you can generate a bunch of videos for free and really test the tool. Subject reference is a particularly cool feature. It lets you upload a photo of a character and then generate a scene with that character in it. I found the output to be pretty accurate, although I often needed to do some manual editing to maintain coherence. The model can also take multiple attempts to get it right, which will eat into your credits. The feature also often fails at close-ups (wide shots tend to work better but lose fine details). One of the first things that stood out to me was how well it understands prompts. Hailuo seemed to nail camera movements and scene composition accurately. The image quality is also noticeably high. However, generation times are limited to 6 seconds, which makes creating longer sequences more tedious. Al‎ibaba Qwen Another day, another release. Alibaba have quietly included video generation in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max and it's really good. Here are a few examples - check them out. pic.twitter.com/u6qptO59ai — TomLikesRobots🤖 (@TomLikesRobots) January 30, 2025 Verdict: Completely free and produces high quality videos, but often with unreliable generation Link: ‎‎‎‎https://chat.qwenlm.ai/ Alibaba included an AI video generator in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max. It’s a text-to-video only tool, but it’s completely free and I’ve been impressed by the quality. The one catch is that the generation is kind of unreliable. I often enter my prompt and the video generates up to 99% complete and then gets stuck for quite a while. In my experience the videos do eventually finish generating but be prepared to wait a little. The output quality seems to be really good, and while the functionality is limited, it’s completely free and the videos have no watermark. Kl‎ing If you’re looking to combine character consistency with high-quality VFX, @Kling_ai is the best choice. 🎥✨ Version 1.5 absolutely nails VFX. A true must-have! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/rO1WvmLj3k — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) January 12, 2025 Verdict: High quality output, but very long free plan generation wait times Link: ‎https://www.klingai.com/ Kling offers text-to-video and image-to-video features, along with free video generation credits for users who log in each month. Kling brings an impressive level of fluidity and realism to movement in videos. I found the adjustable creativity and relevance slider particularly useful for fine-tuning outputs. Its biggest strength lies in image-to-video generation (and in particular its elements feature), which is far superior to tools like Runway. The motion is smoother, and the AI follows prompts accurately. When I asked for a character to blink or walk forward while the camera zoomed in, Kling delivered exactly what I asked for. If you need storytelling or consistency between frames, Kling is a great option. Kling 1.5 also supports HD, which is a nice bonus. Kling has some drawbacks, the biggest being generation speed. On the free version, I sometimes had to wait an hour or more for a single clip, and I’ve heard of free users waiting a full day for results. This is a major issue if you need quick iterations. On a paid plan the generations are quicker, but I also noticed that Kling sometimes gets stuck at 99% completion and wastes credits. At the end of the day, if you prioritize quality, accuracy, and motion control, Kling is a great choice. The motion brush tool adds extra control, and the first-attempt success rate is high, meaning I spent less time fighting the AI to get what I wanted. Ru‎nway When setting up a shot in Runway, think carefully about where to put the camera. Consider what the camera placement tells the audience about the story, about the character, and about the moment. Every angle is a decision that affects how the audience will experience it. pic.twitter.com/XnijHcb0Jv — Cristóbal Valenzuela (@c_valenzuelab) November 11, 2024 Verdict: The Gen-3 model gives you great results and some amazing advanced features that come with a bit of a learning curve Link: ‎https://runwayml.com/ Runway’s latest Gen-3 model offers a comprehensive suite of creative tools, such as text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video, alongside advanced features like motion brush, keyframes, camera controls and inpainting. On the free basic plan, you can create short text-to-video clips (up to 10 seconds long or 16 seconds using the \"extend video\" feature in the older Gen-2 model) but can’t upscale resolution or remove watermarks. You also can’t generate videos directly from text using their Gen-3 Alpha model on the free plan (only images to video). However, you can still make great videos with just the image-video feature. Here's an example workflow to show you how I use Runway’s free plan to create AI-generated short story videos: Midjourney to generate images Runway for image-to-video Suno to generate music Elevenlabs for some effects Topaz for video upscaling Capcut for editing I found Runway’s advanced features to be pretty amazing. Camera control lets you adjust angles, focus, and movement to achieve a polished, professional look. The Motion brush tool allows you to add motion and direction to specific parts of a video, which is great for creating visually dynamic social media content. Keyframes allow you to configure the starting, middle, and ending frames to create smooth transitions between them. Inpainting lets you automatically remove unwanted objects throughout your clip. This tool handled complex scenes surprisingly well; I could remove background elements without affecting the continuity of the video, something that would usually require a lot of time and expertise. However, I found that these advanced features come with a learning curve, so if you’re new to video editing you might need a bit of practice to fully utilize Runway’s capabilities. I found Runway’s video generation process to be fast and reliable. I think the pricing is reasonable given the platform’s capabilities, especially for creators, filmmakers, and digital artists who want more control and creative freedom. However, the costs might feel high if you’re only looking for basic AI video generation, as Runway is designed for those looking to push creative boundaries and explore the possibilities of AI in video production. Go‎ogle Veo Been generating impossibly dangerous stunts with veo 2 using text prompts. Still surprising how realistic they can look (though not perfect yet). pic.twitter.com/0gETBwGH5y — Ethan Mollick (@emollick) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best option for creative video production, but limited access for now (US only waitlist) Link: ‎https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/ I was blown away by Google Veo 2’s realistic video generation capabilities. Every clip I produced, from a misty jungle scene to a foggy wildlife sequence, was rendered in stunning detail, and the visual fidelity was top-notch. One of the aspects that stood out for me was the advanced cinematic controls. I could specify everything from lens types to shot angles and even adjust depth-of-field effects, which made it feel like I had an entire professional film crew at my fingertips. The dolly zoom and pan shot features, in particular, added that extra layer of cinematic flair that really brought my scenes to life. In my tests, Veo 2 consistently produced more “correct” results compared to other tools like OpenAI’s Sora. The physics simulation is fantastic with objects and characters that move and interact in a way that feels natural and true to real-world behavior. I found that character consistency was excellent too; no matter how complex the scene, the generated characters maintained their look and identity throughout the video. Veo 2 supports high-resolution outputs (up to 4K) and longer video durations too, which simplifies your workflow as you won’t need upscaling tools. The only reason why Veo 2 isn’t my top pick for creative video production is because it’s still not publicly available - you have to join a waitlist and it’s still US only. There’s also room for improvement still, and I sometimes saw some strange character movements in my generated videos. Op‎enAI Sora 🚨 It’s crazy! #Sora just dropped, and it’s already blowing everyone’s minds! 😱🎥 Here are 10 mind-blowing examples showcasing its insane possibilities. 🔥 The future of video is here. 🚀👇 pic.twitter.com/Mcq2OepO3R — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Fun to play around with but needs to improve Link: ‎https://sora.com/ Sora is OpenAI’s entry into text-to-video AI video generation, and after spending some time with it, I’ve found it to be a mixed bag. On the one hand, when Sora works, it can deliver stunning, lifelike visuals, especially for abstract or artistic scenes. Its storyboard functionality is one of my favorite features, as it lets you prompt multiple shots in a single generation, and the “Blend” option adds a fun layer of creativity, allowing you to combine visual elements in unexpected ways. However, in my experience the model struggles with some critical aspects. Sora consistently fails when it comes to physics, general body movements, and character consistency. For example, I tried generating scenes as simple as making cats dance, only to be met with choppy motion, glitches, and overall results that were far from convincing. In several cases, the outputs felt like a gamble: some generations might be passable, but most of the time, prompts didn’t translate well into the expected actions or camera movements. I found that free or cheaper alternatives outperform Sora in accuracy and usability. There’s a steep learning curve, and despite the potential of the video-to-video remix functionality (which I’ve used to remaster some older AI-generated clips), the overall inconsistency is hard to overlook. You can access Sora on the plus plan ($20/month) which gives you 50 videos up to 720p resolution and 5 seconds long, or the pro plan ($200/month) for 500 videos up to 1080p resolution and 20 seconds long. Pi‎ka I had early access to the Pika 2.1 Model, A new journey begins, More clips to follow! @pika_labs pic.twitter.com/rN5OfMacoo — Stevie Mac (@StevieMac03) January 23, 2025 Verdict: The free plan isn’t great, but the premium plans have very good image-to-video features Link: ‎https://pika.art/ Pika offers a free plan that gives you access to Pika 1.5, which has text-to-video and image-to-video features and 150 monthly video credits. Videos can be downloaded without a watermark on the free plan. I wasn’t super impressed with the quality of the generated videos though. However, while Pika 1.5’s video output is nothing special, Pika 2.1 (available on the paid plan) offers an image-to-video feature called scene ingredients, which I think is pretty amazing. With scene ingredients you can build a shot from the exact character, object, wardrobe, and setting you want. It works by using reference images of each element and then providing a prompt. It’s similar to Kling’s elements feature in that it allows you to ensure creative consistency between scenes, which I found made it a super useful tool to produce actually usable videos. Lu‎ma First impression Luma > Sora pic.twitter.com/R2pXVsAesw — The Retro Burn (@burntheretro) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Their new Ray 2 model is great, but it’s a premium feature and it doesn’t offer image-to-video Link: ‎https://lumalabs.ai/ Luma's Ray 2 model has great motion realism and the physics feel really natural. The frame-to-frame consistency is a clear improvement over previous versions and it does an excellent job with cinematic elements, responding impressively to lighting, contrast, film formats, and camera motion. At times, it even seemed to intelligently structure shots. By using highly detailed prompts and running multiple generations, I found that it’s possible to create some truly stunning videos, though it does require some cherry-picking to get the best results. When I tested a sports car driving through snowy mountains at dawn, the scene composition was spot on and the snow, warm light, and camera tracking all felt smooth and natural. I also experimented with close-up shots of faces, and I was surprised by how well it captured emotional expressions, particularly in an extreme sadness prompt, where the eye movements and facial subtleties felt incredibly lifelike. Where Luma stands out is its ability to generate dynamic camera movements while keeping the scene coherent. It understands cinematic depth and framing in a way that makes it ideal for dramatic shots. I found that Luma is great at handling large-scale scene changes. For example, when I asked it to generate a collapsing building Luma delivered a convincing destruction sequence. Currently, Luma’s Ray 2 is only available to paid users and is capped at 720p resolution. Videos can be up to 10 seconds long, but I noticed that after about 7 seconds, scene consistency can start breaking down, occasionally shifting in unintended ways. Ad‎obe Firefly Here's another video created by Adobe Firefly.. a 3D printer, printing a car. Very impressed by the results. https://t.co/L5d8zf3TGv pic.twitter.com/ySylkRlDMS — techAU (@techAU) February 13, 2025 Verdict: Inconsistent motion and limited free use (only 2 free generations) make it hard to recommend Link: ‎‎https://firefly.adobe.com/ Adobe Firefly offers both text to video and image to video, both capable of producing 1080p clips from simple prompts or static images. Firefly struggles with distortion. I tested it by generating a video of \"a cyclist riding through a mountain trail in autumn,\" and while the colors and scenery were nice, the motion was noticeably unnatural. The cyclist's legs appeared to glitch mid-pedal, and the overall movement felt disjointed. Image to video fared better when creating abstract or background footage, but realistic human action remained a challenge. The output currently feels more like digital experiments than polished, usable content. On the positive side, Firefly's interface is intuitive. The built-in controls for adjusting camera angles, motion paths, and shot sizes make experimenting with different styles relatively simple. After generating two free videos, I was prompted to upgrade to either Firefly Standard or Pro for additional generations. While Firefly is enjoyable to explore and has clear creative potential, I’ll stick with more reliable alternatives for projects that need high-quality, natural-looking results. The best AI video generators for social media and YouTube content Fl‎exClip PlayHow to use FlexClip's AI Video Creator Verdict: User-friendly video tool with innovative AI features Link: ‎https://www.flexclip.com/ FlexClip is highly user-friendly platform that excels at helping you create professional-looking videos quickly and efficiently. I love the drag-and-drop editor. It’s perfect for creating videos on the fly without needing to spend hours on intricate editing. I’ve used it to create everything from social media content to promotional videos. The AI-powered text-to-video tool allows you to input simple text prompts, and the AI generates video clips based on the text, matching stock footage, adding text overlays, and even suggesting music. It's perfect for social media clips. While the AI can be a little hit or miss when it comes to perfectly matching footage to specific content, it’s an amazing tool for creating videos when you’re short on time or just need a draft to build upon, and I typically only need to make a few adjustments after generation. The AI script generator is another great feature. While the scripts are generally a good starting point, they often need a little fine-tuning to match the specific tone of the brand or subject matter. This is definitely a time-saver, though, especially when you’re stuck trying to put ideas into words. Another feature that impressed me was the AI background remover. It works surprisingly well. For most images, the background removal is clean, though it sometimes struggles with more intricate details like hair or small objects. It’s a great time-saver when you’re working with product images or need transparent backgrounds quickly. FlexClip also offers an auto-subtitle generator, which is a great tool for improving accessibility and engagement on social media platforms. It’s surprisingly accurate, and I’ve used it for videos on YouTube and Instagram. However, it does occasionally struggle with fast speech or complex accents, so if you’re working with content that has unclear audio, this may not always be 100% reliable. One area where FlexClip could improve is its media library. While it offers a decent range of stock footage and images, it’s not as extensive as some other platforms I’ve used. For niche content, I’ve often had to source additional media from other places. The stock library is good for general-purpose videos, but it may not always have exactly what you need. Ve‎ed PlayHow to Make a YouTube Intro Verdict: User-friendly browser-based video editor that streamlines social media content creation Link: ‎https://www.veed.io/ Veed is a user-friendly, browser-based video editor that made creating social media content incredibly easy for me. The intuitive layout and drag-and-drop functionality let me start projects quickly, and I loved using features like automatic subtitles, text-to-speech, and background removal to give my videos a professional touch. The templates and filters helped keep my style consistent, and with auto-translate, creating multilingual content was straightforward. The only downside I found was that the free plan includes a watermark, and complex scenes sometimes required a bit of manual tweaking to get the AI effects like background removal just right. Overall, Veed offered everything I needed for quick, polished videos with minimal effort. Ca‎nva PlayCreate content fast with Canva Video Verdict: AI-powered video editing with versatile templates Link: ‎https://www.canva.com/video-editor/ai/ Canva is not only a design tool; it’s also a great alternative for creating social media and YouTube videos. I tried its video editor, and I was impressed by how well it adapts to video creation. Canva’s templates make it easy to start projects tailored for platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. One of my favorite features is the automatic resizing, which lets me quickly reformat videos for different platforms without needing to start from scratch. The AI-powered suggestions for text and animations are also handy—it feels like Canva’s tools know how to keep my content consistent and visually engaging. With access to a vast library of stock media and music, I could easily enhance my videos, and the new AI text-to-speech and captioning features were a nice bonus, especially for making my videos more accessible. Overall, Canva’s video editing tools made it simple to produce polished, shareable content that looks just as good as anything created with dedicated video editors. The best AI-powered video editors Fi‎lmora PlayFilmora 14 is HERE! | Introducing a NEW way to edit Verdict: An affordable and user-friendly video editor with robust AI features Link: ‎https://filmora.wondershare.com/ When I first tried Filmora, I was immediately struck by how easy it was to navigate. The drag-and-drop functionality and straightforward interface made it simple to start editing, even without much prior experience. Filmora offers a robust library of transitions, effects, and templates, allowing me to quickly put together visually appealing videos, which is ideal for creating content for social media and YouTube. I appreciated how the platform balances usability with a range of features, making it suitable for both beginners and intermediate users who want to produce polished videos without a steep learning curve. Filmora’s pricing is also accessible, with options that cater to different types of users. They offer an annual subscription starting at around $49.99 per year, and for those looking for more flexibility, a lifetime license is available for around $79.99. There’s also a free version, which is great for testing the software before committing, but it does add a watermark to videos. For creators looking to edit consistently without major financial commitments, Filmora’s pricing offers a good balance of affordability and value, especially considering the powerful AI tools it includes. These plans are well-suited for individuals and small business owners who need regular access to professional-grade video tools without breaking the bank. Filmora's AI-powered tools bring a lot of convenience and creativity to the editing process. I'll run through each one. The AI Smart Cutout feature, for example, allows you to cut objects out of scenes by painting over the area, which is perfect for isolating specific subjects without complex masking. I also found AI Audio Denoise to be extremely useful for cleaning up background noise in my videos, especially when I recorded in less-than-ideal environments. The AI Audio Stretch tool was another handy feature that let me extend background music to match scene transitions, saving me the hassle of remixing or finding perfectly timed tracks. These AI tools are not only time-saving but also elevate the overall quality of the final video, helping users create professional-looking content with minimal effort. The AI Motion Tracking tool was a lot of fun to experiment with—it can be used to track faces or moving objects, allowing for privacy blurring or creative effects like pasting funny stickers over someone’s face to make meme-style videos. Another feature I really enjoyed was AI Remove Background, which made it easy to change the background of my videos without needing a green screen. I could, for instance, place a runner in an outer-space setting, which opens up endless creative possibilities. Additionally, Filmora’s AI Silence Detection tool helped speed up my editing by automatically removing pauses and hesitations, making it effortless to create snappy jump cuts. These tools make Filmora an efficient, AI-enhanced option for quick edits and visually dynamic effects. However, while these AI tools are great for general use, there are a few limitations. The precision of features like Smart Cutout and Remove Background isn’t perfect and might require manual touch-ups for complex scenes. Additionally, while Filmora handles most tasks smoothly, rendering can slow down when working with high-resolution files or when using multiple AI features in one project. This might be a drawback for users with demanding workflows or those creating high-quality, professional-grade content. Overall, though, Filmora’s AI tools make it an impressive choice for social media creators and hobbyists. In summary, Filmora is an accessible, budget-friendly video editor that packs a lot of AI-driven functionality into an affordable package. It’s particularly suited for those creating content for social media, YouTube, or personal projects. With its range of pricing options, Filmora offers a lot of value, especially for casual and intermediate creators who don’t need the high-end features of more advanced (and expensive) software. To‎paz PlayExperience Wonder by Topaz Labs Verdict: A premium AI-driven enhancer that delivers cinematic upscaling and noise reduction for professional-quality footage Link: ‎‎https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-video-ai Topaz Video AI is an advanced video enhancement tool that uses AI to upscale, stabilize, and improve video quality. When I tried it, I was impressed by how well it upscaled footage, even to resolutions as high as 16K, adding a cinematic clarity to older or lower-quality clips. The AI-driven noise reduction made a noticeable difference, effectively removing grain and artifacts that I struggled with in other software. I also found the frame rate enhancement and slow-motion features to be smooth and natural, making it ideal for creating professional-quality slow-motion shots or restoring archival footage. Priced at $299 for personal use and $1099 for commercial licensing, Topaz Video AI is an expensive but valuable investment for filmmakers, content creators, and digital archivists looking to elevate their work with high-end upscaling and video repair capabilities. Ca‎pCut PlayLearn How to Create Amazing Content using CapCut Web Version | CapCut Verdict: A free and versatile editor with intuitive AI tools that make crafting polished content effortless across devices Link: https://www.capcut.com/ CapCut is a free, all-in-one video editing tool that I found easy to use across mobile, desktop, and browser platforms. The array of AI-powered features—like background removal and automatic upscaling—made editing quick and straightforward, especially for creating social media content. The audio-to-text transcription was a time-saver, automatically adding captions that boosted accessibility and engagement on my videos. I liked tools like video stabilization and text-to-speech, which let me enhance video quality without needing complex software. CapCut’s collaborative features were also helpful, especially when working on shared projects, and the library of templates gave me plenty of creative options. Overall, CapCut’s versatility and ease of use make it a great choice for both personal and professional video editing. The best AI video generators for video repurposing Op‎usClip PlayOpusClip 3.0: The smartest AI clipping tool just got smarter Verdict: A smart and time-saving tool that repurposes long videos into engaging, platform-ready clips with minimal effort Link: ‎https://www.opus.pro/ Opus Clip has quickly become one of my favorite tools for repurposing long videos into social media-friendly clips. The AI-driven clip generation feature is surprisingly accurate, identifying the most engaging parts of my videos and saving me the time I’d usually spend sorting through footage. I appreciate how it automatically resizes clips to fit different platforms like TikTok and Instagram without any manual adjustments. Adding captions and even emojis is simple, and I noticed it makes the videos more engaging, especially for viewers who watch without sound. One of the standout features is the \"hook\" identification, which picks out key moments to grab attention quickly. Overall, Opus Clip made it easy to create compelling, shareable content from my existing videos, and the AI features really lightened my workload. Mu‎nch PlayMeet Munch Verdict: Efficiently converts long-form content into shareable social snippets using AI Link: ‎https://www.getmunch.com/ Munch is an AI-based tool for repurposing long-form video content into shorter clips suited for social media platforms. It identifies key moments in videos and includes features like auto-cropping, subtitles, and format adjustments to help optimize content for platforms such as Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok. Munch offers a streamlined way to create shareable content from existing videos, aimed at enhancing reach and engagement across various channels. I found the interface clean and easy to navigate, allowing me to jump right in without needing tutorials. One feature I particularly liked was the automatic detection of key moments. Munch’s AI identifies engaging segments, which saved me the time of manually sifting through my footage to find the best parts to share. For anyone looking to repurpose content across platforms, this automation is a real time-saver. Munch’s formatting tools also make it easy to resize videos for different social platforms. The auto-cropping options adjust clips to fit Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and more, making cross-platform distribution simpler. I appreciated the automatic subtitle feature, which made my videos accessible to a broader audience without much additional work. However, while these features are useful, they lack some customization. I couldn’t manually adjust the selected clips as much as I’d like, and sometimes the AI would pick sections that didn’t feel as relevant or engaging as I had hoped. One limitation I noticed is that the output quality and customization options are fairly basic compared to more advanced editing software. While auto-cropping and subtitles are convenient, the styling options for subtitles are limited, and I missed having more flexibility with transitions and effects. This might be a drawback if you’re aiming for highly polished, branded content, as Munch is more focused on speed and efficiency than fine-tuning. Overall, though, it’s a solid tool for quickly repurposing long videos into social-friendly snippets. If you need a quick way to generate clips from existing content and don’t require advanced editing, Munch is a handy addition to your toolkit.

The auto-cut feature was spot-on, leaving me with a much tighter, more engaging video without having to painstakingly cut it all myself. The tool is super intuitive. It offers handy features like background noise cancellation and even let me choose whether to add background music, which really helped polish the final product. I also appreciated the straightforward interface—it made setting up projects and tweaking settings a breeze.

Make a Video Updated: 12/10/24 Published: 06/16/23 Videos are integral to any marketing campaign; however, they can be tedious and difficult to create if you aren’t savvy with editing or are short on time. Fortunately, you can leverage many AI video generators to streamline your production and create content that engages your audience. But what’s the best AI video generator for your tasks? This article will explore 12 different AI video generators, their features, and how you can best use them in your next video marketing campaign. Time to press play on easier video creation. Table of Contents Can AI make videos? How to Make AI Videos Transforming Text to Video With AI What makes a great AI video generator? Best AI Video Generators Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video Can AI make videos? Yes, AI can make videos. AI video generators can instantly produce basic presentation slides with text, B-roll, and background music, all the way up to advanced videos of lifelike AI avatars “speaking” to you. AI’s impressive — but it’s not perfect. What works well with AI video generators: Video scripts. Being able to generate video scripts in a few seconds is incredible and saves so much time. Stock imagery, B-roll, and background music. Even though it still requires editing, having multimedia pulled automatically for you by the video generator makes it feel like you have an assistant. Video editing. The video editing capabilities are incredible and often beginner-friendly, which is a huge leap in the video editing world. What isn’t working (yet): Believability. The realistic AI avatars are incredibly advanced, but the mannerisms and articulation make it obvious that they're, well, AI. Pacing. Much research has been done on how quickly a video moves from scene to scene to hold viewers’ attention, and I found that not all generators factored this into their algorithms. Decision overload. The number of video templates, AI avatars, and effects available can overwhelm the editing process. AI is rapidly advancing, and some of these quirks will soon be passé. How to Make AI Videos The process for making an AI video will vary depending on the tool or platform you're using. Some generators work by analyzing and creating a video based on the script you uploaded, while others will follow a prompt typed in by the user. The key is to find a tool or generator with the features you need to create the kind of content you want. Transforming Text to Video With AI When ChatGPT catapulted to popularity in 2022, I don’t think the average marketers knew just how quickly AI video would follow. It needs to be used ethically to be useful to society, but when leveraged correctly, it’s an incredible tool. The most sought-after AI video feature is the text-to-video generator. This allows you to type in a sentence and, in a few seconds, be presented with an editable AI-generated video. I tested this feature using two different prompts: A vague prompt: “I’d like to educate viewers about AI-generated video.” A specific prompt: “I’d like to inspire beginner marketers to try AI video generation. The video should explain the benefits of AI video generators and should inspire viewers to try this new video tool.” I used HubSpot’s free AI video generator Clip Creator, and here’s what I saw. They were both high-quality videos. Both videos had appropriate stock images and music tailored to human behavior. The content was very similar for both videos. After testing many AI generators, I’ve found that a marketer’s time is better spent editing rather than making their prompt more specific. No matter how perfect your prompt feels, the end result will still require edits.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now What makes a great AI video generator? So, how does one evaluate all of the different software on the market? The best AI video tools all have a mix of these different features. Intuitive User Interface While most platforms list a long list of fancy AI features, users need an easy-to-use AI studio first and foremost. This enables a quick editing process. AI Scripts Automatically-generated video scripts save an incredible amount of time when producing video content. They turn written content (such as a blog post, email, etc.) or a prompt into spoken language. Sometimes, they even use an AI narrator to read it out loud for you. Not all software can generate video scripts, but it’s an enormous time saver. To be fair to the software that doesn’t offer this, it’s replaceable with a few clicks in ChatGPT. After trying more than a dozen AI video generators, I found the AI scripts were one of the features that made the greatest difference, along with the next feature. Factoring in Human Behavior Some software have tailored their AI to match user behavior, and some haven’t. For example, most people prefer videos with a brisk pace and visuals that don’t stay on the screen too long. In the video world, this is referred to as “pacing.” Not all software is tailored for this, and as a result, it will produce slow, lengthy slides that feel like a bad PowerPoint presentation. This isn’t a detail that software companies list on their “features” page, but it’s something that’s apparent based on the first draft of the video that the software gives you. Template Library Start from scratch? What is it, 2018? There’s no need to start from scratch with video anymore, as most platforms have built-in template libraries. Bonus points if these libraries include variation in: Intended audience. Aspect ratio. Project type. Editing Capabilities It’s normal for different software to offer different editing options, but most AI studios will cover the basics, such as: Text. Fonts. Music. Colors. Timing. Transitions. Animations. Stock footage. Different video styles. Pricing Tiers (or Free Plan) An AI video generator costs $0 to $50 a month (paid annually). All paid software includes a discount when purchasing an annual package, and the cost of month-to-month service is always higher. I know you’re on a budget — all of the suggested AI tools below are either free or include a free trial/demo. Multilingual Look for software that supports multiple languages if your business requires it. A chart comparing 11 AI Video Generators Chart comparing AI video generators Best AI Video Generators AI video generators have come extremely far in a short time. You can now make professional videos with the numerous text-to-video generation tools on the market. I’ve tried all the most popular AI video generators, so you don’t have to. Here’s what I found. 1. Clip Creator Source Clip Creator is the best AI video generator for beginners. It can be used by someone with no video experience and walks you through the video creation process painlessly. You start by answering a few basic questions (like video type), then provide a brief overview of the video you’d like to create. You can choose from video templates, which are oriented for both landscape videos and vertical videos. Then, Clip Creator uses AI to generate the text on your slides, plus the background imagery. You’re instantly given a video with editable text, stock images, background music, etc. The video creation workflow is very intuitive. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video My experience: I love how streamlined this AI video creator is. Instead of bombarding you with endless features, options, and pop-ups, Clip Creator starts simple and allows you to make any edits you need after it generates the video. Source Pros: Incredibly intuitive user interface, great customization options, and makes for a very fast and efficient AI video creator. Cons: Smaller template library than paid AI video generators, and no advanced features like realistic AI avatars. Best for: Video creation beginners and marketers on a budget. Most user-friendly interface and best free AI video generator. 2. Pictory Source Pictory is an excellent AI video generator for creators and marketers who don’t have experience creating videos. All you have to do is provide a script or article to guide your video content. For example, you can submit a blog post to the AI video creator, and Pictory will create a video based on the post that can be used for social media or your website. Furthermore, you can edit videos in minutes by using text. Pictory also includes a feature that creates shareable video highlight reels that can be used as a trailer or a short-form video for social media such as a Reel. Even better, Pictory can automatically caption and summarize your videos.

Marketing AI Tools Practical Tips Trends and Statistics And More! Get Your Free Report Learn more Get Your Free Report Download Free All fields are required. You're all set! Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: I provided the same prompt for Pictory as I did for the Clip Creator video, and it initially generated much less content (only 1 slide). I went back and instead provided a URL of a blog post and tested the blog-to-video generator. This feature automatically creates video scripts based on a blog post, and using their realistic AI voices, I could have it automatically narrated too. The writing on every slide needed to be edited significantly to be useful, but I was impressed with the options. Pictory supports multiple languages (currently English, Spanish, French, and German) and has a huge library of AI voices. Source Prices for Pictory start at $19 per month, and users can try a 2-week free trial. Pros: Users have a lot of options for how to begin their AI-generated videos, and they can thoroughly customize the video output. Cons: The first draft of the automatically-generated videos needs heavy editing. It may be faster to let ChatGPT write a script for you and use that. Best for: Marketers and creators with limited video editing experience who want to convert content like blog posts or webinars into shareable video content. 3. Simplified Source The Simplified AI video generator transforms a long-form video into multiple AI-enhanced clips with just one click. This allows users to create videos from text and make an entirely new video using its accessible editing interface. Simplified simplifies the way we produce content by providing users with easy access to an expansive in-app library that hosts thousands of templates, all available for free. I like that it guarantees exceptional video quality and pairs this with an intuitive, user-friendly interface, ensuring that users can craft high-quality videos without sacrificing ease of use. Its comprehensive suite of features goes beyond basic editing options to include animation enhancements and multilingual translation capabilities, making it a versatile all-in-one tool for video creation. Users can save their brand settings in Simplified’s “brand book” is a great time-saving feature. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just starting, this platform equips you with everything you need to bring your vision to life. Brands like Bloomberg, DuckDuckGo, and Cashify use Simplified for their marketing needs. My experience: I prompted Simplified the same way I prompted the other video generators, and I was immediately asked to describe my target audience and provide my video topic. This was a nice step toward more personalized videos, but it required more user-generated input than Clip Creator, which had a multiple-choice intake process. If you stick to the free plan, it’s time-consuming to sift through all the features to see what’s free to use. Source Prices for Simplified include a forever-free plan. Paid plans start from $15.20 a month and are billed annually. Pros: If you pay for this AI video creator, you have many creation options at your disposal that not all other platforms offer (AI meme creation, AI image generation, AI carousel maker, etc.). Cons: Not the best free AI video generator; other platforms are more generous with their features. You’re not able to test the text-to-video generator without joining a paid plan, as you’re about to do with other features. Best for: Creators who want to create, edit, and schedule videos for all social media platforms. 4. Movavi Video Editor Source Rather than generating AI videos from scratch, the Movavi Video Editor uses AI to make video editing easier. Video editing can be a time-consuming chore; for many, it’s the less enjoyable side of content creation. However, with Movavi Video Editor’s nonlinear AI technique, you’re not just replicating traditional tool functions but also enhancing your videos through advanced AI video editing. With AI background removal, you can cut out and replace backgrounds, adding a new dimension to your visuals. Plus, the AI noise removal feature enhances audio quality by automatically eliminating unwanted sounds, ensuring your videos are of the highest standard. Source The app also offers a host of advanced options like PiP, chroma-key, titles, keyframing, motion tracking, and more. Following the free 7-day trial, paid plans start at $49.95 per year. Pros: The presence of built-in training rapidly familiarizes you with the software, and it has features that many other AI video editors don’t. Cons: This AI video editor brings high-level tools (like color correction) to marketers, but total video newbies may be overwhelmed with some of the more advanced features. Best for: Creators and marketers who already have video footage and want help editing videos to be more engaging (or who just need to speed up the editing process). 5. Fotor AI Video Generator Source Fotor is an image and video editing platform that integrates various AI features, known for its creativity, intelligence, flexibility, and convenience. Its AI video generator fully utilizes advancements in AI technology, making video creation more efficient and enjoyable. Video creation is often a complex and professional process, but Fotor simplifies the steps. You just need to describe your creative ideas in text form and choose your desired style. AI will automatically analyze and generate a video you’ll be satisfied with. You can also upload images and add descriptions to generate a video. Whether you're an amateur video maker, a professional creator, or someone learning video production with no skills, AI will help you enjoy the efficiency and fun of video creation. Inspiration is important for video creators. Fotor AI video generator provides preset prompts and images, helping creators find more inspiration for their videos. My experience: Fotor’s interface is very user-friendly and simple. you can quickly find the features you need without any distracting ads or clutter. It also provides detailed step-by-step instructions, making it easy for new creators to get started. While creating videos, its preset text descriptions and high-quality images inspired me creatively. They also saved me time and greatly boosted my production efficiency. Source What I found most convenient was that after generating a video, I could perform basic edits directly in Fotor and I could also use their rich AI video tools, like one-click enhancement and beautification, background removal, and object elimination. Pros: The AI video generator supports creating videos in various styles, including Photography, Cinematic, Digital Art, Anime, Neopunk, Game Art, Illustration Art, and more. Catering to various creative ideas and needs. Cons: AI may not always fully understand textual descriptions or emotions and feelings, so some videos may not appear as realistic. Best for: Professional video creators, video creation beginners, social media video influencers, and users who enjoy trying and testing trendy and interesting features. 6. AI Studio Source With AI Studio, users can create videos by uploading their script and using the text-to-speech feature. The platform will then generate a video in five minutes or less. You can manually type in the script or copy and paste it into the platform. From there, you just need to select the appropriate language and AI model and finish editing. AI Studio allows users to select a custom-made avatar that suits their brand.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: New users can input a 300-character script, and an AI avatar will read your script using the AI text-to-video generator. I found the AI models to be less convincing than others; the mouths sometimes moved between sentences, and I think all viewers could identify these as AI. However, since the advent of TikTok’s text-to-speech narration feature, the public has become more accustomed to artificial narration, and there are many situations where this type of AI would work well. Source Prices for AI Studio start at $30 per month. Pros: The platform’s intuitive features make it excellent for beginners with limited or no video creation experience. Cons: The AI Studio avatars are identifiable as being artificial. Best for: Marketing videos that need text-to-speech narration and have visuals for B-roll. 7. Veed.io Source With Veed.io, you can use custom text, colors, font, and music to create a unique video for your brand. One of its standout features is Auto Transcribe. You can upload your video, hit the Auto Transcribe button, and immediately download the script. Even better, there is no software to download, and the platform is easy to use for those without video editing experience. My experience: I entered my “Pinterest marketing for beginners” prompt, and Veed.io quickly generated a short vertical video. The AI video generator automatically provided the script, AI narration, background music, stock videos, and close captioning. The on-screen captions were really engaging, using color-changing text and emojis — perfect for social media. Source Veed.io is free to use for videos under 10 minutes. To access more features, prices start at $18 per month (when billed annually) and go all the way up to enterprise custom pricing. Pros: The pacing, on-screen captions, slang, and approach were very engaging. Cons: The stock video that was automatically inserted into the video was off-topic at times but can be easily edited. Best for: Short-form videos designed to hold attention on social media. 8. Synthesia Source Synthesia's AI video generator enables users to create professional videos without requiring cameras, actors, or studios. Users can generate videos featuring realistic AI avatars that deliver content in over 140 languages by simply inputting text. This makes it an ideal tool for efficiently and at scale creating training materials, sales and marketing content, and internal communications. My experience: Synthesia's intuitive interface and extensive customization options make video creation straightforward. The platform's diverse range of avatars and multilingual support allowed me to produce engaging content tailored to a global audience. The quality of the AI-generated avatars is impressive, closely mimicking human expressions and speech patterns. Synthesia offers a free plan that includes 3 minutes of video per month, 9 AI avatars, and access to AI voices in 140+ languages. Paid plans are available for users requiring more features. Pros: Synthesia simplifies video creation with its intuitive interface and realistic AI avatars. Its support for over 140 languages makes it an excellent tool for creating global content. Cons: The free plan has limited features and is suitable only for basic use. Best for: Businesses and individuals seeking to create professional training videos, marketing content, or internal communications featuring AI avatars, especially when targeting a multilingual audience. 9. Elai.io Source Elai is simple and requires no video editing skills. To use Elai, copy and paste a blog post URL or HTML text, choose a template from its library, and let the generator do the rest. This AI video maker is specialized in corporate learning. Once the video is complete, review it to make any changes before rendering and downloading it. My experience: I found that Elai's format is unique. Even though the AI avatar doesn’t pass as a real human, its small display size makes it feel less distracting. The avatar compliments these videos instead of dominating them. I also really like the audio options: you can upload an audio file of you speaking, and Elai will generate a realistic AI avatar to narrate the text. Source Elai has over 60 languages and 25 avatars to choose from. You can use Elai for free with a 1-minute credit. For more features, Elai’s plans start at $23 per month (billed annually). Pros: As a specialized AI video generator, this tool allows you to quickly create training videos for new hires or product onboarding videos. Cons: Being a platform specialized for educational videos, it would be more time-consuming to create general marketing videos. Best for: Generating videos at scale and creating training videos and product videos. 10. Colossyan Source Colossyan provides a diverse range of avatars who can recite your script in various languages. You can also customize your avatar’s outfit. Colossyan’s key features are auto translations, subtitles, and the ability to enhance messages via screen recording. My experience: The AI avatar options from Colossyan are advanced. You can add multiple AI avatars to a single video screen in the video creation workflow, starting a “conversation.” You can even customize the pauses between speakers. Source There’s a free trial, and the prices start at $19 per month (when billed annually). Pros: The advanced avatar options make this a highly customizable AI video generator. Cons: The sound of the AI narrators isn’t the most natural-sounding. Best for: Creating training videos and explainers for workplace learning. 11. FlexClip Source This AI video generator features hundreds of video templates, AI-generated subtitles, background remover, and a text-to-speech engine. And its intuitive interface makes it simple for creators at any skill level. My experience: I created my video by inputting a URL and letting FlexClip automatically pull content from my website. The AI generator took an enormous amount of work out of the video creation process, but still required editing. The pacing of the video was slower than other AI tools, but I was able to easily customize all elements of the video. Source After the free plan, pricing starts at $9.99 per month (when billed annually, which saves 50%). Pros: The basic plan's price point makes this a very budget-friendly AI video generator. It is also a great, straightforward option for beginners who don’t want to feel overwhelmed. Cons: The AI-generated first draft requires more editing than some of the other platforms. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. 12. Wave Video Source Wave Video is a popular choice among content creators thanks to its many tools, which include image and video assets, text overlay effects, audio, and captions. The platform also provides a variety of video formats for Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and website-based applications. Other key features are: Text-to-video AI. Video hosting. Voiceovers. Text-to-speech. Millions of stock assets. My experience: I tested Wave Video by inserting a blog post URL and letting the AI video generator populate text and graphics based on the content. The video background graphics, pacing, and text populated on the slides needed significant editing to be ready for viewers. I like how easy it is to change the video format and edit any of the content. Wave Video also has many live-stream video tools. Source Wave Video is free, with monthly plans starting at $16 (paid annually). Pros: The features of this software are very beginner-friendly, and the user interface doesn’t feel overwhelming. Cons: The stock images it pulled were lower quality than the other AI tools. The images were blurry and stayed on screen much too long before switching slides (video pacing needed editing). Best for: Livestream videos. Making the Most of AI Video How will AI-generated video help your brand? With just a few clicks, you can create amazing videos, which was unimaginable a few years ago.
