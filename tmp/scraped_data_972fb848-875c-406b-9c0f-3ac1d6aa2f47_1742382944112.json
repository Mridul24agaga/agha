Here's what we found. In today's world of powerful generative AI tools, having a top-tier AI video generator in your metaphorical back pocket is like having your own personal Hollywood film crew at your service. In fact, AI video generators are now so capable that major brands are switching from old video production methods to these modern AI-powered ones. Even the Tribeca Film Festival and other players in the film industry are jumping aboard the AI movement, highlighting just how dynamic and impressive these tools are becoming. But if you're reading this and think it sounds like AI video generators are just for the creative pros, don't worry because that's not the case. With AI text-to-video, AI-generated avatars, and tons of other awesome new AI video features, literally anyone can create unbelievably high-quality content. I made this anime trailer, and I think it‚Äôs pretty cool. The pictures, animation, and even the song were all generated by AI. Let me break down the process and tell you how it was done üëá pic.twitter.com/Y117zidiei ‚Äî Framer üá±üáπ (@0xFramer) August 22, 2024 But with so many options flooding the market, it can be tough to figure out which tool is the right fit for you. Each promises to be the best, but how do you know which will deliver on that promise and actually be the best AI video generator? We made this guide to help you navigate the crowded field and find the tool that suits your needs. We've carefully selected and reviewed seven top contenders, focusing on what they offer, where they excel, and where they might fall short. So, if you've ever wondered, \"What is the best AI video generator?\" you're in the right place. What is an AI video generator? In the simplest of terms, an AI video generator is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to automate the video creation process. Instead of manually editing clips, adding effects, and syncing audio, these tools handle the heavy lifting for you. You just input text, images, or other media, and AI turns that into a complete video through text to video generation. By using AI, these tools automatically select the best visuals, create smooth transitions, and even generate voiceovers with realistic AI avatars. This means you can focus more on crafting your message and less on getting bogged down in the technical details. How do AI video generators work? AI video generators work by using advanced algorithms to analyze and process your input, whether it‚Äôs text, images, or other media. When you provide the content, the AI interprets it and makes decisions about how to structure the video. This includes selecting visuals, syncing audio, and applying effects‚Äîall in a matter of minutes. ‚ú® From Photo AI image to video with @LumaLabsAI's video model that came out today called Dream Machine It's absolutely state of the art and the best video model available right now I think It's able to highly accurately predict 3d surroundings from just a photo, I think up‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/KDetDBdGIS ‚Äî @levelsio (@levelsio) June 13, 2024 At the core of these tools is machine learning, which allows the AI to improve over time. The more data it processes, the better it becomes at making creative decisions that result in high-quality videos. For example, if you input a script, the AI video tool can generate corresponding scenes, choose relevant images or video clips, and even create a voiceover. The process is surprisingly intuitive. You simply provide the material, and the AI organizes it into a cohesive video that aligns with your vision. How we chose the best AI video generators To ensure you pick the best AI video generators and generative AI editing tools, we chose products that truly deliver on their promises of creating amazing videos. No matter how skilled you are at video editing, you need an AI tool that simplifies the process. Next, we evaluated the range of features. A great AI video maker should offer more than just basic editing‚Äîit should allow you to customize and tweak your video clips until they look like they were made by a professional film crew. We also compared the pricing plans, ensuring that they offer a solid mix of features without breaking the bank. Our goal was to find tools that help you save time and money. ‚Äç 1. AI Studios by Deepbrain AI DeepBrain AI‚Äôs video generator is a robust all-in-one tool that brings realistic AI avatars, natural text-to-speech, and intuitive video creation into one seamless platform. Whether you‚Äôre making educational videos, marketing content, or AI-powered presentations, it streamlines the entire process with easy-to-use tools and customizable features. The standout feature here? 150+ ready-to-use AI avatars that instantly add a human touch to your content. You can pair these avatars with lifelike AI voices, customize their look, and even use templates to get a head start. Tools like script generation, voice cloning, and text-to-speech make content creation feel effortless, even if you‚Äôre not a video editing pro. Why we like AI Studios by Deepbrain AI: New and powerful For teams, DeepBrain AI shines with collaborative features that let you sync up in a shared workspace. Add to that the ability to export videos in multiple formats, and you‚Äôve got a powerful tool for turning ideas into polished videos ‚Äì fast. Whether you're experimenting with the free plan or scaling up with Team and Enterprise options, the flexibility here ensures there‚Äôs something for everyone. Where AI Studios could improve We love the power and usability of this tool, but since they are relatively new to the space, they could benefit from more brand recognition. Once more people are familiar with this tool and how it can help with creative workflow, we are confident it will be a go-to product for designers and creatives of all stripes. Pricing options: Free plan ($0.00) Personal ($24.00/month) Team ($55.00/month) Enterprise (Custom) 2. Luma Dream Machine Dream Machine by Luma Labs is a video creation tool that uses AI to generate extremely lifelike videos. You can quickly turn your images or text prompts into professional-looking clips. The process of creating a video takes just a couple of minutes. Each video is about five seconds long and can include multiple shots, making them richer and more detailed than many competitors‚Äô outputs. During my tests, some videos were ready quickly, while others took longer, but all captured motion better than any other tool I‚Äôve tried. Whether you're crafting an epic scene or a visually intense moment, Dream Machine captures the essence of storytelling with visuals that feel straight out of Hollywood. Created product mockup videos with Luma Dream Machine V1.5 text-to-video model, and I‚Äôm really happy with the results. You can find the prompts in the thread, and you can use the same ones with Midjourney or Flux.#LumaDreamMachine pic.twitter.com/VISWZK8TEp ‚Äî Gizem Akdag (@gizakdag) August 21, 2024 Why we like Dream Machine: Most cinematic If you're a creator with a flair for the cinematic, you're going to love making videos with Dream Machine. What really stands out is that you don't need precise details for motion areas, Dream Machine still manages to capture motion concepts effectively. Itfollows the laws of physics, ensuring that every shot feels grounded and realistic. Plus, it‚Äôs super fast! As their website mentions, Dream Machine can currently produce 120 frames in 120 seconds, which is not too shabby to say the least. Where Dream Machine could improve Although Dream Machine is generally fast, some users have experienced slower processing times when working on intricate projects with a lot of elements. The discard rate can be around 98% with Reddit users pointing that most of the videos generated are unusable because of random elements, incorrect motion, or distortion. Pricing options: Free Plan ($0.00) Lite Plan ($7.99/month) Standard Plan ($23.99/month) Plus Plan ($51.99/month) Pro Plan ($79.99/month) 3. Runway Gen-3 Alpha Runway calls their latest model, Gen-3 Alpha, the new frontier for video generation, and we are here to say that they could definitely be right. The Gen-3 Alpha supports text to video, image to video, advanced camera control, multi motion brush, and after testing some of these features out, we were seriously impressed by how smooth and sharp the results are. The video creation workflow feels super streamlined, thanks to the improved fidelity and motion‚Äîit‚Äôs clear this model was built for powerful things. Add expressiveness and intention to your generations with Multi Motion Brush. Learn how with today's Runway Academy: https://t.co/EUbxc4aA0D pic.twitter.com/qredD7vsXu ‚Äî Runway (@runwayml) January 23, 2024 Why we like Runway: Most dynamic Runway's Gen-3 Alpha is one of the most impressive AI video generators we‚Äôve come across. Not only is it a powerful tool for video that makes content creation seem limitless, but it has a shockingly friendly interface and is easy to use. With the Multi Motion Brush, you can select up to five areas with independent motion and control across 3 directional axis (x, y, z) for more precise and expressive generations. Another highlight is how well it handles human-like characters. The AI generates lifelike figures with natural expressions and gestures, adding a level of realism that‚Äôs hard to beat. We aren't exaggerating when we say you'll likely be blown away by what you generate with this tool. The videos are truly cinematic and offer an exciting glimpse into the future of creativity. Where Runway could improve Runway is an extraordinary tool, so it is hard to say where it can improve. Of course, with such a dynamic AI video generator comes cost, which might be the only thing holding back casual users or if you're on a budget. Plus, it is true that sometimes the final results might look a little \"wonky,\" but overall the quality is top-tier. Pricing options: Basic Plan ($0 per editor per month) Standard Plan ($12 per user per month, billed annually as $144) Pro Plan ($28 per user per month, billed annually as $336) Unlimited Plan ($76 per user per month, billed annually as $912) Enterprise Plan (Customized with Runway team) 4. Hailuo AI Hailuo AI is an AI-powered video generator designed to make content creation simple but still extraordinary. Whether you‚Äôre making cinematic videos for marketing, detailedproduct explainers, or social media ads, this tool automates the heavy lifting‚Äîgiving you professional-looking results in minutes. Instead of spending hours fine-tuning every frame, creators can focus on storytelling while the AI ensures smooth motion, clean edits, and stunning visuals. #Hailuo AI is absolutely insane for creating Hollywood-style blockbuster scenes! üé¨üî• Every test is a thrill pic.twitter.com/idaAJWb2BZ ‚Äî Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) March 6, 2025 Why we like Hailuo AI: Fast yet eye-popping For businesses and content creators who need speed, flexibility, and truly remarkable videos, Hailuo AI delivers. One of the standout features is its customizable templates, which allow users to tweak layouts, colors, and visual styles without advanced editing skills. So regardless of what kind of content you ar making, whether it's onboarding video or a marketing campaign, Hailuo AI makes sure your content looks tailored, not cookie-cutter. Where Hailuo AI Could Improve While the AI does a great job with automation, some users may find the customization options a bit limited. For example, while templates are helpful, they don‚Äôt always allow for fine-grained control over pacing and scene composition. Additionally, industries needing highly specific branding‚Äîlike film production or high-end advertising‚Äîmight need more flexibility in motion effects and camera angles. Pricing options: Standard plan ($14.90 per month) Unlimited plan ($94.90 per month) 5. Kling AI The Kling AI video generator produces highly realistic 1080p videos up to two minutes long, all from a single prompt. The key difference? It doesn‚Äôt just generate good-looking footage‚Äîit ensures movements and physics behave naturally, making everything feel more lifelike. Have an Amazing Day!‚òÄÔ∏èüôÇ‚òïÔ∏è Name: Flower Care Made with @Kling_ai 1.6 Text to Video#AIart Good Monday #MondayMotivation #Mondayvibes pic.twitter.com/MEvNj9HVrw ‚Äî Jay Kay (@JayKay65220066) March 10, 2025 Why we like Kling AI: Smooth, natural motion What sets Kling apart is how well it captures human motion and expression. Thanks to its 3D face and body reconstruction technology, characters move fluidly and show natural emotions‚Äîall from a single image. Its physics engine also shines, allowing for believable object interactions and environments that behave like real-world scenes. Whether you're creating short films, virtual influencers, or AI-generated marketing content, Kling delivers a level of realism that‚Äôs hard to match. Where Kling AI could improve While Kling is impressive, it‚Äôs not perfect. Some users report slow processing times, especially for highly detailed scenes. Occasionally, minor inconsistencies appear, like hand distortions or subtle motion glitches. More control over camera angles and fine-tuning details would make it even stronger for professional creators. Pricing options: Basic (free) Standard ($72.90 yearly) Pro ($293.04 yearly) Premier ($728.64 yearly) 6. revid AI This tool might be new on the scene, but for improving video productivity for socials, revid is quickly becoming one of our favorites. Their mission is all about helping creators like you make short videos that have a potential to go viral. Why we like revid AI: Best for social media What we like most about revid AI is that it has a specific focus. The AI does the heavy lifting from finding ideas, adding sound effects, creating scripts, and then transforming everything into viral videos for your social media content. It‚Äôs a company that knows its lane, and we can certainly appreciate its dedication to being the master of one instead of the jack of all AI video trades. Where revid AI could improve The main drawback with revid AI is that it is niche. This is fine if you need this specific type of content, but it may be lacking if you're searching for a more powerful tool. Pricing options Hobby ($49/month) Growth (Launch offer $49/month) Ultra ($199/month) 7. Colossyan Whether you're making screen recordings for employee training, video marketing content for social media platforms, or educational videos for compliance training, Colossyan offers features that simplify video making for established businesses. Why we like Colossyan: Best for large businesses Colossyan is awesome with AI video editing, offering tools like prompt to video and AI script assistants that help you create excellent videos without needing tons of experience. While it is definitely on the more corporate side of video creation, we saw this tool streamline the creation process and make it easy to produce high-quality generated videos super fast and efficiently. Plus, Colossyan‚Äôs extensive library of AI avatars and multilingual support make it a nice choice for large companies and diverse clients. Where Colossyan could improve While Colossyan has a ton of cool features, it may require a bit of a learning curve for those new to AI video tools. The sheer number of options, from AI avatars to multiple export formats, can be overwhelming for beginners. Pricing options Starter Plan ($19/month, annually) Pro Plan ($61/month, billed annually) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 8. HeyGen HeyGen is one of the more impressive platforms we tested. A big reason for this is because it is hassle-free and easy to use, so jumping in was a simple process. More specifically, HeyGen is one of the best when it comes to generating AI avatars. The process of creating a HeyGen avatar boils down to three steps: choosing or creating an avatar, recording or choosing a voice to go with it, selecting a video template, then letting HeyGen put it all together in a matter of minutes. Why we like HeyGen: Most intriguing video generator One of the coolest features of HeyGen is its AI avatars, which are constantly evolving. The platform frequently updates these avatars to include enhanced visual details, expanded speech abilities, and more lifelike animations. Another great feature is the change videos to multiple langauges. HeyGen allows you to create videos in over forty languages from your original video, letting you reach audiences from all parts of the world. Where HeyGen could improve While HeyGen offers a lot of flexibility, the pricing for the Team plan might be higher for smaller teams or individual creators. Additionally, the Free plan, although great for beginners, limits users to just 3 videos per month, which may not be enough for those who need to produce content regularly. Pricing options Free Plan ($0) Creator Plan ($24/mo) Team Plan ($69/seat/mo) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 9. Haiper AI After diving into Haiper AI, we quickly realized it‚Äôs a promising tool for anyone looking to explore the world of AI-driven video creation. One of the first things that stood out to us is how Haiper AI makes the video creation process both accessible and efficient, even for those just starting. With just 3 images, @escelce transported us through 3 different universes, holy cow! #KeyframeConditioning #AIvideo #MadeWithHaiper https://t.co/6FwlLObhIK pic.twitter.com/JZdJOq3QMb ‚Äî Haiper AI (@HaiperGenAI) August 19, 2024 Why we like Haiper AI: Best for beginners What we appreciated most about Haiper AI is its flexibility and how user friendly it was. The platform allows for up to 10 creations per day on the Free plan, which is generous for a no-cost option. That, on top of the text-to-speech feature helps make Haiper a solid tool. For those who need more, the Explorer and Pro plans offer expanded features that cater to different levels of use. Where Haiper AI could improve One of the primary limitations is that the Free plan doesn‚Äôt allow for commercial use or watermark-free videos. This might be a dealbreaker for users who need to produce content for business purposes but aren‚Äôt ready to invest in a paid plan. Pricing options Free Plan (Beta, $0/month): Explorer Plan (Beta, $8/month, billed yearly) Pro Plan (Beta, $24/month, billed yearly) Enterprise APIs (Custom Pricing) ‚Äç 10. Synthesia Synthesia is a game-changer for simplifying the process of making (sometimes scarily) realistic AI avatars. With simple text-based prompts, Synthesia turns your script into a polished, video ready project featuring life-like avatars. Why we like Synthesia: Excellent for avatars Even if you're new to video Synthesia has an intuitive interface that makes creating and editing your video feel straightforward. You simply choose an avatar, input your text prompts, and watch as the AI works its magic, transforming your words into engaging content. Plus, the AI video editor allows you to tweak and refine your video, so you can take the time to make those small changes that really make your vision come to life. So whether it is explainer videos, content creation for blog posts, or other marketing projects, Synthesia is excellent for businesses who want to make videos for their products or services. Where Synthesia could improve One of the main limitations is the degree of control available for the AI avatars. The avatars do look polished, but the options for appearance and expressions are somewhat limited compared to more advanced tools. Pricing Options Free Plan (‚Ç¨0/mo) Starter Plan (‚Ç¨20/mo) Creator Plan (‚Ç¨59/mo) Enterprise Plan (custom pricing) ‚Äç ‚Äç Wrapping up: The future of AI Video Tools AI in video and avatar creation has come a long way. From quirky results to making videos you‚Äôd swear were real, AI's gotten pretty good at this stuff. But the trick isn‚Äôt just making videos look real‚Äîit‚Äôs about getting them to move right, too. With tools like Luma Labs‚Äô Dream Machine or Synthesia, we see how far AI can go in understanding motion and realistic avatars. These advancements are opening doors to new ways to create and tell stories, and brands like Mcdonald's Japan aren't afraid to test it out. These tools aren't here to replace humans in the creative process; but to make it possible to do more, to be even more innovative, without needing blockbuster budgets. Thanks to AI, we‚Äôre moving toward a future where anyone can produce a mini-movie or use avatars for product demos. It‚Äôs exciting to think about how these tools will help us all be more creative and bring our wildest ideas to life. So, go ahead and play around with these AI video generators. See how they can improve your video project workflow or let you experiment with digital avatars. They're here to help, not to take over.

In fact, according to our AI in Marketing Statistics 2024, 80% of marketers have used ‚Äì or currently use ‚Äì AI tools to help them create marketing content. But, of course, not every AI tool is worth your time. We tested 13 AI video generators ‚Äì looking at things like quality, load time, cost, and more ‚Äì to really separate the best from the rest. Sure, all of these AI tools have their own impressive marketing videos. But we dug beyond that, really testing out the features for ourselves, in order to find out what the final product really looks like. So, if you‚Äôre looking to explore AI video generation in 2024, read on to find out which is the best platform to invest your time and money into. Why use AI video generators anyway? The best AI video generators are going to help you save time and money while increasing your video content output. Note that we said ‚Äòincreasing‚Äô ‚Äì an AI video generator should not be your sole way of making video content. The technology just simply isn‚Äôt good enough yet. And consumers are EXPERTS on video content these days. They sure watch enough of it! Statistic People on average watch 17 hours of online video content per week. Source: Wyzowl Video Marketing Statistics 2023 Viewers will 100% know the difference between AI generated videos and videos created by experts. It‚Äôs hard enough getting people to watch a professionally made video all the way through so don‚Äôt waste your time trying to get people to watch a bunch of AI content. Our Insight By all means use AI video generators to convert your blog articles into videos or for fun short-lived social content, but NOT to create the explainer video that introduces your brand to the world. The 13 AI video generators we tested 1. Pictory Pictory is an AI tool that makes it easy for you to turn other forms of content into highly shareable videos. Pictory has a lot of useful guides that really do make it easy to get started with AI video. And the platform holds your hand while you‚Äôre making your first video ‚Äì but not in a way that‚Äôs annoying or overbearing. The finished video project was‚Ä¶okay. But the reliance on stock footage and simple transitions means that videos made on Pictory won‚Äôt really stand out among the crowd. Plus, the closing watermark is unnecessarily long. Pros: ‚Äì Easy to use ‚Äì It‚Äôs fast ‚Äì The voiceovers sound real Cons: ‚Äì A lot of the video assets are for paying users only, which makes it difficult to get a true experience on the free trial Pictory Pricing Starter ‚Äì $23/month Professional ‚Äì $47/month Teams ‚Äì $119/month Our rating 2. Synthesys Synthesys is a platform for creating AI content at scale. Using only text, you can create voiceovers, videos, and AI generated images. There‚Äôs a large array of templates that make it really easy to get started. However, this could also make it harder to differentiate your videos from ones that other users have created. For the purposes of this article, we created a vertical video that would be perfect for social media. The platform is easy enough to use but does feel slow and kind of clunky in places. Unfortunately, the AI voiceover got the platform‚Äôs own brand name incorrect. Pros: ‚Äì Easy to use ‚Äì Nice templates ‚Äì There‚Äôs a free plan Cons: ‚Äì It‚Äôs slow and kind of clunky Synthesys Pricing Free Creator ‚Äì $59/month Business ‚Äì $99/month Our rating 3. Synthesia Synthesia is a text to video AI platform. You just enter your script and select from over 160 diverse avatars. You can also pick a realistic voiceover (in one of 130+ languages) and even add cool little micro details like gestures, pauses and diction. You can personalise the video background, add media, use your own brands and fonts, plus add music and transitions. All in all, you can end up with a really slick looking video here in a very short amount of time. Pros: ‚Äì Micro gestures elevate the quality ‚Äì It‚Äôs fast ‚Äì Huge selection Cons: ‚Äì The lip syncing could be better Synthesia Pricing Free Starter ‚Äì ¬£23/month Creator ‚Äì ¬£69/month Enterprise ‚Äì Enquiries only Our rating 4. Deepbrain Deepbrain is another AI video generator that specialises in text to video and realistic-looking avatars. You just enter your script, select an avatar, add any finishing touches, et voila ‚Äì you have a video! There‚Äôs a lot of choice when it comes to the avatars and voices, plus you can convert text to speech in over 80 different languages right within their script editor. The script editor is also integrated with ChatGPT so you can even use it to generate ideas for your videos. Overall, the tool is quick, easy to use, and quite intuitive when creating your video. However, processing time can be slow and we were honestly disappointed with the end result after testing others on the list: Pros: ‚Äì Integrated with ChatGPT ‚Äì Large selection of languages, voices, and avatars ‚Äì Easy to use Cons: ‚Äì The resulting video looked quite unnatural Deepbrain Pricing Starter ‚Äì $30/month Pro ‚Äì $225/month Enterprise ‚Äì Enquiries only Our rating 5. Invideo Invideo is an online video editor that allows users to create videos with text prompts. The platform uses AI to generate visuals and a voiceover to match your script. Alternatively, if you don‚Äôt have a script then the AI can help you create one from a single prompt. However, we asked for a 10 second script and were given a 35 second one so it‚Äôs necessary to edit your script to fit your specific requirements. We found this AI video generator difficult to use, to be honest. The templates are very specific to certain industries and topics, and even if you do start from scratch you have to let Invideo present you with visuals first before you can start tweaking and changing them. Plus, the suggestions given were pretty random. Take this scene with the racecar, for example. The audio paired with this also sounded like a babbling brook ‚Äì interesting choice! You might be asking why we aren‚Äôt sharing a video for this one and that‚Äôs because you can‚Äôt export your files without upgrading to a paid plan. You can share via a link, but the link expires quickly. We definitely weren‚Äôt wow-ed by this one. Pros: ‚Äì AI helps give you a head start ‚Äì There‚Äôs the option to make vertical videos Cons: ‚Äì No free plan ‚Äì Feels clunky and hard to use Invideo Pricing Business ‚Äì $30/month Unlimited ‚Äì $60/month Our rating 6. HeyGen HeyGen is an AI video generator that makes it easy and fun to produce studio-quality videos with AI-generated avatars and voices. This platform is so slick and intuitive. It‚Äôs a joy to use, you can go for landscape or portrait videos, and you can even use the CEO as an avatar for your video ‚Äì which is what we did! You can get started from scratch or use a template. The video editor is user-friendly and the only gripe we had was that it wasn‚Äôt obvious how to find stock assets. However, once we found those (under Elements > Video/Image > See all) we didn‚Äôt have any complaints. There‚Äôs no option to preview the lip sync functionality (although that seems standard for the industry) before you‚Äôve rendered your video. But when you do ‚Äì wow. We think HeyGen might have the best AI lip syncing out of every platform on the list. The avatar looks super natural while not giving off that ‚Äòuncanny valley‚Äô feeling that some others do. Pros: ‚Äì You can play around for free ‚Äì Impressive avatars and AI voices ‚Äì Super intuitive Cons: ‚Äì It‚Äôs one of the more expensive platforms on the list HeyGen Pricing Free Creator ‚Äì $59/month Business ‚Äì $179/month Enterprise ‚Äì Enquiries only Our rating 7. Veed Veed is a popular online video editing tool with tons of amazing features, but for the purposes of this article we‚Äôre going to focus solely on their AI offering. As you‚Äôd expect from Veed, the AI video generator is intuitive and easy to use. You can create basic videos pretty quickly either using your own voice and stock footage or with an AI avatar. The AI voiceovers are realistic and so are the avatars, with the lip syncing standing out as particularly impressive. Pros: ‚Äì You can get started for free ‚Äì Super easy to use ‚Äì Transcription and subtitles are completely auto-generated Cons: ‚Äì Limited customisation options Veed Pricing Free Basic ‚Äì ¬£10/month Pro ‚Äì ¬£18/month Business ‚Äì ¬£49/month Our rating 8. Fliki Fliki is an AI video generator that can create complete videos from just simple ideas. All you need to do is enter some text that describes what you‚Äôd like your video to be about, select the length and aspect ratio, and you‚Äôre good to go. Of course, as with any AI video generator, you‚Äôll want to personalise your video a little. But the fact that Fliki gives you the bare bones to get started with can be a real time saver. The software itself can create professional-looking videos that have awesome subtitles and AI-generated voiceovers. However, when you‚Äôre looking to add your own personal touch to the video you may struggle on the limited free plan. Pros: ‚Äì So quick and intuitive ‚Äì Realistic voiceovers ‚Äì Great automatic subtitling Cons: ‚Äì You need a paid account to benefit from a more extensive stock footage library and AI avatars Fliki Pricing Free Standard ‚Äì $21/month Premium ‚Äì $66/month Our rating 9. Colossyan Colossyan is an AI video platform aimed at companies that want to create workplace learning and training videos. There are lots of templates to choose from or you can create your video from scratch. The editor is simple and easy to use, giving users the option to select different avatars, add background elements, text, music, and more. Like other AI platforms, you can‚Äôt see what the lip sync of the AI avatar is going to look like until the video is rendered. Speaking of rendering, we found Colossyan somewhat slower than other tools in this area. Pros: ‚Äì User-friendly platform ‚Äì AI avatars look great and natural ‚Äì Generous stock assets library Cons: ‚Äì Slow to render and it‚Äôs unfortunate that the pronunciation of AI is incorrect in the video we made ‚Äì No free version Colossyan Pricing Starter ‚Äì $27/month Pro ‚Äì $87/month Enterprise ‚Äì Enquiries only Our rating 10. Elai Elai is everything you could want in an AI video generator, and then some. The site is clean and easy to use. You can create your video from a template, from an AI storyboard, or using an AI avatar. We decided to start with the AI storyboard because we hadn‚Äôt seen that offered on other platforms. All you need to do to get started is enter a topic: Elai then generates a video outline that you can adjust as needed. Once you have your storyboard, you can of course make further edits. You can make wholesale changes or use AI to make quick and easy adjustments, like ‚Äòmake it shorter‚Äô and ‚Äòsound happier‚Äô. When you‚Äôre happy with your video, you can render the finished product in 4K. Overall, we found Elai to be a really intuitive and impressive AI video generator. Pros: ‚Äì Easy to use ‚Äì Quick and intuitive ‚Äì Impressive range of features Cons: ‚Äì The free package does have limitations Elai Pricing Free Basic ‚Äì $23/month Advanced ‚Äì $100/month Enterprise ‚Äì Enquiries only Our rating 11. Runway Runway is kind of different to the other video generators on this list. To create a video you need to upload an image and then add a text prompt, like so: Now, you‚Äôre probably thinking: ‚ÄòHmm, it doesn‚Äôt sound that different?‚Äô But it‚Äôs what comes next that‚Äôs different. Other video tools on this list seem to use AI to create fresh ideas using prompts as inspiration, whereas Runway adds animation to the actual image itself, like this: You can use a motion brush to control different areas of the video, but this still gives very limited movement options. You may think the video with the puppies doesn‚Äôt look too bad. But we found that using humans makes things a whole lot creepier: The prompt for this one was ‚Äòthe writer drinks her coffee‚Äô Now, is it better when just using a text prompt (no images)? ‚Ä¶no. Pros: ‚Äì You can play around for free ‚Äì It generates new content quickly Cons: ‚Äì There‚Äôs much better technology out there ‚Äì It‚Äôs way too creepy ‚Äì Very limited customisation Runway Pricing Free Standard ‚Äì $15/month Pro ‚Äì $35/month Unlimited ‚Äì $95/month Enterprise ‚Äì Enquiries only Our rating 12. Visla Visla is an AI video creation and editing service that allows users to generate videos using high quality stock footage. You can generate videos from blog articles, scripts, or simply a written or spoken idea. The platform works quickly and it‚Äôs easy enough to edit videos. The biggest difficulty we found as users on the Free plan is that Visla highlights the premium features and assets first, so it can be difficult to find one suitable to use on the free plan. Unfortunately, this platform has no AI avatars on offer and the watermark at the end adds almost 5 seconds to your video. Pros: ‚Äì It‚Äôs free to get started ‚Äì It‚Äôs fast ‚Äì Different languages (including German, Italian, Spanish, and more) are supported Cons: ‚Äì Animated watermark adds length to the video ‚Äì It can be difficult to find free features and assets Visla Pricing Free Premium ‚Äì $24/month Our rating 13. Hour one Hour One claims to help users ‚Äòcreate, manage, and streamline cinematic AI avatar videos.‚Äô And the platform really is slick. It‚Äôs quick and easy to get started for free, and you can even clone your own voice for the voiceover. One of the downsides of the platform is that it can be slow to render videos, but it does keep you updated on progress. The lip syncing is impressive but lacking in emotion. Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt download without paying for premium so we have no example to show for Hour One. Pros: ‚Äì Get started for free ‚Äì Impressive lip syncing ‚Äì Slick, easy-to-use platform Cons: ‚Äì You can‚Äôt download videos on the free plan Hour One Pricing Free Lite ‚Äì $30/month Business ‚Äì $112/month Enterprise ‚Äì Enquiries only Our rating The 4 best AI video generators 1. Elai ‚Äì It‚Äôs really user-friendly and intuitive, plus you can get started for free. 2. HeyGen ‚Äì Super impressive AI avatars and voices. It‚Äôs easy to get started with templates. 3. Veed ‚Äì It‚Äôs free, quick, and easy to make professional-looking videos. 4. Synthesia ‚Äì So easy to use and tons of realistic AI avatars to choose from. Final thoughts All of these AI video generators have pros and cons, and we‚Äôre sure that the best choice will be completely different for everyone. It all depends on your budget and requirements.

An AI video generator is a tool that generates videos from descriptions using artificial intelligence algorithms. These text-to-video generators use AI to create or enhance video content from text inputted by users. AI video generation helps craft high-quality videos without the need for expensive equipment, actors, or even video editing skills. What is the best AI video generator? The text-to-video feature in the AI video creator quickly generates videos from text with AI avatars and voices, making it the best text-to-video generator AI. Choose your ideal avatar, type your script, and generate talking head videos for your product releases, explainer videos, and more in minutes. What is a talking head video? A talking head video is one of the most common types of video used for e-Learning. It features a person, or the ‚ÄúSubject-Matter Expert‚Äù (SME), who directly addresses the viewer in an interview-like format. This video type is often shot from the chest or waist upwards, with the presenter either standing or sitting. Because of their human elements, talking head videos are suitable for building trust and connection with the target viewers. What differentiates talking head videos from other video types? What sets talking head videos apart from other video types is they let SMEs or instructors communicate directly through the camera, as if they're having a one-to-one conversation with learners. Talking head videos are ideal for brief and straightforward learning sessions, which users can access on their own time. With tools like an AI video generator from text, you can break down lengthy presentations into a series of shorter clips. Can AI create videos from text? Yes, it can! Type in the script you want the avatar to narrate or speak and choose from 300+ voices available in 40+ languages. Then, watch as AI generates your video in minutes. Use the AI video maker to turn your script into talking head videos with customizable AI avatars. Omg I love you guys! Thanks for making it so easy for me to use your templates.

Make a Video Updated: 12/10/24 Published: 06/16/23 Videos are integral to any marketing campaign; however, they can be tedious and difficult to create if you aren‚Äôt savvy with editing or are short on time. Fortunately, you can leverage many AI video generators to streamline your production and create content that engages your audience. But what‚Äôs the best AI video generator for your tasks? This article will explore 12 different AI video generators, their features, and how you can best use them in your next video marketing campaign. Time to press play on easier video creation. Table of Contents Can AI make videos? How to Make AI Videos Transforming Text to Video With AI What makes a great AI video generator? Best AI Video Generators Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video Can AI make videos? Yes, AI can make videos. AI video generators can instantly produce basic presentation slides with text, B-roll, and background music, all the way up to advanced videos of lifelike AI avatars ‚Äúspeaking‚Äù to you. AI‚Äôs impressive ‚Äî but it‚Äôs not perfect. What works well with AI video generators: Video scripts. Being able to generate video scripts in a few seconds is incredible and saves so much time. Stock imagery, B-roll, and background music. Even though it still requires editing, having multimedia pulled automatically for you by the video generator makes it feel like you have an assistant. Video editing. The video editing capabilities are incredible and often beginner-friendly, which is a huge leap in the video editing world. What isn‚Äôt working (yet): Believability. The realistic AI avatars are incredibly advanced, but the mannerisms and articulation make it obvious that they're, well, AI. Pacing. Much research has been done on how quickly a video moves from scene to scene to hold viewers‚Äô attention, and I found that not all generators factored this into their algorithms. Decision overload. The number of video templates, AI avatars, and effects available can overwhelm the editing process. AI is rapidly advancing, and some of these quirks will soon be pass√©. How to Make AI Videos The process for making an AI video will vary depending on the tool or platform you're using. Some generators work by analyzing and creating a video based on the script you uploaded, while others will follow a prompt typed in by the user. The key is to find a tool or generator with the features you need to create the kind of content you want. Transforming Text to Video With AI When ChatGPT catapulted to popularity in 2022, I don‚Äôt think the average marketers knew just how quickly AI video would follow. It needs to be used ethically to be useful to society, but when leveraged correctly, it‚Äôs an incredible tool. The most sought-after AI video feature is the text-to-video generator. This allows you to type in a sentence and, in a few seconds, be presented with an editable AI-generated video. I tested this feature using two different prompts: A vague prompt: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to educate viewers about AI-generated video.‚Äù A specific prompt: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to inspire beginner marketers to try AI video generation. The video should explain the benefits of AI video generators and should inspire viewers to try this new video tool.‚Äù I used HubSpot‚Äôs free AI video generator Clip Creator, and here‚Äôs what I saw. They were both high-quality videos. Both videos had appropriate stock images and music tailored to human behavior. The content was very similar for both videos. After testing many AI generators, I‚Äôve found that a marketer‚Äôs time is better spent editing rather than making their prompt more specific. No matter how perfect your prompt feels, the end result will still require edits.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now What makes a great AI video generator? So, how does one evaluate all of the different software on the market? The best AI video tools all have a mix of these different features. Intuitive User Interface While most platforms list a long list of fancy AI features, users need an easy-to-use AI studio first and foremost. This enables a quick editing process. AI Scripts Automatically-generated video scripts save an incredible amount of time when producing video content. They turn written content (such as a blog post, email, etc.) or a prompt into spoken language. Sometimes, they even use an AI narrator to read it out loud for you. Not all software can generate video scripts, but it‚Äôs an enormous time saver. To be fair to the software that doesn‚Äôt offer this, it‚Äôs replaceable with a few clicks in ChatGPT. After trying more than a dozen AI video generators, I found the AI scripts were one of the features that made the greatest difference, along with the next feature. Factoring in Human Behavior Some software have tailored their AI to match user behavior, and some haven‚Äôt. For example, most people prefer videos with a brisk pace and visuals that don‚Äôt stay on the screen too long. In the video world, this is referred to as ‚Äúpacing.‚Äù Not all software is tailored for this, and as a result, it will produce slow, lengthy slides that feel like a bad PowerPoint presentation. This isn‚Äôt a detail that software companies list on their ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù page, but it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs apparent based on the first draft of the video that the software gives you. Template Library Start from scratch? What is it, 2018? There‚Äôs no need to start from scratch with video anymore, as most platforms have built-in template libraries. Bonus points if these libraries include variation in: Intended audience. Aspect ratio. Project type. Editing Capabilities It‚Äôs normal for different software to offer different editing options, but most AI studios will cover the basics, such as: Text. Fonts. Music. Colors. Timing. Transitions. Animations. Stock footage. Different video styles. Pricing Tiers (or Free Plan) An AI video generator costs $0 to $50 a month (paid annually). All paid software includes a discount when purchasing an annual package, and the cost of month-to-month service is always higher. I know you‚Äôre on a budget ‚Äî all of the suggested AI tools below are either free or include a free trial/demo. Multilingual Look for software that supports multiple languages if your business requires it. A chart comparing 11 AI Video Generators Chart comparing AI video generators Best AI Video Generators AI video generators have come extremely far in a short time. You can now make professional videos with the numerous text-to-video generation tools on the market. I‚Äôve tried all the most popular AI video generators, so you don‚Äôt have to. Here‚Äôs what I found. 1. Clip Creator Source Clip Creator is the best AI video generator for beginners. It can be used by someone with no video experience and walks you through the video creation process painlessly. You start by answering a few basic questions (like video type), then provide a brief overview of the video you‚Äôd like to create. You can choose from video templates, which are oriented for both landscape videos and vertical videos. Then, Clip Creator uses AI to generate the text on your slides, plus the background imagery. You‚Äôre instantly given a video with editable text, stock images, background music, etc. The video creation workflow is very intuitive. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video My experience: I love how streamlined this AI video creator is. Instead of bombarding you with endless features, options, and pop-ups, Clip Creator starts simple and allows you to make any edits you need after it generates the video. Source Pros: Incredibly intuitive user interface, great customization options, and makes for a very fast and efficient AI video creator. Cons: Smaller template library than paid AI video generators, and no advanced features like realistic AI avatars. Best for: Video creation beginners and marketers on a budget. Most user-friendly interface and best free AI video generator. 2. Pictory Source Pictory is an excellent AI video generator for creators and marketers who don‚Äôt have experience creating videos. All you have to do is provide a script or article to guide your video content. For example, you can submit a blog post to the AI video creator, and Pictory will create a video based on the post that can be used for social media or your website. Furthermore, you can edit videos in minutes by using text. Pictory also includes a feature that creates shareable video highlight reels that can be used as a trailer or a short-form video for social media such as a Reel. Even better, Pictory can automatically caption and summarize your videos.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: I provided the same prompt for Pictory as I did for the Clip Creator video, and it initially generated much less content (only 1 slide). I went back and instead provided a URL of a blog post and tested the blog-to-video generator. This feature automatically creates video scripts based on a blog post, and using their realistic AI voices, I could have it automatically narrated too. The writing on every slide needed to be edited significantly to be useful, but I was impressed with the options. Pictory supports multiple languages (currently English, Spanish, French, and German) and has a huge library of AI voices. Source Prices for Pictory start at $19 per month, and users can try a 2-week free trial. Pros: Users have a lot of options for how to begin their AI-generated videos, and they can thoroughly customize the video output. Cons: The first draft of the automatically-generated videos needs heavy editing. It may be faster to let ChatGPT write a script for you and use that. Best for: Marketers and creators with limited video editing experience who want to convert content like blog posts or webinars into shareable video content. 3. Simplified Source The Simplified AI video generator transforms a long-form video into multiple AI-enhanced clips with just one click. This allows users to create videos from text and make an entirely new video using its accessible editing interface. Simplified simplifies the way we produce content by providing users with easy access to an expansive in-app library that hosts thousands of templates, all available for free. I like that it guarantees exceptional video quality and pairs this with an intuitive, user-friendly interface, ensuring that users can craft high-quality videos without sacrificing ease of use. Its comprehensive suite of features goes beyond basic editing options to include animation enhancements and multilingual translation capabilities, making it a versatile all-in-one tool for video creation. Users can save their brand settings in Simplified‚Äôs ‚Äúbrand book‚Äù is a great time-saving feature. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned professional or just starting, this platform equips you with everything you need to bring your vision to life. Brands like Bloomberg, DuckDuckGo, and Cashify use Simplified for their marketing needs. My experience: I prompted Simplified the same way I prompted the other video generators, and I was immediately asked to describe my target audience and provide my video topic. This was a nice step toward more personalized videos, but it required more user-generated input than Clip Creator, which had a multiple-choice intake process. If you stick to the free plan, it‚Äôs time-consuming to sift through all the features to see what‚Äôs free to use. Source Prices for Simplified include a forever-free plan. Paid plans start from $15.20 a month and are billed annually. Pros: If you pay for this AI video creator, you have many creation options at your disposal that not all other platforms offer (AI meme creation, AI image generation, AI carousel maker, etc.). Cons: Not the best free AI video generator; other platforms are more generous with their features. You‚Äôre not able to test the text-to-video generator without joining a paid plan, as you‚Äôre about to do with other features. Best for: Creators who want to create, edit, and schedule videos for all social media platforms. 4. Movavi Video Editor Source Rather than generating AI videos from scratch, the Movavi Video Editor uses AI to make video editing easier. Video editing can be a time-consuming chore; for many, it‚Äôs the less enjoyable side of content creation. However, with Movavi Video Editor‚Äôs nonlinear AI technique, you‚Äôre not just replicating traditional tool functions but also enhancing your videos through advanced AI video editing. With AI background removal, you can cut out and replace backgrounds, adding a new dimension to your visuals. Plus, the AI noise removal feature enhances audio quality by automatically eliminating unwanted sounds, ensuring your videos are of the highest standard. Source The app also offers a host of advanced options like PiP, chroma-key, titles, keyframing, motion tracking, and more. Following the free 7-day trial, paid plans start at $49.95 per year. Pros: The presence of built-in training rapidly familiarizes you with the software, and it has features that many other AI video editors don‚Äôt. Cons: This AI video editor brings high-level tools (like color correction) to marketers, but total video newbies may be overwhelmed with some of the more advanced features. Best for: Creators and marketers who already have video footage and want help editing videos to be more engaging (or who just need to speed up the editing process). 5. Fotor AI Video Generator Source Fotor is an image and video editing platform that integrates various AI features, known for its creativity, intelligence, flexibility, and convenience. Its AI video generator fully utilizes advancements in AI technology, making video creation more efficient and enjoyable. Video creation is often a complex and professional process, but Fotor simplifies the steps. You just need to describe your creative ideas in text form and choose your desired style. AI will automatically analyze and generate a video you‚Äôll be satisfied with. You can also upload images and add descriptions to generate a video. Whether you're an amateur video maker, a professional creator, or someone learning video production with no skills, AI will help you enjoy the efficiency and fun of video creation. Inspiration is important for video creators. Fotor AI video generator provides preset prompts and images, helping creators find more inspiration for their videos. My experience: Fotor‚Äôs interface is very user-friendly and simple. you can quickly find the features you need without any distracting ads or clutter. It also provides detailed step-by-step instructions, making it easy for new creators to get started. While creating videos, its preset text descriptions and high-quality images inspired me creatively. They also saved me time and greatly boosted my production efficiency. Source What I found most convenient was that after generating a video, I could perform basic edits directly in Fotor and I could also use their rich AI video tools, like one-click enhancement and beautification, background removal, and object elimination. Pros: The AI video generator supports creating videos in various styles, including Photography, Cinematic, Digital Art, Anime, Neopunk, Game Art, Illustration Art, and more. Catering to various creative ideas and needs. Cons: AI may not always fully understand textual descriptions or emotions and feelings, so some videos may not appear as realistic. Best for: Professional video creators, video creation beginners, social media video influencers, and users who enjoy trying and testing trendy and interesting features. 6. AI Studio Source With AI Studio, users can create videos by uploading their script and using the text-to-speech feature. The platform will then generate a video in five minutes or less. You can manually type in the script or copy and paste it into the platform. From there, you just need to select the appropriate language and AI model and finish editing. AI Studio allows users to select a custom-made avatar that suits their brand.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: New users can input a 300-character script, and an AI avatar will read your script using the AI text-to-video generator. I found the AI models to be less convincing than others; the mouths sometimes moved between sentences, and I think all viewers could identify these as AI. However, since the advent of TikTok‚Äôs text-to-speech narration feature, the public has become more accustomed to artificial narration, and there are many situations where this type of AI would work well. Source Prices for AI Studio start at $30 per month. Pros: The platform‚Äôs intuitive features make it excellent for beginners with limited or no video creation experience. Cons: The AI Studio avatars are identifiable as being artificial. Best for: Marketing videos that need text-to-speech narration and have visuals for B-roll. 7. Veed.io Source With Veed.io, you can use custom text, colors, font, and music to create a unique video for your brand. One of its standout features is Auto Transcribe. You can upload your video, hit the Auto Transcribe button, and immediately download the script. Even better, there is no software to download, and the platform is easy to use for those without video editing experience. My experience: I entered my ‚ÄúPinterest marketing for beginners‚Äù prompt, and Veed.io quickly generated a short vertical video. The AI video generator automatically provided the script, AI narration, background music, stock videos, and close captioning. The on-screen captions were really engaging, using color-changing text and emojis ‚Äî perfect for social media. Source Veed.io is free to use for videos under 10 minutes. To access more features, prices start at $18 per month (when billed annually) and go all the way up to enterprise custom pricing. Pros: The pacing, on-screen captions, slang, and approach were very engaging. Cons: The stock video that was automatically inserted into the video was off-topic at times but can be easily edited. Best for: Short-form videos designed to hold attention on social media. 8. Synthesia Source Synthesia's AI video generator enables users to create professional videos without requiring cameras, actors, or studios. Users can generate videos featuring realistic AI avatars that deliver content in over 140 languages by simply inputting text. This makes it an ideal tool for efficiently and at scale creating training materials, sales and marketing content, and internal communications. My experience: Synthesia's intuitive interface and extensive customization options make video creation straightforward. The platform's diverse range of avatars and multilingual support allowed me to produce engaging content tailored to a global audience. The quality of the AI-generated avatars is impressive, closely mimicking human expressions and speech patterns. Synthesia offers a free plan that includes 3 minutes of video per month, 9 AI avatars, and access to AI voices in 140+ languages. Paid plans are available for users requiring more features. Pros: Synthesia simplifies video creation with its intuitive interface and realistic AI avatars. Its support for over 140 languages makes it an excellent tool for creating global content. Cons: The free plan has limited features and is suitable only for basic use. Best for: Businesses and individuals seeking to create professional training videos, marketing content, or internal communications featuring AI avatars, especially when targeting a multilingual audience. 9. Elai.io Source Elai is simple and requires no video editing skills. To use Elai, copy and paste a blog post URL or HTML text, choose a template from its library, and let the generator do the rest. This AI video maker is specialized in corporate learning. Once the video is complete, review it to make any changes before rendering and downloading it. My experience: I found that Elai's format is unique. Even though the AI avatar doesn‚Äôt pass as a real human, its small display size makes it feel less distracting. The avatar compliments these videos instead of dominating them. I also really like the audio options: you can upload an audio file of you speaking, and Elai will generate a realistic AI avatar to narrate the text. Source Elai has over 60 languages and 25 avatars to choose from. You can use Elai for free with a 1-minute credit. For more features, Elai‚Äôs plans start at $23 per month (billed annually). Pros: As a specialized AI video generator, this tool allows you to quickly create training videos for new hires or product onboarding videos. Cons: Being a platform specialized for educational videos, it would be more time-consuming to create general marketing videos. Best for: Generating videos at scale and creating training videos and product videos. 10. Colossyan Source Colossyan provides a diverse range of avatars who can recite your script in various languages. You can also customize your avatar‚Äôs outfit. Colossyan‚Äôs key features are auto translations, subtitles, and the ability to enhance messages via screen recording. My experience: The AI avatar options from Colossyan are advanced. You can add multiple AI avatars to a single video screen in the video creation workflow, starting a ‚Äúconversation.‚Äù You can even customize the pauses between speakers. Source There‚Äôs a free trial, and the prices start at $19 per month (when billed annually). Pros: The advanced avatar options make this a highly customizable AI video generator. Cons: The sound of the AI narrators isn‚Äôt the most natural-sounding. Best for: Creating training videos and explainers for workplace learning. 11. FlexClip Source This AI video generator features hundreds of video templates, AI-generated subtitles, background remover, and a text-to-speech engine. And its intuitive interface makes it simple for creators at any skill level. My experience: I created my video by inputting a URL and letting FlexClip automatically pull content from my website. The AI generator took an enormous amount of work out of the video creation process, but still required editing. The pacing of the video was slower than other AI tools, but I was able to easily customize all elements of the video. Source After the free plan, pricing starts at $9.99 per month (when billed annually, which saves 50%). Pros: The basic plan's price point makes this a very budget-friendly AI video generator. It is also a great, straightforward option for beginners who don‚Äôt want to feel overwhelmed. Cons: The AI-generated first draft requires more editing than some of the other platforms. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. 12. Wave Video Source Wave Video is a popular choice among content creators thanks to its many tools, which include image and video assets, text overlay effects, audio, and captions. The platform also provides a variety of video formats for Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and website-based applications. Other key features are: Text-to-video AI. Video hosting. Voiceovers. Text-to-speech. Millions of stock assets. My experience: I tested Wave Video by inserting a blog post URL and letting the AI video generator populate text and graphics based on the content. The video background graphics, pacing, and text populated on the slides needed significant editing to be ready for viewers. I like how easy it is to change the video format and edit any of the content. Wave Video also has many live-stream video tools. Source Wave Video is free, with monthly plans starting at $16 (paid annually). Pros: The features of this software are very beginner-friendly, and the user interface doesn‚Äôt feel overwhelming.

Tips for effective AI-generated video creation From keeping your videos short to leveraging clear visuals, appropriate audio, effective scripts, and subtitles for accessibility and SEO, here are some tips to help you create compelling content that captivates and inspires. Keep the video short The average attention span of internet users is shrinking, which is why it‚Äôs important to keep the content short to quickly capture and retain audience interest. When planning your digital marketing video, aim for a succinct narrative structure to keep a brisk pace, holding viewers‚Äô attention from start to finish. Consider using visual storytelling techniques and dynamic visuals, such as animations or infographic videos, to communicate complex concepts in a digestible format. Keep text overlays brief and to the point to highlight important messages without overwhelming your audience. You can even experiment with creative editing, like quick cuts or time-lapses, to maintain momentum and visual engagement throughout the video. Use clear and engaging visuals When you create a video with AI, selecting high-quality images and videos is key to visual engagement, allowing you to convey your message with precision and impact. You can start by curating visual assets that align with your brand identity and resonate with your target audience. Take on a range of visuals, including dynamic infographics, impactful live-action clips, and captivating animation videos, to evoke emotional resonance and reinforce your narrative. Prioritize clarity and relevance in your visual selections, making sure each element contributes meaningfully to the overarching message of your video. Feel free to experiment with different camera angles, vibrant color palettes, and other visual effects to fill your video with a sense of cinematic flair. Choose audio and sound effects Video background music and sound effects can enhance your AI-generated videos from mere presentations to immersive cinematic experiences. Start by selecting background music that complements the tone and pacing of your video. Next, consider the feeling you want to evoke in your audience‚Äîexcitement, nostalgia, or suspense‚Äîand choose music tracks that align with these thematic elements. Be sure to pay attention to tempo, instrumentation, and mood, selecting compositions that enhance the narrative flow and engage viewers on a subconscious level. You‚Äôll also want to integrate sound effects strategically to accentuate key moments and enhance immersion. Keep in mind that each auditory element contributes to the overall ambiance and storytelling efficacy of your video. Audio quality is another key aspect of ensuring a seamless viewing experience for your audience. Pay attention to audio mixing and mastering, balancing dialogue, music, and sound effects to create a cohesive auditory landscape that enhances rather than detracts from the viewing experience. Write scripts with natural language Whether you‚Äôre crafting explainer videos, training videos, or social media videos, the art of scripting lies in distilling complex ideas into clear, concise language that resonates with your audience. Don‚Äôt forget to define the overarching purpose and message of your video, articulating the central idea that you wish to communicate to your viewers. Consider your audience‚Äôs needs, preferences, and pain points, crafting a narrative that speaks directly to their interests and aspirations. Storytelling techniques, like character development, conflict resolution, and narrative arc, can give your script depth and emotional resonance. Visual storytelling techniques can also boost your script‚Äôs effectiveness. Use on-screen graphics, animations, and visual metaphors to reinforce key points and improve comprehension. Always prioritize clarity and simplicity in your language, avoiding jargon or technical terminology that may alienate or confuse viewers. You should aim for a conversational tone that fosters a sense of intimacy and connection, inviting viewers to engage with your content on a personal level. Add subtitles When you add subtitles to your AI-generated videos, you not only allow access for viewers with hearing impairments but also enhance your content‚Äôs search engine optimization (SEO) performance, improving its discoverability and reach. Start by transcribing the dialogue and narration of your video, capturing every spoken word. You can use automated transcription tools or hire professional transcription services to streamline this process and guarantee accuracy. Once transcribed, synchronize the text with the corresponding audio segments, aligning subtitles with spoken dialogue to create a seamless viewing experience. Pay attention to formatting and styling, making sure subtitles are legible and clear. You‚Äôll want to choose a consistent font style and size, contrasting against the background to maximize readability. Wrapping it up Through the fusion of cutting-edge technology and creativity, you use AI video tools to generate video content that resonates with your audience on a profound level, maximizing your impact and engagement in the long run. The Renderforest AI video generator simplifies the process of creating eye-catching, influential videos. Leveraging smart technology, it enables users to produce professional-quality videos quickly and effortlessly‚Äîand with minimal video editing skills. But don‚Äôt be fooled; it‚Äôs not just about the tech. The real impact of these professional videos is in the stories they tell and the feelings they create for your audience. With trendy visuals, sounds, and great scripts, these videos can really grab your viewers‚Äô attention and make them feel something.
