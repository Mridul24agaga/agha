Make a Video Updated: 12/10/24 Published: 06/16/23 Videos are integral to any marketing campaign; however, they can be tedious and difficult to create if you aren’t savvy with editing or are short on time. Fortunately, you can leverage many AI video generators to streamline your production and create content that engages your audience. But what’s the best AI video generator for your tasks? This article will explore 12 different AI video generators, their features, and how you can best use them in your next video marketing campaign. Time to press play on easier video creation. Table of Contents Can AI make videos? How to Make AI Videos Transforming Text to Video With AI What makes a great AI video generator? Best AI Video Generators Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video Can AI make videos? Yes, AI can make videos. AI video generators can instantly produce basic presentation slides with text, B-roll, and background music, all the way up to advanced videos of lifelike AI avatars “speaking” to you. AI’s impressive — but it’s not perfect. What works well with AI video generators: Video scripts. Being able to generate video scripts in a few seconds is incredible and saves so much time. Stock imagery, B-roll, and background music. Even though it still requires editing, having multimedia pulled automatically for you by the video generator makes it feel like you have an assistant. Video editing. The video editing capabilities are incredible and often beginner-friendly, which is a huge leap in the video editing world. What isn’t working (yet): Believability. The realistic AI avatars are incredibly advanced, but the mannerisms and articulation make it obvious that they're, well, AI. Pacing. Much research has been done on how quickly a video moves from scene to scene to hold viewers’ attention, and I found that not all generators factored this into their algorithms. Decision overload. The number of video templates, AI avatars, and effects available can overwhelm the editing process. AI is rapidly advancing, and some of these quirks will soon be passé. How to Make AI Videos The process for making an AI video will vary depending on the tool or platform you're using. Some generators work by analyzing and creating a video based on the script you uploaded, while others will follow a prompt typed in by the user. The key is to find a tool or generator with the features you need to create the kind of content you want. Transforming Text to Video With AI When ChatGPT catapulted to popularity in 2022, I don’t think the average marketers knew just how quickly AI video would follow. It needs to be used ethically to be useful to society, but when leveraged correctly, it’s an incredible tool. The most sought-after AI video feature is the text-to-video generator. This allows you to type in a sentence and, in a few seconds, be presented with an editable AI-generated video. I tested this feature using two different prompts: A vague prompt: “I’d like to educate viewers about AI-generated video.” A specific prompt: “I’d like to inspire beginner marketers to try AI video generation. The video should explain the benefits of AI video generators and should inspire viewers to try this new video tool.” I used HubSpot’s free AI video generator Clip Creator, and here’s what I saw. They were both high-quality videos. Both videos had appropriate stock images and music tailored to human behavior. The content was very similar for both videos. After testing many AI generators, I’ve found that a marketer’s time is better spent editing rather than making their prompt more specific. No matter how perfect your prompt feels, the end result will still require edits.

The best AI video tools all have a mix of these different features. Intuitive User Interface While most platforms list a long list of fancy AI features, users need an easy-to-use AI studio first and foremost. This enables a quick editing process. AI Scripts Automatically-generated video scripts save an incredible amount of time when producing video content. They turn written content (such as a blog post, email, etc.) or a prompt into spoken language. Sometimes, they even use an AI narrator to read it out loud for you. Not all software can generate video scripts, but it’s an enormous time saver. To be fair to the software that doesn’t offer this, it’s replaceable with a few clicks in ChatGPT. After trying more than a dozen AI video generators, I found the AI scripts were one of the features that made the greatest difference, along with the next feature. Factoring in Human Behavior Some software have tailored their AI to match user behavior, and some haven’t. For example, most people prefer videos with a brisk pace and visuals that don’t stay on the screen too long. In the video world, this is referred to as “pacing.” Not all software is tailored for this, and as a result, it will produce slow, lengthy slides that feel like a bad PowerPoint presentation. This isn’t a detail that software companies list on their “features” page, but it’s something that’s apparent based on the first draft of the video that the software gives you. Template Library Start from scratch? What is it, 2018? There’s no need to start from scratch with video anymore, as most platforms have built-in template libraries. Bonus points if these libraries include variation in: Intended audience. Aspect ratio. Project type. Editing Capabilities It’s normal for different software to offer different editing options, but most AI studios will cover the basics, such as: Text. Fonts. Music. Colors. Timing. Transitions. Animations. Stock footage. Different video styles. Pricing Tiers (or Free Plan) An AI video generator costs $0 to $50 a month (paid annually). All paid software includes a discount when purchasing an annual package, and the cost of month-to-month service is always higher. I know you’re on a budget — all of the suggested AI tools below are either free or include a free trial/demo. Multilingual Look for software that supports multiple languages if your business requires it. A chart comparing 11 AI Video Generators Chart comparing AI video generators Best AI Video Generators AI video generators have come extremely far in a short time. You can now make professional videos with the numerous text-to-video generation tools on the market. I’ve tried all the most popular AI video generators, so you don’t have to. Here’s what I found. 1. Clip Creator Source Clip Creator is the best AI video generator for beginners. It can be used by someone with no video experience and walks you through the video creation process painlessly. You start by answering a few basic questions (like video type), then provide a brief overview of the video you’d like to create. You can choose from video templates, which are oriented for both landscape videos and vertical videos. Then, Clip Creator uses AI to generate the text on your slides, plus the background imagery. You’re instantly given a video with editable text, stock images, background music, etc. The video creation workflow is very intuitive. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video My experience: I love how streamlined this AI video creator is. Instead of bombarding you with endless features, options, and pop-ups, Clip Creator starts simple and allows you to make any edits you need after it generates the video. Source Pros: Incredibly intuitive user interface, great customization options, and makes for a very fast and efficient AI video creator. Cons: Smaller template library than paid AI video generators, and no advanced features like realistic AI avatars. Best for: Video creation beginners and marketers on a budget. Most user-friendly interface and best free AI video generator. 2. Pictory Source Pictory is an excellent AI video generator for creators and marketers who don’t have experience creating videos. All you have to do is provide a script or article to guide your video content. For example, you can submit a blog post to the AI video creator, and Pictory will create a video based on the post that can be used for social media or your website. Furthermore, you can edit videos in minutes by using text. Pictory also includes a feature that creates shareable video highlight reels that can be used as a trailer or a short-form video for social media such as a Reel. Even better, Pictory can automatically caption and summarize your videos.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: I provided the same prompt for Pictory as I did for the Clip Creator video, and it initially generated much less content (only 1 slide). I went back and instead provided a URL of a blog post and tested the blog-to-video generator. This feature automatically creates video scripts based on a blog post, and using their realistic AI voices, I could have it automatically narrated too. The writing on every slide needed to be edited significantly to be useful, but I was impressed with the options. Pictory supports multiple languages (currently English, Spanish, French, and German) and has a huge library of AI voices. Source Prices for Pictory start at $19 per month, and users can try a 2-week free trial. Pros: Users have a lot of options for how to begin their AI-generated videos, and they can thoroughly customize the video output. Cons: The first draft of the automatically-generated videos needs heavy editing. It may be faster to let ChatGPT write a script for you and use that. Best for: Marketers and creators with limited video editing experience who want to convert content like blog posts or webinars into shareable video content. 3. Simplified Source The Simplified AI video generator transforms a long-form video into multiple AI-enhanced clips with just one click. This allows users to create videos from text and make an entirely new video using its accessible editing interface. Simplified simplifies the way we produce content by providing users with easy access to an expansive in-app library that hosts thousands of templates, all available for free. I like that it guarantees exceptional video quality and pairs this with an intuitive, user-friendly interface, ensuring that users can craft high-quality videos without sacrificing ease of use. Its comprehensive suite of features goes beyond basic editing options to include animation enhancements and multilingual translation capabilities, making it a versatile all-in-one tool for video creation. Users can save their brand settings in Simplified’s “brand book” is a great time-saving feature. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just starting, this platform equips you with everything you need to bring your vision to life. Brands like Bloomberg, DuckDuckGo, and Cashify use Simplified for their marketing needs. My experience: I prompted Simplified the same way I prompted the other video generators, and I was immediately asked to describe my target audience and provide my video topic. This was a nice step toward more personalized videos, but it required more user-generated input than Clip Creator, which had a multiple-choice intake process. If you stick to the free plan, it’s time-consuming to sift through all the features to see what’s free to use. Source Prices for Simplified include a forever-free plan. Paid plans start from $15.20 a month and are billed annually. Pros: If you pay for this AI video creator, you have many creation options at your disposal that not all other platforms offer (AI meme creation, AI image generation, AI carousel maker, etc.). Cons: Not the best free AI video generator; other platforms are more generous with their features. You’re not able to test the text-to-video generator without joining a paid plan, as you’re about to do with other features. Best for: Creators who want to create, edit, and schedule videos for all social media platforms. 4. Movavi Video Editor Source Rather than generating AI videos from scratch, the Movavi Video Editor uses AI to make video editing easier. Video editing can be a time-consuming chore; for many, it’s the less enjoyable side of content creation. However, with Movavi Video Editor’s nonlinear AI technique, you’re not just replicating traditional tool functions but also enhancing your videos through advanced AI video editing. With AI background removal, you can cut out and replace backgrounds, adding a new dimension to your visuals. Plus, the AI noise removal feature enhances audio quality by automatically eliminating unwanted sounds, ensuring your videos are of the highest standard. Source The app also offers a host of advanced options like PiP, chroma-key, titles, keyframing, motion tracking, and more. Following the free 7-day trial, paid plans start at $49.95 per year. Pros: The presence of built-in training rapidly familiarizes you with the software, and it has features that many other AI video editors don’t. Cons: This AI video editor brings high-level tools (like color correction) to marketers, but total video newbies may be overwhelmed with some of the more advanced features. Best for: Creators and marketers who already have video footage and want help editing videos to be more engaging (or who just need to speed up the editing process). 5. Fotor AI Video Generator Source Fotor is an image and video editing platform that integrates various AI features, known for its creativity, intelligence, flexibility, and convenience. Its AI video generator fully utilizes advancements in AI technology, making video creation more efficient and enjoyable. Video creation is often a complex and professional process, but Fotor simplifies the steps. You just need to describe your creative ideas in text form and choose your desired style. AI will automatically analyze and generate a video you’ll be satisfied with. You can also upload images and add descriptions to generate a video. Whether you're an amateur video maker, a professional creator, or someone learning video production with no skills, AI will help you enjoy the efficiency and fun of video creation. Inspiration is important for video creators. Fotor AI video generator provides preset prompts and images, helping creators find more inspiration for their videos. My experience: Fotor’s interface is very user-friendly and simple. you can quickly find the features you need without any distracting ads or clutter. It also provides detailed step-by-step instructions, making it easy for new creators to get started. While creating videos, its preset text descriptions and high-quality images inspired me creatively. They also saved me time and greatly boosted my production efficiency. Source What I found most convenient was that after generating a video, I could perform basic edits directly in Fotor and I could also use their rich AI video tools, like one-click enhancement and beautification, background removal, and object elimination. Pros: The AI video generator supports creating videos in various styles, including Photography, Cinematic, Digital Art, Anime, Neopunk, Game Art, Illustration Art, and more. Catering to various creative ideas and needs. Cons: AI may not always fully understand textual descriptions or emotions and feelings, so some videos may not appear as realistic. Best for: Professional video creators, video creation beginners, social media video influencers, and users who enjoy trying and testing trendy and interesting features. 6. AI Studio Source With AI Studio, users can create videos by uploading their script and using the text-to-speech feature. The platform will then generate a video in five minutes or less. You can manually type in the script or copy and paste it into the platform. From there, you just need to select the appropriate language and AI model and finish editing. AI Studio allows users to select a custom-made avatar that suits their brand.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: New users can input a 300-character script, and an AI avatar will read your script using the AI text-to-video generator. I found the AI models to be less convincing than others; the mouths sometimes moved between sentences, and I think all viewers could identify these as AI. However, since the advent of TikTok’s text-to-speech narration feature, the public has become more accustomed to artificial narration, and there are many situations where this type of AI would work well. Source Prices for AI Studio start at $30 per month. Pros: The platform’s intuitive features make it excellent for beginners with limited or no video creation experience. Cons: The AI Studio avatars are identifiable as being artificial. Best for: Marketing videos that need text-to-speech narration and have visuals for B-roll. 7. Veed.io Source With Veed.io, you can use custom text, colors, font, and music to create a unique video for your brand. One of its standout features is Auto Transcribe. You can upload your video, hit the Auto Transcribe button, and immediately download the script. Even better, there is no software to download, and the platform is easy to use for those without video editing experience. My experience: I entered my “Pinterest marketing for beginners” prompt, and Veed.io quickly generated a short vertical video. The AI video generator automatically provided the script, AI narration, background music, stock videos, and close captioning. The on-screen captions were really engaging, using color-changing text and emojis — perfect for social media. Source Veed.io is free to use for videos under 10 minutes. To access more features, prices start at $18 per month (when billed annually) and go all the way up to enterprise custom pricing. Pros: The pacing, on-screen captions, slang, and approach were very engaging. Cons: The stock video that was automatically inserted into the video was off-topic at times but can be easily edited. Best for: Short-form videos designed to hold attention on social media. 8. Synthesia Source Synthesia's AI video generator enables users to create professional videos without requiring cameras, actors, or studios. Users can generate videos featuring realistic AI avatars that deliver content in over 140 languages by simply inputting text. This makes it an ideal tool for efficiently and at scale creating training materials, sales and marketing content, and internal communications. My experience: Synthesia's intuitive interface and extensive customization options make video creation straightforward. The platform's diverse range of avatars and multilingual support allowed me to produce engaging content tailored to a global audience. The quality of the AI-generated avatars is impressive, closely mimicking human expressions and speech patterns. Synthesia offers a free plan that includes 3 minutes of video per month, 9 AI avatars, and access to AI voices in 140+ languages. Paid plans are available for users requiring more features. Pros: Synthesia simplifies video creation with its intuitive interface and realistic AI avatars. Its support for over 140 languages makes it an excellent tool for creating global content. Cons: The free plan has limited features and is suitable only for basic use. Best for: Businesses and individuals seeking to create professional training videos, marketing content, or internal communications featuring AI avatars, especially when targeting a multilingual audience. 9. Elai.io Source Elai is simple and requires no video editing skills. To use Elai, copy and paste a blog post URL or HTML text, choose a template from its library, and let the generator do the rest. This AI video maker is specialized in corporate learning. Once the video is complete, review it to make any changes before rendering and downloading it. My experience: I found that Elai's format is unique. Even though the AI avatar doesn’t pass as a real human, its small display size makes it feel less distracting. The avatar compliments these videos instead of dominating them. I also really like the audio options: you can upload an audio file of you speaking, and Elai will generate a realistic AI avatar to narrate the text. Source Elai has over 60 languages and 25 avatars to choose from. You can use Elai for free with a 1-minute credit. For more features, Elai’s plans start at $23 per month (billed annually). Pros: As a specialized AI video generator, this tool allows you to quickly create training videos for new hires or product onboarding videos. Cons: Being a platform specialized for educational videos, it would be more time-consuming to create general marketing videos. Best for: Generating videos at scale and creating training videos and product videos. 10. Colossyan Source Colossyan provides a diverse range of avatars who can recite your script in various languages. You can also customize your avatar’s outfit. Colossyan’s key features are auto translations, subtitles, and the ability to enhance messages via screen recording. My experience: The AI avatar options from Colossyan are advanced. You can add multiple AI avatars to a single video screen in the video creation workflow, starting a “conversation.” You can even customize the pauses between speakers. Source There’s a free trial, and the prices start at $19 per month (when billed annually). Pros: The advanced avatar options make this a highly customizable AI video generator. Cons: The sound of the AI narrators isn’t the most natural-sounding. Best for: Creating training videos and explainers for workplace learning. 11. FlexClip Source This AI video generator features hundreds of video templates, AI-generated subtitles, background remover, and a text-to-speech engine. And its intuitive interface makes it simple for creators at any skill level. My experience: I created my video by inputting a URL and letting FlexClip automatically pull content from my website. The AI generator took an enormous amount of work out of the video creation process, but still required editing. The pacing of the video was slower than other AI tools, but I was able to easily customize all elements of the video. Source After the free plan, pricing starts at $9.99 per month (when billed annually, which saves 50%). Pros: The basic plan's price point makes this a very budget-friendly AI video generator. It is also a great, straightforward option for beginners who don’t want to feel overwhelmed. Cons: The AI-generated first draft requires more editing than some of the other platforms. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. 12. Wave Video Source Wave Video is a popular choice among content creators thanks to its many tools, which include image and video assets, text overlay effects, audio, and captions. The platform also provides a variety of video formats for Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and website-based applications. Other key features are: Text-to-video AI. Video hosting. Voiceovers. Text-to-speech. Millions of stock assets. My experience: I tested Wave Video by inserting a blog post URL and letting the AI video generator populate text and graphics based on the content. The video background graphics, pacing, and text populated on the slides needed significant editing to be ready for viewers. I like how easy it is to change the video format and edit any of the content. Wave Video also has many live-stream video tools. Source Wave Video is free, with monthly plans starting at $16 (paid annually). Pros: The features of this software are very beginner-friendly, and the user interface doesn’t feel overwhelming. Cons: The stock images it pulled were lower quality than the other AI tools. The images were blurry and stayed on screen much too long before switching slides (video pacing needed editing). Best for: Livestream videos. Making the Most of AI Video How will AI-generated video help your brand? With just a few clicks, you can create amazing videos, which was unimaginable a few years ago.

The AI interprets the prompt and generates a matching video, complete with movement, lighting, and even physics. This is by far the most popular type of AI video generation. Image-to-video Look at that VEO 2 animates windows wallpaper! pic.twitter.com/qL51V8S4oA — testtm (@test_tm7873) December 26, 2024 Image-to-video AI video generation animates static images, bringing them to life with motion effects. AI can generate smooth transitions, camera movements, or even animate characters from a few frames. Image-to-video models are popular with AI video creators because they allow you to maintain character, scene and object consistency throughout your video. You would typically use these tools alongside an AI image generator like Midjourney. Video-to-video @runwayml has 4K upscaling now! 🤯 I did a comparison between Runway GEN-3 and Topaz Video AI's upscaler, from HD to 4K. Runway's file size footprint is 40% of Topaz (using the Theia model), and after reviewing the results on a 40\" monitor, there's little to no difference in… pic.twitter.com/GamPOXq9mr — Tom Blake (@Iamtomblake) January 9, 2025 Video-to-video AI video generation uses AI to enhance, modify, or transform existing videos rather than creating new ones from scratch. This can include improving video quality, changing styles, adding special effects, or even altering elements within the footage—like removing objects, or replacing backgrounds. Some good examples of video-to-video includes Synthesia's AI dubbing (with lip sync) or Topaz's video upscaling. Th‎e best AI video generator for studio-quality videos with AI avatars Synthesia PlayCreate an AI Video in 4 Minutes with Synthesia ⚡️ Verdict: Easy to use and great for training, internal communications, marketing, outreach and localisation/translation ‎Link: ‎https://www.synthesia.io/ Synthesia is a leading AI video generator that allows you to create studio-quality videos with AI avatars that can narrate your text. It includes more than 60 video templates you can start from, and you can choose between more than 230 AI avatars that speak more than 140 languages and accents. Here's an example video I made for a product launch: PlayProduct Introduction (Free AI Video Template) Synthesia can be used to create a variety of video types, with the most common use cases being learning and development videos, including training videos and other eLearning video production. It also excels at producing onboarding videos and video content for internal communications, as well as marketing and outreach videos. Synthesia is a top-ranked AI software, with 1150+ reviews on G2 and has a rating of 4.7 out of 5. The platform is being used by 50,000 companies of all sizes, with many big names among them, such as Reuters, Zoom, and Amazon. Synthesia is a browser-based platform and I found it easy to set up my first video. I simply typed in my script, selected an avatar from their library, customized my video with the AI video editor, and then Synthesia generated a polished video featuring one of its realistic AI avatars. With over 230 avatars to choose from, I easily found options that fit different tones and purposes. You can also make a custom avatar that looks like you. Synthesia supports over 140 languages, and I was able to create localized versions of my video with ease. The platform even has a multilingual video player that automatically translates videos to viewers’ preferred languages, making it useful for global audiences. I tried adding multiple avatars on screen to simulate conversations, which worked smoothly and could be helpful for training scenarios or role-playing videos. The platform has over 60 professionally designed video templates that make it easy to produce polished content quickly. Features like live collaboration tools allow teams to work together seamlessly, while detailed video analytics provide insights into video performance. Altogether, these capabilities make Synthesia a practical, efficient choice for professional projects. One of its most popular use cases is as training video software, but it's also great for other sales and marketing videos and multilingual content. Th‎e best AI video generators for creative video production Here's my rundown of the best text-to-video and image-to-video AI video generators for creative video production. Hailuo Hailuo Director Mode is so fun. Being able to combine camera shots is just fantastic. Here shaky camera and push in. pic.twitter.com/MfqBA22vm8 — Jerrod Lew (@jerrod_lew) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best free option for creative video production Link: ‎https://hailuoai.video/ Hailuo AI is an AI video generator that delivers high-quality 6-second video clips at 720p resolution. It offers text-to-video, image-to-video and a subject reference feature. Hailuo offers a 3-day free unlimited generation period so that you can generate a bunch of videos for free and really test the tool. Subject reference is a particularly cool feature. It lets you upload a photo of a character and then generate a scene with that character in it. I found the output to be pretty accurate, although I often needed to do some manual editing to maintain coherence. The model can also take multiple attempts to get it right, which will eat into your credits. The feature also often fails at close-ups (wide shots tend to work better but lose fine details). One of the first things that stood out to me was how well it understands prompts. Hailuo seemed to nail camera movements and scene composition accurately. The image quality is also noticeably high. However, generation times are limited to 6 seconds, which makes creating longer sequences more tedious. Al‎ibaba Qwen Another day, another release. Alibaba have quietly included video generation in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max and it's really good. Here are a few examples - check them out. pic.twitter.com/u6qptO59ai — TomLikesRobots🤖 (@TomLikesRobots) January 30, 2025 Verdict: Completely free and produces high quality videos, but often with unreliable generation Link: ‎‎‎‎https://chat.qwenlm.ai/ Alibaba included an AI video generator in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max. It’s a text-to-video only tool, but it’s completely free and I’ve been impressed by the quality. The one catch is that the generation is kind of unreliable. I often enter my prompt and the video generates up to 99% complete and then gets stuck for quite a while. In my experience the videos do eventually finish generating but be prepared to wait a little. The output quality seems to be really good, and while the functionality is limited, it’s completely free and the videos have no watermark. Kl‎ing If you’re looking to combine character consistency with high-quality VFX, @Kling_ai is the best choice. 🎥✨ Version 1.5 absolutely nails VFX. A true must-have! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/rO1WvmLj3k — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) January 12, 2025 Verdict: High quality output, but very long free plan generation wait times Link: ‎https://www.klingai.com/ Kling offers text-to-video and image-to-video features, along with free video generation credits for users who log in each month. Kling brings an impressive level of fluidity and realism to movement in videos. I found the adjustable creativity and relevance slider particularly useful for fine-tuning outputs. Its biggest strength lies in image-to-video generation (and in particular its elements feature), which is far superior to tools like Runway. The motion is smoother, and the AI follows prompts accurately. When I asked for a character to blink or walk forward while the camera zoomed in, Kling delivered exactly what I asked for. If you need storytelling or consistency between frames, Kling is a great option. Kling 1.5 also supports HD, which is a nice bonus. Kling has some drawbacks, the biggest being generation speed. On the free version, I sometimes had to wait an hour or more for a single clip, and I’ve heard of free users waiting a full day for results. This is a major issue if you need quick iterations. On a paid plan the generations are quicker, but I also noticed that Kling sometimes gets stuck at 99% completion and wastes credits. At the end of the day, if you prioritize quality, accuracy, and motion control, Kling is a great choice. The motion brush tool adds extra control, and the first-attempt success rate is high, meaning I spent less time fighting the AI to get what I wanted. Ru‎nway When setting up a shot in Runway, think carefully about where to put the camera. Consider what the camera placement tells the audience about the story, about the character, and about the moment. Every angle is a decision that affects how the audience will experience it. pic.twitter.com/XnijHcb0Jv — Cristóbal Valenzuela (@c_valenzuelab) November 11, 2024 Verdict: The Gen-3 model gives you great results and some amazing advanced features that come with a bit of a learning curve Link: ‎https://runwayml.com/ Runway’s latest Gen-3 model offers a comprehensive suite of creative tools, such as text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video, alongside advanced features like motion brush, keyframes, camera controls and inpainting. On the free basic plan, you can create short text-to-video clips (up to 10 seconds long or 16 seconds using the \"extend video\" feature in the older Gen-2 model) but can’t upscale resolution or remove watermarks. You also can’t generate videos directly from text using their Gen-3 Alpha model on the free plan (only images to video). However, you can still make great videos with just the image-video feature. Here's an example workflow to show you how I use Runway’s free plan to create AI-generated short story videos: Midjourney to generate images Runway for image-to-video Suno to generate music Elevenlabs for some effects Topaz for video upscaling Capcut for editing I found Runway’s advanced features to be pretty amazing. Camera control lets you adjust angles, focus, and movement to achieve a polished, professional look. The Motion brush tool allows you to add motion and direction to specific parts of a video, which is great for creating visually dynamic social media content. Keyframes allow you to configure the starting, middle, and ending frames to create smooth transitions between them. Inpainting lets you automatically remove unwanted objects throughout your clip. This tool handled complex scenes surprisingly well; I could remove background elements without affecting the continuity of the video, something that would usually require a lot of time and expertise. However, I found that these advanced features come with a learning curve, so if you’re new to video editing you might need a bit of practice to fully utilize Runway’s capabilities. I found Runway’s video generation process to be fast and reliable. I think the pricing is reasonable given the platform’s capabilities, especially for creators, filmmakers, and digital artists who want more control and creative freedom. However, the costs might feel high if you’re only looking for basic AI video generation, as Runway is designed for those looking to push creative boundaries and explore the possibilities of AI in video production. Go‎ogle Veo Been generating impossibly dangerous stunts with veo 2 using text prompts. Still surprising how realistic they can look (though not perfect yet). pic.twitter.com/0gETBwGH5y — Ethan Mollick (@emollick) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best option for creative video production, but limited access for now (US only waitlist) Link: ‎https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/ I was blown away by Google Veo 2’s realistic video generation capabilities. Every clip I produced, from a misty jungle scene to a foggy wildlife sequence, was rendered in stunning detail, and the visual fidelity was top-notch. One of the aspects that stood out for me was the advanced cinematic controls. I could specify everything from lens types to shot angles and even adjust depth-of-field effects, which made it feel like I had an entire professional film crew at my fingertips. The dolly zoom and pan shot features, in particular, added that extra layer of cinematic flair that really brought my scenes to life. In my tests, Veo 2 consistently produced more “correct” results compared to other tools like OpenAI’s Sora. The physics simulation is fantastic with objects and characters that move and interact in a way that feels natural and true to real-world behavior. I found that character consistency was excellent too; no matter how complex the scene, the generated characters maintained their look and identity throughout the video. Veo 2 supports high-resolution outputs (up to 4K) and longer video durations too, which simplifies your workflow as you won’t need upscaling tools. The only reason why Veo 2 isn’t my top pick for creative video production is because it’s still not publicly available - you have to join a waitlist and it’s still US only. There’s also room for improvement still, and I sometimes saw some strange character movements in my generated videos. Op‎enAI Sora 🚨 It’s crazy! #Sora just dropped, and it’s already blowing everyone’s minds! 😱🎥 Here are 10 mind-blowing examples showcasing its insane possibilities. 🔥 The future of video is here. 🚀👇 pic.twitter.com/Mcq2OepO3R — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Fun to play around with but needs to improve Link: ‎https://sora.com/ Sora is OpenAI’s entry into text-to-video AI video generation, and after spending some time with it, I’ve found it to be a mixed bag. On the one hand, when Sora works, it can deliver stunning, lifelike visuals, especially for abstract or artistic scenes. Its storyboard functionality is one of my favorite features, as it lets you prompt multiple shots in a single generation, and the “Blend” option adds a fun layer of creativity, allowing you to combine visual elements in unexpected ways. However, in my experience the model struggles with some critical aspects. Sora consistently fails when it comes to physics, general body movements, and character consistency. For example, I tried generating scenes as simple as making cats dance, only to be met with choppy motion, glitches, and overall results that were far from convincing. In several cases, the outputs felt like a gamble: some generations might be passable, but most of the time, prompts didn’t translate well into the expected actions or camera movements. I found that free or cheaper alternatives outperform Sora in accuracy and usability. There’s a steep learning curve, and despite the potential of the video-to-video remix functionality (which I’ve used to remaster some older AI-generated clips), the overall inconsistency is hard to overlook. You can access Sora on the plus plan ($20/month) which gives you 50 videos up to 720p resolution and 5 seconds long, or the pro plan ($200/month) for 500 videos up to 1080p resolution and 20 seconds long. Pi‎ka I had early access to the Pika 2.1 Model, A new journey begins, More clips to follow! @pika_labs pic.twitter.com/rN5OfMacoo — Stevie Mac (@StevieMac03) January 23, 2025 Verdict: The free plan isn’t great, but the premium plans have very good image-to-video features Link: ‎https://pika.art/ Pika offers a free plan that gives you access to Pika 1.5, which has text-to-video and image-to-video features and 150 monthly video credits. Videos can be downloaded without a watermark on the free plan. I wasn’t super impressed with the quality of the generated videos though. However, while Pika 1.5’s video output is nothing special, Pika 2.1 (available on the paid plan) offers an image-to-video feature called scene ingredients, which I think is pretty amazing. With scene ingredients you can build a shot from the exact character, object, wardrobe, and setting you want. It works by using reference images of each element and then providing a prompt. It’s similar to Kling’s elements feature in that it allows you to ensure creative consistency between scenes, which I found made it a super useful tool to produce actually usable videos. Lu‎ma First impression Luma > Sora pic.twitter.com/R2pXVsAesw — The Retro Burn (@burntheretro) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Their new Ray 2 model is great, but it’s a premium feature and it doesn’t offer image-to-video Link: ‎https://lumalabs.ai/ Luma's Ray 2 model has great motion realism and the physics feel really natural. The frame-to-frame consistency is a clear improvement over previous versions and it does an excellent job with cinematic elements, responding impressively to lighting, contrast, film formats, and camera motion. At times, it even seemed to intelligently structure shots. By using highly detailed prompts and running multiple generations, I found that it’s possible to create some truly stunning videos, though it does require some cherry-picking to get the best results. When I tested a sports car driving through snowy mountains at dawn, the scene composition was spot on and the snow, warm light, and camera tracking all felt smooth and natural. I also experimented with close-up shots of faces, and I was surprised by how well it captured emotional expressions, particularly in an extreme sadness prompt, where the eye movements and facial subtleties felt incredibly lifelike. Where Luma stands out is its ability to generate dynamic camera movements while keeping the scene coherent. It understands cinematic depth and framing in a way that makes it ideal for dramatic shots. I found that Luma is great at handling large-scale scene changes. For example, when I asked it to generate a collapsing building Luma delivered a convincing destruction sequence. Currently, Luma’s Ray 2 is only available to paid users and is capped at 720p resolution. Videos can be up to 10 seconds long, but I noticed that after about 7 seconds, scene consistency can start breaking down, occasionally shifting in unintended ways. Ad‎obe Firefly Here's another video created by Adobe Firefly.. a 3D printer, printing a car. Very impressed by the results. https://t.co/L5d8zf3TGv pic.twitter.com/ySylkRlDMS — techAU (@techAU) February 13, 2025 Verdict: Inconsistent motion and limited free use (only 2 free generations) make it hard to recommend Link: ‎‎https://firefly.adobe.com/ Adobe Firefly offers both text to video and image to video, both capable of producing 1080p clips from simple prompts or static images. Firefly struggles with distortion. I tested it by generating a video of \"a cyclist riding through a mountain trail in autumn,\" and while the colors and scenery were nice, the motion was noticeably unnatural. The cyclist's legs appeared to glitch mid-pedal, and the overall movement felt disjointed. Image to video fared better when creating abstract or background footage, but realistic human action remained a challenge. The output currently feels more like digital experiments than polished, usable content. On the positive side, Firefly's interface is intuitive. The built-in controls for adjusting camera angles, motion paths, and shot sizes make experimenting with different styles relatively simple. After generating two free videos, I was prompted to upgrade to either Firefly Standard or Pro for additional generations. While Firefly is enjoyable to explore and has clear creative potential, I’ll stick with more reliable alternatives for projects that need high-quality, natural-looking results. The best AI video generators for social media and YouTube content Fl‎exClip PlayHow to use FlexClip's AI Video Creator Verdict: User-friendly video tool with innovative AI features Link: ‎https://www.flexclip.com/ FlexClip is highly user-friendly platform that excels at helping you create professional-looking videos quickly and efficiently. I love the drag-and-drop editor. It’s perfect for creating videos on the fly without needing to spend hours on intricate editing. I’ve used it to create everything from social media content to promotional videos. The AI-powered text-to-video tool allows you to input simple text prompts, and the AI generates video clips based on the text, matching stock footage, adding text overlays, and even suggesting music. It's perfect for social media clips. While the AI can be a little hit or miss when it comes to perfectly matching footage to specific content, it’s an amazing tool for creating videos when you’re short on time or just need a draft to build upon, and I typically only need to make a few adjustments after generation. The AI script generator is another great feature. While the scripts are generally a good starting point, they often need a little fine-tuning to match the specific tone of the brand or subject matter. This is definitely a time-saver, though, especially when you’re stuck trying to put ideas into words. Another feature that impressed me was the AI background remover. It works surprisingly well. For most images, the background removal is clean, though it sometimes struggles with more intricate details like hair or small objects. It’s a great time-saver when you’re working with product images or need transparent backgrounds quickly. FlexClip also offers an auto-subtitle generator, which is a great tool for improving accessibility and engagement on social media platforms. It’s surprisingly accurate, and I’ve used it for videos on YouTube and Instagram. However, it does occasionally struggle with fast speech or complex accents, so if you’re working with content that has unclear audio, this may not always be 100% reliable. One area where FlexClip could improve is its media library. While it offers a decent range of stock footage and images, it’s not as extensive as some other platforms I’ve used. For niche content, I’ve often had to source additional media from other places. The stock library is good for general-purpose videos, but it may not always have exactly what you need. Ve‎ed PlayHow to Make a YouTube Intro Verdict: User-friendly browser-based video editor that streamlines social media content creation Link: ‎https://www.veed.io/ Veed is a user-friendly, browser-based video editor that made creating social media content incredibly easy for me. The intuitive layout and drag-and-drop functionality let me start projects quickly, and I loved using features like automatic subtitles, text-to-speech, and background removal to give my videos a professional touch. The templates and filters helped keep my style consistent, and with auto-translate, creating multilingual content was straightforward. The only downside I found was that the free plan includes a watermark, and complex scenes sometimes required a bit of manual tweaking to get the AI effects like background removal just right. Overall, Veed offered everything I needed for quick, polished videos with minimal effort. Ca‎nva PlayCreate content fast with Canva Video Verdict: AI-powered video editing with versatile templates Link: ‎https://www.canva.com/video-editor/ai/ Canva is not only a design tool; it’s also a great alternative for creating social media and YouTube videos. I tried its video editor, and I was impressed by how well it adapts to video creation. Canva’s templates make it easy to start projects tailored for platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. One of my favorite features is the automatic resizing, which lets me quickly reformat videos for different platforms without needing to start from scratch. The AI-powered suggestions for text and animations are also handy—it feels like Canva’s tools know how to keep my content consistent and visually engaging. With access to a vast library of stock media and music, I could easily enhance my videos, and the new AI text-to-speech and captioning features were a nice bonus, especially for making my videos more accessible. Overall, Canva’s video editing tools made it simple to produce polished, shareable content that looks just as good as anything created with dedicated video editors. The best AI-powered video editors Fi‎lmora PlayFilmora 14 is HERE! | Introducing a NEW way to edit Verdict: An affordable and user-friendly video editor with robust AI features Link: ‎https://filmora.wondershare.com/ When I first tried Filmora, I was immediately struck by how easy it was to navigate. The drag-and-drop functionality and straightforward interface made it simple to start editing, even without much prior experience. Filmora offers a robust library of transitions, effects, and templates, allowing me to quickly put together visually appealing videos, which is ideal for creating content for social media and YouTube. I appreciated how the platform balances usability with a range of features, making it suitable for both beginners and intermediate users who want to produce polished videos without a steep learning curve. Filmora’s pricing is also accessible, with options that cater to different types of users. They offer an annual subscription starting at around $49.99 per year, and for those looking for more flexibility, a lifetime license is available for around $79.99. There’s also a free version, which is great for testing the software before committing, but it does add a watermark to videos. For creators looking to edit consistently without major financial commitments, Filmora’s pricing offers a good balance of affordability and value, especially considering the powerful AI tools it includes. These plans are well-suited for individuals and small business owners who need regular access to professional-grade video tools without breaking the bank. Filmora's AI-powered tools bring a lot of convenience and creativity to the editing process. I'll run through each one. The AI Smart Cutout feature, for example, allows you to cut objects out of scenes by painting over the area, which is perfect for isolating specific subjects without complex masking. I also found AI Audio Denoise to be extremely useful for cleaning up background noise in my videos, especially when I recorded in less-than-ideal environments. The AI Audio Stretch tool was another handy feature that let me extend background music to match scene transitions, saving me the hassle of remixing or finding perfectly timed tracks. These AI tools are not only time-saving but also elevate the overall quality of the final video, helping users create professional-looking content with minimal effort. The AI Motion Tracking tool was a lot of fun to experiment with—it can be used to track faces or moving objects, allowing for privacy blurring or creative effects like pasting funny stickers over someone’s face to make meme-style videos. Another feature I really enjoyed was AI Remove Background, which made it easy to change the background of my videos without needing a green screen. I could, for instance, place a runner in an outer-space setting, which opens up endless creative possibilities. Additionally, Filmora’s AI Silence Detection tool helped speed up my editing by automatically removing pauses and hesitations, making it effortless to create snappy jump cuts. These tools make Filmora an efficient, AI-enhanced option for quick edits and visually dynamic effects. However, while these AI tools are great for general use, there are a few limitations. The precision of features like Smart Cutout and Remove Background isn’t perfect and might require manual touch-ups for complex scenes. Additionally, while Filmora handles most tasks smoothly, rendering can slow down when working with high-resolution files or when using multiple AI features in one project. This might be a drawback for users with demanding workflows or those creating high-quality, professional-grade content. Overall, though, Filmora’s AI tools make it an impressive choice for social media creators and hobbyists. In summary, Filmora is an accessible, budget-friendly video editor that packs a lot of AI-driven functionality into an affordable package. It’s particularly suited for those creating content for social media, YouTube, or personal projects. With its range of pricing options, Filmora offers a lot of value, especially for casual and intermediate creators who don’t need the high-end features of more advanced (and expensive) software. To‎paz PlayExperience Wonder by Topaz Labs Verdict: A premium AI-driven enhancer that delivers cinematic upscaling and noise reduction for professional-quality footage Link: ‎‎https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-video-ai Topaz Video AI is an advanced video enhancement tool that uses AI to upscale, stabilize, and improve video quality. When I tried it, I was impressed by how well it upscaled footage, even to resolutions as high as 16K, adding a cinematic clarity to older or lower-quality clips. The AI-driven noise reduction made a noticeable difference, effectively removing grain and artifacts that I struggled with in other software. I also found the frame rate enhancement and slow-motion features to be smooth and natural, making it ideal for creating professional-quality slow-motion shots or restoring archival footage. Priced at $299 for personal use and $1099 for commercial licensing, Topaz Video AI is an expensive but valuable investment for filmmakers, content creators, and digital archivists looking to elevate their work with high-end upscaling and video repair capabilities. Ca‎pCut PlayLearn How to Create Amazing Content using CapCut Web Version | CapCut Verdict: A free and versatile editor with intuitive AI tools that make crafting polished content effortless across devices Link: https://www.capcut.com/ CapCut is a free, all-in-one video editing tool that I found easy to use across mobile, desktop, and browser platforms. The array of AI-powered features—like background removal and automatic upscaling—made editing quick and straightforward, especially for creating social media content. The audio-to-text transcription was a time-saver, automatically adding captions that boosted accessibility and engagement on my videos. I liked tools like video stabilization and text-to-speech, which let me enhance video quality without needing complex software. CapCut’s collaborative features were also helpful, especially when working on shared projects, and the library of templates gave me plenty of creative options. Overall, CapCut’s versatility and ease of use make it a great choice for both personal and professional video editing. The best AI video generators for video repurposing Op‎usClip PlayOpusClip 3.0: The smartest AI clipping tool just got smarter Verdict: A smart and time-saving tool that repurposes long videos into engaging, platform-ready clips with minimal effort Link: ‎https://www.opus.pro/ Opus Clip has quickly become one of my favorite tools for repurposing long videos into social media-friendly clips. The AI-driven clip generation feature is surprisingly accurate, identifying the most engaging parts of my videos and saving me the time I’d usually spend sorting through footage. I appreciate how it automatically resizes clips to fit different platforms like TikTok and Instagram without any manual adjustments. Adding captions and even emojis is simple, and I noticed it makes the videos more engaging, especially for viewers who watch without sound. One of the standout features is the \"hook\" identification, which picks out key moments to grab attention quickly. Overall, Opus Clip made it easy to create compelling, shareable content from my existing videos, and the AI features really lightened my workload. Mu‎nch PlayMeet Munch Verdict: Efficiently converts long-form content into shareable social snippets using AI Link: ‎https://www.getmunch.com/ Munch is an AI-based tool for repurposing long-form video content into shorter clips suited for social media platforms. It identifies key moments in videos and includes features like auto-cropping, subtitles, and format adjustments to help optimize content for platforms such as Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok. Munch offers a streamlined way to create shareable content from existing videos, aimed at enhancing reach and engagement across various channels. I found the interface clean and easy to navigate, allowing me to jump right in without needing tutorials. One feature I particularly liked was the automatic detection of key moments. Munch’s AI identifies engaging segments, which saved me the time of manually sifting through my footage to find the best parts to share. For anyone looking to repurpose content across platforms, this automation is a real time-saver. Munch’s formatting tools also make it easy to resize videos for different social platforms. The auto-cropping options adjust clips to fit Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and more, making cross-platform distribution simpler. I appreciated the automatic subtitle feature, which made my videos accessible to a broader audience without much additional work. However, while these features are useful, they lack some customization. I couldn’t manually adjust the selected clips as much as I’d like, and sometimes the AI would pick sections that didn’t feel as relevant or engaging as I had hoped. One limitation I noticed is that the output quality and customization options are fairly basic compared to more advanced editing software. While auto-cropping and subtitles are convenient, the styling options for subtitles are limited, and I missed having more flexibility with transitions and effects. This might be a drawback if you’re aiming for highly polished, branded content, as Munch is more focused on speed and efficiency than fine-tuning. Overall, though, it’s a solid tool for quickly repurposing long videos into social-friendly snippets. If you need a quick way to generate clips from existing content and don’t require advanced editing, Munch is a handy addition to your toolkit. Wi‎secut PlayTurn long videos into shorts with Wisecut AI Verdict: Wisecut streamlines editing by automatically trimming dead space and adding professional touches Link: ‎https://www.wisecut.ai/ Wisecut automatically finds interesting moments in long clips and cuts them, adding music and subtitles.

His attorneys argue that the arrest violates his First Amendment rights and is a form of retaliation for his political activism.

It is recognized for its in-depth reporting, analysis, and breaking news on political events, elections, and government affairs.

Wide Reach: Politico has a significant online presence and is widely read by political professionals. Things to Consider: Potential Bias: While Politico aims for objectivity, it’s always wise to be aware of potential biases. Some critics argue that Politico leans slightly to the left or caters to a D.C. establishment perspective. Being aware of this can help you interpret their reporting. Sensationalism: To attract readers, Politico sometimes uses sensational headlines or focuses on conflict and drama. In Conclusion: Politico is a valuable source for staying informed about American politics and policy. However, like any news outlet, it’s essential to read their content critically, considering potential biases and the overall media landscape. ~ by Claude I can share some general information about Politico as a news outlet.

It’s generally considered to be a mainstream political news source that’s widely read by people in government, politics, and policy circles. ~ by Gemini 2.0 Flash Okay, here’s an overview of Politico, considering its reputation, strengths, weaknesses, and overall place in the media landscape: General Overview: Politico is a prominent news organization focused on politics and policy in the United States and, increasingly, globally (with Politico Europe). It’s known for its in-depth reporting, particularly on Congress, the White House, and lobbying. It aims to provide non-partisan news but it has been known for favoring left-leaning views in its content. Key Characteristics and Strengths: Focus on Politics and Policy: Politico’s core strength is its deep dive into the mechanics of government, legislation, and political maneuvering. They cover the “inside baseball” aspects that other outlets might miss. Speed and Timeliness: Politico is known for breaking news quickly, often being among the first to report on developments in Washington.

Paywalls: Access to some of Politico’s content, especially Politico Pro, is behind a paywall, which limits accessibility for some readers.

Its strength lies in its in-depth reporting, speed, and influence within political circles. However, it’s important to be aware of potential biases and the limitations of its insider focus. As with any news source, it’s best to read Politico critically and compare its reporting with that of other outlets to get a well-rounded perspective. To form your own opinion, I recommend: Reading a variety of articles from Politico over time. Comparing Politico’s coverage of specific events with that of other news organizations. Considering the source’s ownership and funding. Being aware of your own biases and how they might influence your interpretation of the news. ~ by DeepSeek **Assessment of Politico:** 1. **Overview and Reputation:** Politico, founded in 2007, is a prominent U.S.-based news outlet specializing in politics, policy, and governance, with a strong focus on Washington, D.C., and international affairs. It is widely regarded as credible and nonpartisan in its news reporting, though its opinion sections may reflect diverse ideological perspectives. Its reputation for breaking news and insider access, particularly through newsletters like *Playbook*, makes it a staple for policymakers, journalists, and politically engaged audiences. 2. **Content and Style:** – **Speed vs. Depth:** Known for rapid news updates, Politico balances quick scoops with in-depth policy analysis. While its breaking-news approach occasionally risks lacking context, its long-form journalism (e.g., policy deep dives) is well-researched. – **Audience:** Targets political insiders, which can lead to jargon-heavy content, though efforts to explain complex issues for broader audiences exist. 3. **Ownership and Expansion:** Acquired by Axel Springer (2021), Politico benefits from expanded resources and international reach, notably through *Politico Europe*. While maintaining a U.S. focus, this ownership may enhance cross-border reporting but raises questions about editorial independence (though no major shifts in tone have been observed post-acquisition). 4. **Criticisms and Controversies:** – **Sensationalism:** Critics argue its emphasis on scoops can prioritize speed over accuracy, as seen in a retracted 2020 story linking a Chinese scientist to COVID-19. – **Paywall:** Limits public access to content, potentially reducing its reach compared to free outlets. 5. **Influence and Impact:** Politico often sets the news agenda for other media, amplifying its influence in political discourse. Its awards (e.g., Pulitzer finalists) underscore journalistic rigor. However, its insider focus sometimes draws accusations of catering to elite narratives over grassroots perspectives. **Conclusion:** Politico is a key player in political journalism, valued for timely reporting and policy expertise. While generally credible, readers should remain mindful of potential sensationalism and seek diverse sources for balanced viewpoints. Its evolution under Axel Springer and global expansion will be critical to monitor for maintaining quality and impartiality. ~ Chat GPT 4 Politico is a well-known American news outlet that primarily covers politics and policy at the national and international levels.

However, the Mueller report found no conclusive evidence of such collusion.2. **Steele Dossier**: Schiff promoted the Steele dossier, which was later discredited. He claimed it contained verified information, but it was revealed that the dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, and its credibility was highly questionable.3. **Nunes Memo**: Schiff criticized the Nunes memo, which detailed the origins and lack of evidence supporting the Steele dossier. He claimed the memo was misleading and unsupported by facts, but later revelations showed that the memo’s claims were accurate.4. **Impeachment Inquiry**: During the impeachment inquiry against President Trump, Schiff was accused of misrepresenting the contents of a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He later admitted that his summary was a “parody”.5. **Public Statements vs. Closed Testimony**: Schiff made public statements asserting that there was direct evidence of collusion, but transcripts of closed-door testimonies revealed that key witnesses, including former Obama administration officials, stated they had no direct evidence of collusion.These instances have led to significant controversy and criticism of Schiff’s credibility.~ by PerplexityThe search results do not provide specific instances where Adam Schiff has been definitively found lying. However, they do mention several controversies and criticisms related to his statements and actions, particularly regarding the Trump-Russia investigation. Here are some of the key points:Claims of Collusion Evidence: Schiff repeatedly stated that there was evidence of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia, which was not supported by the Mueller or Durham investigations12. Critics argue that these claims were misleading or false.FISA Memo Controversy: The Schiff memo was criticized for containing false statements regarding the FISA warrant process for Carter Page. The Inspector General’s report supported many of the claims made in the Nunes memo, which contradicted Schiff’s assertions3.Whistleblower Testimony: There were false claims circulating about Schiff’s involvement with impeachment witnesses, including a bogus claim that he paid them over $40 million5.Censure by the House: Schiff was censured by the House for his comments on the Trump-Russia investigations, with the resolution stating that he “purposely deceived his Committee, Congress, and the American people”7.Assertions on Trump’s Actions: Schiff has been criticized for his interpretations of Trump’s actions, such as his claims about Trump’s handling of the Jamal Khashoggi murder investigation2.

His statements, particularly on Trump’s alleged Russia connections, have drawn significant scrutiny, with accusations of lying from political opponents.Instances of False StatementsHere are detailed instances where Schiff has been found lying, based on available evidence:Whistleblower Contact: In September 2019, Schiff claimed on MSNBC that his committee had not spoken directly with the whistleblower involved in the Trump-Ukraine complaint. However, it was later revealed that a staffer had communicated with the whistleblower, making this statement false (PolitiFact).Trump’s Ukraine Call: During a September 2019 House hearing, Schiff gave a dramatized account of Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which was not accurate to the transcript, leading to accusations of misrepresentation (CNN).Promotion of Steele Dossier: In March 2017, Schiff entered the unverified Steele dossier into the Congressional record, promoting its claims of Trump-Russia collusion, which were later discredited, contributing to false narratives (Fox News).Assertions of Collusion: Schiff repeatedly claimed there was evidence of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia, despite the Mueller report finding no criminal conspiracy, potentially misleading the public (POLITICO).Continued Insistence Post-Mueller: Even after the March 2019 Mueller report, Schiff maintained there was collusion, continuing to assert evidence existed, which some view as a lie given the report’s conclusions (The Washington Post).These instances reflect the complexity and controversy surrounding Schiff’s statements, with political implications shaping public perception.Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Adam Schiff’s Alleged False StatementsAdam Schiff, a Democratic U.S. Representative from California and former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has been a central figure in investigations into former President Donald Trump’s alleged ties to Russia, particularly during the 2016 election. His statements have faced significant scrutiny, with accusations of lying from Republican critics, while Democrats often defend him as a champion of oversight. This analysis explores five instances where Schiff has been found lying, based on available evidence, and provides a comprehensive overview of the context, controversy, and implications.Context and Political LandscapeSchiff’s prominence grew during the Trump administration, especially through his role in the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the subsequent impeachment inquiries. His assertions of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia were met with counterclaims of fabrication, particularly after the Mueller report’s release in March 2019, which found no evidence of criminal conspiracy but confirmed Russian interference and Trump’s campaign’s receptiveness to it. The political polarization surrounding these issues has fueled debates over Schiff’s credibility, with Republicans seeking to censure him and Democrats viewing him as a target of political revenge.Detailed Instances of Alleged LiesThe following table summarizes the five instances where Schiff has been found lying, with supporting details and sources:InstanceDetailsDateSource URLFalse statement about whistleblower contactClaimed on MSNBC that committee had not spoken directly with whistleblower; staffer had contact.September 2019PolitiFactMisleading account of Trump’s Ukraine callGave dramatized account in House hearing, not accurate to transcript, presented as parody.September 2019CNNPromotion of Steele dossier as evidence of collusionEntered unverified dossier into record in 2017, later discredited, promoted as evidence.March 2017Fox NewsAssertions of collusion evidenceRepeatedly claimed evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, despite Mueller report’s findings.Various, 2017-19POLITICOContinued insistence post-Mueller reportMaintained collusion evidence existed after March 2019 report, seen as misleading.March 2019The Washington PostAnalysis of Each InstanceWhistleblower Contact: In September 2019, during an MSNBC interview, Schiff stated, “We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower,” referring to the individual who filed a complaint about Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Subsequent reporting by The New York Times and FactCheck.org revealed that a House Intelligence Committee aide had received a vague outline of the whistleblower’s concerns and shared some with Schiff before the complaint was filed. This discrepancy led PolitiFact to rate the statement as false, highlighting Schiff’s lack of clarity, which he later attributed to referring to official interviews rather than staff communications.Trump’s Ukraine Call: During a September 2019 House Intelligence Committee hearing, Schiff presented a dramatized version of Trump’s July 25, 2019, phone call with Zelensky, saying, “I’m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent. Understand? Lots of it, on this and on that.” CNN fact-checked this, noting that Trump did not repeat demands seven times and did not instruct Zelensky to “make up dirt,” but rather asked to “look into” baseless claims. Schiff later claimed it was a parody, but the initial presentation caused confusion, leading to accusations of lying from Trump and his allies.Promotion of Steele Dossier: In March 2017, during a House Intelligence Committee hearing, Schiff read parts of the Steele dossier into the Congressional record, which contained unverified claims of Trump’s collusion with Russia, including allegations of a conspiracy with the Kremlin. The dossier, funded by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign, was later discredited by Special Counsel John Durham’s investigation, particularly after charges against Igor Danchenko, a key source, for lying to the FBI. Fox News reported Schiff’s defense, but critics argue he promoted it as evidence, contributing to false narratives.Assertions of Collusion Evidence: Throughout 2017-2019, Schiff made numerous statements asserting evidence of collusion, such as in February 2019 on CNN, saying, “You can see evidence in plain sight on the issue of collusion, pretty compelling evidence,” distinguishing between collusion and criminal conspiracy. However, the Mueller report, released in March 2019, found no evidence of criminal conspiracy, leading to accusations that Schiff misled the public. POLITICO covered this, noting his distinction, but the public perception of “collusion” as criminal activity fueled controversy.Continued Insistence Post-Mueller Report: After the Mueller report’s release, Schiff maintained in March 2019 to The Washington Post, “Undoubtedly there is collusion,” and continued to push for further investigation, despite the report’s findings. This insistence, seen by some as a lie given the lack of criminal conspiracy evidence, reflects his interpretation of “collusion” as broader coordination, but critics argue it perpetuated a false narrative, especially as Republicans sought to censure him in 2023.Controversy and ImplicationsThe controversy surrounding Schiff’s statements is deeply rooted in political polarization. Republicans, as seen in the 2023 House censure resolution, accused him of abusing his position to spread false allegations, with Rep. Anna Paulina Luna citing “baseless distortions” (Fox News). Democrats, however, defended him, with Rep. Jamie Raskin calling it an “embarrassing revenge tour” (PBS News). This divide highlights the challenge of distinguishing between factual inaccuracies and political rhetoric, especially on sensitive topics like election interference.The implications extend to public trust in Congress, with Schiff’s actions seen by some as damaging institutional integrity, while others view him as a necessary check on executive power. The complexity lies in the definitions used—collusion versus conspiracy—and the timing of statements relative to investigative findings, making it a debated topic as of February 27, 2025.Unexpected Detail: Impact on Media CoverageAn unexpected detail is the significant media coverage Schiff received, amplifying his statements’ reach, as noted in The Hill’s critique of an “unquestioning press” promoting his book based on Russia fiction (The Hill). This media dynamic contributed to public perception, adding another layer to the controversy.This analysis, based on extensive research into fact-checking sites like PolitiFact and CNN, news reports from Fox News, POLITICO, and The Washington Post, and congressional records, provides a comprehensive view of Schiff’s alleged lies, acknowledging the complexity and ongoing debate.Key CitationsPolitiFact Adam Schiff’s false claim that ‘we have not spoken directly with the whistleblower’CNN Fact check Breaking down Adam Schiff’s account of Trump’s Ukraine callFox News Rep.

Adam Schiff! – 3/8/25 Answers by AI Prompt: Mention at least five instances where Adam Schiff has been found lying. ~ by Copilot Here are five instances where Adam Schiff has been accused of lying: 1. **Trump-Russia Collusion**: Schiff repeatedly claimed that there was clear evidence of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. However, the Mueller report found no conclusive evidence of such collusion. 2. **Steele Dossier**: Schiff promoted the Steele dossier, which was later discredited. He claimed it contained verified information, but it was revealed that the dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, and its credibility was highly questionable. 3. **Nunes Memo**: Schiff criticized the Nunes memo, which detailed the origins and lack of evidence supporting the Steele dossier. He claimed the memo was misleading and unsupported by facts, but later revelations showed that the memo’s claims were accurate. 4. **Impeachment Inquiry**: During the impeachment inquiry against President Trump, Schiff was accused of misrepresenting the contents of a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He later admitted that his summary was a “parody”. 5. **Public Statements vs. Closed Testimony**: Schiff made public statements asserting that there was direct evidence of collusion, but transcripts of closed-door testimonies revealed that key witnesses, including former Obama administration officials, stated they had no direct evidence of collusion. These instances have led to significant controversy and criticism of Schiff’s credibility. ~ by Perplexity The search results do not provide specific instances where Adam Schiff has been definitively found lying. However, they do mention several controversies and criticisms related to his statements and actions, particularly regarding the Trump-Russia investigation. Here are some of the key points: Claims of Collusion Evidence: Schiff repeatedly stated that there was evidence of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia, which was not supported by the Mueller or Durham investigations12. Critics argue that these claims were misleading or false. FISA Memo Controversy: The Schiff memo was criticized for containing false statements regarding the FISA warrant process for Carter Page. The Inspector General’s report supported many of the claims made in the Nunes memo, which contradicted Schiff’s assertions3. Whistleblower Testimony: There were false claims circulating about Schiff’s involvement with impeachment witnesses, including a bogus claim that he paid them over $40 million5. Censure by the House: Schiff was censured by the House for his comments on the Trump-Russia investigations, with the resolution stating that he “purposely deceived his Committee, Congress, and the American people”7. Assertions on Trump’s Actions: Schiff has been criticized for his interpretations of Trump’s actions, such as his claims about Trump’s handling of the Jamal Khashoggi murder investigation2. However, these are more about differing interpretations than outright lies. It’s important to note that while Schiff has faced significant criticism and controversy, not all of these instances necessarily constitute “lying” in a strict sense. Some may be seen as misinterpretations, exaggerations, or differing political perspectives.

DOGE – For the Records – Promt 2172025 The Department of Government Efficiency What is DOGE? ~ by Perplexity The **Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)** is a newly established initiative under the Trump administration, officially created on January 20, 2025. It is led by Elon Musk and aims to streamline federal operations by reducing spending, cutting regulations, and modernizing governmental technology. Despite its name, DOGE is not a Cabinet-level department but rather a temporary organization operating under the United States DOGE Service, which was formerly known as the United States Digital Service[1][2][4]. ### Objectives and Actions DOGE’s primary mission includes: – **Slashing Federal Spending**: The organization has claimed to save over $1 billion by canceling various contracts related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives[2][3]. Musk has suggested that DOGE could potentially cut up to $2 trillion from the federal budget by eliminating redundant agencies and downsizing the workforce[1][3]. – **Dismantling Bureaucracy**: The initiative seeks to reduce what it perceives as excessive government bureaucracy and wasteful expenditures. This includes proposals to consolidate over 400 federal agencies into fewer than 100[1][4]. – **Controversial Methods**: DOGE’s approach has sparked significant controversy, including lawsuits from Democratic lawmakers who argue that its actions may violate constitutional provisions. Critics have labeled DOGE’s efforts as a “hostile takeover” of federal functions[2][4][5]. ### Legal and Political Implications The establishment of DOGE has raised questions regarding its legality and authority. Critics argue that it operates beyond its intended scope, potentially infringing on established governmental processes. Supporters, however, view it as a necessary reform to address what they see as bloated government spending amid rising national debt[2][5]. The organization is scheduled to operate until July 4, 2026, during which it aims to implement its ambitious agenda[1][3]. In summary, the Department of Government Efficiency represents a significant shift in how the U.S. government approaches efficiency and spending, spearheaded by high-profile figures like Elon Musk amidst considerable political contention.

DOGE “Phase 3” Launching SOON Leaked Documents Reveal Lithocholic Acid (LCA) – What is it? – Prompt – 2162025 Prompt: What do you know about Lithocholic Acid (LCA) and its benefits? ~ by Copilot **Lithocholic Acid (LCA)** is a bile acid produced by the action of intestinal bacteria on chenodeoxycholic acid. Here are some key points about LCA and its benefits: 1. **Fat Absorption**: LCA acts as a detergent to solubilize fats for absorption in the intestine. 2. **Anti-Aging Effects**: Preliminary research suggests that LCA may have anti-aging effects, mimicking the benefits of calorie restriction. 3. **Anti-Tumor Properties**: LCA has been shown to selectively kill certain cancer cells, such as neuroblastoma cells, while sparing normal cells. 4. **Gut-Liver Axis**: LCA plays a role in the gut-liver axis, potentially regulating gut microbiota and intestinal barrier functions. 5. **Vitamin D Receptor Activation**: LCA can activate the vitamin D receptor without significantly raising calcium levels. 6. **Anti-Inflammatory Effects**: Some studies suggest that LCA may have anti-inflammatory properties. ~ by Perplexity Lithocholic acid (LCA), also known as 3α-hydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid, is a bile acid that functions as a detergent to help solubilize fats for absorption[1]. It is a monohydroxy bile acid produced by intestinal flora from chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) through bacterial action[2][3]. LCA was once considered toxic, but more recent studies have revealed that LCA and its derivatives may have anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects under certain conditions[2][3]. It goes through enterohepatic circulation along with other bile acids, impacting the gut microbiota, intestinal barrier, and relevant nuclear receptors[2][3]. Dietary fiber can bind to lithocholic acid, which can help protect against colon cancer by aiding in its excretion in stool[1]. Other effects and benefits of lithocholic acid: * **Anti-aging** LCA has demonstrated anti-aging effects in yeast, fruit flies, nematodes, and mice[1]. LCA can mimic the effects of calorie restriction, such as activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), enhancing muscle regeneration, and rejuvenating grip strength and running capacity[4][6]. * **Antimicrobial effects** LCA exhibits antibacterial effects against certain bacteria, such as *Helicobacter pylori*[3]. It can also show synergistic effects with clarithromycin or levofloxacin[3]. * **Antineoplastic effects** LCA has antitumor effects and can induce a multi-pronged antineoplastic program in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells[5]. It can inhibit cancer cell proliferation and reduce cell invasion capacity[5][8]. * **Vitamin D receptor activation** LCA can activate the vitamin D receptor without raising calcium levels as much as vitamin D itself[1]. * **NAPE-PLD binding** LCA binds with 20 μM affinity to the human membrane enzyme NAPE-PLD, enhancing dimer assembly and enabling catalysis. NAPE-PLD facilitates crosstalk between bile acid signals and lipid amide signals[1].

Copilot Incorporating Lithocholic Acid (LCA) into your body typically involves dietary supplements, as it is not commonly found in foods. Here are some ways to incorporate LCA: 1. **Supplements**: You can take LCA supplements available in health stores or online. Make sure to follow the dosage instructions provided by the manufacturer or consult with a healthcare professional. 2. **Probiotics**: Consuming probiotics can help promote the production of LCA in your gut. Probiotics like Lactobacillus and Clostridium species can convert primary bile acids into LCA. 3. **Calorie Restriction**: Some studies suggest that calorie restriction can increase the production of LCA in the body. While not a direct method of incorporating LCA, it may help boost its levels naturally. 4. **Healthy Diet**: Maintaining a healthy diet that supports gut health can also contribute to the production of LCA. Include foods rich in fiber, prebiotics, and probiotics to support your gut microbiota. Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen to ensure it is safe and appropriate for your individual health needs. Perplexity Incorporating lithocholic acid (LCA) into your body can be approached through dietary supplementation, but caution is advised due to its potential toxicity at high levels. Here are some methods and considerations for incorporating LCA: 1. **Dietary Sources**: LCA is naturally produced in the body from the metabolism of primary bile acids. While direct dietary sources of LCA are limited, it can be influenced by the consumption of foods high in fiber, which promote the growth of gut bacteria that convert primary bile acids into secondary bile acids like LCA. 2. **Supplementation**: LCA supplements are available on the market. If considering supplementation, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare provider to determine appropriate dosages and to monitor for any adverse effects, as excessive LCA can lead to liver damage or cholestasis[2][4]. 3. **Combination with Other Compounds**: Some studies suggest that combining LCA with other natural components may enhance its detoxification and reduce potential toxicity. For example, glycyrrhizin from licorice can promote detoxification processes that mitigate LCA-induced liver damage[2]. 4. **Research-Based Approaches**: Emerging research indicates that LCA may mimic certain effects of vitamin D and could be beneficial in specific contexts, such as enhancing calcium absorption or exhibiting anti-aging properties[3][5]. However, these benefits are primarily observed in controlled studies and may not translate directly to general dietary practices. 5. **Monitoring and Safety**: Regular monitoring of liver function and overall health is essential when incorporating LCA into your regimen, especially if taken in supplement form. The effects can vary significantly between individuals based on their health status and existing conditions. In summary, while there are ways to incorporate lithocholic acid into your body, it should be approached with care, considering both potential benefits and risks. Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.

Copilot Lithocholic Acid (LCA) can have some side effects, especially at higher doses. Here are a few potential side effects: 1. **Liver Toxicity**: High concentrations of LCA can be toxic to liver cells, potentially causing liver damage. 2. **Oxidative Stress**: LCA can induce oxidative stress and DNA damage, which may promote tumor development. 3. **Gastrointestinal Issues**: Some studies suggest that LCA might cause gastrointestinal discomfort or disturbances. 4. **Carcinogenic Potential**: There is some evidence that LCA could have carcinogenic properties, although this is still under investigation. It’s important to consult with a healthcare professional before taking LCA supplements to ensure they are safe and appropriate for your individual health needs. Perplexity Yes, there are known side effects associated with lithocholic acid (LCA)[2]. Once considered toxic, it can cause cholestatic liver injury and potentially lead to death from liver failure, especially in individuals with compromised sulfation[3]. Other potential side effects and considerations include: * **Carcinogenesis** It has been implicated in human and experimental animal carcinogenesis[6]. High concentrations of LCA can induce oxidative stress and DNA damage, potentially promoting tumor development by inhibiting DNA repair enzymes and encouraging cell proliferation[2]. * **Liver damage** Lithocholic acid is a liver-toxic metabolite[1]. Dietary administration of lithocholic acid to chickens has been reported to cause hepatic adenomatous hyperplasia[1]. * **Drug interactions** Bile acid sequestering agents like cholestyramine and colestipol may interfere with the action of Reltone by reducing its absorption. Aluminum-based antacids may also interfere with Reltone in the same manner. Estrogens, oral contraceptives, and clofibrate may counteract the effectiveness of ursodiol[1]. * **Gastrointestinal issues** Severe overdose with ursodiol would likely manifest as diarrhea[1]. * **Heart Symptoms** Serious heart symptoms such as fast, irregular, or pounding heartbeats, fluttering in your chest, shortness of breath, and sudden dizziness[1]. * **Other common side effects** Allergy, chest pain, fatigue, viral infection, abdominal pain, Cholecystitis, Constipation, Alopecia and Dysmenorrhea[1].

My wife and I are having a good marriage period but I dream very often that we get divorced/separated. Any thoughts? by Copilot Dreams can often reflect our subconscious thoughts, emotions, and anxieties, even if everything seems fine in our waking life. Here are a few thoughts on why you might be having these dreams: 1. **Subconscious Fears**: Even if your marriage is currently in a good place, you may have underlying fears about losing your partner or the stability of your relationship. These fears can manifest as dreams about separation or divorce. 2. **Change and Transition**: Dreams about separation can also symbolize changes or transitions in your life. It doesn’t necessarily mean a literal separation from your partner but could reflect other changes you’re experiencing or anticipating. 3. **Reflection of Stress**: If you’re experiencing stress or anxiety in other areas of your life, such as work or personal issues, these emotions might be seeping into your dreams and expressing themselves through themes of separation. 4. **Communication Needs**: Sometimes, these dreams might indicate a need for more communication or reassurance within your relationship. It could be your mind’s way of prompting you to check in with your partner and discuss any concerns, even if they’re minor. Remember, dreams are highly personal and can be influenced by many factors. While these are some general thoughts, your specific situation might have unique aspects. If these dreams are causing you distress, talking about them with your partner or a professional might help provide more clarity and peace of mind. by Perplexity Dreaming about divorce or separation can be unsettling, especially during a good period in your marriage. Dream analysis suggests various interpretations for such dreams: * **Fear and Insecurity**: Dreams of divorce can symbolize fear, threat, insecurity, sorrow, regret, and serious issues within your marriage[1]. It may also reflect a fear of change and uncertainty about the future[1]. * **Desire for Freedom**: A divorce dream may indicate a longing for freedom and liberation if you feel restricted or trapped, signaling a need to break away from old patterns[1]. * **Processing Unresolved Emotions**: Dreams of divorce can be an echo of complex emotions that remain to be fully processed, such as sadness, anger, or regret[3]. * **Reflection of Current Situation**: Dreaming about divorce could reflect your current situation, especially if the impact of a potential separation is affecting your subconscious mind[5]. * **Fear of Loss and Loneliness**: The dream may indicate a fear of losing loved ones or being separated from them, as well as a fear of loneliness and a desire to be among people[5]. * **Inner Transformation**: Such dreams can symbolize severing ties with an outdated version of yourself, which keeps you from living a more empowered and authentic life[3]. * **External Stressors**: Stress, fear, or anxiety in your life can manifest as dreams about divorce, indicating feelings of disconnection from your partner or yourself[1]. It may also be a sign to take appropriate steps to remove yourself from things that are not good for you[5]. Dreams are sensitive to our most important relationships, and a divorce is likely to dominate a person’s dreamscape for a long time[7]. It’s worth considering what these dreams might be telling you about your feelings, fears, or needs within the relationship.

Dreams about relationship troubles, including divorce, don’t necessarily reflect a desire for separation or predict future problems. In fact, they’re quite common even in happy relationships. These dreams often represent: 1. Processing natural anxieties about losing someone important to you 2. Working through past relationship experiences or witnessed divorces (perhaps from family or friends) 3. Dealing with normal relationship changes or growth periods 4. Managing general life stresses that might be manifesting in dream scenarios The fact that you’re in a good period in your marriage makes particular sense here – sometimes when things are going well, our subconscious mind processes our fears of losing that happiness. It’s similar to how parents might have nightmares about their children despite being wonderful parents, or professionals dream about failing at work despite being successful. by Gemini 2.0 Flash It’s understandable to be concerned when you’re dreaming about something that seems contrary to your waking life, especially when it involves your marriage. While I can’t give you a definitive interpretation (dream analysis is highly personal), I can offer some common reasons why you might be having these dreams, even during a happy period in your marriage. Here are some potential avenues to explore: 1. Anxiety about Loss and Change (Even Positive Change): Fear of losing what you have: Sometimes, when things are good, we subconsciously worry about losing them. Your dreams could be reflecting a fear that this happy period won’t last. It’s a manifestation of the anxiety that good times could end. Anxiety about change (even good change): Even positive changes in a relationship can trigger anxiety. Perhaps this “good period” involves new dynamics, deeper vulnerability, or future plans that are causing some subconscious unease. Are you stepping into new roles, facing new challenges, or making big decisions together? A need for control: The dream could be about feeling a lack of control over the future of your relationship. The divorce/separation symbolizes a major disruption, and the dream might be an attempt to grapple with the uncertainty inherent in any long-term commitment. 2. Exploring Unresolved Issues (Even if Subconscious): Dredged-up past hurts: Dreams can dredge up unresolved issues from the past, even if they seem insignificant in your waking life. Is there anything, even minor, that you or your wife haven’t fully processed or forgiven? Unmet needs: Even in a good marriage, there might be unspoken needs or desires. The dream could be a symbolic representation of a need for more emotional intimacy, greater freedom, or something else entirely. It’s not necessarily about your wife failing to meet these needs; it could be about your own difficulty expressing them. Self-sabotage: Although this is less likely, sometimes people subconsciously sabotage good things in their lives due to feelings of unworthiness or fear of commitment. The dream could be a manifestation of this self-sabotaging tendency. 3. Symbolism and Metaphor: “Divorce” as a metaphor for separation from a part of yourself: Dreams often use symbolic language. “Divorce” in your dream might not literally mean divorce from your wife, but rather a separation from a part of yourself or a way of life. Are you feeling disconnected from your passions, your identity, or your purpose outside of the marriage? Need for independence: The dream might reflect a need for more personal space or independence within the marriage. It’s not necessarily a negative thing; healthy relationships allow for individual growth and autonomy. End of a cycle: “Separation” could symbolize the end of a chapter in your life together. Perhaps you’re transitioning into a new phase of your marriage, and the dream is reflecting the letting go of the old. 4. General Stress and Anxiety: Unrelated stress: Stress from other areas of your life (work, finances, family) can manifest in dreams about your relationship, even if the stress isn’t directly related to your wife. Your subconscious might be using your marriage as a familiar framework to process general anxiety. Exaggerated fears: Sometimes, our dreams amplify our fears and insecurities. The dream might be an overblown representation of a small worry or concern you have about your marriage. What to Do: Reflect on the details of the dreams: What are the specific circumstances of the divorce/separation in the dream? Who initiates it? How do you feel in the dream (angry, sad, relieved, etc.)? These details can provide valuable clues. Talk to your wife (carefully): It’s important to approach this conversation gently. Don’t accuse her of anything or make her feel responsible for your dreams. You could say something like, “I’ve been having some unsettling dreams about separation, and I wanted to share them with you because I value our communication. I’m not blaming you, but I’m wondering if we can talk about any underlying anxieties or unmet needs we might have, even if they seem small.” Consider journaling: Writing down your dreams and exploring your feelings about them can help you uncover hidden meanings and patterns. Explore your own emotions and insecurities: Are there any areas in your life where you feel insecure, anxious, or out of control? Addressing these issues directly might help reduce the frequency of these dreams. If the dreams are causing significant distress, consider consulting a therapist: A therapist can provide a safe space for you to explore your subconscious anxieties and help you develop coping mechanisms. Important Note: Dreams are often symbolic and don’t necessarily predict the future. Don’t let these dreams create unnecessary anxiety or distrust in your relationship. Instead, use them as an opportunity for self-reflection and open communication with your wife. Good luck! by DeepSeek Dreams about divorce or separation, especially when your waking life feels stable and positive, can be unsettling. However, dreams often don’t reflect literal truths but instead symbolize deeper emotions, fears, or unresolved thoughts. Here are some possible interpretations to consider: 1. **Fear of Loss or Change**: Even in a happy marriage, it’s natural to have underlying fears about losing the relationship or facing unexpected changes. Your dream might be reflecting a subconscious fear of losing the connection you value so much. 2. **Personal Insecurities**: Sometimes, dreams about separation can stem from personal insecurities or self-doubt. You might be questioning your worthiness as a partner or worrying about whether you’re meeting your wife’s needs. 3. **Unresolved Conflict or Stress**: If there’s any minor tension or unresolved issue in your relationship (even something small or unspoken), it could manifest in your dreams as a more dramatic scenario, like divorce. 4. **Symbolic Transformation**: Dreams of separation or divorce don’t always relate to the relationship itself. They can symbolize a desire for personal growth or a need to let go of old habits, patterns, or aspects of yourself that no longer serve you. 5. **External Influences**: If you’ve recently been exposed to stories of divorce (e.g., from friends, family, or media), it might have triggered these dreams, even if they don’t reflect your own reality. ### What You Can Do: – **Reflect on Your Emotions**: Pay attention to how you feel in the dream and upon waking. Are you relieved, sad, or anxious? This can offer clues about what the dream might mean. – **Communicate with Your Wife**: If the dreams are bothering you, consider sharing them with your wife in a non-alarming way. It might open up a meaningful conversation about your relationship and strengthen your bond. – **Address Underlying Stress**: If you’re feeling stressed or insecure in other areas of life, those feelings might be spilling over into your dreams. Practicing self-care or journaling can help. – **Consider Professional Insight**: If the dreams persist and cause significant distress, talking to a therapist or dream analyst could provide deeper understanding. Remember, dreams are often symbolic and not literal. The fact that you’re having these dreams doesn’t mean your marriage is in trouble—it might simply be your mind processing emotions or fears in a safe, subconscious space. by OpenAi – ChatGPT 4 Dreams about divorce or separation, even during a happy marriage, can feel really unsettling. It’s important to remember that dream imagery often isn’t a literal reflection of reality but rather a symbolic expression of our subconscious mind.

Sometimes our subconscious mind uses dramatic imagery like divorce to express these anxieties. Symbolic Representation: Divorce in a dream might not literally mean the end of your relationship. It could symbolize a transformation or change—perhaps related to personal growth, evolving roles within your relationship, or even changes in life circumstances that you’re processing. Stress or Life Transitions: Recurring dreams, even pleasant ones, can sometimes be triggered by external stressors or significant life events. Reflect on whether there have been any recent changes, pressures, or decisions in your life that might be stirring up these feelings subconsciously. Personal Reflection: Sometimes, these dreams invite you to explore your inner feelings about independence, identity, or commitment. It might be worth considering if there’s an aspect of your personal life or self-image that’s undergoing change or if there’s an unspoken fear of losing something important—even if logically you know your relationship is secure. Ultimately, dreams are highly personal, and their meanings can vary widely from one person to another. If these dreams continue to bother you, discussing them with a trusted therapist or counselor might help uncover deeper insights and provide reassurance.

(AI Video Editor Capcut) A prophecy and a conspiracy theory – Prompt – For the Records What is the common ground of a prophecy and a conspiracy theory? (FEB 8-2025) ~ by Copilot A prophecy and a conspiracy theory share some common ground in terms of their speculative nature and the belief systems they often evoke. Here’s a brief comparison: Common Ground 1. Speculation Both prophecies and conspiracy theories involve speculation about future events or hidden truths. They are often based on interpretations of available information, sometimes without concrete evidence. 2. Belief Systems: They both can be tied to strong belief systems. Prophecies often stem from religious or spiritual beliefs, while conspiracy theories can arise from political, social, or cultural beliefs. 3. Prediction: Prophecies predict future events, often with a sense of inevitability or divine intervention. Conspiracy theories, while they do not necessarily predict the future, suggest hidden plans or secrets that can affect future outcomes. 4. Interpretation: Both rely heavily on interpretation of data, symbols, or events. In prophecies, interpretations can be of sacred texts or visions. In conspiracy theories, interpretations can be of information, news, and events. Differences 1. Basis: Prophecies are often rooted in religious or spiritual contexts, claimed to be divinely inspired. Conspiracy theories are typically based on an interpretation of real-world events, often questioning official narratives. 2. Purpose: The purpose of a prophecy is often to provide guidance, warning, or insight. Conspiracy theories aim to uncover hidden truths, challenge authority, or explain complex events with simplified, hidden narratives. Both prophecies and conspiracy theories can influence individuals and groups, often leading to strong convictions or actions based on these beliefs. ~ by Perplexity Conspiracy theories and prophecies both offer explanations of events through a narrative of good versus evil, often suggesting that nothing happens by accident and everything is interconnected[1]. They both simplify complex issues into simple causes and provide a sense of certainty about the present and future[1]. Similarities between conspiracy theories and prophecies: Narrative Structure: Both present a cosmic conflict between good and evil, occurring in visible and invisible realms[1]. Explanatory Power: They both promise to explain societal ills, typically through interconnected hypotheses[1]. Simplification: Both simplify complex issues into simple causes[1]. Psychological comfort: Conspiracy theories, like religious beliefs, can help people feel more in control by attributing random events to human actions or predetermined plans[3]. Elements of intrigue:They both contain a shred of interesting fact combined with partial evidence, rumor, and half-truths to make the theory believable[7].

Here are some key points of common ground: 1. Predictive Nature: Both prophecies and conspiracy theories often involve predictions about future events. Prophecies typically come from a religious or spiritual context, while conspiracy theories speculate about future events based on perceived hidden plots or agendas. 2. Uncertainty and Mystery: Both thrive on uncertainty and the unknown. Prophecies often involve mysterious or divine revelations, while conspiracy theories rely on hidden information or secretive actions by powerful groups. 3. Narrative Structure: Both often present a compelling narrative that explains complex events in a way that is easy to understand and emotionally engaging. This narrative can provide a sense of order or meaning to chaotic or random events. 4. Belief and Faith: Both require a level of belief or faith from their followers. Prophecies require faith in a divine or supernatural source, while conspiracy theories require belief in the existence of hidden forces or agendas. 5. Social and Psychological Functions: Both can serve social and psychological functions, such as providing a sense of control, understanding, or belonging. They can also offer explanations for events that are otherwise difficult to comprehend. 6. Skepticism of Authority: Both often involve a skepticism of established authorities or mainstream narratives. Prophecies may challenge religious or secular authorities, while conspiracy theories often distrust government, media, or scientific institutions. 7. Symbolism and Interpretation: Both rely heavily on symbolism and interpretation. Prophecies often use symbolic language that requires interpretation, while conspiracy theories interpret events, symbols, and actions as evidence of a hidden plot. 8. Community and Identity: Both can create a sense of community and identity among believers. Followers of a prophecy or a conspiracy theory may feel a sense of belonging and shared purpose with others who believe the same thing. While prophecies and conspiracy theories can be compelling and influential, it’s important to approach them critically and consider the evidence and sources behind them.

New players emerge, pricing changes, and feature sets are constantly updated. However, I can give you some strategies and names to watch for: Strategies for Finding the Best & Cheapest: Look for Freemium Models: Many AI video generators offer a free tier with limitations (watermarks, low resolution, limited usage). This allows you to test the platform and its capabilities before committing to a paid plan. This is a great way to find a cheap option that suits your needs. Consider Your Needs: Do you need high-resolution videos? Complex animations? Specific styles? Your requirements will greatly impact the cost. A simple video generator might suffice, avoiding expensive, feature-rich options. Watch for Sales and Promotions: Keep an eye on software review websites, newsletters, and the websites of the AI video generators themselves for discounts and special offers. Compare Feature Sets and Pricing: Don’t just look at the price tag. Compare the features offered by different platforms. A slightly more expensive option might offer better value if it has features that save you time and effort. Check Reviews: Read reviews from other users to gauge the quality of the videos produced, the ease of use, and the customer support provided by different platforms. Promising Candidates (but always check their current pricing and features): It’s impossible to definitively say which will be cheapest and best, as this is subjective and changes. However, these are frequently mentioned and offer various pricing tiers: Pictory AI: Known for its ease of use in creating videos from text or existing content. Likely to have a freemium model. Steve.AI: Focuses on making professional-looking videos quickly. Often compared to Pictory and may have competitive pricing. Synthesia: A popular choice for creating videos with AI avatars. Generally on the higher end of the pricing spectrum, but offers advanced features. Might have competitive pricing options for specific use cases. Kapwing: A versatile video editor with AI features. While not solely an AI video generator, its AI capabilities are powerful and it could be a cost-effective option depending on your needs. RunwayML: Offers a wide range of AI tools for video editing and generation, but it tends to be more expensive and geared towards professionals. Important Note: The “cheapest” option isn’t always the best. Consider the time you’ll save, the quality of the output, and the overall value you get for your money. A slightly more expensive option might save you significant time and frustration in the long run. Before making a decision, I strongly recommend visiting the websites of these platforms, checking their current pricing plans, and testing any free trials or freemium options available. The landscape changes quickly, so up-to-date information is crucial. ChatGPT – 4 For 2024-2025, several AI video generators offer a combination of affordability, ease of use, and powerful features. These tools are especially helpful for content creators, marketers, and businesses looking to produce video content quickly without needing a deep technical background. Here’s a list of the best and cheapest AI video generators for the coming years: 1. Pictory 2. Synthesia 3. Lumen5 4. InVideo 5. Veed.io 6. Descript 7. Runway 8. Animoto 9. DeepBrain 10. Magisto Choosing the Right Tool: These tools cater to a range of different needs, from simple social media posts to more complex professional videos.

that will make video content creation a whole lot faster and easier and I wish I had some of these way back in the day I've been creating videos professionally for over 15 years and I've been on YouTube for over eight years and in the last couple years as these new tools came about I pretty much started testing all of them out and this is the list of the seven tools that I use every single week now okay the first one I wanted to show you has saved me a ton of time this is called opes clip and opes clip what it does is you give it a long form YouTube link or any type of video link and it will basically clip it into short format videos for Tik Tok YouTube shorts Instagram reels so seven new AI tools you won't believe exist that's the video that I posted on YouTube already but it's a longer video now let me show you in a few seconds what opes clip did it created all these different short format videos directly from the transcript some have different variety of length this one is 10 seconds 1 minute 17 seconds all from the transcript and then once I have it here you see on the left side it gives a score to every single one so you start from Top This is 99 out of 100 so it had a strong hook it had a good flow the value and Trend was also very good there is a new Option inside a haen called generate looks and it's really interesting you could generate an AI Avatar using multiple photos now the interesting thing is my video looked nothing like this I was just in the corner like the video you're watching right now I was just down in this corner so it picked up on that it put me in the bottom half of the video if you wanted to edit it you could go to this edit clip panel and you have all these different options that you could actually use inside of the editor so if you wanted to you could change the different transitions you could Auto generate AI Boll Clips too you could see all these AI generate Boll got added automatically it's captioned the whole video for us extremely useful for repurposing any type of content that you're going to create for other platforms and make them into short viral content too next on the list is descript and this one is an AI powered audio and video editing software and this one I've been using for a very long time actually for four or five years now well before using chat GPT now all you have to do is upload any audio or video file the unedited version of that and even a podcast you drop an entire podcast into it and in a few seconds it's going to go ahead and transcribe automatically now once the transcription is done this allows and you want to edit videos or audio files by editing text so if I wanted to get rid of this entire section right here this whole paragraph if I just press delete it deletes that from the actual video or audio file so it will jump from here to there I could even do it with smaller section let's say just this one sentence I want to go ahead and delete it I could delete it and it's now gone from the video okay so that part is cool saves you a lot of time allows anybody that doesn't know how to edit video or audio to be able to do it using text but they have an AI Suite up here it's called Underlord this does require the paid subscription though but it lets you do a ton of things with AI for example you could click edit for clarity and it will literally remove filler WS any time you bladder any obvious Cuts automatically so this becomes an AI powered editor for you they have this option that will remove filler WS they have an option that removes retakes a lot of times if I'm recording a video like this and I make a mistake well it will just take out the worst take here automatically any gaps between WS if I have any pauses you want really tight edits and this also has one of the most powerful AI green screen options so let's say I didn't like my background in this video after I was done editing it well you have this option this green screen option you could click it I'm not obviously sitting in front of a green screen but this could actually remove this background and then I could add a different background right inside of here and look how clean and professional this looks like around my shoulders is incredible and then under stock you could do all kinds of different backgrounds over here you could do different visuals over here and I could just drop that here as a new track and it becomes my new background track now maybe this for what I was creating was a much more suitable background and you could drop your own you don't have to pick from the stock Library a huge timesaver the next one on my list is called spotter Studio the sponsor for today's video and this one is one of the best brainstorming tools I've ever seen but it's really a AI power Creative Suite I want to show you some of the options that I use every single day since I got access to it and all you have to do is link your YouTube channel to it so this is really designed for YouTube creators once you link your YouTube channel over here the first thing you could do is just right on top get bunch of ideas for your titles your thumbnails and the hook for your video so I'm going to type in the idea I have for this video top AI tools for YouTube creators right it's okay but it's not highly clickable I want to get some ideas I'm just going to press go right here and look at this one just right on top seven essential AI tools having listicle videos just outperform other type of videos that's why I made this one like this so and I picked seven that's a that's a great number usually for these type of videos and then you have a bunch of different options and then if you want to expand I could press continue and have this one expand out so they have this option that I actually like for rephrasing using the same one as the base one and then it's going to give me a bunch of new ideas based on that must try AI tools for YouTube creators I could add that seven in front of it that's probably going to be my title for this video or I could do an entire mood shift here and get Alternatives but in a different tone okay and if I like any of them I could go ahead and keep it I'm actually going to go back I like that this keeps the history of everything that you do within the same chat I'm going to go ahead and keep this one it's going to add it over here then I could go ahead and come up with a bunch of different thumbnail ideas too the thumbnail allows you to use the slider to go go in between your style of thumbnails and YouTube best practices I've been on YouTube for a long time so I think I use pretty much most of YouTube's best practices so I'll leave it right in the middle here and look at this because I point a lot on my thumbnails like if you go to my channel I'm pretty much right here I wear a gray hat most of the time I point to the title must try AI tools for YouTube and then I have bunch of little icons for the different tools this first one is probably going to be something that I'm going to go ahead and use for mine and this works like the title so you could get variations of that one and I could see different versions of these and this is not going to be my exact thumbnail right this is more for brainstorming and ideation I probably still use Photoshop to design it with my own picture over here and then if you go to the hook tab right over here this is going to help you come up with a hook for your video your first 10 seconds of the video and they have ton of other things like this calendar tab is one of my favorites where I could add new projects do my brainstorming ahead of time and then use this as my schedule calendar they have this outliers tab which is cool so if I go to what my audience also watches this shows other AI channels in the same niche as me and then it shows how well those videos are doing 1.7 times better in this video compared to his regular video so I know this is some trending tool that I might want to cover which obviously I covered Sora on this channel before and under my favorite you could actually Link in the settings the channels that you want to keep track of so Matt wolf Matt Burman futurepedia those are the channels I watch Pretty consistently and then I could see how well these are doing and then get brainstorm ideas directly by clicking this tab and get those ideas as well based on how well those videos are performing something you just can't do manually right I'm not going to go through hundreds of videos and see how well they're they're doing I need a tool like this to help me with that so spotter gave me a special link that gets you a 60-day free trial that I'll link below that's double the length of the free trial they have in the regular website and they're also doing a 25 ,000 giveaway right now to YouTube creators that use spotter studio and create a new project and that's also included as part of the 60-day free trial that I have linked below and I think once you start using it it's going to become your regular workflow so right now I'm 100% relying on this every time I brainstorm a new idea next on my list is 11 labs this is probably the best AI power text to speeech platform available right now let me jump into the app to show you how it works okay inside of 11 Labs all you have to do is pick text to speech and then typing your script or paste your script right over here now the reason why I really like 11 Labs is because a lot of people they want to be content creators but they don't want to be on camera all the time or they want to tell stories where you need different voices than just your own voice and these are very humanlike AI voices that you could go ahead and pick from The Voice library and then if you click on their voices you could listen to different ones I'll just show you a couple here later that same evening detective Carlson received this is a deep voice I have crossed oceans of time to find you I'll choose this one here that I really like and then you just go ahead and generate the speech from here New York was booming with skyscrapers like the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building beginning to Define its iconic Skyline now how incredible is that I just still can't believe sometimes when I listen to these These are AI generated voices and now with 11 Labs you could just press download right over here and you could download this audio file and use it anywhere you want and then you could even go to this dubbing Studio here and this one lets you I was using it about a year ago pretty frequently where you could dub any type of video into a different language so I was making videos in Spanish and in Hindi and in languages I just don't speak and then I was able to post those in some other channels or provide some people that wanted access to my videos in a different language now the next one I want to show you is called pictory this is an all-in-one video creation platform and this literally could turn a single text into a complete video and do everything including voice over and including your text captioning now pictory has a bunch of different options but text to video is one of the best ones right here I'll show you so I'm going to paste a script here that I made with chat GPT again about New York City in the 1920s and I could even use the voiceover I got from 11 Labs but this I think they have a partnership with 11 Labs so I think it might be already using the voiceover from there and then it's going to take care of everything in the step and then you could edit everything it makes now this literally makes you the whole video and it breaks it up into different scenes but one of the reasons why I really like it is it lets you switch everything out so a lot of these platforms are not going to do a great job the first time and just give you a finished video you could post but this makes it really easy so if I wanted to change scene two I mean just look at the caption right here I would definitely want to cut this in half I think that's way too much on screen and I could literally go scene by scene and do that and if I want to change the background I could select the background and I could go ahead and swap that out under the audio tab this voiceover tab you could generate voiceovers again directly from here and yeah it is from 11 Labs with premium voices so if you have access to that membership you could do that and you could change the formatting so if you wanted to do something for short form you could go ahead and change it directly from here these are for Tik Tok and shorts and things like that and then when you're done just go ahead and press download right on top now the next one on my list is called Adobe podcast directly from Adobe and the reason why I wanted to include this is because a lot of YouTube creators have figured out a lot of things about making good videos except for Quality audio and this literally takes pretty bad audio and makes it into studio quality audio this option right here and right over here you just drop in your audio and pretty quickly this analyzes the clip and it completely enhances it makes it much closer to Studio sound than what it sounded like before so if you don't have professional mics like this or if you're using your phone to record or like a GoPro to record I highly recommend you drop it into here enhance it very quickly make sure this is turned on and then just download it from here this is just on the web and really easy to use next on my list is called capcut this is a very popular video editing platform but they've added so many different AI tools that I think this fits in the AI powered category I could do any traditional editing down here just like any other video but let me show you some of these AI tools that are used pretty frequently let me go to this text tab right over here and they have this autoc caption it transcribes the video and generates the caption okay if you look down here this is added a caption to this entire video and that took less than 60 seconds that's 11 minute video under templates they have all these different style of captions that completely change how your caption is animated on screen I'll just click on this one for example I mean look at that compared to the previous one that was there by default and look at these emojis that actually fit with what the text is saying too I mean this is just incredible and these are fully editable too so I could go ahead and resize these and this is just one of the many many different templates they have for captioning and they also have this whole AI Avatar category so you could choose from different AI avatars that will help you read the script and they kind of look like this very useful to do that right inside of an editing app too there are other apps like hayen for example that create these AI avatars but this is kind of interesting to have this built into the app like this and then ad script they have different voices available and these are all part of the Pro Plan inside of capcut so as someone that creates content pretty much every single day those are some of the top apps that I rely on as a Creator I hope you found some of these useful as well thanks for spotter for sponsoring this video I will catch you on the next one by",

for inquiries: youri@flowflowmedia.com #YouTubeAutomation #YouriAutomation #YouTubeCashCow 38 comments as a YouTuber you've got two choices when it comes to AI you can either adopt it and win big or you can ignore it and get left behind but here's the problem with all the hype around AI it seems like every new tool promises to make a killer YouTube video for you that will hit the algorithm big time and blow up your channel but that's simply not true the fact is that barely any of these AI script writers video generators and thumbnail makers are any good and will actually make an impact on your videos and here's why an AI tool should either help you save money or help you create better videos so in today's video I'm going to give you the seven best AI tools that will do that the first AI tool that will help you save a lot of time and make you a better video is glasp AI Back in the Day writing a good script required a lot of skills and training I mean you needed to be proficient in researching topics organizing information and crafting compelling narrative atives it was a long painful and most importantly timec consuming process in the early days of YouTube even the most basic script writing could consume countless hours and the results often were a hit or miss then came tools like various content generators and AI script assistance which dramatically helped streamline the process but even since these tools came out one problem remained the quality of the script no matter how you put it writing a good script however simple still takes a lot of time it takes time to get the flow right it takes time to gather the information and it even takes time to learn how to use these script writing tools themselves so that's really all to say that script writing isn't easy nor quick and that is where glasp AI comes in handy glasp AI is a Chrome extension integrated with CAD GPT glasp AI can help you gather and summarize information from various sources including YouTube videos and Chad gbt can help you organize this information into a coherent and compelling script in a matter of minutes you can go from having no script whatsoever to having a full script done for you with AI in fact everything I have just said was done with glass p and the fact that you're still here watching this proves that this script can be as engaging as you writing it yourself here's how I myself like to use this tool whenever I'm making a new video I use glass by ey to summarize already successful videos since this video is about seven AI tools to create killer YouTube videos I try to model what already worked which is how I stumbled up on this video by Iman having installed glass PI right here within just one click of a button I have a bulletproof summary of this video and I can ask any follow-up question about it and here's why this is so powerful on YouTube the worst thing you can do when you're struggling to grow is try and reinvent the wheel instead it is much smarter to call copy what is already working and that's how I've grown over four channels now to over 100,000 subscribers not by Reinventing the wheel but by simply copying what works and then modeling it after my own formula and my own style and Glass by ey makes that extremely easy to do after summarizing iman's video I asked it to write an intro for my own video that has the topic 7 AI tools to make killer YouTube videos and as you can see it did that quite nicely then next up I opened the transcrip of this video and then I copied the part that I wanted to remodel I pasted that into GPT and then from there on I asked it to write a similar core part script using the same problem to solution process that Iman uses and as you can see it spit that out perfectly and if you read it you'll notice that this is actually the script I ended up using for the first part of this video this makes it easier and faster to create killer scripts for your YouTube videos saving you a bunch of time in the process and that's just like the next tool called gling AI this will help you save hours of video editing see back in the day editing videos required a lot of skills and mainly time you needed to know your way around video editing softwares have a good sense of timing possess an eye for detail then you would have to cut out all the bad mistakes from the footage that you received which trust me can add up quite a lot even for the best YouTubers out there and then once you've done that you needed to piece together a smooth engaging video that entire process could take hours if not days or weeks depending on the complexity of the video you're making now of course there is the alternative to hire a video editor that does the work for you but then still it would take that person hours days or weeks to edit your video and guess what you're the one that has to pay for that and that's where this brand new AI tool comes in gling AI it's an AI video editor that automatically detects the bad takes in your videos and then Cuts them out for you in a matter of minutes you can go from raw footage to having a fully edited engaging video all you need to do is upload your video and let gling a ey do the heavy lifting just think about how much time this can save you or your video editor so we'll do everything automatically but if there's any sentence that you would like to remove or add back in it's very simple all you got to do is click on the scissor icon right here and that part of the video is now back or deleted so even if you've never done any video editing before anyone can work with this you can also add Zoom on every single scene in case you wish to as well as improve the audio quality with just one click of a button this tool is not for heavy editing or crazy effects but it gets the most annoying part of video editing out of the way so at my company we use this as a pre- editor we let gling cut out all of the bad takes and then we render this as an Adobe Premiere file which we can then open in that video editing software and then continue with the effects animations and everything like that I'll leave the link for for you down below in case you want to try it out whereas the previous AI tools mainly save you time this next one can make you a bunch of money in fact it's currently making me around $5,000 every single month this AI is a full-fledged AI video generator that quite literally does all the work for you just by entering a prompt it can create a full video a script voiceover and video footage for you tell to make a video about how Paris became the city of love and it will do just that for you from here you can customize anything you'd like the script the footage the voiceover the subtitles anything can be done and the good part is you don't need to learn video editing in order to do so you can customize anything simply by telling it what to do now remember I said I make about 5k per month using this tool and that's right this is the backend of the channel that I'm talking about all of these videos are fully produced with AI with the tool that I just showed you and as you can see we're growing quite fast in the last 28 days we did 4.7k in Revenue with the earnings not even updated yet so you can try this out for yourself with the link in the description and speaking about making money on YouTube I use this next AI tool to make over $6,500 how I did that I will transparently show you in a bit I will show you the channel the videos and how I made the money with hey Jen you can make videos with AI characters at skill simply choose the character you like load in your script choose your voice over and you've got a complete video that looks as if it's made by a real human being this is perfect for talking head videos like I'm making right now as well as ugc videos because Haun has recently launched an update of AI characters specifically made for ugc now let's follow the money for a second I built a YouTube channel called Tom Stones using an haen AI character where I reviewed certain products on the channel one of these products is called mpy and it generated me over $6,500 in affiliate commissions which you can see right here so we've got mpy and then as you can see the payout for that is about $66,000 I then did that once again with a part that called Iz that so far made me $600 so over $6,600 in commissions from videos generated with an AI character see just 10 months ago I did not know whether these AI characters were any good would people notice would they actually convert into sales I had no idea but I tried it and then the market answered my question for me and then I tool that perfectly goes hand inand with haen AI is this next tool right here that lets you create high quality voiceovers from just having a script this is the best Tex to speech tool in the game and it even allows you to clone your own voice so that when you're sick or don't want to record again and again you can simply generate an audio file that sounds like you now did you notice that that wasn't even me that was my clone voice which honestly sounds like me which is absolutely crazy if you want to make videos but you're shy to be on camera what you can now do is take haen AI characters with an 11 Labs voice and there you go you can still make talking head videos like I'm doing right now even though you don't want to be on camera if you go to the library on 11 Labs you'll see that they've got tons of voices that you can use you've got storytelling you've got conversational you've got voiceovers for advertisements whatever you need they'll have it all you need to do is type in the script then click generate speech and it will create the voice over for you in the voice over that you selected and here's what that sounds like hey guys I hope you're enjoying Yuri's video If so like the video now but did Yuri tell you there's also very unique sounding voices like this yes we've got it all baby you can even do speech to speech changing from one voice into another which means you can record yourself and then change it to any other voice in 11 La the sixth tool that I want to show you is something I discovered only 2 days ago this AI has many different features one of them being generative AI with their new gen-f free Alpha you can tell it to create any shot and it will do so to make this fun let's say I went on a two-e holiday in Bali and I filmed A Day in the Life there professional as I am I forgot to record a drone shot of my Bali Villa to fix this I don't need to fly all the way back instead I just need to tell Runway amount the following thing I want you to create a drone shot of a villa and Bali on a sunny day make it look as if the Drone is flying North then all you need to do is Click generate and it's going to generate that clip for you and it can do this with literally anything you want and just like that I have the clip I need this AI really comes in handy when you need b-roll something that's impossible to find on stock platforms but that's not where generative AI stops these last but definitely not least AI tools I want to show you are respons I for people being forced to click on your YouTube video it can make your thumbnail so good that people are quite literally dying to know what's about to happen courtroom consequences with pretty much a million subscribers and 20 million views per month is a great example for this the AI tool they use is called mid Journey which specializes in creating images based on text prompts this allows you to create any image that you can imagine and if done correctly just like this channel you can create images to drive your viewers curiosity that makes them click your video now what's interesting to see is the Improvement of how real these images look just one year ago their AI generated thumbnails look like this they're good but you can kind of still tell it's not real nowadays they look like this that's as real as it gets and now even though this works wonders already there's one big problem with this mid journey is not specifically designed to make YouTube thumbnails and that's where this new promising AI tool comes in it's called pixels Ai and I recently had dinner with the founder of this software in Dubai and I have to say I like his vision his goal is to make it possible to generate a highly clickable YouTube thumbnail with AI with just a few prompts if not one prompt and I don't mean just any thumbnail I mean killer thumbnails with a high CTR the way this works is similar as to Mid Journey the difference is in the fact that he's actually trained this AI specifically for YouTube thumbnails I will put up some thumbnails generated with pixels AI on the screen now I think you'll agree that these look impressive especially considering that all of this was done by Ai and AI tools including all of the ones in this video will only get better as time passes by adopt it and when big or ignore them and get left behind the choice is yours",
