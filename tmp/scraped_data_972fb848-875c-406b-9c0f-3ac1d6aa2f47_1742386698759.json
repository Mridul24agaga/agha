But how exactly can AI help you achieve your marketing goals? In this blog, I'll be sharing 10 fascinating examples of AI in digital marketing that will blow your mind. So buckle up and get ready for an incredible ride! ‍ Use cases of AI in marketing automation ‍ ‍ AI has already revolutionized marketing automation, and its applications are vast and varied. One example is the use of AI in chatbots. Chatbots are AI-powered virtual assistants that can engage with customers, answer their questions, and even guide them through the buying process. This improves the customer experience and can lead to increased sales. Another example is the use of AI in email marketing. With AI-powered tools, you can examine customer data and generate personalized emails that have a higher chance of resonating with the recipients. This leads to more opens, clicks, and ultimately, conversions. AI is also applied to social media marketing in order to track trends and analyze consumer feedback. This can assist companies in producing more audience-resonant, relevant, and engaging content. ‍ Custom marketing campaigns ‍ With AI, you can develop custom marketing campaigns that cater to your particular requirements, target audience, and budget. AI technology can scrutinize customer data, forecast consumer behavior, and develop personalized messaging that resonates with your customers. This lets you fine-tune your marketing efforts, boost your ROI, and generate more sales. Plus, AI can automate the implementation of marketing campaigns, which saves you valuable time and resources. With AI, you can accomplish more efficiency, effectiveness, and triumph in your marketing campaigns. ** Personalized marketing messages** ‍ Creating personalized marketing messages is an excellent way to connect with customers and drive engagement. But crafting tailored messages for each customer can be a daunting task. Thankfully, AI can make the process smoother. By utilizing AI in marketing automation, businesses can analyze customer data and behavior to create custom messages that resonate with each customer. For instance, AI can segment customers based on demographics, location, and interests to create targeted campaigns. Chatbots are another great example of AI in marketing automation that can deliver personalized customer service. ‍ Automated email campaigns ‍ If you're running a business, you'll know that email campaigns are crucial for getting your message across. But let's face it, creating email campaigns that hit the right spot with your customers can be tough and time-consuming. Luckily, that's where AI comes in. AI can make the process of creating effective email campaigns a breeze. With AI-powered marketing automation, you'll be able to personalize your email campaigns based on your customers' behavior, preferences, interests, and demographics. Plus, AI can optimize your email content and subject lines to get more opens and clicks. And if you're in eCommerce, AI can analyze your customer data and recommend the most relevant products for cross-selling and up-selling. Pretty cool, right? ‍ AI-powered chatbots ‍ I'll admit, creating chatbots that provide a seamless and personalized experience can be a complex task. But that's where AI comes in - using natural language processing and machine learning, it creates chatbots that can understand and respond to customer queries in real time. You'll see businesses using chatbots for everything from answering FAQs to processing orders and providing recommendations. And some, like Sephora and Bank of America, are even using chatbots for personalized services! ‍ Examples of AI in marketing automation ‍ ‍ Sephora is using AI-powered chatbots to provide personalized recommendations to customers based on their skin type, preferences, and purchase history. The chatbot can also answer frequently asked questions and provide beauty tips and tutorials.

That's because the traditional way of creating ad copy can be a real time and money drain. I'll be honest, many businesses struggle to create effective ad copy that speaks to their audience, which can result in wasted ad spend. But that's where AI steps in to help. By automating the process, AI can create copy that is personalized and targeted to each individual user. Some examples of AI-generated ad copy are Google's responsive search ads, which use machine learning to adapt to the user's search query, and Persado, a platform that uses AI to create emotionally resonant ad copy.

This approach solves the problem of inefficient targeting and wasted ad spend, which can occur when ads are shown to the wrong audience. By using AI, you can analyze vast amounts of data on user behavior and preferences to create highly targeted campaigns. Some examples of automated ad targeting include Facebook's Lookalike Audiences, which uses AI to identify users who are similar to your existing customers, and Google's Smart Display campaigns, which use machine learning to optimize ad placement for maximum impact. ‍ Ad optimization ‍ Ad optimization is all about refining and improving your campaigns to achieve better results. This involves analyzing metrics like click-through rates, conversion rates, and cost per click to identify areas for improvement. But, let's be real, doing this manually can take a lot of time and effort. That's why AI is critical to ad optimization. With the help of AI, you can analyze large amounts of data quickly and make real-time adjustments to campaigns based on user behavior. For example, Google's AdWords uses AI to optimize ad placements based on user intent and behavior, while Facebook's Dynamic Ads use machine learning to personalize ad content based on user preferences. By incorporating AI into your ad optimization strategy, you can expect better-targeted campaigns, increased ROI, and improved overall ad performance. And, trust me, visual aids like graphs and charts can really help illustrate the impact of AI on ad optimization. ‍ Examples of AI in paid advertising ‍ ‍ Behr and HOLT CAT are two examples of consumer companies that are using AI for paid advertising. Behr, a paint manufacturing company, has leveraged AI-powered programmatic advertising to optimize their ad targeting and improve their campaign performance. HOLT CAT, a construction equipment supplier, uses AI-based chatbots to provide personalized recommendations to customers and improve their engagement rates. Additionally, many other companies are also using programmatic advertising platforms, which utilize AI to automate the process of buying and selling ad space, to improve their advertising efficiency and effectiveness. Interactive Investor uses the AI tool Albert to drive more account signups and reduce customer acquisition costs through paid search. The tool made real-time PPC campaign improvements to demographic targeting, keywords, ad copy, and campaign timing. The tool created nearly 10,000 different text ads and delivered a 286% increase in keywords, resulting in an 89% share of voice across the top 10 branded terms and a significant drop in cost per acquisition. ‍ Digital First AI for paid advertising ‍ ‍ With Digital First AI, you'll get personalized recommendations for the most effective paid marketing tactics for your business.

By integrating AI tools into existing workflows, digital marketing agencies can streamline the process of creating and distributing video content while also personalising it for your target audience. According to a report by Wyzowl, 86% of businesses use video as a marketing tool, and 91% of those believe it's a crucial part of their strategy. However, creating compelling and engaging video content can take time and effort. That's where AI comes in - it can help automate many tasks involved in creating video content, such as generating ideas, writing scripts, and even making the final video: What is AI-powered video marketing Benefits of using artificial intelligence in video marketing strategy The 3-step process of using ChatGPT to create video content A list of trending AI video creation tools What is AI-powered video marketing AI-powered video marketing uses artificial intelligence to optimise and streamline the video marketing process. This approach differs from the traditional one because it uses AI technology to create, analyse, and distribute video content. The role of artificial intelligence in the video marketing process is to automate many of the tasks involved in creating video content, making the process more efficient and cost-effective. For example, AI-powered tools can generate ideas for video content based on data analysis or existing content, automatically write scripts, and even create the final video using pre-existing footage, animation, or written content. In addition to content creation, you can use artificial intelligence tools to analyse and optimise videos for maximum impact. With machine learning algorithms, AI can track viewer engagement and use that data to inform future video content creation. AI can also analyse user behaviour and demographic data to personalise videos for specific audiences, increasing engagement and conversion rates. Overall, using AI in video marketing allows for a more data-driven, efficient, and effective approach to video content creation and distribution. How To Leverage AI for Social Media Posts: Take Your Content To the Next Level Learn how Benefits of using artificial intelligence in video marketing strategy There are numerous benefits to using AI-powered social media videos in your digital marketing strategy. Here are some of the most notable advantages. Increased efficiency One of the main benefits of using AI in video marketing is the ability to streamline the content creation process. AI can generate ideas, write scripts, and even create the final video, freeing up time and resources for other tasks. You can then use Sendible's bulk import feature to make sure everything is ready to go for when the time comes. This increased efficiency allows more video content to be made and distributed in less time, leading to better engagement and, ultimately, more conversions. Personalised content With AI-powered video marketing, it's possible to create personalised social media videos that have content tailored to specific audiences. AI can create content that resonates with individual viewers by analysing user data, such as browsing history and demographic information. This personalised approach leads to increased engagement and a more positive user experience. Better audience targeting AI can also analyse audience data and optimise video content for maximum impact. AI-powered analytics tools can track viewer engagement and use that data to inform future content creation. For example, at Sendible we use social media analytics to better understand what posts are bringing in engagement and what the optimal time is to post content on different platforms. This audience data allows marketers to make better decisions. With this data-driven approach, marketers can create video content that resonates with the correct target audience, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates. The 3-step process of using ChatGPT to create video content If you're ready to implement AI-powered video marketing into your digital marketing strategy, here's a step-by-step guide on how to ideate and create video content using ChatGPT prompts: Step 1: Come up with an idea by using AI video generator prompts Step 2: Create the video script Step 3: Prepare title, description, and promotional copy Step 1: Come up with an idea by using AI video generator prompts Feel free to skip this step if you already have a list of topics you'd like to cover. If not, try this tactic. Before heading to ChatGPT, remember the first rule of using artificial intelligence tools - they are not perfect, and they are always learning. You need to lead a conversation with it to get what you need. Now that we've covered that, it's time to open the chat. At this stage, you're just looking for ideas. But your prompt will have to be as specific as possible and include this information: Who is creating the video? What's your target audience? What is their most significant pain point? How many ideas do you want? Here's an example of a prompt: Imagine you're a social media manager in an agency looking to create up to 10-minute-long YouTube videos. Your target audience is fashion brands looking to improve their social media presence and boost eCommerce sales. I want you to create 10 video ideas in a table, addressing the pain points they must be experiencing, then lead towards the actual reason they are experiencing this and give a solution. In a matter of seconds, you'll be provided with this: You can then ask it to add additional columns, such as viral hooks. You can keep tweaking these ideas until you're pleased with the list and they align with your goals. And once this is done, all you have to do is run a quick keyword research, depending on the platform where you wish to publish the video. You want to ensure you'll include trending and relevant phrases that will target the right audience. Step 2: Create the video script You can choose whichever AI tool you like, but we'll continue using ChatGPT to demonstrate the process. This step consists of three stages: Outline Script Tweaks How to create a video outline? Your ideas are ready, and now's the time to write the outline for the first one. Use a prompt similar to this one to get started: Create an outline of an up to 10-minute-long YouTube video based on the second video idea you provided: 2. Common Social Media Mistakes Made by Fashion Brands Description: We'll explore the common mistakes that fashion brands make on social media, why these mistakes can harm their eCommerce sales, and how to avoid them. Viral Hook/Emotional Factor: Viral Hook: \"The cringe-worthy social media fails that will make you laugh (and cry)\" Emotional Factor: Humor The outline you receive should include the names of the chapters and the outline of each of them. In this case, the result included seven chapters and bullet-point lists for each one of them. If you're not 100% happy with the outline, now's the time to rewrite it or adjust particular sections. How to write a video script? Great! Your outline is ready; it's time to create the script. We found that it's best not to overwhelm the chat with too much information at once. So take it easy and start with a simple request: Please write the video script for YouTube based on the outline you provided. Use trendy tone and language typical for the fashion industry. Make it very engaging, action-focused, and witty. Ensure that each chapter can be repurposed as a standalone, short-form video on other social media platforms. You might get lucky and get a perfectly crafted script, but typically you'll get decent content without timestamps and calls to action. But don't worry. That's why we have the tweaking stage. Bonus tip: If a creator uses a particular tone you fell in love with, and you'd like your video to sound just like that, instruct ChatGPT to use the language tone of [insert video link]. Unfortunately, this will only work if the video was published before 2022. For now. How to tweak the video script? Your video script is good, but it's not perfect yet. It could be too short or missing time stamps, names of chapters, or calls to action. Nothing to worry about! Just continue the chat with a prompt similar to this one: The video should be at least 5 minutes long. Please adjust the length of content, add timestamps for each paragraph (normal speed of speech), add names of chapters, promote agencies services for fashion brands in the intro and outro, and invite them to learn more about these services in the link in the description of the video. Step 3: Prepare title, description, and promotional copy The choice is yours - you can either record and edit the video first or wrap up your chat with the AI tools first. I personally prefer the latter. Here are the prompts you can use to get the title, description, and social media copy for the promotion posts. Title: Suggest a few attention-grabbing titles for the video on the topic: Common Social Media Mistakes Made by Fashion Brands. Video description: Great! Please write the video description that includes these sections and use emojis: About the video Timecodes Additional resources Call to action to learn more about the services Copy for social media posts: Write a few social media posts that I could use to promote this video. Include emojis and relevant hashtags. Email content: Now I need content for the email that will promote this video. Please write: A few email subject line options (no more than 9 words and 60 characters each) A few email snippets (up to 50 characters each) T__itle (engaging and attention-grabbing) Copy that includes a call to action to watch the full video A list of trending AI video creation tools The choice is yours - you can record and edit the videos the traditional way, or you can experiment with artificial intelligence.

The evolution of AI over time has led to its integration into everyday technologies, making it an indispensable part of our lives. As AI continues to progress, it presents both opportunities and challenges that require thoughtful and responsible approaches. The Mechanics of an AI Video Generator An AI video generator is an application that combines AI technologies, such as machine learning and computer vision, to automate the creation of video content. These generators analyze vast amounts of data, including images, videos, and text, to generate coherent and visually appealing videos. Imagine a world where video content creation is effortless and efficient. AI video editors are at the forefront of this revolution, using cutting-edge technologies to streamline the process. Let's dive deeper into the inner workings of these fascinating systems. The Role of Machine Learning Machine learning plays a vital role in the functioning of an AI video generator. By training on large datasets, machine learning algorithms learn patterns and correlations that allow them to generate visually coherent videos. These algorithms can detect and analyze visual features, such as objects, scenes, and emotions, and use this information to construct compelling videos. The power of machine learning lies in its ability to adapt and improve over time. As an AI video generator continues to process more data, its algorithms become more refined, enabling them to generate increasingly realistic and captivating videos. This iterative learning process ensures that the videos produced by these generators are of the highest quality. How AI Video Generators Create Content An AI video generator follows a multi-step process to create content. First, it analyzes the input data, which can include images, videos, and text, to extract relevant information. This initial analysis is crucial, as it sets the foundation for the subsequent steps. In the case of our AI Photo Booth, Snapshot AI, the input is the user's likeness based on selfies captured or uploaded. The user then becomes the central subject of the video, resulting in a unique video output based on that person. Cool stuff! ‍ Once the AI video generator has gathered the necessary information, it proceeds to generate a storyboard. This storyboard outlines the sequence of scenes and their respective visual elements. It acts as a blueprint for the video, ensuring that the generated content follows a logical and coherent structure. With the storyboard in place, the generator applies various video editing techniques to bring the video to life. Transitions, effects, and audio integration are just a few examples of the editing techniques employed. These techniques add depth and polish to the video, making it visually appealing and engaging for the audience. It is worth noting that AI video generators are not limited to a specific style or genre. They can adapt to various creative visions, allowing content creators to explore different aesthetics and storytelling approaches. From cinematic masterpieces to playful animations, AI video generators are versatile tools that cater to a wide range of artistic expressions. Without doubt, AI video generators are revolutionizing the way video content is created. By harnessing the power of machine learning and computer vision, these systems automate the process, making it more efficient and accessible. As technology continues to advance, we can expect even more sophisticated AI video generators that push the boundaries of creativity and innovation. AI Video Generator Trends in 2024 These are some of the latest trends we're watching this year, which are tough to keep up with - it's evolving very quickly! Text-to-Video: Generating realistic videos from scratch based on your text input is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Tools like Synthesia and Invideo now let you create explainer videos, product demos, and even social media clips with AI-powered avatars delivering the message.

Not only is it revolutionizing technological advancement, but it is also getting rapidly adopted across all industries. Video marketing is the new normal in the digital marketing world, especially after brands, entrepreneurs, and influencers started embracing video content. When video marketing meets artificial intelligence, it creates a killer combo for marketers to take their social media marketing to the next level. So let’s try to understand how brands, small businesses, and marketing agencies can brush up their social media content creation with AI-powered video marketing strategies. The easiest way to manage and grow your social channels. Try ContentStudio for FREE Before we dive deep, it’s best to understand what AI-powered video marketing really is. What is AI-powered video marketing? AI-powered video marketing refers to the digital marketing strategy that involves creating videos for content marketing through AI-based video softwares. The best part about these AI video tools is that they are smart enough to quickly process and create videos based on the material provided to them. These AI-powered content creation tools allow digital marketers to crank out video content on social media at a much faster pace. No wonder we see so many AI-generated videos on TikTok, Reels, and Shorts. Video marketing with AI has never been this easy. Gone are the days when AI video tools could only convert blog posts into short videos. Now there are tools available on the market that could repurpose your podcasts into videos and even more. In today’s competitive SEO environment, SEOs strive to make their website look better in the search engines’ eyes. Therefore, elements like visuals, videos, and pictures help SEO content stand out from the crowd. Once you begin to comprehend what AI-powered video marketing is, you’re ready to explore a whole new chapter in your digital marketing journey. What are the benefits of AI in video marketing? Brands and influencers map out content plans for months so that they have a sense of direction. Video content plays a vital role in the wide spectrum of social media content creation without a doubt. We’ll see the broader picture of AI in video marketing and shed some light on the diversified benefits of using the technology in video marketing. Here are six benefits of AI in video marketing: 1. Content creation gets faster The first and foremost benefit of AI in video marketing is that video content creation gets faster. Usually, it takes hours to shoot and edit a normal sit-down YouTube video. On the other hand, AI has made content creation faster than ever. Given the right prompt, you could generate an AI-based video within a few minutes. Sure, one can argue on the style, formatting, and aesthetic of the AI-generated video as compared to a real footage video. But it’s also true that the faster you put out content, the quicker you can adapt. Example: Lumen5 automatically converts an article into a video. 2. Video publishing at scale Social media success comes with consistent publishing and regularly showing up for engagement no matter what social media platform you’re on. When it comes to video marketing, the same consistency applies here. You have to put out great videos consistently whether you’re on TikTok, Instagram, YouTube or other OTT platforms. If you’re not ready to put in the work on a consistent basis, then it’ll be fairly hard to win. Remember that you’re fighting an uphill battle when you’re trying to dominate social media. Example: Alfie Deyes Alfie Deyes is a YouTuber and vlogger from the UK. He has been making videos on YouTube for over ten years. No wonder he is one of the most popular YouTubers in the country. 3. Low human effort required One of the aspects of video marketing that marketers and influencers embrace is that video creation requires a lot of time and effort. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a YouTube vlogger, Twitch streamer, TikTok dancer, or Reels maker, every form of video content takes time, energy, and money. Well, AI has changed the video marketing game altogether. Gone are the days when you need hours of video shoot and then days to edit the video. AI video marketing has come to the rescue. All you need is to pick the right AI video marketing tool to create or edit the videos, and you’re all set to make an impact with video marketing with minimum to zero human effort. Example: Synthesia 4. Enables content repurposing Content repurposing is a content marketing strategy that allows content creators to convert one form of content into a different one without requiring any manual labor. The common use case of content repurposing is to convert blog posts into videos and videos into podcasts. So one of the perks of AI in video marketing is that there are a bunch of AI video tools that can convert blog posts into AI videos. Not only do these tools make video marketing easier, but they also speed up the content publishing process. Example: VEED.io Veed is an AI tool for video editing, screen recording, subtitling, and preparing videos for uploading to YouTube, Instagram, and other social platforms. 5. Video scripting gets better Video scripting is a part of YouTube content creation whether you make skits, reviews, docuseries, or any other type of content. Video script writing is an easy-to-understand AI use case in video marketing. Sometimes, it becomes overwhelming and daunting to come up with a catchy, attractive, and relevant video script. Therefore, an AI writing tool could help video creators scale and improve their video scripting. Example: ChatGPT ChatGPT is a free source for creating excellent video scripts if done right. The secret to creating the best video scripts is in prompt writing. The better the prompt, the more efficient the outcome. Related Read: 80+ AI Prompts for Social Media 6. Countless video content ideas generation Video ideas are imperative to making engaging, useful, and high-converting videos regardless of the social media platform. However, coming up with video content ideas is no easy task. This is where AI comes in and helps marketers, bloggers, and influencers. One of the benefits of AI in video marketing is that users can create dozens of video content ideas using the appropriate AI content creation tool. Almost every paid AI writing tool has a module or template for generating video content ideas. It’s a true testament to the idea of how effective AI technology could be in video marketing. Example: Jasper Jasper is a popular AI content creation tool that lets you create social media content, blog posts, post descriptions, subtitles, video scripts, and much more. It’s a complete suite for generating AI-powered content for marketing. Also Read: Top 20 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost Your Engagement How to Create a Video Script with AI New AI tools are popping up every day, and it’s hard to keep track of the best ones. More importantly, AI technology is rapidly replacing the human workforce as brands and organizations are embracing artificial intelligence at a quick pace. One of the areas that are being revolutionized by AI is video scripting for social media. Let’s discuss how AI can help you write video scripts and make video creation way easier. Here’s the four-step process of creating video scripts with AI: Step #1: Choose a tempting topic to make a video Before you start wondering about the best AI tool to create a video script, pay close attention to the video topic selection. Sure, most of you would have ideas in mind before opting for a video script writing using AI. However, it’s not the case for everyone. So start with finding a trendy and popular topic to make a video so that you don’t have to worry about getting attention on the video. Here are different ways to find a useful yet tempting video topic: Check with the latest trends in the industry Analyze the SERP for the relevant keywords Look through the comments on the blog and social media Dig into the emails and DMs from subscribers, customers, and prospects Keep an eye on Google trends when doing your topic research The point is that choosing the right topic to make an AI video is far more important than opting for a suitable AI video script-writing tool. Pat Flynn is a social media influencer, entrepreneur, and blogger. He is an influential and successful blogger turned entrepreneur. He also thinks choosing the right topic matters. You’ll hear this advice over and over again opt for the best yet relevant topic to create content no matter what the platform is. Step #2: Generate a video script using ChatGPT ChatGPT is a writing machine when it comes to generating plain text, ideas, tips, and codes. However, the only catch is writing a perfect prompt. Most people fail to come up with the right words or phrases to get the most out of it. No wonder most entrepreneurs, bloggers, and marketers use ChatGPT for ideation and brainstorming rather than writing articles. AI-powered video creation won’t be possible without leveraging the power of ChatGPT. To generate a video script, all you need is to input the prompt and let ChatGPT take care of the rest. Here’s an example of a video script: The prompt was about writing a video script explaining the steps involved in the barbecue process. The ChatGPT was instructed to keep the instructions simple, precise, and to the point. The outcome was quite decent. Step #3: Fine-tune the video script with Chat AI Once you’ve generated a video script with ChatGPT, you can always make alteration to add a human touch to it. Moreover, you can use ContentStudio‘s in-app AI assistant called Chat AI to fix or improve the video script generated with ChatGPT. Chat AI is a state-of-the-art chatbot developed by ContentStudio that interacts with users and provides comprehensive answers to their queries. You can learn how to use ContentStudio’s Chat AI if you want to dig deeper into it. Furthermore, ContentStudio has integrated an AI-writing technology that lets users write AI-generated captions and hashtags within a fraction of a second. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5EAbTDwpcE Step #4: Use a video generator to make a video Once the video script is done, you can put it into any AI-powered video generator tool to create a video. There are plenty of free AI video generator tools on the market that help users generate AI videos within minutes. You’ll find a handful of AI video generators in the next section of this article. Moreover, a lot of people are creating AI-based videos using ChatGPT and Canva. You can quickly take a peek at some of the related videos on YouTube to figure out how it’s done.

But the last few years have yielded wildly rapid advancements in AI, especially for media like graphics, writing and video. One such application is AI-generated video production, which has the potential to transform the way we create and edit videos. In this blog post, we’re going to take a look at some of the newest AI-assisted video production tools that are in the works and explore how they can revolutionize content creation, making it more accessible and cost-effective. Boost Video Efficiency AI Video Generators Appear Out of Nowhere Just a couple of years ago, no one was talking about creating videos from scratch using AI. Now, everyone is eager to see how they can ramp up their video content game with the help of generative AI tools. Imagen, an experimental text-to-image diffusion graphics generator released by Google, has recently gained attention for its ability to produce high-definition videos within seconds: Akin to other similar tools, Imagen is one of several open doors to new possibilities in the world of content creation. Gone are the days when businesses and creators had to rely solely on human expertise and extensive resources to produce compelling videos. AI-generated videos will imminently level the playing field, empowering individuals and organizations of all sizes to create professional-looking content without the need for specialized video editing skills or hefty budgets. But the capabilities of AI-generated videos extend far beyond simple image manipulation. These advanced algorithms have the ability to analyze vast amounts of data, recognize patterns, and generate high-quality videos that meet the desired specifications of the prompter. For example, you could use a tool like Stable Diffusion to simply describe any scene you can think of, like ”robots eating dinner in front of the Eiffel Tower”: And watch as the AI magically generates an image or video that practically matches your description: This type of technology is making waves in the content creation process, freeing video creators from the burdensome minutiae associated with video and image editing. Whether it’s a promotional video for a product, a captivating advertisement or an engaging tutorial, videos derived through artificial intelligence can fulfill a wide range of content needs. With the ability to generate videos at such speed and scale, creators can focus more on crafting engaging narratives and experimenting with innovative visual styles. Whereas before, ideation of video content was largely proactive, requiring a fully-realized idea to exist before the production of the video.

By leveraging AI-powered video creation, businesses can allocate their resources more efficiently. Instead of spending countless hours and considerable funds on intricate editing processes, they can now devote their energy to developing innovative ideas and refining their strategies. The creative vision takes center stage, allowing businesses to truly unleash their imaginative potential and bring their ideas to life with unparalleled ease. Furthermore, the time saved through AI video generation is invaluable. With reduced editing complexities, you can swiftly produce engaging videos that captivate your target audience and maintain a consistent flow of content. This accelerated production cycle not only saves time but also opens up opportunities for businesses to experiment with fresh concepts, respond promptly to market trends, and stay ahead of the competition.

Some are DIY, some are plug-and-play and some use AI. That’s right, AI video is on the rise, and more and more companies are using it to enhance their content marketing strategies. Let’s dive in and explore what AI video is and how it’s used in content marketing. What Is AI Video Marketing? AI video marketing refers to the integration of artificial intelligence to create video content for marketing purposes. This approach leverages AI-powered tools to streamline video production, enhance personalization and improve the efficiency of marketing campaigns. Creating videos takes a lot of work, from storyboarding and script writing to sourcing footage and video editing. By automating various aspects of video creation and distribution, AI enables marketers to produce high-quality content at scale, tailor messages to individual audience segments and optimize performance based on data-driven insights. Examples of AI Video Content Several companies and platforms have successfully implemented AI in their video marketing strategies, showcasing the potential of this technology. Generative AI Brand Videos Toys “R” Us used AI-powered video tools to create engaging video content in collaboration with their studio. For this video, the company used Sora, OpenAI’s new video technology, to create realistic scenes and characters from text instruction. It took just a few weeks to create this brand video which might have taken months using traditional video production techniques. It’s a cool video, though some people have noted the generative AI mistakes like the boys’ freckles disappearing and his glasses changing. However, it’s worth noting that AI didn’t do everything. The video had plenty of human help, including an Emmy Award-winning producer and a director from an Emmy-nominated creative agency. Webpage to Video Of course, sourcing footage is just one element of video production. With an end-to-end video creation platform, you can also use AI to generate the script, storyboard, voiceover, soundtrack and animations. In this video, we used AI to create a video from our 2024 State of Video Technology report webpage. Since our AI pulled the content from the page, there was no need to worry about storyboarding or scripting, although edits are easy if you want to change the text on screen or narration (or visual elements like the colors and footage). Making an AI video this way takes a matter of seconds, minutes if you want to do more in-depth editing. If you want to learn more about how it works, read our blog on how to turn a webpage into a video. With our Enterprise AI Video creator, you can also turn a doc into a video or connect our AI to your knowledge base so videos can be created at scale and always on brand. Commercials Using AI to create videos for commercials is a big opportunity for marketers. With today’s tools, you can feed the AI what you want the video to look like and it will generate something quickly. In this video, Heinz uses AI-generated images to further solidify their branding and make the claim that “ketchup” is synonymous with Heinz. While the video itself was still made by a human team, it shows that AI generated images and videos are making their way into our everyday understanding of items. FAQ Pages FAQ pages are a wealth of knowledge and helpful for improving your user experience. While written FAQ pages do the job, adding a video FAQ is more engaging and offers a different way to take in the information. In this video, we used our AI video creator to take a WhatsApp’s FAQ page and turn it into a video. Here’s how it looks. Note: As you can see, the video above has a CTA at the end sending people to the source page. Using AI to make an Interactive Video can be a great way to incorporate links to additional content you want users to see. Interviews for Content Marketing Another example of content marketing gold using AI? Why not add an interview with your CEO’s digital avatar or maybe a Q&A about your company’s origin story? The video above from author and podcaster Reid Hoffman amassed an impressive 127,000 views in just 3 months. People are hungry for AI content, so if you use AI in your video, be sure to highlight that for viewers. Bonus: Employee Training Videos We don’t think of HR content as marketing content, so this one is a bit of a bonus. But if you do use AI to create internal education content that’s not too sensitive to share, why not upload it to your YouTube to give customers a glimpse behind the scenes? Using videos for your internal training programs is a great way to engage employees, but it can be costly to create these videos. Fortunately, with AI, you can create training and onboarding videos faster and even customize them for specific employee courses. In the example above, this video uses an AI avatar to walk employees through an anti-bullying course. 5 Benefits of AI Video Content There are quite a few benefits of using AI to create video content. Here are a few. Saves Time AI significantly reduces the time required for video production. Marketers can easily cut down on their video content creation time using AI video generators. If it’s an end-to-end AI video tool like ours, that creates a complete video with all the needed components, you’re talking about a time savings of 100x or more — a video done in minutes instead of months. Traditional video creation involves lengthy processes, including video script writing, shooting and editing. AI streamlines these tasks by automating scriptwriting, generating visuals and handling post-production. This efficiency allows marketers to focus on strategic aspects of their campaigns while AI handles the rest. Easy To Scale One of the significant advantages of AI video marketing is its scalability. AI tools can help with content creation by producing a large volume of high-quality videos quickly. This scalability is crucial for staying relevant in a fast-paced digital environment where regular content updates are essential for engagement. Creates Great Experiences AI makes it possible to create immersive video experiences at scale and these experiences are everything. According to PwC, 17% of people will walk away from a brand they love after just one bad experience. Focus on delivering great customer experiences with the creativity and scalability of AI video. Even better, personalize the experience. Using our Enterprise AI Video solution, videos can easily be integrated with customer data for hyper-personalization or with live data so they are updated in real time. White paper Get our top tips from creating millions of Personalized Videos Download Improves ROI Video marketing has been shown to improve conversion rates (on average, sites that use video have a 65% increase in conversion rate). But video production studios can be expensive, cutting into your ROI. AI video can help you increase your video output without dramatically increasing your experiences, ensuring you get a better return on your investment. Empowers Personalization AI allows for a high degree of personalization in video content, tailoring messages to individual viewers based on their preferences, behaviors and interactions. This personalized approach not only enhances viewer engagement but also improves customer satisfaction and loyalty. According to a study by McKinsey, personalization can lead to a 10-15% increase in revenue. Where Can You Use AI Videos? AI is a powerhouse when it comes to making video marketing scalable, efficient and personalized. But where can you use these videos in your digital marketing strategy? Social Media Social media platforms are prime locations for sharing your videos. AI tools can create social media videos made for different platforms, ensuring they meet the specific requirements and preferences of each audience. This capability helps brands maintain a strong and engaging presence on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn and YouTube. Email Marketing Incorporating videos into email marketing campaigns can significantly boost engagement and increase click-through rates by up to 3x. They’re an interesting way to grab the reader’s attention quickly and creatively. You can also use videos to convey more information without having to use giant blocks of text in your email copy. Website Content AI-generated videos can enrich website content by providing visitors with engaging and informative visuals and keep them on the site longer. From explainer videos to product demonstrations, AI can create a variety of content that enhances the user experience and improves a brand’s site metrics. Ads Video ads are highly effective, with video view campaigns (VVC) getting an average of 40% more views than in-stream skippable cost-per-view campaigns. Even more impressive, AI tools can create targeted ads that appeal to specific audience segments, optimizing ad spend and maximizing ROI. These videos can be used across various advertising channels, including social media, search engines and display networks, ensuring that brands reach their target audience with compelling content. Get Started With AI Video in Your Content Marketing AI is a great tool for content creation that’s scalable, personalized and efficient.

AI tools transform your words into captivating visuals with advanced features & user-friendly interfaces. Explore our top 5 picks! In the digital era, video content has established itself as a dominant player in content marketing. As businesses strive to create engaging and captivating video content, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a game-changer. AI text to video tools have opened up new avenues in content creation, automating the process and delivering high-quality videos faster and more efficiently. AI text to video tools use advanced machine learning algorithms to transform text content into visually engaging video content. The process typically involves selecting relevant images or clips, synthesizing voiceovers, and syncing the visuals and audio to the text. These tools interpret the context and meaning of the text, ensuring the resulting video aligns with the message. The importance of AI-generated videos in content creation and marketing cannot be overstated. They enable businesses to repurpose existing content, reach a broader audience, and drive more engagement. Video content generally performs better in terms of user engagement and retention, making AI video generation an invaluable tool for marketers. History and Evolution of AI Text to Video Tools The journey of AI text to video tools has been marked by significant advancements and milestones, mapping the broader trajectory of technological innovation in the digital age. The Emergence of AI The story of AI text to video tools begins with the rise of artificial intelligence itself. Although the concept of AI has been around since the mid-20th century, it's only in the last couple of decades that it's become sophisticated enough to significantly impact fields like marketing. In the early 2000s, advancements in machine learning and natural language processing enabled the development of AI that could understand and interpret text. This laid the foundation for the creation of AI text to video tools. First Wave of AI Video Tools The initial wave of AI video tools was focused more on automating video editing rather than converting text to video. They could stitch together clips, add filters, and even incorporate music based on preset themes, but the capacity to understand and interpret text was limited. This sparked a wave of new jobs for video editing that requested experience with AI video editing tools like some of these video editor jobs available on Jooble or similar platforms. However, these tools marked the beginning of the automation trend in video creation, signaling the potential of AI to simplify the video creation process. Text to Video Revolution As AI technology evolved, so did its capabilities. The rise of more sophisticated machine learning algorithms led to AI tools that could not only understand text but also extract key points to create video summaries. This marked the advent of true text to video tools, which promised to revolutionize content creation by transforming written content into engaging videos. Tools like Lumen5 began to emerge, leveraging machine learning to interpret text, select appropriate images or video clips, and even generate voiceovers. Current State and Future Outlook Today's AI text to video tools are incredibly advanced, offering extensive customization options, high-quality output, and user-friendly interfaces. They have become integral to digital marketing, offering a means to quickly produce engaging, shareable content. With the integration of text to speech voices, these tools can now generate videos with natural, human-like narration, enhancing the overall viewer experience. With the continuous advancement in AI and machine learning technology, these tools are expected to become even more efficient and intuitive. They will likely offer better personalization, more creative control, and even deeper analytics, shaping the future of video content creation and marketing. Key Features to Consider When Choosing an AI Video Generator When selecting an AI video generator, several factors should be considered to ensure it meets your specific needs: Customization Effective marketing requires a brand to stand out, which means creating unique content that aligns with your brand's identity. The AI tool you select should offer flexibility to tailor visuals, text, music, and voice-overs. Whether you want to add your logo, change color schemes, or incorporate your brand's unique voice, your tool should offer robust customization features to bring your vision to life. Ease of Use Not everyone using these tools will be a tech wizard. Therefore, your chosen tool should feature an intuitive interface that makes it easy for even a beginner to navigate and use. Clear instructions, guides, or tutorials can further simplify the process. Additionally, responsive customer support is crucial, so if you encounter any issues or have questions, they can be promptly addressed. AI Capabilities The power of the AI behind your tool is paramount. Advanced AI is critical for effectively interpreting your text and generating professional-quality voiceovers. The AI should be capable of accurately understanding and conveying the nuances of the text. Additionally, it should be capable of learning and improving over time, adapting to your style and preferences to produce increasingly refined results. Library Options A diverse media library offering a range of images, video clips, music tracks, and voice-over options is highly desirable. Having a wide variety of media to choose from allows you to create more diverse and engaging content. It also helps if the tool includes copyright-free media, so you don't have to worry about licensing issues. Versatility The digital marketing landscape requires a variety of video content, from short social media snippets to longer explainer videos. Therefore, the tool should be capable of creating a wide range of video types. Whether you need to create instructional videos, promotional content, or social media posts, the tool should be adaptable enough to handle your diverse needs. Speed In the fast-paced world of digital marketing, being able to quickly create and distribute content is a significant advantage. The tool you choose should be capable of producing high-quality videos quickly. This doesn't mean compromising quality for speed - the tool should balance both effectively. Export/Share Options Once your video is ready, the ease with which you can export and share it is crucial. The tool should provide versatile export options, enabling you to download videos in various formats suitable for different platforms. Furthermore, it should facilitate direct sharing to social media platforms, saving you the time and effort of manually uploading your videos. Pricing While free tools can be attractive, they often come with limitations. When considering the cost of the tool, it's essential to assess the value it brings. Do the features justify the cost? Is there a tiered pricing structure that lets you choose a plan that matches your needs and budget? Consider these aspects to ensure you're getting a tool that offers excellent value for your investment.

The tool's user-friendly nature, combined with its optimization for social media content, makes it a popular choice among marketers looking to create engaging, shareable content. â Freepik Â Freepik AI video generator uses advanced image-to-video and text-to-video AI models to interpret uploaded reference images and descriptive prompts into immersive video content perfect for viral ads, marketing campaigns, and creative expression. With no traditional editing skills required, users of all skill levels can generate mesmerizing videos from animation to cinematic realism in a matter of minutes, easily formatted for use across social media and all other communication channels. The Impact of AI in Video Marketing Automation in Content Creation Automation in content creation is one of the most impactful advantages AI brings to video marketing. For instance, tools like Pictory can convert long-form content like blog posts or scripts into engaging short videos. What would traditionally take hours, or even days, of manual work - storyboarding, visual selection, audio syncing - can now be accomplished in a fraction of the time. This accelerated process enables marketers to churn out quality content more frequently, thereby maintaining a consistent presence in their audiences' feeds. By reducing the need for human intervention in technical tasks, AI also allows marketers to focus their energy on refining their content strategies and enhancing the storytelling aspects of their videos. For example, they could spend more time researching audience interests or crafting compelling narratives, thereby enriching the content's quality and potential for engagement. Optimization for Engagement AI's role in optimizing content for better engagement is another game-changer in video marketing. For example, Designs.AI's Videomaker uses AI to recommend suitable stock images, videos, and music tracks based on the text input. Likewise, Lumen5's smart algorithms suggest the most effective layouts and formats, thereby enhancing the video's aesthetic appeal. This ability to tailor content based on data-driven insights allows for a more personalized viewer experience. For example, if an AI tool detects that a particular audience segment responds better to videos with energetic music and vibrant colors, marketers can use this insight to tailor their content accordingly. Such nuanced customization goes a long way in capturing viewers' attention and improving engagement rates. Performance Analysis AI-powered performance analysis is a significant boon for video marketing. Traditionally, marketers would have to manually comb through heaps of data to gauge a campaign's performance. However, AI tools like Veed.io provide automated analytics, capturing a wealth of metrics like video views, average watch time, click-through rates, and more. Furthermore, utilizing hardware like H200 GPUs can support the processing needs of AI tools, helping them handle large-scale data analysis and improve the speed and efficiency of performance analysis in video marketing. These tools can also discern patterns in viewer behavior over time, identifying which types of videos get the most engagement or at what point viewers typically drop off. For instance, if the AI tool detects a pattern of viewers exiting the video at a certain point, marketers can use this insight to make their content more engaging in those areas. This level of precision in performance analysis enables marketers to continually refine their strategies and optimize their content for better results. In Summary As AI technology continues to advance, it's poised to play an even more significant role in shaping video marketing trends and strategies. With the ability to create personalized content, predict user behavior, and analyze big data, AI will continue to redefine the landscape of video marketing. In a world where attention spans are shortening, AI's ability to deliver engaging, personalized, and targeted content quickly will become even more valuable. AI text to video tools have emerged as pivotal assets in the modern digital marketing landscape. They allow businesses to create engaging video content quickly, efficiently, and at scale. Understanding the features and capabilities of these tools is crucial in leveraging their full potential. As AI continues to evolve, it promises even more exciting opportunities in video marketing.
