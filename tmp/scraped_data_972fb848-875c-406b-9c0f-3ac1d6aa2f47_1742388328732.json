An AI video tool is software that uses artificial intelligence to assist in creating, editing, or refining video content. These tools use advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to automate complex tasks, improve efficiency, and improve the overall quality of video production. AI video generator capabilities often include automatic editing, scene detection, video summarization, special effects, and personalized content recommendations, making video production more accessible for users with varying levels of expertise. Benefits of using an AI Video tool for content creation According to a recent report, about 92% of video marketers think video content results in increased return on investment (ROI). AI video tools transform video production by facilitating faster turnaround times, reducing production costs, and increasing experimentation and innovation. Let’s explore the key benefits of AI video generators for content creators. 1. Increased efficiency AI automates repetitive tasks like editing out pauses and applying effects, reducing production time. Videos that once took days can be completed in hours or even minutes, allowing for faster content creation. 2. Effortless personalization AI can analyze data to tailor videos to individual viewers. Imagine educational content that adjusts difficulty based on a student’s progress or marketing campaigns with product recommendations specific to a customer’s browsing habits. Personalization allows deeper engagement and increases the impact of your message. 3. Accessibility for all AI video generators with user-friendly interfaces empower non-technical creators to produce high-quality videos. Pre-built templates and drag-and-drop functionality make video creation intuitive and accessible, democratizing the content creation process. 4. Global reach with localization AI can translate scripts and generate captions, breaking down language barriers and expanding your video’s reach to a worldwide audience. This allows you to cater to international markets and maximize the potential of your content. 5. Content experimentation at scale AI facilitates A/B testing of different video elements, enabling data-driven decisions about what resonates best with your audience. This allows you to experiment with various video parts, like introductions or calls to action, to optimize your content marketing for maximum engagement. Potential challenges of using AI video tools for content creation While AI video tools offer compelling benefits, it’s essential to understand the potential challenges of this evolving technology. Let’s discuss some key considerations when using AI video generators for content creation. 1. Ethical considerations and bias AI algorithms are trained on existing data, which can perpetuate societal biases. Be aware of potential biases in the AI’s output, such as gender or racial stereotypes, and actively mitigate them to ensure fair and inclusive content creation. 2. Copyright concerns AI tools that generate content based on existing data can raise copyright issues. Understand the legalities of using copyrighted material within your AI-generated videos and ensure proper attribution where necessary. Also, consider AI privacy and consider the ethical implications of using AI in your creations to avoid stepping into legal gray areas. 3. Creative control and nuance While AI excels at automation, capturing the human touch of storytelling and emotional resonance can be challenging. Nuances in humor, sarcasm, or cultural references may be missed by AI, requiring creators to carefully curate the creative direction and emotional tone of their videos. 4. Quality concerns AI-generated videos often struggle with maintaining consistency and realism, particularly in complex scenes or with nuanced human expressions. Additionally, AI systems are susceptible to hallucinations, fabricating details or producing false information. Key factors to consider when choosing an AI video tool A recent study shows that as many as 91% of consumers want to see more online video content from brands, To harness the full potential of AI for your video creation needs, here are some key factors to consider as you choose the right AI video tool for your business: 1.

Customization options: Does the tool allow you to refine the AI-generated content to your liking? Can you adjust video styles, music choices, or voiceovers? 4. Pricing and scalability AI video generators come with a variety of pricing models. Consider: Subscription plans: Do they offer tiered plans catering to different needs and budgets? Pay-per-use options: Are there options for occasional users who only need the tool for specific projects? Scalability: Can the tool handle your current and future video production needs as your business grows? 10 AI video tools to elevate your content creation AI video generators can significantly elevate your video production game from automating tedious tasks to crafting personalized content.

Types of AI video generation Text-to-video Veo 2 is PURE FIRE 🔥 \"A small pink liquid monster, styled like a rapper with a backward cap and chunky gold chain, performing a kickflip down a flight of stairs. The skateboard spins multiple times underneath as the liquid creature's form ripples and splashes dynamically in… pic.twitter.com/0EEeWlPcHE — Javi Lopez ⛩️ (@javilopen) January 13, 2025 Text-to-video AI video generation allows users to create videos simply by describing a scene in text. The AI interprets the prompt and generates a matching video, complete with movement, lighting, and even physics. This is by far the most popular type of AI video generation. Image-to-video Look at that VEO 2 animates windows wallpaper! pic.twitter.com/qL51V8S4oA — testtm (@test_tm7873) December 26, 2024 Image-to-video AI video generation animates static images, bringing them to life with motion effects. AI can generate smooth transitions, camera movements, or even animate characters from a few frames. Image-to-video models are popular with AI video creators because they allow you to maintain character, scene and object consistency throughout your video. You would typically use these tools alongside an AI image generator like Midjourney. Video-to-video @runwayml has 4K upscaling now! 🤯 I did a comparison between Runway GEN-3 and Topaz Video AI's upscaler, from HD to 4K. Runway's file size footprint is 40% of Topaz (using the Theia model), and after reviewing the results on a 40\" monitor, there's little to no difference in… pic.twitter.com/GamPOXq9mr — Tom Blake (@Iamtomblake) January 9, 2025 Video-to-video AI video generation uses AI to enhance, modify, or transform existing videos rather than creating new ones from scratch. This can include improving video quality, changing styles, adding special effects, or even altering elements within the footage—like removing objects, or replacing backgrounds. Some good examples of video-to-video includes Synthesia's AI dubbing (with lip sync) or Topaz's video upscaling. Th‎e best AI video generator for studio-quality videos with AI avatars Synthesia PlayCreate an AI Video in 4 Minutes with Synthesia ⚡️ Verdict: Easy to use and great for training, internal communications, marketing, outreach and localisation/translation ‎Link: ‎https://www.synthesia.io/ Synthesia is a leading AI video generator that allows you to create studio-quality videos with AI avatars that can narrate your text. It includes more than 60 video templates you can start from, and you can choose between more than 230 AI avatars that speak more than 140 languages and accents. Here's an example video I made for a product launch: PlayProduct Introduction (Free AI Video Template) Synthesia can be used to create a variety of video types, with the most common use cases being learning and development videos, including training videos and other eLearning video production. It also excels at producing onboarding videos and video content for internal communications, as well as marketing and outreach videos. Synthesia is a top-ranked AI software, with 1150+ reviews on G2 and has a rating of 4.7 out of 5. The platform is being used by 50,000 companies of all sizes, with many big names among them, such as Reuters, Zoom, and Amazon. Synthesia is a browser-based platform and I found it easy to set up my first video. I simply typed in my script, selected an avatar from their library, customized my video with the AI video editor, and then Synthesia generated a polished video featuring one of its realistic AI avatars. With over 230 avatars to choose from, I easily found options that fit different tones and purposes. You can also make a custom avatar that looks like you. Synthesia supports over 140 languages, and I was able to create localized versions of my video with ease. The platform even has a multilingual video player that automatically translates videos to viewers’ preferred languages, making it useful for global audiences. I tried adding multiple avatars on screen to simulate conversations, which worked smoothly and could be helpful for training scenarios or role-playing videos. The platform has over 60 professionally designed video templates that make it easy to produce polished content quickly. Features like live collaboration tools allow teams to work together seamlessly, while detailed video analytics provide insights into video performance. Altogether, these capabilities make Synthesia a practical, efficient choice for professional projects. One of its most popular use cases is as training video software, but it's also great for other sales and marketing videos and multilingual content. Th‎e best AI video generators for creative video production Here's my rundown of the best text-to-video and image-to-video AI video generators for creative video production. Hailuo Hailuo Director Mode is so fun. Being able to combine camera shots is just fantastic. Here shaky camera and push in. pic.twitter.com/MfqBA22vm8 — Jerrod Lew (@jerrod_lew) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best free option for creative video production Link: ‎https://hailuoai.video/ Hailuo AI is an AI video generator that delivers high-quality 6-second video clips at 720p resolution. It offers text-to-video, image-to-video and a subject reference feature. Hailuo offers a 3-day free unlimited generation period so that you can generate a bunch of videos for free and really test the tool. Subject reference is a particularly cool feature. It lets you upload a photo of a character and then generate a scene with that character in it. I found the output to be pretty accurate, although I often needed to do some manual editing to maintain coherence. The model can also take multiple attempts to get it right, which will eat into your credits. The feature also often fails at close-ups (wide shots tend to work better but lose fine details). One of the first things that stood out to me was how well it understands prompts. Hailuo seemed to nail camera movements and scene composition accurately. The image quality is also noticeably high. However, generation times are limited to 6 seconds, which makes creating longer sequences more tedious. Al‎ibaba Qwen Another day, another release. Alibaba have quietly included video generation in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max and it's really good. Here are a few examples - check them out. pic.twitter.com/u6qptO59ai — TomLikesRobots🤖 (@TomLikesRobots) January 30, 2025 Verdict: Completely free and produces high quality videos, but often with unreliable generation Link: ‎‎‎‎https://chat.qwenlm.ai/ Alibaba included an AI video generator in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max. It’s a text-to-video only tool, but it’s completely free and I’ve been impressed by the quality. The one catch is that the generation is kind of unreliable. I often enter my prompt and the video generates up to 99% complete and then gets stuck for quite a while. In my experience the videos do eventually finish generating but be prepared to wait a little. The output quality seems to be really good, and while the functionality is limited, it’s completely free and the videos have no watermark. Kl‎ing If you’re looking to combine character consistency with high-quality VFX, @Kling_ai is the best choice. 🎥✨ Version 1.5 absolutely nails VFX. A true must-have! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/rO1WvmLj3k — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) January 12, 2025 Verdict: High quality output, but very long free plan generation wait times Link: ‎https://www.klingai.com/ Kling offers text-to-video and image-to-video features, along with free video generation credits for users who log in each month. Kling brings an impressive level of fluidity and realism to movement in videos. I found the adjustable creativity and relevance slider particularly useful for fine-tuning outputs. Its biggest strength lies in image-to-video generation (and in particular its elements feature), which is far superior to tools like Runway. The motion is smoother, and the AI follows prompts accurately. When I asked for a character to blink or walk forward while the camera zoomed in, Kling delivered exactly what I asked for. If you need storytelling or consistency between frames, Kling is a great option. Kling 1.5 also supports HD, which is a nice bonus. Kling has some drawbacks, the biggest being generation speed. On the free version, I sometimes had to wait an hour or more for a single clip, and I’ve heard of free users waiting a full day for results. This is a major issue if you need quick iterations. On a paid plan the generations are quicker, but I also noticed that Kling sometimes gets stuck at 99% completion and wastes credits. At the end of the day, if you prioritize quality, accuracy, and motion control, Kling is a great choice. The motion brush tool adds extra control, and the first-attempt success rate is high, meaning I spent less time fighting the AI to get what I wanted. Ru‎nway When setting up a shot in Runway, think carefully about where to put the camera. Consider what the camera placement tells the audience about the story, about the character, and about the moment. Every angle is a decision that affects how the audience will experience it. pic.twitter.com/XnijHcb0Jv — Cristóbal Valenzuela (@c_valenzuelab) November 11, 2024 Verdict: The Gen-3 model gives you great results and some amazing advanced features that come with a bit of a learning curve Link: ‎https://runwayml.com/ Runway’s latest Gen-3 model offers a comprehensive suite of creative tools, such as text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video, alongside advanced features like motion brush, keyframes, camera controls and inpainting. On the free basic plan, you can create short text-to-video clips (up to 10 seconds long or 16 seconds using the \"extend video\" feature in the older Gen-2 model) but can’t upscale resolution or remove watermarks. You also can’t generate videos directly from text using their Gen-3 Alpha model on the free plan (only images to video). However, you can still make great videos with just the image-video feature. Here's an example workflow to show you how I use Runway’s free plan to create AI-generated short story videos: Midjourney to generate images Runway for image-to-video Suno to generate music Elevenlabs for some effects Topaz for video upscaling Capcut for editing I found Runway’s advanced features to be pretty amazing. Camera control lets you adjust angles, focus, and movement to achieve a polished, professional look. The Motion brush tool allows you to add motion and direction to specific parts of a video, which is great for creating visually dynamic social media content. Keyframes allow you to configure the starting, middle, and ending frames to create smooth transitions between them. Inpainting lets you automatically remove unwanted objects throughout your clip. This tool handled complex scenes surprisingly well; I could remove background elements without affecting the continuity of the video, something that would usually require a lot of time and expertise. However, I found that these advanced features come with a learning curve, so if you’re new to video editing you might need a bit of practice to fully utilize Runway’s capabilities. I found Runway’s video generation process to be fast and reliable. I think the pricing is reasonable given the platform’s capabilities, especially for creators, filmmakers, and digital artists who want more control and creative freedom. However, the costs might feel high if you’re only looking for basic AI video generation, as Runway is designed for those looking to push creative boundaries and explore the possibilities of AI in video production. Go‎ogle Veo Been generating impossibly dangerous stunts with veo 2 using text prompts. Still surprising how realistic they can look (though not perfect yet). pic.twitter.com/0gETBwGH5y — Ethan Mollick (@emollick) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best option for creative video production, but limited access for now (US only waitlist) Link: ‎https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/ I was blown away by Google Veo 2’s realistic video generation capabilities. Every clip I produced, from a misty jungle scene to a foggy wildlife sequence, was rendered in stunning detail, and the visual fidelity was top-notch. One of the aspects that stood out for me was the advanced cinematic controls. I could specify everything from lens types to shot angles and even adjust depth-of-field effects, which made it feel like I had an entire professional film crew at my fingertips. The dolly zoom and pan shot features, in particular, added that extra layer of cinematic flair that really brought my scenes to life. In my tests, Veo 2 consistently produced more “correct” results compared to other tools like OpenAI’s Sora. The physics simulation is fantastic with objects and characters that move and interact in a way that feels natural and true to real-world behavior. I found that character consistency was excellent too; no matter how complex the scene, the generated characters maintained their look and identity throughout the video. Veo 2 supports high-resolution outputs (up to 4K) and longer video durations too, which simplifies your workflow as you won’t need upscaling tools. The only reason why Veo 2 isn’t my top pick for creative video production is because it’s still not publicly available - you have to join a waitlist and it’s still US only. There’s also room for improvement still, and I sometimes saw some strange character movements in my generated videos. Op‎enAI Sora 🚨 It’s crazy! #Sora just dropped, and it’s already blowing everyone’s minds! 😱🎥 Here are 10 mind-blowing examples showcasing its insane possibilities. 🔥 The future of video is here. 🚀👇 pic.twitter.com/Mcq2OepO3R — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Fun to play around with but needs to improve Link: ‎https://sora.com/ Sora is OpenAI’s entry into text-to-video AI video generation, and after spending some time with it, I’ve found it to be a mixed bag. On the one hand, when Sora works, it can deliver stunning, lifelike visuals, especially for abstract or artistic scenes. Its storyboard functionality is one of my favorite features, as it lets you prompt multiple shots in a single generation, and the “Blend” option adds a fun layer of creativity, allowing you to combine visual elements in unexpected ways. However, in my experience the model struggles with some critical aspects. Sora consistently fails when it comes to physics, general body movements, and character consistency. For example, I tried generating scenes as simple as making cats dance, only to be met with choppy motion, glitches, and overall results that were far from convincing. In several cases, the outputs felt like a gamble: some generations might be passable, but most of the time, prompts didn’t translate well into the expected actions or camera movements. I found that free or cheaper alternatives outperform Sora in accuracy and usability. There’s a steep learning curve, and despite the potential of the video-to-video remix functionality (which I’ve used to remaster some older AI-generated clips), the overall inconsistency is hard to overlook. You can access Sora on the plus plan ($20/month) which gives you 50 videos up to 720p resolution and 5 seconds long, or the pro plan ($200/month) for 500 videos up to 1080p resolution and 20 seconds long. Pi‎ka I had early access to the Pika 2.1 Model, A new journey begins, More clips to follow! @pika_labs pic.twitter.com/rN5OfMacoo — Stevie Mac (@StevieMac03) January 23, 2025 Verdict: The free plan isn’t great, but the premium plans have very good image-to-video features Link: ‎https://pika.art/ Pika offers a free plan that gives you access to Pika 1.5, which has text-to-video and image-to-video features and 150 monthly video credits. Videos can be downloaded without a watermark on the free plan. I wasn’t super impressed with the quality of the generated videos though. However, while Pika 1.5’s video output is nothing special, Pika 2.1 (available on the paid plan) offers an image-to-video feature called scene ingredients, which I think is pretty amazing. With scene ingredients you can build a shot from the exact character, object, wardrobe, and setting you want. It works by using reference images of each element and then providing a prompt. It’s similar to Kling’s elements feature in that it allows you to ensure creative consistency between scenes, which I found made it a super useful tool to produce actually usable videos. Lu‎ma First impression Luma > Sora pic.twitter.com/R2pXVsAesw — The Retro Burn (@burntheretro) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Their new Ray 2 model is great, but it’s a premium feature and it doesn’t offer image-to-video Link: ‎https://lumalabs.ai/ Luma's Ray 2 model has great motion realism and the physics feel really natural. The frame-to-frame consistency is a clear improvement over previous versions and it does an excellent job with cinematic elements, responding impressively to lighting, contrast, film formats, and camera motion. At times, it even seemed to intelligently structure shots. By using highly detailed prompts and running multiple generations, I found that it’s possible to create some truly stunning videos, though it does require some cherry-picking to get the best results. When I tested a sports car driving through snowy mountains at dawn, the scene composition was spot on and the snow, warm light, and camera tracking all felt smooth and natural. I also experimented with close-up shots of faces, and I was surprised by how well it captured emotional expressions, particularly in an extreme sadness prompt, where the eye movements and facial subtleties felt incredibly lifelike. Where Luma stands out is its ability to generate dynamic camera movements while keeping the scene coherent. It understands cinematic depth and framing in a way that makes it ideal for dramatic shots. I found that Luma is great at handling large-scale scene changes. For example, when I asked it to generate a collapsing building Luma delivered a convincing destruction sequence. Currently, Luma’s Ray 2 is only available to paid users and is capped at 720p resolution. Videos can be up to 10 seconds long, but I noticed that after about 7 seconds, scene consistency can start breaking down, occasionally shifting in unintended ways. Ad‎obe Firefly Here's another video created by Adobe Firefly.. a 3D printer, printing a car. Very impressed by the results. https://t.co/L5d8zf3TGv pic.twitter.com/ySylkRlDMS — techAU (@techAU) February 13, 2025 Verdict: Inconsistent motion and limited free use (only 2 free generations) make it hard to recommend Link: ‎‎https://firefly.adobe.com/ Adobe Firefly offers both text to video and image to video, both capable of producing 1080p clips from simple prompts or static images. Firefly struggles with distortion. I tested it by generating a video of \"a cyclist riding through a mountain trail in autumn,\" and while the colors and scenery were nice, the motion was noticeably unnatural. The cyclist's legs appeared to glitch mid-pedal, and the overall movement felt disjointed. Image to video fared better when creating abstract or background footage, but realistic human action remained a challenge. The output currently feels more like digital experiments than polished, usable content. On the positive side, Firefly's interface is intuitive. The built-in controls for adjusting camera angles, motion paths, and shot sizes make experimenting with different styles relatively simple. After generating two free videos, I was prompted to upgrade to either Firefly Standard or Pro for additional generations. While Firefly is enjoyable to explore and has clear creative potential, I’ll stick with more reliable alternatives for projects that need high-quality, natural-looking results. The best AI video generators for social media and YouTube content Fl‎exClip PlayHow to use FlexClip's AI Video Creator Verdict: User-friendly video tool with innovative AI features Link: ‎https://www.flexclip.com/ FlexClip is highly user-friendly platform that excels at helping you create professional-looking videos quickly and efficiently. I love the drag-and-drop editor. It’s perfect for creating videos on the fly without needing to spend hours on intricate editing. I’ve used it to create everything from social media content to promotional videos. The AI-powered text-to-video tool allows you to input simple text prompts, and the AI generates video clips based on the text, matching stock footage, adding text overlays, and even suggesting music. It's perfect for social media clips. While the AI can be a little hit or miss when it comes to perfectly matching footage to specific content, it’s an amazing tool for creating videos when you’re short on time or just need a draft to build upon, and I typically only need to make a few adjustments after generation. The AI script generator is another great feature. While the scripts are generally a good starting point, they often need a little fine-tuning to match the specific tone of the brand or subject matter. This is definitely a time-saver, though, especially when you’re stuck trying to put ideas into words. Another feature that impressed me was the AI background remover. It works surprisingly well. For most images, the background removal is clean, though it sometimes struggles with more intricate details like hair or small objects. It’s a great time-saver when you’re working with product images or need transparent backgrounds quickly. FlexClip also offers an auto-subtitle generator, which is a great tool for improving accessibility and engagement on social media platforms. It’s surprisingly accurate, and I’ve used it for videos on YouTube and Instagram. However, it does occasionally struggle with fast speech or complex accents, so if you’re working with content that has unclear audio, this may not always be 100% reliable. One area where FlexClip could improve is its media library. While it offers a decent range of stock footage and images, it’s not as extensive as some other platforms I’ve used. For niche content, I’ve often had to source additional media from other places. The stock library is good for general-purpose videos, but it may not always have exactly what you need. Ve‎ed PlayHow to Make a YouTube Intro Verdict: User-friendly browser-based video editor that streamlines social media content creation Link: ‎https://www.veed.io/ Veed is a user-friendly, browser-based video editor that made creating social media content incredibly easy for me. The intuitive layout and drag-and-drop functionality let me start projects quickly, and I loved using features like automatic subtitles, text-to-speech, and background removal to give my videos a professional touch. The templates and filters helped keep my style consistent, and with auto-translate, creating multilingual content was straightforward. The only downside I found was that the free plan includes a watermark, and complex scenes sometimes required a bit of manual tweaking to get the AI effects like background removal just right. Overall, Veed offered everything I needed for quick, polished videos with minimal effort. Ca‎nva PlayCreate content fast with Canva Video Verdict: AI-powered video editing with versatile templates Link: ‎https://www.canva.com/video-editor/ai/ Canva is not only a design tool; it’s also a great alternative for creating social media and YouTube videos. I tried its video editor, and I was impressed by how well it adapts to video creation. Canva’s templates make it easy to start projects tailored for platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. One of my favorite features is the automatic resizing, which lets me quickly reformat videos for different platforms without needing to start from scratch. The AI-powered suggestions for text and animations are also handy—it feels like Canva’s tools know how to keep my content consistent and visually engaging. With access to a vast library of stock media and music, I could easily enhance my videos, and the new AI text-to-speech and captioning features were a nice bonus, especially for making my videos more accessible. Overall, Canva’s video editing tools made it simple to produce polished, shareable content that looks just as good as anything created with dedicated video editors. The best AI-powered video editors Fi‎lmora PlayFilmora 14 is HERE! | Introducing a NEW way to edit Verdict: An affordable and user-friendly video editor with robust AI features Link: ‎https://filmora.wondershare.com/ When I first tried Filmora, I was immediately struck by how easy it was to navigate. The drag-and-drop functionality and straightforward interface made it simple to start editing, even without much prior experience. Filmora offers a robust library of transitions, effects, and templates, allowing me to quickly put together visually appealing videos, which is ideal for creating content for social media and YouTube. I appreciated how the platform balances usability with a range of features, making it suitable for both beginners and intermediate users who want to produce polished videos without a steep learning curve. Filmora’s pricing is also accessible, with options that cater to different types of users. They offer an annual subscription starting at around $49.99 per year, and for those looking for more flexibility, a lifetime license is available for around $79.99. There’s also a free version, which is great for testing the software before committing, but it does add a watermark to videos. For creators looking to edit consistently without major financial commitments, Filmora’s pricing offers a good balance of affordability and value, especially considering the powerful AI tools it includes. These plans are well-suited for individuals and small business owners who need regular access to professional-grade video tools without breaking the bank. Filmora's AI-powered tools bring a lot of convenience and creativity to the editing process. I'll run through each one. The AI Smart Cutout feature, for example, allows you to cut objects out of scenes by painting over the area, which is perfect for isolating specific subjects without complex masking. I also found AI Audio Denoise to be extremely useful for cleaning up background noise in my videos, especially when I recorded in less-than-ideal environments. The AI Audio Stretch tool was another handy feature that let me extend background music to match scene transitions, saving me the hassle of remixing or finding perfectly timed tracks. These AI tools are not only time-saving but also elevate the overall quality of the final video, helping users create professional-looking content with minimal effort. The AI Motion Tracking tool was a lot of fun to experiment with—it can be used to track faces or moving objects, allowing for privacy blurring or creative effects like pasting funny stickers over someone’s face to make meme-style videos. Another feature I really enjoyed was AI Remove Background, which made it easy to change the background of my videos without needing a green screen. I could, for instance, place a runner in an outer-space setting, which opens up endless creative possibilities. Additionally, Filmora’s AI Silence Detection tool helped speed up my editing by automatically removing pauses and hesitations, making it effortless to create snappy jump cuts. These tools make Filmora an efficient, AI-enhanced option for quick edits and visually dynamic effects. However, while these AI tools are great for general use, there are a few limitations. The precision of features like Smart Cutout and Remove Background isn’t perfect and might require manual touch-ups for complex scenes. Additionally, while Filmora handles most tasks smoothly, rendering can slow down when working with high-resolution files or when using multiple AI features in one project. This might be a drawback for users with demanding workflows or those creating high-quality, professional-grade content. Overall, though, Filmora’s AI tools make it an impressive choice for social media creators and hobbyists. In summary, Filmora is an accessible, budget-friendly video editor that packs a lot of AI-driven functionality into an affordable package. It’s particularly suited for those creating content for social media, YouTube, or personal projects. With its range of pricing options, Filmora offers a lot of value, especially for casual and intermediate creators who don’t need the high-end features of more advanced (and expensive) software. To‎paz PlayExperience Wonder by Topaz Labs Verdict: A premium AI-driven enhancer that delivers cinematic upscaling and noise reduction for professional-quality footage Link: ‎‎https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-video-ai Topaz Video AI is an advanced video enhancement tool that uses AI to upscale, stabilize, and improve video quality. When I tried it, I was impressed by how well it upscaled footage, even to resolutions as high as 16K, adding a cinematic clarity to older or lower-quality clips. The AI-driven noise reduction made a noticeable difference, effectively removing grain and artifacts that I struggled with in other software. I also found the frame rate enhancement and slow-motion features to be smooth and natural, making it ideal for creating professional-quality slow-motion shots or restoring archival footage. Priced at $299 for personal use and $1099 for commercial licensing, Topaz Video AI is an expensive but valuable investment for filmmakers, content creators, and digital archivists looking to elevate their work with high-end upscaling and video repair capabilities.

The array of AI-powered features—like background removal and automatic upscaling—made editing quick and straightforward, especially for creating social media content. The audio-to-text transcription was a time-saver, automatically adding captions that boosted accessibility and engagement on my videos. I liked tools like video stabilization and text-to-speech, which let me enhance video quality without needing complex software. CapCut’s collaborative features were also helpful, especially when working on shared projects, and the library of templates gave me plenty of creative options. Overall, CapCut’s versatility and ease of use make it a great choice for both personal and professional video editing. The best AI video generators for video repurposing Op‎usClip PlayOpusClip 3.0: The smartest AI clipping tool just got smarter Verdict: A smart and time-saving tool that repurposes long videos into engaging, platform-ready clips with minimal effort Link: ‎https://www.opus.pro/ Opus Clip has quickly become one of my favorite tools for repurposing long videos into social media-friendly clips. The AI-driven clip generation feature is surprisingly accurate, identifying the most engaging parts of my videos and saving me the time I’d usually spend sorting through footage. I appreciate how it automatically resizes clips to fit different platforms like TikTok and Instagram without any manual adjustments. Adding captions and even emojis is simple, and I noticed it makes the videos more engaging, especially for viewers who watch without sound. One of the standout features is the \"hook\" identification, which picks out key moments to grab attention quickly. Overall, Opus Clip made it easy to create compelling, shareable content from my existing videos, and the AI features really lightened my workload. Mu‎nch PlayMeet Munch Verdict: Efficiently converts long-form content into shareable social snippets using AI Link: ‎https://www.getmunch.com/ Munch is an AI-based tool for repurposing long-form video content into shorter clips suited for social media platforms. It identifies key moments in videos and includes features like auto-cropping, subtitles, and format adjustments to help optimize content for platforms such as Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok. Munch offers a streamlined way to create shareable content from existing videos, aimed at enhancing reach and engagement across various channels. I found the interface clean and easy to navigate, allowing me to jump right in without needing tutorials. One feature I particularly liked was the automatic detection of key moments. Munch’s AI identifies engaging segments, which saved me the time of manually sifting through my footage to find the best parts to share. For anyone looking to repurpose content across platforms, this automation is a real time-saver. Munch’s formatting tools also make it easy to resize videos for different social platforms. The auto-cropping options adjust clips to fit Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and more, making cross-platform distribution simpler. I appreciated the automatic subtitle feature, which made my videos accessible to a broader audience without much additional work. However, while these features are useful, they lack some customization. I couldn’t manually adjust the selected clips as much as I’d like, and sometimes the AI would pick sections that didn’t feel as relevant or engaging as I had hoped. One limitation I noticed is that the output quality and customization options are fairly basic compared to more advanced editing software. While auto-cropping and subtitles are convenient, the styling options for subtitles are limited, and I missed having more flexibility with transitions and effects. This might be a drawback if you’re aiming for highly polished, branded content, as Munch is more focused on speed and efficiency than fine-tuning. Overall, though, it’s a solid tool for quickly repurposing long videos into social-friendly snippets. If you need a quick way to generate clips from existing content and don’t require advanced editing, Munch is a handy addition to your toolkit. Wi‎secut PlayTurn long videos into shorts with Wisecut AI Verdict: Wisecut streamlines editing by automatically trimming dead space and adding professional touches Link: ‎https://www.wisecut.ai/ Wisecut automatically finds interesting moments in long clips and cuts them, adding music and subtitles. I tested it by uploading a raw clip full of awkward pauses and unnecessary dead spots, and Wisecut’s smart editing removed all the fluff. The auto-cut feature was spot-on, leaving me with a much tighter, more engaging video without having to painstakingly cut it all myself. The tool is super intuitive. It offers handy features like background noise cancellation and even let me choose whether to add background music, which really helped polish the final product. I also appreciated the straightforward interface—it made setting up projects and tweaking settings a breeze. In short, Wisecut has saved me a significant amount of time, letting me focus more on creating content rather than getting bogged down in editing. If you’re looking to streamline your workflow and produce cleaner, more professional videos, I’d highly recommend giving it a try. How did I decide on the best AI video generators?

Make a Video Updated: 12/10/24 Published: 06/16/23 Videos are integral to any marketing campaign; however, they can be tedious and difficult to create if you aren’t savvy with editing or are short on time. Fortunately, you can leverage many AI video generators to streamline your production and create content that engages your audience. But what’s the best AI video generator for your tasks? This article will explore 12 different AI video generators, their features, and how you can best use them in your next video marketing campaign. Time to press play on easier video creation. Table of Contents Can AI make videos? How to Make AI Videos Transforming Text to Video With AI What makes a great AI video generator? Best AI Video Generators Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video Can AI make videos? Yes, AI can make videos. AI video generators can instantly produce basic presentation slides with text, B-roll, and background music, all the way up to advanced videos of lifelike AI avatars “speaking” to you. AI’s impressive — but it’s not perfect. What works well with AI video generators: Video scripts. Being able to generate video scripts in a few seconds is incredible and saves so much time. Stock imagery, B-roll, and background music. Even though it still requires editing, having multimedia pulled automatically for you by the video generator makes it feel like you have an assistant. Video editing. The video editing capabilities are incredible and often beginner-friendly, which is a huge leap in the video editing world. What isn’t working (yet): Believability. The realistic AI avatars are incredibly advanced, but the mannerisms and articulation make it obvious that they're, well, AI. Pacing. Much research has been done on how quickly a video moves from scene to scene to hold viewers’ attention, and I found that not all generators factored this into their algorithms. Decision overload. The number of video templates, AI avatars, and effects available can overwhelm the editing process. AI is rapidly advancing, and some of these quirks will soon be passé. How to Make AI Videos The process for making an AI video will vary depending on the tool or platform you're using. Some generators work by analyzing and creating a video based on the script you uploaded, while others will follow a prompt typed in by the user. The key is to find a tool or generator with the features you need to create the kind of content you want. Transforming Text to Video With AI When ChatGPT catapulted to popularity in 2022, I don’t think the average marketers knew just how quickly AI video would follow. It needs to be used ethically to be useful to society, but when leveraged correctly, it’s an incredible tool. The most sought-after AI video feature is the text-to-video generator. This allows you to type in a sentence and, in a few seconds, be presented with an editable AI-generated video. I tested this feature using two different prompts: A vague prompt: “I’d like to educate viewers about AI-generated video.” A specific prompt: “I’d like to inspire beginner marketers to try AI video generation. The video should explain the benefits of AI video generators and should inspire viewers to try this new video tool.” I used HubSpot’s free AI video generator Clip Creator, and here’s what I saw. They were both high-quality videos. Both videos had appropriate stock images and music tailored to human behavior. The content was very similar for both videos. After testing many AI generators, I’ve found that a marketer’s time is better spent editing rather than making their prompt more specific. No matter how perfect your prompt feels, the end result will still require edits.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now What makes a great AI video generator? So, how does one evaluate all of the different software on the market? The best AI video tools all have a mix of these different features. Intuitive User Interface While most platforms list a long list of fancy AI features, users need an easy-to-use AI studio first and foremost. This enables a quick editing process. AI Scripts Automatically-generated video scripts save an incredible amount of time when producing video content. They turn written content (such as a blog post, email, etc.) or a prompt into spoken language. Sometimes, they even use an AI narrator to read it out loud for you. Not all software can generate video scripts, but it’s an enormous time saver. To be fair to the software that doesn’t offer this, it’s replaceable with a few clicks in ChatGPT. After trying more than a dozen AI video generators, I found the AI scripts were one of the features that made the greatest difference, along with the next feature. Factoring in Human Behavior Some software have tailored their AI to match user behavior, and some haven’t. For example, most people prefer videos with a brisk pace and visuals that don’t stay on the screen too long. In the video world, this is referred to as “pacing.” Not all software is tailored for this, and as a result, it will produce slow, lengthy slides that feel like a bad PowerPoint presentation. This isn’t a detail that software companies list on their “features” page, but it’s something that’s apparent based on the first draft of the video that the software gives you. Template Library Start from scratch? What is it, 2018? There’s no need to start from scratch with video anymore, as most platforms have built-in template libraries. Bonus points if these libraries include variation in: Intended audience. Aspect ratio. Project type. Editing Capabilities It’s normal for different software to offer different editing options, but most AI studios will cover the basics, such as: Text. Fonts. Music. Colors. Timing. Transitions. Animations. Stock footage. Different video styles. Pricing Tiers (or Free Plan) An AI video generator costs $0 to $50 a month (paid annually). All paid software includes a discount when purchasing an annual package, and the cost of month-to-month service is always higher. I know you’re on a budget — all of the suggested AI tools below are either free or include a free trial/demo. Multilingual Look for software that supports multiple languages if your business requires it. A chart comparing 11 AI Video Generators Chart comparing AI video generators Best AI Video Generators AI video generators have come extremely far in a short time. You can now make professional videos with the numerous text-to-video generation tools on the market. I’ve tried all the most popular AI video generators, so you don’t have to. Here’s what I found. 1. Clip Creator Source Clip Creator is the best AI video generator for beginners. It can be used by someone with no video experience and walks you through the video creation process painlessly. You start by answering a few basic questions (like video type), then provide a brief overview of the video you’d like to create. You can choose from video templates, which are oriented for both landscape videos and vertical videos. Then, Clip Creator uses AI to generate the text on your slides, plus the background imagery. You’re instantly given a video with editable text, stock images, background music, etc. The video creation workflow is very intuitive. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video My experience: I love how streamlined this AI video creator is. Instead of bombarding you with endless features, options, and pop-ups, Clip Creator starts simple and allows you to make any edits you need after it generates the video. Source Pros: Incredibly intuitive user interface, great customization options, and makes for a very fast and efficient AI video creator. Cons: Smaller template library than paid AI video generators, and no advanced features like realistic AI avatars. Best for: Video creation beginners and marketers on a budget. Most user-friendly interface and best free AI video generator. 2. Pictory Source Pictory is an excellent AI video generator for creators and marketers who don’t have experience creating videos. All you have to do is provide a script or article to guide your video content. For example, you can submit a blog post to the AI video creator, and Pictory will create a video based on the post that can be used for social media or your website. Furthermore, you can edit videos in minutes by using text. Pictory also includes a feature that creates shareable video highlight reels that can be used as a trailer or a short-form video for social media such as a Reel. Even better, Pictory can automatically caption and summarize your videos.

Marketing AI Tools Practical Tips Trends and Statistics And More! Get Your Free Report Learn more Get Your Free Report Download Free All fields are required. You're all set! Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: I provided the same prompt for Pictory as I did for the Clip Creator video, and it initially generated much less content (only 1 slide). I went back and instead provided a URL of a blog post and tested the blog-to-video generator. This feature automatically creates video scripts based on a blog post, and using their realistic AI voices, I could have it automatically narrated too. The writing on every slide needed to be edited significantly to be useful, but I was impressed with the options. Pictory supports multiple languages (currently English, Spanish, French, and German) and has a huge library of AI voices. Source Prices for Pictory start at $19 per month, and users can try a 2-week free trial. Pros: Users have a lot of options for how to begin their AI-generated videos, and they can thoroughly customize the video output. Cons: The first draft of the automatically-generated videos needs heavy editing. It may be faster to let ChatGPT write a script for you and use that. Best for: Marketers and creators with limited video editing experience who want to convert content like blog posts or webinars into shareable video content. 3. Simplified Source The Simplified AI video generator transforms a long-form video into multiple AI-enhanced clips with just one click. This allows users to create videos from text and make an entirely new video using its accessible editing interface. Simplified simplifies the way we produce content by providing users with easy access to an expansive in-app library that hosts thousands of templates, all available for free. I like that it guarantees exceptional video quality and pairs this with an intuitive, user-friendly interface, ensuring that users can craft high-quality videos without sacrificing ease of use. Its comprehensive suite of features goes beyond basic editing options to include animation enhancements and multilingual translation capabilities, making it a versatile all-in-one tool for video creation. Users can save their brand settings in Simplified’s “brand book” is a great time-saving feature. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just starting, this platform equips you with everything you need to bring your vision to life. Brands like Bloomberg, DuckDuckGo, and Cashify use Simplified for their marketing needs. My experience: I prompted Simplified the same way I prompted the other video generators, and I was immediately asked to describe my target audience and provide my video topic. This was a nice step toward more personalized videos, but it required more user-generated input than Clip Creator, which had a multiple-choice intake process. If you stick to the free plan, it’s time-consuming to sift through all the features to see what’s free to use. Source Prices for Simplified include a forever-free plan. Paid plans start from $15.20 a month and are billed annually. Pros: If you pay for this AI video creator, you have many creation options at your disposal that not all other platforms offer (AI meme creation, AI image generation, AI carousel maker, etc.). Cons: Not the best free AI video generator; other platforms are more generous with their features. You’re not able to test the text-to-video generator without joining a paid plan, as you’re about to do with other features. Best for: Creators who want to create, edit, and schedule videos for all social media platforms. 4. Movavi Video Editor Source Rather than generating AI videos from scratch, the Movavi Video Editor uses AI to make video editing easier. Video editing can be a time-consuming chore; for many, it’s the less enjoyable side of content creation. However, with Movavi Video Editor’s nonlinear AI technique, you’re not just replicating traditional tool functions but also enhancing your videos through advanced AI video editing. With AI background removal, you can cut out and replace backgrounds, adding a new dimension to your visuals. Plus, the AI noise removal feature enhances audio quality by automatically eliminating unwanted sounds, ensuring your videos are of the highest standard. Source The app also offers a host of advanced options like PiP, chroma-key, titles, keyframing, motion tracking, and more. Following the free 7-day trial, paid plans start at $49.95 per year. Pros: The presence of built-in training rapidly familiarizes you with the software, and it has features that many other AI video editors don’t. Cons: This AI video editor brings high-level tools (like color correction) to marketers, but total video newbies may be overwhelmed with some of the more advanced features. Best for: Creators and marketers who already have video footage and want help editing videos to be more engaging (or who just need to speed up the editing process). 5. Fotor AI Video Generator Source Fotor is an image and video editing platform that integrates various AI features, known for its creativity, intelligence, flexibility, and convenience. Its AI video generator fully utilizes advancements in AI technology, making video creation more efficient and enjoyable. Video creation is often a complex and professional process, but Fotor simplifies the steps. You just need to describe your creative ideas in text form and choose your desired style. AI will automatically analyze and generate a video you’ll be satisfied with. You can also upload images and add descriptions to generate a video. Whether you're an amateur video maker, a professional creator, or someone learning video production with no skills, AI will help you enjoy the efficiency and fun of video creation. Inspiration is important for video creators. Fotor AI video generator provides preset prompts and images, helping creators find more inspiration for their videos. My experience: Fotor’s interface is very user-friendly and simple. you can quickly find the features you need without any distracting ads or clutter. It also provides detailed step-by-step instructions, making it easy for new creators to get started. While creating videos, its preset text descriptions and high-quality images inspired me creatively. They also saved me time and greatly boosted my production efficiency. Source What I found most convenient was that after generating a video, I could perform basic edits directly in Fotor and I could also use their rich AI video tools, like one-click enhancement and beautification, background removal, and object elimination. Pros: The AI video generator supports creating videos in various styles, including Photography, Cinematic, Digital Art, Anime, Neopunk, Game Art, Illustration Art, and more. Catering to various creative ideas and needs. Cons: AI may not always fully understand textual descriptions or emotions and feelings, so some videos may not appear as realistic. Best for: Professional video creators, video creation beginners, social media video influencers, and users who enjoy trying and testing trendy and interesting features. 6. AI Studio Source With AI Studio, users can create videos by uploading their script and using the text-to-speech feature. The platform will then generate a video in five minutes or less. You can manually type in the script or copy and paste it into the platform. From there, you just need to select the appropriate language and AI model and finish editing. AI Studio allows users to select a custom-made avatar that suits their brand.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: New users can input a 300-character script, and an AI avatar will read your script using the AI text-to-video generator. I found the AI models to be less convincing than others; the mouths sometimes moved between sentences, and I think all viewers could identify these as AI. However, since the advent of TikTok’s text-to-speech narration feature, the public has become more accustomed to artificial narration, and there are many situations where this type of AI would work well. Source Prices for AI Studio start at $30 per month. Pros: The platform’s intuitive features make it excellent for beginners with limited or no video creation experience. Cons: The AI Studio avatars are identifiable as being artificial. Best for: Marketing videos that need text-to-speech narration and have visuals for B-roll. 7. Veed.io Source With Veed.io, you can use custom text, colors, font, and music to create a unique video for your brand. One of its standout features is Auto Transcribe. You can upload your video, hit the Auto Transcribe button, and immediately download the script. Even better, there is no software to download, and the platform is easy to use for those without video editing experience. My experience: I entered my “Pinterest marketing for beginners” prompt, and Veed.io quickly generated a short vertical video. The AI video generator automatically provided the script, AI narration, background music, stock videos, and close captioning. The on-screen captions were really engaging, using color-changing text and emojis — perfect for social media. Source Veed.io is free to use for videos under 10 minutes. To access more features, prices start at $18 per month (when billed annually) and go all the way up to enterprise custom pricing. Pros: The pacing, on-screen captions, slang, and approach were very engaging. Cons: The stock video that was automatically inserted into the video was off-topic at times but can be easily edited. Best for: Short-form videos designed to hold attention on social media. 8. Synthesia Source Synthesia's AI video generator enables users to create professional videos without requiring cameras, actors, or studios. Users can generate videos featuring realistic AI avatars that deliver content in over 140 languages by simply inputting text. This makes it an ideal tool for efficiently and at scale creating training materials, sales and marketing content, and internal communications. My experience: Synthesia's intuitive interface and extensive customization options make video creation straightforward. The platform's diverse range of avatars and multilingual support allowed me to produce engaging content tailored to a global audience. The quality of the AI-generated avatars is impressive, closely mimicking human expressions and speech patterns. Synthesia offers a free plan that includes 3 minutes of video per month, 9 AI avatars, and access to AI voices in 140+ languages. Paid plans are available for users requiring more features. Pros: Synthesia simplifies video creation with its intuitive interface and realistic AI avatars. Its support for over 140 languages makes it an excellent tool for creating global content. Cons: The free plan has limited features and is suitable only for basic use. Best for: Businesses and individuals seeking to create professional training videos, marketing content, or internal communications featuring AI avatars, especially when targeting a multilingual audience. 9. Elai.io Source Elai is simple and requires no video editing skills. To use Elai, copy and paste a blog post URL or HTML text, choose a template from its library, and let the generator do the rest. This AI video maker is specialized in corporate learning. Once the video is complete, review it to make any changes before rendering and downloading it. My experience: I found that Elai's format is unique. Even though the AI avatar doesn’t pass as a real human, its small display size makes it feel less distracting. The avatar compliments these videos instead of dominating them. I also really like the audio options: you can upload an audio file of you speaking, and Elai will generate a realistic AI avatar to narrate the text. Source Elai has over 60 languages and 25 avatars to choose from. You can use Elai for free with a 1-minute credit. For more features, Elai’s plans start at $23 per month (billed annually). Pros: As a specialized AI video generator, this tool allows you to quickly create training videos for new hires or product onboarding videos. Cons: Being a platform specialized for educational videos, it would be more time-consuming to create general marketing videos. Best for: Generating videos at scale and creating training videos and product videos. 10. Colossyan Source Colossyan provides a diverse range of avatars who can recite your script in various languages. You can also customize your avatar’s outfit. Colossyan’s key features are auto translations, subtitles, and the ability to enhance messages via screen recording. My experience: The AI avatar options from Colossyan are advanced. You can add multiple AI avatars to a single video screen in the video creation workflow, starting a “conversation.” You can even customize the pauses between speakers. Source There’s a free trial, and the prices start at $19 per month (when billed annually). Pros: The advanced avatar options make this a highly customizable AI video generator. Cons: The sound of the AI narrators isn’t the most natural-sounding. Best for: Creating training videos and explainers for workplace learning. 11. FlexClip Source This AI video generator features hundreds of video templates, AI-generated subtitles, background remover, and a text-to-speech engine. And its intuitive interface makes it simple for creators at any skill level. My experience: I created my video by inputting a URL and letting FlexClip automatically pull content from my website. The AI generator took an enormous amount of work out of the video creation process, but still required editing. The pacing of the video was slower than other AI tools, but I was able to easily customize all elements of the video. Source After the free plan, pricing starts at $9.99 per month (when billed annually, which saves 50%). Pros: The basic plan's price point makes this a very budget-friendly AI video generator. It is also a great, straightforward option for beginners who don’t want to feel overwhelmed. Cons: The AI-generated first draft requires more editing than some of the other platforms. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. 12. Wave Video Source Wave Video is a popular choice among content creators thanks to its many tools, which include image and video assets, text overlay effects, audio, and captions. The platform also provides a variety of video formats for Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and website-based applications. Other key features are: Text-to-video AI. Video hosting. Voiceovers. Text-to-speech. Millions of stock assets. My experience: I tested Wave Video by inserting a blog post URL and letting the AI video generator populate text and graphics based on the content. The video background graphics, pacing, and text populated on the slides needed significant editing to be ready for viewers. I like how easy it is to change the video format and edit any of the content. Wave Video also has many live-stream video tools. Source Wave Video is free, with monthly plans starting at $16 (paid annually). Pros: The features of this software are very beginner-friendly, and the user interface doesn’t feel overwhelming. Cons: The stock images it pulled were lower quality than the other AI tools. The images were blurry and stayed on screen much too long before switching slides (video pacing needed editing). Best for: Livestream videos. Making the Most of AI Video How will AI-generated video help your brand? With just a few clicks, you can create amazing videos, which was unimaginable a few years ago.

fastest-growing AI education platform & Instantly access 20+ top courses in AI: 👉 Start with a free trial: https://bit.ly/skill-leap ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 26 comments I've got a list of seven AI tools that will make video content creation a whole lot faster and easier and I wish I had some of these way back in the day I've been creating videos professionally for over 15 years and I've been on YouTube for over eight years and in the last couple years as these new tools came about I pretty much started testing all of them out and this is the list of the seven tools that I use every single week now okay the first one I wanted to show you has saved me a ton of time this is called opes clip and opes clip what it does is you give it a long form YouTube link or any type of video link and it will basically clip it into short format videos for Tik Tok YouTube shorts Instagram reels so seven new AI tools you won't believe exist that's the video that I posted on YouTube already but it's a longer video now let me show you in a few seconds what opes clip did it created all these different short format videos directly from the transcript some have different variety of length this one is 10 seconds 1 minute 17 seconds all from the transcript and then once I have it here you see on the left side it gives a score to every single one so you start from Top This is 99 out of 100 so it had a strong hook it had a good flow the value and Trend was also very good there is a new Option inside a haen called generate looks and it's really interesting you could generate an AI Avatar using multiple photos now the interesting thing is my video looked nothing like this I was just in the corner like the video you're watching right now I was just down in this corner so it picked up on that it put me in the bottom half of the video if you wanted to edit it you could go to this edit clip panel and you have all these different options that you could actually use inside of the editor so if you wanted to you could change the different transitions you could Auto generate AI Boll Clips too you could see all these AI generate Boll got added automatically it's captioned the whole video for us extremely useful for repurposing any type of content that you're going to create for other platforms and make them into short viral content too next on the list is descript and this one is an AI powered audio and video editing software and this one I've been using for a very long time actually for four or five years now well before using chat GPT now all you have to do is upload any audio or video file the unedited version of that and even a podcast you drop an entire podcast into it and in a few seconds it's going to go ahead and transcribe automatically now once the transcription is done this allows and you want to edit videos or audio files by editing text so if I wanted to get rid of this entire section right here this whole paragraph if I just press delete it deletes that from the actual video or audio file so it will jump from here to there I could even do it with smaller section let's say just this one sentence I want to go ahead and delete it I could delete it and it's now gone from the video okay so that part is cool saves you a lot of time allows anybody that doesn't know how to edit video or audio to be able to do it using text but they have an AI Suite up here it's called Underlord this does require the paid subscription though but it lets you do a ton of things with AI for example you could click edit for clarity and it will literally remove filler WS any time you bladder any obvious Cuts automatically so this becomes an AI powered editor for you they have this option that will remove filler WS they have an option that removes retakes a lot of times if I'm recording a video like this and I make a mistake well it will just take out the worst take here automatically any gaps between WS if I have any pauses you want really tight edits and this also has one of the most powerful AI green screen options so let's say I didn't like my background in this video after I was done editing it well you have this option this green screen option you could click it I'm not obviously sitting in front of a green screen but this could actually remove this background and then I could add a different background right inside of here and look how clean and professional this looks like around my shoulders is incredible and then under stock you could do all kinds of different backgrounds over here you could do different visuals over here and I could just drop that here as a new track and it becomes my new background track now maybe this for what I was creating was a much more suitable background and you could drop your own you don't have to pick from the stock Library a huge timesaver the next one on my list is called spotter Studio the sponsor for today's video and this one is one of the best brainstorming tools I've ever seen but it's really a AI power Creative Suite I want to show you some of the options that I use every single day since I got access to it and all you have to do is link your YouTube channel to it so this is really designed for YouTube creators once you link your YouTube channel over here the first thing you could do is just right on top get bunch of ideas for your titles your thumbnails and the hook for your video so I'm going to type in the idea I have for this video top AI tools for YouTube creators right it's okay but it's not highly clickable I want to get some ideas I'm just going to press go right here and look at this one just right on top seven essential AI tools having listicle videos just outperform other type of videos that's why I made this one like this so and I picked seven that's a that's a great number usually for these type of videos and then you have a bunch of different options and then if you want to expand I could press continue and have this one expand out so they have this option that I actually like for rephrasing using the same one as the base one and then it's going to give me a bunch of new ideas based on that must try AI tools for YouTube creators I could add that seven in front of it that's probably going to be my title for this video or I could do an entire mood shift here and get Alternatives but in a different tone okay and if I like any of them I could go ahead and keep it I'm actually going to go back I like that this keeps the history of everything that you do within the same chat I'm going to go ahead and keep this one it's going to add it over here then I could go ahead and come up with a bunch of different thumbnail ideas too the thumbnail allows you to use the slider to go go in between your style of thumbnails and YouTube best practices I've been on YouTube for a long time so I think I use pretty much most of YouTube's best practices so I'll leave it right in the middle here and look at this because I point a lot on my thumbnails like if you go to my channel I'm pretty much right here I wear a gray hat most of the time I point to the title must try AI tools for YouTube and then I have bunch of little icons for the different tools this first one is probably going to be something that I'm going to go ahead and use for mine and this works like the title so you could get variations of that one and I could see different versions of these and this is not going to be my exact thumbnail right this is more for brainstorming and ideation I probably still use Photoshop to design it with my own picture over here and then if you go to the hook tab right over here this is going to help you come up with a hook for your video your first 10 seconds of the video and they have ton of other things like this calendar tab is one of my favorites where I could add new projects do my brainstorming ahead of time and then use this as my schedule calendar they have this outliers tab which is cool so if I go to what my audience also watches this shows other AI channels in the same niche as me and then it shows how well those videos are doing 1.7 times better in this video compared to his regular video so I know this is some trending tool that I might want to cover which obviously I covered Sora on this channel before and under my favorite you could actually Link in the settings the channels that you want to keep track of so Matt wolf Matt Burman futurepedia those are the channels I watch Pretty consistently and then I could see how well these are doing and then get brainstorm ideas directly by clicking this tab and get those ideas as well based on how well those videos are performing something you just can't do manually right I'm not going to go through hundreds of videos and see how well they're they're doing I need a tool like this to help me with that so spotter gave me a special link that gets you a 60-day free trial that I'll link below that's double the length of the free trial they have in the regular website and they're also doing a 25 ,000 giveaway right now to YouTube creators that use spotter studio and create a new project and that's also included as part of the 60-day free trial that I have linked below and I think once you start using it it's going to become your regular workflow so right now I'm 100% relying on this every time I brainstorm a new idea next on my list is 11 labs this is probably the best AI power text to speeech platform available right now let me jump into the app to show you how it works okay inside of 11 Labs all you have to do is pick text to speech and then typing your script or paste your script right over here now the reason why I really like 11 Labs is because a lot of people they want to be content creators but they don't want to be on camera all the time or they want to tell stories where you need different voices than just your own voice and these are very humanlike AI voices that you could go ahead and pick from The Voice library and then if you click on their voices you could listen to different ones I'll just show you a couple here later that same evening detective Carlson received this is a deep voice I have crossed oceans of time to find you I'll choose this one here that I really like and then you just go ahead and generate the speech from here New York was booming with skyscrapers like the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building beginning to Define its iconic Skyline now how incredible is that I just still can't believe sometimes when I listen to these These are AI generated voices and now with 11 Labs you could just press download right over here and you could download this audio file and use it anywhere you want and then you could even go to this dubbing Studio here and this one lets you I was using it about a year ago pretty frequently where you could dub any type of video into a different language so I was making videos in Spanish and in Hindi and in languages I just don't speak and then I was able to post those in some other channels or provide some people that wanted access to my videos in a different language now the next one I want to show you is called pictory this is an all-in-one video creation platform and this literally could turn a single text into a complete video and do everything including voice over and including your text captioning now pictory has a bunch of different options but text to video is one of the best ones right here I'll show you so I'm going to paste a script here that I made with chat GPT again about New York City in the 1920s and I could even use the voiceover I got from 11 Labs but this I think they have a partnership with 11 Labs so I think it might be already using the voiceover from there and then it's going to take care of everything in the step and then you could edit everything it makes now this literally makes you the whole video and it breaks it up into different scenes but one of the reasons why I really like it is it lets you switch everything out so a lot of these platforms are not going to do a great job the first time and just give you a finished video you could post but this makes it really easy so if I wanted to change scene two I mean just look at the caption right here I would definitely want to cut this in half I think that's way too much on screen and I could literally go scene by scene and do that and if I want to change the background I could select the background and I could go ahead and swap that out under the audio tab this voiceover tab you could generate voiceovers again directly from here and yeah it is from 11 Labs with premium voices so if you have access to that membership you could do that and you could change the formatting so if you wanted to do something for short form you could go ahead and change it directly from here these are for Tik Tok and shorts and things like that and then when you're done just go ahead and press download right on top now the next one on my list is called Adobe podcast directly from Adobe and the reason why I wanted to include this is because a lot of YouTube creators have figured out a lot of things about making good videos except for Quality audio and this literally takes pretty bad audio and makes it into studio quality audio this option right here and right over here you just drop in your audio and pretty quickly this analyzes the clip and it completely enhances it makes it much closer to Studio sound than what it sounded like before so if you don't have professional mics like this or if you're using your phone to record or like a GoPro to record I highly recommend you drop it into here enhance it very quickly make sure this is turned on and then just download it from here this is just on the web and really easy to use next on my list is called capcut this is a very popular video editing platform but they've added so many different AI tools that I think this fits in the AI powered category I could do any traditional editing down here just like any other video but let me show you some of these AI tools that are used pretty frequently let me go to this text tab right over here and they have this autoc caption it transcribes the video and generates the caption okay if you look down here this is added a caption to this entire video and that took less than 60 seconds that's 11 minute video under templates they have all these different style of captions that completely change how your caption is animated on screen I'll just click on this one for example I mean look at that compared to the previous one that was there by default and look at these emojis that actually fit with what the text is saying too I mean this is just incredible and these are fully editable too so I could go ahead and resize these and this is just one of the many many different templates they have for captioning and they also have this whole AI Avatar category so you could choose from different AI avatars that will help you read the script and they kind of look like this very useful to do that right inside of an editing app too there are other apps like hayen for example that create these AI avatars but this is kind of interesting to have this built into the app like this and then ad script they have different voices available and these are all part of the Pro Plan inside of capcut so as someone that creates content pretty much every single day those are some of the top apps that I rely on as a Creator I hope you found some of these useful as well thanks for spotter for sponsoring this video I will catch you on the next one by",

Vidyo.ai 10 tips for maximizing efficiency with AI video toolsCreate impactful videos effortlessly with the right AI tools Share this article: Humans have always been visual creatures. From cave paintings to the latest viral TikTok trend, visuals have been our go-to mode of communication. Creating engaging videos can still seem daunting with the hours required for scripting, filming, and editing. Luckily, AI is here to change that. Imagine entering a text-based script, and moments later, a professional-looking video appears, complete with voiceovers, background music, and engaging visuals. Or picture yourself removing awkward pauses from a video clip with just a click of a button. These are not futuristic concepts—they’re the capabilities many AI-powered video tools like Loom’s screen recorder and Synthesia’s text-to-speech tools offer today. Explore the best AI video tools for content creation and discover what features to consider when selecting one. What to look for in an AI video tool When choosing an AI (artificial intelligence) video tool, consider factors like ease of use, AI-powered video editing, and automatic caption and transcription generation. All these elements help you create high-quality video content, including explainer videos, social media posts, and tutorials, without extensive editing or technical expertise. Here’s a closer look at the features to look for in an AI video creation tool: User-friendly interface In a world where time is money, AI video tools automate editing and make the video creation process seamless and quick. They allow you to focus on the creative side of production rather than worrying about complex tasks or software features. Look for a platform that offers a clean, intuitive interface, including a simple layout with easy-to-navigate menus and clear instructions, allowing even beginners with minimal technical skills to create professional videos. AI-powered video editing features You just finished recording a video presentation for your team. As you’re watching it, you notice a few awkward pauses, some “ums” and “ahs,” and a couple of lengthy segments that could be trimmed. In the past, this meant spending hours sifting through footage to make those edits. Today, AI video tools like Loom have AI-powered video editing features that automatically detect and remove awkward pauses, improve audio quality, and trim unnecessary sections, reducing considerable editing time. Loom’s AI video tools automatically remove filler words from your video It’s equally important to look for features like automatic transcription and caption generation to make your videos more engaging and accessible. Customization options While AI tools automate editing, look for ample customization options to tweak elements like text, colors, and transitions to maintain creative control, including your branding and style. AI tools like Pictory and Descript even offer editable templates to accelerate the content creation process while still giving you control over your content and branding. Collaboration features Collaboration features are essential when working with a team to streamline communication and feedback. Consider tools that allow multiple users to edit videos in real time, provide feedback directly on specific moments, and offer cloud-based storage for easy access and sharing, especially in remote or hybrid work workspaces. With Loom, teams can react to videos with emojis, add time-stamped comments, and share video content with a single click across platforms like Slack, Gmail, and more. 1. Loom Tired of spending hours editing videos just to communicate a simple idea or update? Loom’s AI-powered screen recording tool might just be the perfect fit.

Loom AI generates video titles and summaries, removes pauses and filler words, and even crafts messages for you.

Cons: Synthesia is script-driven, so you can’t record live videos. The AI-based avatars may lack human nuances. Pricing: Synthesia is free to start; paid plans that include more avatars start at $18 per user per month. 6. Runway ML Runway’s Gen 2 AI lets you transform text into captivating videos Runway ML is a machine learning–based platform that makes advanced video editing accessible to everyone. It provides an all-in-one suite that simplifies complex editing tasks, including background removal, modifying images, applying motion to images, and text-to-video generation. Features: Text to video: Generate images and even entire scenes from text prompts to visualize concepts without shooting live footage. Generative audio: Add voiceovers and dialogue to your videos with AI-powered text-to-speech and lip-sync options. Multi-motion brush: Highlight and animate up to five specific areas in your video, adding motion effects to static objects. Creative variations: Change settings like location, lighting, and characters’ appearance to test different styles and ideas. Pros: Real-time collaboration and project co-editing features make it perfect for remote workspaces. Runway ML offers many pre-trained models—ready-made machine learning models for image, audio, text, and video—so users can experiment without training models from scratch. Cons: Some of the advanced tools may take a bit of practice for new users. Runway’s AI tools require a robust device with strong processing power and memory—making it less than ideal for users with lower-end equipment. Projects with heavy effects will take a while to render, which might slow down your workflow. Pricing: Runway ML offers a freemium plan for standard features. For more credits and advanced features, paid plans start at $12 per user per month, billed annually. 7. AI Studios by DeepBrain AI Studios avatars AI Studios eliminates hours of recording, editing, and perfecting videos with solutions like text-to-speech with AI voiceovers, realistic avatars, video cloning, and more to help you create videos for marketing and training purposes. Input your text or upload PPT slides, choose an avatar out of 150+ options, and AI Studios will generate a video for you within minutes. Features: Multi-language support: Create videos in over 80 languages with natural-sounding AI voices. AI editor: Use the AI editor to create multi-avatar scenes, simulate interactions between them, and add movements and gestures to the avatars. Synchronized workspace: Collaborate with your team on video projects or share a link once you finalize the video. Pros: You don’t need any prior video editing experience to navigate its user-friendly interface. It’s great for producing multiple videos in different languages or for various audiences. Cons: While customizable, avatars lack natural expressiveness. It offers a limited customization option with few options to create highly expressive videos. Pricing: AI Studios starts at $24 per month when billed annually. 8. Lumen5 Lumen5 is an AI-driven video creation platform that makes it incredibly easy to turn text into video. You can enter your blog’s URL, upload a PDF file, enter text manually, or just share an outline—Lumen5 has an AI tool to create a script for you and generate a video. Lumen also supports talking head videos, allowing you to include callouts, an on-screen presenter, and cutaways into your video to enhance engagement. Lumen5 dashboard Features: Text-to-video conversion: Input your text, and Lumen5’s AI will automatically suggest relevant visuals and layouts. Customizable templates: Choose from various editable video templates for different use cases, like promoting a new feature or making an announcement. AI-driven storyboarding: Visualize how your content will flow in video format using the automatically generated storyboard based on your text. Pros: Lumen5 offers an intuitive drag-and-drop dashboard to create professional-looking videos easily. It offers a great selection of icons and stock footage you can use in your videos. Cons: The first two plans don’t let you create branded content—to add your brand’s watermark, you’ll have to opt for a much pricier plan. Rendering the video may take time due to the processing power required to combine media, text, effects, and transitions. Pricing: Lumen5’s initial freemium plan allows up to five videos per month. For fewer limitations and more features, paid plans start at $29 per user per month when billed monthly. 9. Wisecut Wisecut is an AI video editor that sifts through your videos to extract key moments and turn them into viral-worthy social media clips. Editing the videos is also a breeze with its “storyboard-based” dashboard that allows you to edit videos directly through text. Wisecut dashboard Features: Auto captions and translations: Generate accurate subtitles and translate them into multiple languages. AI-based silence removal: Automatically detect and remove silent pauses from your video. Smart background music: Add music to your video based on its content while performing audio ducking, which includes lowering the volume when someone is speaking. Pros: Wisecut is an excellent tool for brands looking to hone their video marketing strategy and get instant social media fame. It’s pretty cost-friendly relative to many of its counterparts in the market. Cons: It’s a video editor, not a video recorder or creator. Pricing: Wisecut paid plans start at $10 per month, billed annually. The freemium plan allows up to one hour per month of video recording. 10. Elai.io Elai is an AI-driven video content generator that offers features like text-to-video conversion and lifelike avatars to help you create professional videos in bulk. Interactive elements like quizzes and branching scenarios—leading to different paths and outcomes—make it particularly suited for sales enablement, training, and educational content. Elai user interface Features: Multi-language videos: Clone your own voice in over 28 languages or choose AI voices in over 75 languages and 450 accents to create videos for an international audience. Different avatar types: Choose from various avatars based on your use case, including selfie, studio, photo, and animated mascot. Pros: Its quizzes and branching features are great for customer education and employee learning. Elai is ideal for multilingual audiences.

Elai can get pricey, with a limit of only 15 minutes a month on the starter plan. Pricing: Paid plans start at $23 per month when billed annually for up to 15 minutes per month. The free plan allows only a one-minute free credit per month. 11.

Pricing: Paid plans start at $16 per month when billed annually. 10 tips for maximizing efficiency with AI video tools Start with clear goals. Understanding what role videos play in your business is key to choosing the right AI video maker for the job. If you’re focused on internal communications and personalized outreach, a tool like Loom is best. But if your goal is to create quick clips for social media, you might prefer Opus Clip. Brainstorm scripts. Even if you’re using an AI-generated video script, customization is essential for keeping your videos focused and cohesive. Keep it concise. The Sprout Social Index Report found that two-thirds of consumers find short-form videos to be the most engaging form of content on social media. Keep your content short and sweet to maintain attention. Use high-quality visuals. Look for video creation tools that record in at least high definition (HD). For example, the Loom free plan records in HD, while paid plans record in up to 4K resolution. If you use AI video generators, look for libraries of professional-level stock footage or high-quality, AI-generated videos that look realistic. Add a CTA. Make it clear what you want your viewers to do after they watch your video by adding a CTA. Some AI video editors, like Loom, allow you to embed auto-CTA links directly into your videos to make it even easier for viewers to take the next step. Track your results. Keep an eye on how your videos perform and adjust as necessary. Measuring video engagement is also important for training videos and team updates. Tools like Loom allow you to see who hasn’t watched your video yet, giving you a chance to follow up. Start small. You don’t need to overhaul your entire video strategy or team collaboration workflow overnight. Start with small steps to gradually integrate AI tools into your process, gain confidence, and experiment with different ways to use AI to your advantage. Create impactful videos effortlessly with the right AI tools You post an engaging video on your social media channels. The next thing you know, everyone’s sharing, commenting, and creating their own interpretations. This is the kind of buzz that great video content generates—captivating, memorable, and, most importantly, shareable. With AI video tools in your tool kit, your video marketing strategy can produce that level of excitement effortlessly, and within a few minutes. You can streamline your video creation process and turn recording and editing into a seamless, one-click task. To create high-quality videos with realistic AI avatars and voiceovers, Synthesia is a suitable option. Pictory and Lumen5 are solid text-to-video AI video makers. For those seeking a tool that lets you add a personal touch to your content, Loom stands out from the rest. The AI screen recorder captures your webcam, your screen, or both simultaneously, making it perfect for adding cues, gestures, and a level of engagement that feels personalized and authentic. When you’re finished recording, Loom’s AI-powered features handle the editing, adding speech-to-text captions and transcriptions, removing filler words and pauses, and adding other enhancements to make your video polished and ready to share. Forget long-winded meetings or static presentations—unleash the power of AI in your video production with Loom.
