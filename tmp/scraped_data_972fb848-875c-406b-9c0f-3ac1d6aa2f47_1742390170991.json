Instagram’s algorithm for Reels changes every four weeks. Just when you think you’ve cracked the code, it switches things up again. ? With the high costs of hiring professional video editors and booking studios, you might find it challenging to produce enough high-quality videos to meet your needs. Want to know my strategy to create stunning videos in a short time? Using an AI video generator. ? An AI video generator and video editor can create anything from byte-sized clips to feature-length videos in seconds. These AI-generated videos don’t just look good—they take considerably less time to produce. In this article, I’ll share the best AI video tools I’ve personally used and loved. We’ll discuss their best features, limitations, pricing, and online reviews. What Should You Look for in an AI Video Generator? When choosing the best AI video generator, I always consider a few key features. First, video editing capabilities matter. You want an AI video editor that offers a seamless editing process, such as trimming, adding background music, or incorporating video clips and stock footage. Next, check for customization options. ? Whether you’re making explainer videos, social media videos, or longer YouTube cinematic videos—the best AI video makers should allow you to work with video templates and offer flexibility in creating content in any video format. Advanced features like AI avatars and text-to-video can be game-changers for producing content quickly. ? For example, when creating videos with popular AI video tools like Pictory or Synthesia, I can simply upload a script, select my preferred AI avatar, and generate a professional video in just a few clicks. Lastly, user experience is important. ? For example, with some tools, you can create amazing videos that are ready for publishing—without spending hours editing or worrying about production quality.

HeyGen (Best for creating short AI-driven avatar videos) If you’re a content creator looking to speak multiple languages or expand into new markets, HeyGen can help you create high-quality videos with voiceovers and customizable avatars. Instead of positioning itself as an all-purpose AI video generator, HeyGen’s claim to fame is its video generation capabilities, which produce studio-quality videos in over 175 languages. You can even customize your video avatar with various outfits and themes. The tool also has a fairly intuitive user interface. However, HeyGen has useful but limited native integrations, with most integrations routed via Zapier. This can complicate things for your video creation workflow.

With over 1,300 AI voices and support for 75+ languages, it’s perfect for producing content globally resonant content. I’ve used it to quickly turn a blog post into a slick YouTube video—with no advanced editing needed. Fliki’s voice-cloning feature also adds a personal touch, keeping things consistent across projects. Creating AI videos with the tool is fast, simple, and scalable—perfect for creators, marketers, and educators. While Fliki’s voiceovers can sometimes sound robotic, this is a small tradeoff for the speed and versatility it offers.

With features like drag-and-drop clips and auto-generated subtitles, it’s designed for efficiency. `You can even remove background noise in just a few clicks.

This makes it extremely easy to use for users who have no prior experience with video creation or editing. Plus, the template library offers plenty of ready-to-use options, saving you time in a pinch. DeepBrain AI’s best features DeepBrain AI limitations DeepBrain AI pricing DeepBrain AI ratings and reviews ?Pro Tip: Look for AI video editing tools, including text-to-video features and AI avatars. 8. Elai (Best for scalable AI video creation with custom avatars) Do you need to create personalized video content at scale but without the headache of endless editing? I tested Elai to see if it could tackle this challenge. The custom avatar feature immediately caught my attention. I could create digital presenters that looked professional and spoke multiple languages—perfect for reaching diverse audiences. The text-to-video function was another strong point. I could instantly generate video scripts by simply uploading product descriptions, a huge time saver. However, while the lip-sync accuracy was impressive, I sometimes find the movements of the AI avatars generated to be stiff. With its API integration, you can automate hundreds of personalized videos overnight, which no other platform has managed so smoothly yet. Elai best features Elai limitations Elai pricing Elai ratings and reviews 9. Runway (Best for cinematic AI video generation and editing) What if you could instantly generate futuristic, high-quality video output or add complex effects without traditional VFX software? I tested Runway to see if it delivers. The text-to-video feature stood out to me. I typed in simple prompts, and within minutes, the AI-generated video was delivered and needed only a few minor adjustments. Another highlight was the Motion Brush tool. It allowed me to add flowing animations that typically take hours quickly. The image-to-video tool also worked well. I uploaded a still render and generated a 360-degree rotation that looked incredibly realistic. Its ability to automatically generate background music was a nice touch. Runway best features Runway limitations Runway pricing Runway ratings and reviews 10. Synthesys (Best for scalable AI video creation with lifelike avatars) I tested Synthesys to explore its capabilities as an AI video editor, and it performed quite well overall. The multilingual AI avatars generated were realistic, with smooth expressions and movements, which worked effectively for professional video content. However, avatar customization felt somewhat limited. The text-to-speech feature and the various video templates on the platform were accurate, but the rendering times for longer videos can often be frustratingly slow. The platform’s video templates were useful and saved time, though some options were fairly basic. Synthesys best features Synthesys limitations Synthesys pricing Synthesys ratings and reviews 11. Visla (Best for comprehensive AI-powered video creation) Need an AI platform that lets you handle storyboard, script, B-roll, voice-over, subtitles, and more for different video styles? Visla does that and more. The AI script generation feature is a timesaver, crafting well-structured scripts from basic product briefs. AI avatars were quite lifelike, though I found the selection somewhat limited for more niche industries (imagine not being able to make your AI chef avatar wear the iconic white chef hat). However, the text-to-video tool was efficient, automatically pulling relevant stock footage and adding animations, but the customization options for advanced users felt restricted. Visla also provides solid branding tools, making it simple to keep visuals on-brand with logos and color schemes. The multilingual adaptation and collaboration features were helpful, especially for teams across regions. Visla best features Visla limitations Visla pricing Visla ratings and reviews Also Read: 10 Best AI Screen Recorders in 2024: A Professional’s Guide 12. Hour One (Best for quick-scale AI avatar videos) I tested Hour One’s AI avatar video creation and found it helpful for producing videos quickly, especially for internal communications. The AI avatars were lifelike enough, though not as polished as I expected. The avatars’ voice-to-expression matching was a bit off at times, affecting overall realism. The multilingual capability was highlighted, allowing me to create localized versions with accurate lip-syncing across languages. Overall, Hour One is effective for quick, scalable video creation, but there’s potential for improvements in avatar quality and expression syncing. Hour One best features Hour One limitations Hour One pricing Hour One ratings and reviews 13. Colossyan (Best for handy AI-powered video creation) Reviewing Colossyan was interesting. The platform offers plenty of features for anyone to create AI videos, but there are areas for improvement. Multi-language support is a strong point, with accurate translations and lip-syncing that make content localization easy. However, while the AI avatars looked realistic, a noticeable head wobble made them feel a bit unnatural, and their expressions didn’t always match the tone of their voices. The PowerPoint integration was smooth, quickly converting slides into dynamic videos with animations and voiceovers, which saved time. Interactive elements like quizzes added engagement, but some advanced customization options were lacking.

The realistic AI avatars are incredibly advanced, but the mannerisms and articulation make it obvious that they're, well, AI. Pacing. Much research has been done on how quickly a video moves from scene to scene to hold viewers’ attention, and I found that not all generators factored this into their algorithms. Decision overload. The number of video templates, AI avatars, and effects available can overwhelm the editing process. AI is rapidly advancing, and some of these quirks will soon be passé. How to Make AI Videos The process for making an AI video will vary depending on the tool or platform you're using. Some generators work by analyzing and creating a video based on the script you uploaded, while others will follow a prompt typed in by the user. The key is to find a tool or generator with the features you need to create the kind of content you want. Transforming Text to Video With AI When ChatGPT catapulted to popularity in 2022, I don’t think the average marketers knew just how quickly AI video would follow. It needs to be used ethically to be useful to society, but when leveraged correctly, it’s an incredible tool. The most sought-after AI video feature is the text-to-video generator. This allows you to type in a sentence and, in a few seconds, be presented with an editable AI-generated video. I tested this feature using two different prompts: A vague prompt: “I’d like to educate viewers about AI-generated video.” A specific prompt: “I’d like to inspire beginner marketers to try AI video generation. The video should explain the benefits of AI video generators and should inspire viewers to try this new video tool.” I used HubSpot’s free AI video generator Clip Creator, and here’s what I saw. They were both high-quality videos. Both videos had appropriate stock images and music tailored to human behavior. The content was very similar for both videos. After testing many AI generators, I’ve found that a marketer’s time is better spent editing rather than making their prompt more specific. No matter how perfect your prompt feels, the end result will still require edits.

The best AI video tools all have a mix of these different features. Intuitive User Interface While most platforms list a long list of fancy AI features, users need an easy-to-use AI studio first and foremost. This enables a quick editing process. AI Scripts Automatically-generated video scripts save an incredible amount of time when producing video content. They turn written content (such as a blog post, email, etc.) or a prompt into spoken language. Sometimes, they even use an AI narrator to read it out loud for you. Not all software can generate video scripts, but it’s an enormous time saver. To be fair to the software that doesn’t offer this, it’s replaceable with a few clicks in ChatGPT. After trying more than a dozen AI video generators, I found the AI scripts were one of the features that made the greatest difference, along with the next feature. Factoring in Human Behavior Some software have tailored their AI to match user behavior, and some haven’t. For example, most people prefer videos with a brisk pace and visuals that don’t stay on the screen too long. In the video world, this is referred to as “pacing.” Not all software is tailored for this, and as a result, it will produce slow, lengthy slides that feel like a bad PowerPoint presentation. This isn’t a detail that software companies list on their “features” page, but it’s something that’s apparent based on the first draft of the video that the software gives you. Template Library Start from scratch? What is it, 2018? There’s no need to start from scratch with video anymore, as most platforms have built-in template libraries. Bonus points if these libraries include variation in: Intended audience. Aspect ratio. Project type. Editing Capabilities It’s normal for different software to offer different editing options, but most AI studios will cover the basics, such as: Text. Fonts. Music. Colors. Timing. Transitions. Animations. Stock footage. Different video styles. Pricing Tiers (or Free Plan) An AI video generator costs $0 to $50 a month (paid annually). All paid software includes a discount when purchasing an annual package, and the cost of month-to-month service is always higher. I know you’re on a budget — all of the suggested AI tools below are either free or include a free trial/demo. Multilingual Look for software that supports multiple languages if your business requires it. A chart comparing 11 AI Video Generators Chart comparing AI video generators Best AI Video Generators AI video generators have come extremely far in a short time. You can now make professional videos with the numerous text-to-video generation tools on the market. I’ve tried all the most popular AI video generators, so you don’t have to. Here’s what I found. 1. Clip Creator Source Clip Creator is the best AI video generator for beginners. It can be used by someone with no video experience and walks you through the video creation process painlessly. You start by answering a few basic questions (like video type), then provide a brief overview of the video you’d like to create. You can choose from video templates, which are oriented for both landscape videos and vertical videos. Then, Clip Creator uses AI to generate the text on your slides, plus the background imagery. You’re instantly given a video with editable text, stock images, background music, etc. The video creation workflow is very intuitive. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video My experience: I love how streamlined this AI video creator is. Instead of bombarding you with endless features, options, and pop-ups, Clip Creator starts simple and allows you to make any edits you need after it generates the video. Source Pros: Incredibly intuitive user interface, great customization options, and makes for a very fast and efficient AI video creator. Cons: Smaller template library than paid AI video generators, and no advanced features like realistic AI avatars. Best for: Video creation beginners and marketers on a budget. Most user-friendly interface and best free AI video generator. 2. Pictory Source Pictory is an excellent AI video generator for creators and marketers who don’t have experience creating videos. All you have to do is provide a script or article to guide your video content. For example, you can submit a blog post to the AI video creator, and Pictory will create a video based on the post that can be used for social media or your website. Furthermore, you can edit videos in minutes by using text. Pictory also includes a feature that creates shareable video highlight reels that can be used as a trailer or a short-form video for social media such as a Reel. Even better, Pictory can automatically caption and summarize your videos.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: I provided the same prompt for Pictory as I did for the Clip Creator video, and it initially generated much less content (only 1 slide). I went back and instead provided a URL of a blog post and tested the blog-to-video generator. This feature automatically creates video scripts based on a blog post, and using their realistic AI voices, I could have it automatically narrated too. The writing on every slide needed to be edited significantly to be useful, but I was impressed with the options. Pictory supports multiple languages (currently English, Spanish, French, and German) and has a huge library of AI voices. Source Prices for Pictory start at $19 per month, and users can try a 2-week free trial. Pros: Users have a lot of options for how to begin their AI-generated videos, and they can thoroughly customize the video output. Cons: The first draft of the automatically-generated videos needs heavy editing. It may be faster to let ChatGPT write a script for you and use that. Best for: Marketers and creators with limited video editing experience who want to convert content like blog posts or webinars into shareable video content. 3. Simplified Source The Simplified AI video generator transforms a long-form video into multiple AI-enhanced clips with just one click. This allows users to create videos from text and make an entirely new video using its accessible editing interface. Simplified simplifies the way we produce content by providing users with easy access to an expansive in-app library that hosts thousands of templates, all available for free. I like that it guarantees exceptional video quality and pairs this with an intuitive, user-friendly interface, ensuring that users can craft high-quality videos without sacrificing ease of use. Its comprehensive suite of features goes beyond basic editing options to include animation enhancements and multilingual translation capabilities, making it a versatile all-in-one tool for video creation. Users can save their brand settings in Simplified’s “brand book” is a great time-saving feature. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just starting, this platform equips you with everything you need to bring your vision to life. Brands like Bloomberg, DuckDuckGo, and Cashify use Simplified for their marketing needs. My experience: I prompted Simplified the same way I prompted the other video generators, and I was immediately asked to describe my target audience and provide my video topic. This was a nice step toward more personalized videos, but it required more user-generated input than Clip Creator, which had a multiple-choice intake process. If you stick to the free plan, it’s time-consuming to sift through all the features to see what’s free to use. Source Prices for Simplified include a forever-free plan. Paid plans start from $15.20 a month and are billed annually. Pros: If you pay for this AI video creator, you have many creation options at your disposal that not all other platforms offer (AI meme creation, AI image generation, AI carousel maker, etc.). Cons: Not the best free AI video generator; other platforms are more generous with their features. You’re not able to test the text-to-video generator without joining a paid plan, as you’re about to do with other features. Best for: Creators who want to create, edit, and schedule videos for all social media platforms. 4. Movavi Video Editor Source Rather than generating AI videos from scratch, the Movavi Video Editor uses AI to make video editing easier. Video editing can be a time-consuming chore; for many, it’s the less enjoyable side of content creation. However, with Movavi Video Editor’s nonlinear AI technique, you’re not just replicating traditional tool functions but also enhancing your videos through advanced AI video editing. With AI background removal, you can cut out and replace backgrounds, adding a new dimension to your visuals. Plus, the AI noise removal feature enhances audio quality by automatically eliminating unwanted sounds, ensuring your videos are of the highest standard. Source The app also offers a host of advanced options like PiP, chroma-key, titles, keyframing, motion tracking, and more. Following the free 7-day trial, paid plans start at $49.95 per year. Pros: The presence of built-in training rapidly familiarizes you with the software, and it has features that many other AI video editors don’t. Cons: This AI video editor brings high-level tools (like color correction) to marketers, but total video newbies may be overwhelmed with some of the more advanced features. Best for: Creators and marketers who already have video footage and want help editing videos to be more engaging (or who just need to speed up the editing process). 5. Fotor AI Video Generator Source Fotor is an image and video editing platform that integrates various AI features, known for its creativity, intelligence, flexibility, and convenience. Its AI video generator fully utilizes advancements in AI technology, making video creation more efficient and enjoyable. Video creation is often a complex and professional process, but Fotor simplifies the steps. You just need to describe your creative ideas in text form and choose your desired style.

Inspiration is important for video creators. Fotor AI video generator provides preset prompts and images, helping creators find more inspiration for their videos. My experience: Fotor’s interface is very user-friendly and simple. you can quickly find the features you need without any distracting ads or clutter. It also provides detailed step-by-step instructions, making it easy for new creators to get started. While creating videos, its preset text descriptions and high-quality images inspired me creatively. They also saved me time and greatly boosted my production efficiency. Source What I found most convenient was that after generating a video, I could perform basic edits directly in Fotor and I could also use their rich AI video tools, like one-click enhancement and beautification, background removal, and object elimination. Pros: The AI video generator supports creating videos in various styles, including Photography, Cinematic, Digital Art, Anime, Neopunk, Game Art, Illustration Art, and more. Catering to various creative ideas and needs. Cons: AI may not always fully understand textual descriptions or emotions and feelings, so some videos may not appear as realistic. Best for: Professional video creators, video creation beginners, social media video influencers, and users who enjoy trying and testing trendy and interesting features. 6. AI Studio Source With AI Studio, users can create videos by uploading their script and using the text-to-speech feature. The platform will then generate a video in five minutes or less. You can manually type in the script or copy and paste it into the platform. From there, you just need to select the appropriate language and AI model and finish editing. AI Studio allows users to select a custom-made avatar that suits their brand.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: New users can input a 300-character script, and an AI avatar will read your script using the AI text-to-video generator. I found the AI models to be less convincing than others; the mouths sometimes moved between sentences, and I think all viewers could identify these as AI. However, since the advent of TikTok’s text-to-speech narration feature, the public has become more accustomed to artificial narration, and there are many situations where this type of AI would work well. Source Prices for AI Studio start at $30 per month. Pros: The platform’s intuitive features make it excellent for beginners with limited or no video creation experience. Cons: The AI Studio avatars are identifiable as being artificial. Best for: Marketing videos that need text-to-speech narration and have visuals for B-roll. 7. Veed.io Source With Veed.io, you can use custom text, colors, font, and music to create a unique video for your brand. One of its standout features is Auto Transcribe. You can upload your video, hit the Auto Transcribe button, and immediately download the script. Even better, there is no software to download, and the platform is easy to use for those without video editing experience. My experience: I entered my “Pinterest marketing for beginners” prompt, and Veed.io quickly generated a short vertical video. The AI video generator automatically provided the script, AI narration, background music, stock videos, and close captioning. The on-screen captions were really engaging, using color-changing text and emojis — perfect for social media. Source Veed.io is free to use for videos under 10 minutes. To access more features, prices start at $18 per month (when billed annually) and go all the way up to enterprise custom pricing. Pros: The pacing, on-screen captions, slang, and approach were very engaging. Cons: The stock video that was automatically inserted into the video was off-topic at times but can be easily edited. Best for: Short-form videos designed to hold attention on social media. 8. Synthesia Source Synthesia's AI video generator enables users to create professional videos without requiring cameras, actors, or studios. Users can generate videos featuring realistic AI avatars that deliver content in over 140 languages by simply inputting text. This makes it an ideal tool for efficiently and at scale creating training materials, sales and marketing content, and internal communications.

This AI video maker is specialized in corporate learning. Once the video is complete, review it to make any changes before rendering and downloading it. My experience: I found that Elai's format is unique. Even though the AI avatar doesn’t pass as a real human, its small display size makes it feel less distracting. The avatar compliments these videos instead of dominating them. I also really like the audio options: you can upload an audio file of you speaking, and Elai will generate a realistic AI avatar to narrate the text. Source Elai has over 60 languages and 25 avatars to choose from. You can use Elai for free with a 1-minute credit. For more features, Elai’s plans start at $23 per month (billed annually). Pros: As a specialized AI video generator, this tool allows you to quickly create training videos for new hires or product onboarding videos.

And its intuitive interface makes it simple for creators at any skill level. My experience: I created my video by inputting a URL and letting FlexClip automatically pull content from my website.

The pacing of the video was slower than other AI tools, but I was able to easily customize all elements of the video. Source After the free plan, pricing starts at $9.99 per month (when billed annually, which saves 50%). Pros: The basic plan's price point makes this a very budget-friendly AI video generator.

The platform also provides a variety of video formats for Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and website-based applications. Other key features are: Text-to-video AI. Video hosting. Voiceovers. Text-to-speech. Millions of stock assets. My experience: I tested Wave Video by inserting a blog post URL and letting the AI video generator populate text and graphics based on the content.

In fact, AI video generators are now so capable that major brands are switching from old video production methods to these modern AI-powered ones.

I made this anime trailer, and I think it’s pretty cool. The pictures, animation, and even the song were all generated by AI. Let me break down the process and tell you how it was done 👇 pic.twitter.com/Y117zidiei — Framer 🇱🇹 (@0xFramer) August 22, 2024 But with so many options flooding the market, it can be tough to figure out which tool is the right fit for you. Each promises to be the best, but how do you know which will deliver on that promise and actually be the best AI video generator? We made this guide to help you navigate the crowded field and find the tool that suits your needs. We've carefully selected and reviewed seven top contenders, focusing on what they offer, where they excel, and where they might fall short. So, if you've ever wondered, \"What is the best AI video generator?\" you're in the right place. What is an AI video generator? In the simplest of terms, an AI video generator is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to automate the video creation process. Instead of manually editing clips, adding effects, and syncing audio, these tools handle the heavy lifting for you. You just input text, images, or other media, and AI turns that into a complete video through text to video generation. By using AI, these tools automatically select the best visuals, create smooth transitions, and even generate voiceovers with realistic AI avatars. This means you can focus more on crafting your message and less on getting bogged down in the technical details. How do AI video generators work? AI video generators work by using advanced algorithms to analyze and process your input, whether it’s text, images, or other media. When you provide the content, the AI interprets it and makes decisions about how to structure the video. This includes selecting visuals, syncing audio, and applying effects—all in a matter of minutes. ✨ From Photo AI image to video with @LumaLabsAI's video model that came out today called Dream Machine It's absolutely state of the art and the best video model available right now I think It's able to highly accurately predict 3d surroundings from just a photo, I think up… pic.twitter.com/KDetDBdGIS — @levelsio (@levelsio) June 13, 2024 At the core of these tools is machine learning, which allows the AI to improve over time. The more data it processes, the better it becomes at making creative decisions that result in high-quality videos. For example, if you input a script, the AI video tool can generate corresponding scenes, choose relevant images or video clips, and even create a voiceover. The process is surprisingly intuitive. You simply provide the material, and the AI organizes it into a cohesive video that aligns with your vision. How we chose the best AI video generators To ensure you pick the best AI video generators and generative AI editing tools, we chose products that truly deliver on their promises of creating amazing videos. No matter how skilled you are at video editing, you need an AI tool that simplifies the process. Next, we evaluated the range of features. A great AI video maker should offer more than just basic editing—it should allow you to customize and tweak your video clips until they look like they were made by a professional film crew. We also compared the pricing plans, ensuring that they offer a solid mix of features without breaking the bank. Our goal was to find tools that help you save time and money. ‍ 1. AI Studios by Deepbrain AI DeepBrain AI’s video generator is a robust all-in-one tool that brings realistic AI avatars, natural text-to-speech, and intuitive video creation into one seamless platform. Whether you’re making educational videos, marketing content, or AI-powered presentations, it streamlines the entire process with easy-to-use tools and customizable features.

Whether you're experimenting with the free plan or scaling up with Team and Enterprise options, the flexibility here ensures there’s something for everyone. Where AI Studios could improve We love the power and usability of this tool, but since they are relatively new to the space, they could benefit from more brand recognition. Once more people are familiar with this tool and how it can help with creative workflow, we are confident it will be a go-to product for designers and creatives of all stripes. Pricing options: Free plan ($0.00) Personal ($24.00/month) Team ($55.00/month) Enterprise (Custom) 2. Luma Dream Machine Dream Machine by Luma Labs is a video creation tool that uses AI to generate extremely lifelike videos. You can quickly turn your images or text prompts into professional-looking clips. The process of creating a video takes just a couple of minutes. Each video is about five seconds long and can include multiple shots, making them richer and more detailed than many competitors’ outputs. During my tests, some videos were ready quickly, while others took longer, but all captured motion better than any other tool I’ve tried. Whether you're crafting an epic scene or a visually intense moment, Dream Machine captures the essence of storytelling with visuals that feel straight out of Hollywood. Created product mockup videos with Luma Dream Machine V1.5 text-to-video model, and I’m really happy with the results. You can find the prompts in the thread, and you can use the same ones with Midjourney or Flux.#LumaDreamMachine pic.twitter.com/VISWZK8TEp — Gizem Akdag (@gizakdag) August 21, 2024 Why we like Dream Machine: Most cinematic If you're a creator with a flair for the cinematic, you're going to love making videos with Dream Machine. What really stands out is that you don't need precise details for motion areas, Dream Machine still manages to capture motion concepts effectively. Itfollows the laws of physics, ensuring that every shot feels grounded and realistic. Plus, it’s super fast! As their website mentions, Dream Machine can currently produce 120 frames in 120 seconds, which is not too shabby to say the least. Where Dream Machine could improve Although Dream Machine is generally fast, some users have experienced slower processing times when working on intricate projects with a lot of elements. The discard rate can be around 98% with Reddit users pointing that most of the videos generated are unusable because of random elements, incorrect motion, or distortion. Pricing options: Free Plan ($0.00) Lite Plan ($7.99/month) Standard Plan ($23.99/month) Plus Plan ($51.99/month) Pro Plan ($79.99/month) 3.

Add expressiveness and intention to your generations with Multi Motion Brush. Learn how with today's Runway Academy: https://t.co/EUbxc4aA0D pic.twitter.com/qredD7vsXu — Runway (@runwayml) January 23, 2024 Why we like Runway: Most dynamic Runway's Gen-3 Alpha is one of the most impressive AI video generators we’ve come across. Not only is it a powerful tool for video that makes content creation seem limitless, but it has a shockingly friendly interface and is easy to use. With the Multi Motion Brush, you can select up to five areas with independent motion and control across 3 directional axis (x, y, z) for more precise and expressive generations. Another highlight is how well it handles human-like characters. The AI generates lifelike figures with natural expressions and gestures, adding a level of realism that’s hard to beat. We aren't exaggerating when we say you'll likely be blown away by what you generate with this tool. The videos are truly cinematic and offer an exciting glimpse into the future of creativity. Where Runway could improve Runway is an extraordinary tool, so it is hard to say where it can improve. Of course, with such a dynamic AI video generator comes cost, which might be the only thing holding back casual users or if you're on a budget. Plus, it is true that sometimes the final results might look a little \"wonky,\" but overall the quality is top-tier. Pricing options: Basic Plan ($0 per editor per month) Standard Plan ($12 per user per month, billed annually as $144) Pro Plan ($28 per user per month, billed annually as $336) Unlimited Plan ($76 per user per month, billed annually as $912) Enterprise Plan (Customized with Runway team) 4. Hailuo AI Hailuo AI is an AI-powered video generator designed to make content creation simple but still extraordinary. Whether you’re making cinematic videos for marketing, detailedproduct explainers, or social media ads, this tool automates the heavy lifting—giving you professional-looking results in minutes. Instead of spending hours fine-tuning every frame, creators can focus on storytelling while the AI ensures smooth motion, clean edits, and stunning visuals. #Hailuo AI is absolutely insane for creating Hollywood-style blockbuster scenes! 🎬🔥 Every test is a thrill pic.twitter.com/idaAJWb2BZ — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) March 6, 2025 Why we like Hailuo AI: Fast yet eye-popping For businesses and content creators who need speed, flexibility, and truly remarkable videos, Hailuo AI delivers. One of the standout features is its customizable templates, which allow users to tweak layouts, colors, and visual styles without advanced editing skills. So regardless of what kind of content you ar making, whether it's onboarding video or a marketing campaign, Hailuo AI makes sure your content looks tailored, not cookie-cutter. Where Hailuo AI Could Improve While the AI does a great job with automation, some users may find the customization options a bit limited. For example, while templates are helpful, they don’t always allow for fine-grained control over pacing and scene composition. Additionally, industries needing highly specific branding—like film production or high-end advertising—might need more flexibility in motion effects and camera angles. Pricing options: Standard plan ($14.90 per month) Unlimited plan ($94.90 per month) 5. Kling AI The Kling AI video generator produces highly realistic 1080p videos up to two minutes long, all from a single prompt. The key difference?

Have an Amazing Day!☀️🙂☕️ Name: Flower Care Made with @Kling_ai 1.6 Text to Video#AIart Good Monday #MondayMotivation #Mondayvibes pic.twitter.com/MEvNj9HVrw — Jay Kay (@JayKay65220066) March 10, 2025 Why we like Kling AI: Smooth, natural motion What sets Kling apart is how well it captures human motion and expression. Thanks to its 3D face and body reconstruction technology, characters move fluidly and show natural emotions—all from a single image. Its physics engine also shines, allowing for believable object interactions and environments that behave like real-world scenes. Whether you're creating short films, virtual influencers, or AI-generated marketing content, Kling delivers a level of realism that’s hard to match. Where Kling AI could improve While Kling is impressive, it’s not perfect. Some users report slow processing times, especially for highly detailed scenes. Occasionally, minor inconsistencies appear, like hand distortions or subtle motion glitches. More control over camera angles and fine-tuning details would make it even stronger for professional creators. Pricing options: Basic (free) Standard ($72.90 yearly) Pro ($293.04 yearly) Premier ($728.64 yearly) 6. revid AI This tool might be new on the scene, but for improving video productivity for socials, revid is quickly becoming one of our favorites. Their mission is all about helping creators like you make short videos that have a potential to go viral. Why we like revid AI: Best for social media What we like most about revid AI is that it has a specific focus. The AI does the heavy lifting from finding ideas, adding sound effects, creating scripts, and then transforming everything into viral videos for your social media content. It’s a company that knows its lane, and we can certainly appreciate its dedication to being the master of one instead of the jack of all AI video trades. Where revid AI could improve The main drawback with revid AI is that it is niche. This is fine if you need this specific type of content, but it may be lacking if you're searching for a more powerful tool. Pricing options Hobby ($49/month) Growth (Launch offer $49/month) Ultra ($199/month) 7.

While it is definitely on the more corporate side of video creation, we saw this tool streamline the creation process and make it easy to produce high-quality generated videos super fast and efficiently. Plus, Colossyan’s extensive library of AI avatars and multilingual support make it a nice choice for large companies and diverse clients. Where Colossyan could improve While Colossyan has a ton of cool features, it may require a bit of a learning curve for those new to AI video tools. The sheer number of options, from AI avatars to multiple export formats, can be overwhelming for beginners. Pricing options Starter Plan ($19/month, annually) Pro Plan ($61/month, billed annually) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 8. HeyGen HeyGen is one of the more impressive platforms we tested. A big reason for this is because it is hassle-free and easy to use, so jumping in was a simple process. More specifically, HeyGen is one of the best when it comes to generating AI avatars. The process of creating a HeyGen avatar boils down to three steps: choosing or creating an avatar, recording or choosing a voice to go with it, selecting a video template, then letting HeyGen put it all together in a matter of minutes. Why we like HeyGen: Most intriguing video generator One of the coolest features of HeyGen is its AI avatars, which are constantly evolving. The platform frequently updates these avatars to include enhanced visual details, expanded speech abilities, and more lifelike animations. Another great feature is the change videos to multiple langauges. HeyGen allows you to create videos in over forty languages from your original video, letting you reach audiences from all parts of the world. Where HeyGen could improve While HeyGen offers a lot of flexibility, the pricing for the Team plan might be higher for smaller teams or individual creators. Additionally, the Free plan, although great for beginners, limits users to just 3 videos per month, which may not be enough for those who need to produce content regularly. Pricing options Free Plan ($0) Creator Plan ($24/mo) Team Plan ($69/seat/mo) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 9. Haiper AI After diving into Haiper AI, we quickly realized it’s a promising tool for anyone looking to explore the world of AI-driven video creation.

With just 3 images, @escelce transported us through 3 different universes, holy cow! #KeyframeConditioning #AIvideo #MadeWithHaiper https://t.co/6FwlLObhIK pic.twitter.com/JZdJOq3QMb — Haiper AI (@HaiperGenAI) August 19, 2024 Why we like Haiper AI: Best for beginners What we appreciated most about Haiper AI is its flexibility and how user friendly it was. The platform allows for up to 10 creations per day on the Free plan, which is generous for a no-cost option. That, on top of the text-to-speech feature helps make Haiper a solid tool. For those who need more, the Explorer and Pro plans offer expanded features that cater to different levels of use. Where Haiper AI could improve One of the primary limitations is that the Free plan doesn’t allow for commercial use or watermark-free videos. This might be a dealbreaker for users who need to produce content for business purposes but aren’t ready to invest in a paid plan. Pricing options Free Plan (Beta, $0/month): Explorer Plan (Beta, $8/month, billed yearly) Pro Plan (Beta, $24/month, billed yearly) Enterprise APIs (Custom Pricing) ‍ 10.

Text-to-Video Content Generation Many users do not have coding experience or the time to learn the finer details of video software. That’s why many AI video generation tools include text-to-video content generation capabilities, allowing users to easily turn their scripts or other written text into video content that may include human-looking AI avatars, AI voices, and other elements that create a professional-looking and sounding video. Vocal and Audio Synthesis With an AI video tool, AI speech and audio synthesis make it so any number of videos can be made without a human actor or voice. These platforms take text or rough-spoken recordings and transform them into video-ready voices that are synthetically generated. These voices should be available in a variety of languages and, in most cases, users are able to adjust the tone, pitch, accent, and other elements of speech to make the voice sound more believable. Video Templates A number of AI tools now give users a baseline video template from which to build their video content. These templates may focus on specific industry use cases, a certain social media or digital platform, or a video format with animation or transitional elements. Users can often customize these templates and add their own branding, but the video template gives them the creative ideas and basic design to get started. AI Avatars Many businesses do not have the budgets to pay actors or employees to act as talking heads for brand videos, but they nonetheless want the personal touch of an onscreen personality. AI avatars can be developed to match different appearances, genders, and other expectations, with personalities, tones, accents, and other unique features added to synthetic voices. The best AI avatar solutions create natural-looking avatars and give users the ability to custom-create their own avatars. These avatars can be used for personalized sales and marketing videos, e-learning and training videos, and other forms of media that benefit from a friendly face. Low-Code/No-Code Usability and Video Editing Regardless of how much work AI features can do to put together the final product, users typically want some hands-on control over the video creation and editing process. To make this as simple as possible, most AI video generation tools provide a low-code/no-code user interface, giving customers the ability to adjust slides, audio and visual elements, and other pieces of their video with a drag-and-drop editing tool. How I Evaluated AI Video Generator Tools In comparing and contrasting AI video generator solutions, I scored each option against six key criteria for teams and businesses needing robust yet cost-effective features. From there, I divided each category into weighted subcriteria and assigned an overall score out of five to determine the winner for each category. Evaluation Criteria In scoring the AI video generator solutions, I placed the most emphasis on core features and enterprise features, as top software options should provide standard and advanced capabilities. I also evaluated each platform’s pricing, customization, ease of use, and customer support. Core Features (25 percent): The best AI video generation tools give users the standard capabilities and features necessary to create compelling marketing, sales, training, and customer service videos. Criteria Winner: Invideo Enterprise Features (20 percent): Although many other AI video generation tools exist for casual mobile users and use cases, I mostly steered away from those tools in favor of platforms that offer enterprise features such as multi-language support, automated scene selection, and feedback and optimization. Criteria Winner: Synthesia Pricing (20 percent): When considering the cost of video generation tools, I looked for both affordability and a range of subscription options. In terms of affordability, I sought out tools that offered free versions and/or useful demos and trial periods. Criteria Winner: Lumen5, VEED Customization (15 percent): Flexible platforms allow you to create hyper-targeted videos for specific audiences. I assessed if each tool offers a wide range of customizable avatars, fonts, transitions, voices, and templates. Criteria Winner: Invideo, Lumen5 Ease of Use (10 percent): A platform’s usability impacts user adoption and overall efficiency. Here, I evaluated each tool’s ratings across certified sites, its user interface, active user community, and knowledge base. Criteria Winner: Synthesia User Support (10 percent): For this category, I looked into support channels for each AI video generator via live chat and email and also looked into real user ratings from reputable sites. Criteria Winner: Synthesia Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Find answers to some of the most common questions about AI video generators below: *How Do I Choose the Best AI Video Platform for My Business?*Choosing the right AI video software for your business can feel like an overwhelming process, especially in a market that is increasingly saturated with viable solutions. The best way forward is to consider which features are most important to you, who will be using this software, and what your budget looks like for these requirements. Pay close attention to user reviews on each tool you’re considering, particularly noticing any comments on ease of use or team-based capabilities. For the best possible outcome, reach out to your top vendors to request a product demo and, if possible, see if they can cater that demo to your organization’s specific wants and needs. Going through this preselection process will typically save you time and money in the long run, as you’re less likely to make multiple switches mid-subscription. *What Is an AI-Generated Video?*An AI-generated video is a piece of video content with audio, voices, images, footage, graphics, and other elements that are created with AI rather than by human manipulation. The main use cases for AI-generated video include text-to-video generation and AI-driven video editing. *Can I Use ChatGPT to Make Videos?*No, you cannot directly use ChatGPT to make videos. However, you can generate video scripts and images that can be used in AI videos. Some AI video tools are also integrated with ChatGPT to make text and script generation run more smoothly. Bottom Line: AI Video Generators AI video generators simplify digital marketing and communication, helping users complete many of the most complicated video tasks, ranging from editing footage and audio to creating shorter clips and summaries from long-form content. This type of tool enables greater scalability and a simpler approach to multichannel content creation. Before deciding which tool you should use for your business, consider our list or look into what AI companies can offer to help you narrow down your choices. Sign up for demos or trials to gain hands-on experience or seek expert advice to find the best option for accessible video creation and better customer engagement results.

Hour one The 4 best AI video generators Final thoughts Last updated on 6th June 2024 AI tools are popping up everywhere these days. In fact, according to our AI in Marketing Statistics 2024, 80% of marketers have used – or currently use – AI tools to help them create marketing content. But, of course, not every AI tool is worth your time. We tested 13 AI video generators – looking at things like quality, load time, cost, and more – to really separate the best from the rest. Sure, all of these AI tools have their own impressive marketing videos. But we dug beyond that, really testing out the features for ourselves, in order to find out what the final product really looks like. So, if you’re looking to explore AI video generation in 2024, read on to find out which is the best platform to invest your time and money into. Why use AI video generators anyway? The best AI video generators are going to help you save time and money while increasing your video content output. Note that we said ‘increasing’ – an AI video generator should not be your sole way of making video content. The technology just simply isn’t good enough yet. And consumers are EXPERTS on video content these days. They sure watch enough of it! Statistic People on average watch 17 hours of online video content per week. Source: Wyzowl Video Marketing Statistics 2023 Viewers will 100% know the difference between AI generated videos and videos created by experts. It’s hard enough getting people to watch a professionally made video all the way through so don’t waste your time trying to get people to watch a bunch of AI content. Our Insight By all means use AI video generators to convert your blog articles into videos or for fun short-lived social content, but NOT to create the explainer video that introduces your brand to the world. The 13 AI video generators we tested 1. Pictory Pictory is an AI tool that makes it easy for you to turn other forms of content into highly shareable videos. Pictory has a lot of useful guides that really do make it easy to get started with AI video. And the platform holds your hand while you’re making your first video – but not in a way that’s annoying or overbearing. The finished video project was…okay. But the reliance on stock footage and simple transitions means that videos made on Pictory won’t really stand out among the crowd. Plus, the closing watermark is unnecessarily long. Pros: – Easy to use – It’s fast – The voiceovers sound real Cons: – A lot of the video assets are for paying users only, which makes it difficult to get a true experience on the free trial Pictory Pricing Starter – $23/month Professional – $47/month Teams – $119/month Our rating 2. Synthesys Synthesys is a platform for creating AI content at scale. Using only text, you can create voiceovers, videos, and AI generated images. There’s a large array of templates that make it really easy to get started. However, this could also make it harder to differentiate your videos from ones that other users have created. For the purposes of this article, we created a vertical video that would be perfect for social media. The platform is easy enough to use but does feel slow and kind of clunky in places. Unfortunately, the AI voiceover got the platform’s own brand name incorrect. Pros: – Easy to use – Nice templates – There’s a free plan Cons: – It’s slow and kind of clunky Synthesys Pricing Free Creator – $59/month Business – $99/month Our rating 3. Synthesia Synthesia is a text to video AI platform. You just enter your script and select from over 160 diverse avatars. You can also pick a realistic voiceover (in one of 130+ languages) and even add cool little micro details like gestures, pauses and diction. You can personalise the video background, add media, use your own brands and fonts, plus add music and transitions. All in all, you can end up with a really slick looking video here in a very short amount of time. Pros: – Micro gestures elevate the quality – It’s fast – Huge selection Cons: – The lip syncing could be better Synthesia Pricing Free Starter – £23/month Creator – £69/month Enterprise – Enquiries only Our rating 4. Deepbrain Deepbrain is another AI video generator that specialises in text to video and realistic-looking avatars. You just enter your script, select an avatar, add any finishing touches, et voila – you have a video! There’s a lot of choice when it comes to the avatars and voices, plus you can convert text to speech in over 80 different languages right within their script editor. The script editor is also integrated with ChatGPT so you can even use it to generate ideas for your videos. Overall, the tool is quick, easy to use, and quite intuitive when creating your video. However, processing time can be slow and we were honestly disappointed with the end result after testing others on the list: Pros: – Integrated with ChatGPT – Large selection of languages, voices, and avatars – Easy to use Cons: – The resulting video looked quite unnatural Deepbrain Pricing Starter – $30/month Pro – $225/month Enterprise – Enquiries only Our rating 5. Invideo Invideo is an online video editor that allows users to create videos with text prompts. The platform uses AI to generate visuals and a voiceover to match your script. Alternatively, if you don’t have a script then the AI can help you create one from a single prompt. However, we asked for a 10 second script and were given a 35 second one so it’s necessary to edit your script to fit your specific requirements. We found this AI video generator difficult to use, to be honest. The templates are very specific to certain industries and topics, and even if you do start from scratch you have to let Invideo present you with visuals first before you can start tweaking and changing them. Plus, the suggestions given were pretty random. Take this scene with the racecar, for example. The audio paired with this also sounded like a babbling brook – interesting choice! You might be asking why we aren’t sharing a video for this one and that’s because you can’t export your files without upgrading to a paid plan. You can share via a link, but the link expires quickly. We definitely weren’t wow-ed by this one. Pros: – AI helps give you a head start – There’s the option to make vertical videos Cons: – No free plan – Feels clunky and hard to use Invideo Pricing Business – $30/month Unlimited – $60/month Our rating 6. HeyGen HeyGen is an AI video generator that makes it easy and fun to produce studio-quality videos with AI-generated avatars and voices. This platform is so slick and intuitive. It’s a joy to use, you can go for landscape or portrait videos, and you can even use the CEO as an avatar for your video – which is what we did! You can get started from scratch or use a template. The video editor is user-friendly and the only gripe we had was that it wasn’t obvious how to find stock assets. However, once we found those (under Elements > Video/Image > See all) we didn’t have any complaints. There’s no option to preview the lip sync functionality (although that seems standard for the industry) before you’ve rendered your video. But when you do – wow. We think HeyGen might have the best AI lip syncing out of every platform on the list. The avatar looks super natural while not giving off that ‘uncanny valley’ feeling that some others do. Pros: – You can play around for free – Impressive avatars and AI voices – Super intuitive Cons: – It’s one of the more expensive platforms on the list HeyGen Pricing Free Creator – $59/month Business – $179/month Enterprise – Enquiries only Our rating 7. Veed Veed is a popular online video editing tool with tons of amazing features, but for the purposes of this article we’re going to focus solely on their AI offering. As you’d expect from Veed, the AI video generator is intuitive and easy to use. You can create basic videos pretty quickly either using your own voice and stock footage or with an AI avatar. The AI voiceovers are realistic and so are the avatars, with the lip syncing standing out as particularly impressive. Pros: – You can get started for free – Super easy to use – Transcription and subtitles are completely auto-generated Cons: – Limited customisation options Veed Pricing Free Basic – £10/month Pro – £18/month Business – £49/month Our rating 8. Fliki Fliki is an AI video generator that can create complete videos from just simple ideas. All you need to do is enter some text that describes what you’d like your video to be about, select the length and aspect ratio, and you’re good to go. Of course, as with any AI video generator, you’ll want to personalise your video a little. But the fact that Fliki gives you the bare bones to get started with can be a real time saver. The software itself can create professional-looking videos that have awesome subtitles and AI-generated voiceovers. However, when you’re looking to add your own personal touch to the video you may struggle on the limited free plan. Pros: – So quick and intuitive – Realistic voiceovers – Great automatic subtitling Cons: – You need a paid account to benefit from a more extensive stock footage library and AI avatars Fliki Pricing Free Standard – $21/month Premium – $66/month Our rating 9. Colossyan Colossyan is an AI video platform aimed at companies that want to create workplace learning and training videos. There are lots of templates to choose from or you can create your video from scratch. The editor is simple and easy to use, giving users the option to select different avatars, add background elements, text, music, and more. Like other AI platforms, you can’t see what the lip sync of the AI avatar is going to look like until the video is rendered. Speaking of rendering, we found Colossyan somewhat slower than other tools in this area. Pros: – User-friendly platform – AI avatars look great and natural – Generous stock assets library Cons: – Slow to render and it’s unfortunate that the pronunciation of AI is incorrect in the video we made – No free version Colossyan Pricing Starter – $27/month Pro – $87/month Enterprise – Enquiries only Our rating 10. Elai Elai is everything you could want in an AI video generator, and then some. The site is clean and easy to use. You can create your video from a template, from an AI storyboard, or using an AI avatar. We decided to start with the AI storyboard because we hadn’t seen that offered on other platforms. All you need to do to get started is enter a topic: Elai then generates a video outline that you can adjust as needed. Once you have your storyboard, you can of course make further edits. You can make wholesale changes or use AI to make quick and easy adjustments, like ‘make it shorter’ and ‘sound happier’. When you’re happy with your video, you can render the finished product in 4K. Overall, we found Elai to be a really intuitive and impressive AI video generator. Pros: – Easy to use – Quick and intuitive – Impressive range of features Cons: – The free package does have limitations Elai Pricing Free Basic – $23/month Advanced – $100/month Enterprise – Enquiries only Our rating 11. Runway Runway is kind of different to the other video generators on this list. To create a video you need to upload an image and then add a text prompt, like so: Now, you’re probably thinking: ‘Hmm, it doesn’t sound that different?’ But it’s what comes next that’s different. Other video tools on this list seem to use AI to create fresh ideas using prompts as inspiration, whereas Runway adds animation to the actual image itself, like this: You can use a motion brush to control different areas of the video, but this still gives very limited movement options. You may think the video with the puppies doesn’t look too bad. But we found that using humans makes things a whole lot creepier: The prompt for this one was ‘the writer drinks her coffee’ Now, is it better when just using a text prompt (no images)? …no. Pros: – You can play around for free – It generates new content quickly Cons: – There’s much better technology out there – It’s way too creepy – Very limited customisation Runway Pricing Free Standard – $15/month Pro – $35/month Unlimited – $95/month Enterprise – Enquiries only Our rating 12. Visla Visla is an AI video creation and editing service that allows users to generate videos using high quality stock footage. You can generate videos from blog articles, scripts, or simply a written or spoken idea. The platform works quickly and it’s easy enough to edit videos. The biggest difficulty we found as users on the Free plan is that Visla highlights the premium features and assets first, so it can be difficult to find one suitable to use on the free plan. Unfortunately, this platform has no AI avatars on offer and the watermark at the end adds almost 5 seconds to your video. Pros: – It’s free to get started – It’s fast – Different languages (including German, Italian, Spanish, and more) are supported Cons: – Animated watermark adds length to the video – It can be difficult to find free features and assets Visla Pricing Free Premium – $24/month Our rating 13. Hour one Hour One claims to help users ‘create, manage, and streamline cinematic AI avatar videos.’ And the platform really is slick. It’s quick and easy to get started for free, and you can even clone your own voice for the voiceover. One of the downsides of the platform is that it can be slow to render videos, but it does keep you updated on progress. The lip syncing is impressive but lacking in emotion. Unfortunately, you can’t download without paying for premium so we have no example to show for Hour One. Pros: – Get started for free – Impressive lip syncing – Slick, easy-to-use platform Cons: – You can’t download videos on the free plan Hour One Pricing Free Lite – $30/month Business – $112/month Enterprise – Enquiries only Our rating The 4 best AI video generators 1. Elai – It’s really user-friendly and intuitive, plus you can get started for free. 2. HeyGen – Super impressive AI avatars and voices. It’s easy to get started with templates. 3. Veed – It’s free, quick, and easy to make professional-looking videos. 4. Synthesia – So easy to use and tons of realistic AI avatars to choose from. Final thoughts All of these AI video generators have pros and cons, and we’re sure that the best choice will be completely different for everyone. It all depends on your budget and requirements.

Recently, Khalil has been at the center of a high-profile legal and political controversy. He was arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on March 8, 2025, at his apartment in New York City. The arrest was linked to his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, where he had been a prominent organizer. The Trump administration has accused him of supporting Hamas, a designated terrorist organization, and cited foreign policy concerns as grounds for his deportation. Khalil's detention has sparked widespread protests and legal challenges. His attorneys argue that the arrest violates his First Amendment rights and is a form of retaliation for his political activism. A federal judge has temporarily blocked his deportation while the case is under review.

In Conclusion: Politico is a valuable source for staying informed about American politics and policy. However, like any news outlet, it’s essential to read their content critically, considering potential biases and the overall media landscape. ~ by Claude I can share some general information about Politico as a news outlet. Politico is a well-known American political journalism company that was founded in 2007 by John F. Harris and Jim VandeHei, former reporters at The Washington Post. It specializes in political coverage and reporting on policy and politics in the United States and internationally. Politico is known for: Focusing primarily on politics, policy, and government affairs A fast-paced reporting style with emphasis on breaking news and insider information Coverage of elections, campaigns, Congress, the White House, and policy areas Both free content and a premium subscription service called Politico Pro that offers in-depth policy coverage In 2021, Politico was acquired by the German publishing company Axel Springer. It maintains its headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, and has bureaus in various locations including Washington D.C., New York, and Brussels (where it operates Politico Europe). The outlet has gained prominence for its detailed coverage of government and politics, though like any news source, different readers may have varying opinions about its political leanings or editorial approach. It’s generally considered to be a mainstream political news source that’s widely read by people in government, politics, and policy circles. ~ by Gemini 2.0 Flash Okay, here’s an overview of Politico, considering its reputation, strengths, weaknesses, and overall place in the media landscape: General Overview: Politico is a prominent news organization focused on politics and policy in the United States and, increasingly, globally (with Politico Europe). It’s known for its in-depth reporting, particularly on Congress, the White House, and lobbying. It aims to provide non-partisan news but it has been known for favoring left-leaning views in its content. Key Characteristics and Strengths: Focus on Politics and Policy: Politico’s core strength is its deep dive into the mechanics of government, legislation, and political maneuvering. They cover the “inside baseball” aspects that other outlets might miss. Speed and Timeliness: Politico is known for breaking news quickly, often being among the first to report on developments in Washington. Influential Audience: Politico’s readership is heavily concentrated among political insiders, policymakers, journalists, and academics. This gives it significant influence within those circles.

Paywalls: Access to some of Politico’s content, especially Politico Pro, is behind a paywall, which limits accessibility for some readers.

Clickbait Headlines: Like many online news outlets, Politico sometimes uses sensationalized headlines to attract readers. Ownership and Funding: Politico is owned by Axel Springer, a German media company.

Overall Assessment: Politico is a valuable source of information for anyone interested in U.S. and European politics and policy. Its strength lies in its in-depth reporting, speed, and influence within political circles. However, it’s important to be aware of potential biases and the limitations of its insider focus. As with any news source, it’s best to read Politico critically and compare its reporting with that of other outlets to get a well-rounded perspective. To form your own opinion, I recommend: Reading a variety of articles from Politico over time. Comparing Politico’s coverage of specific events with that of other news organizations. Considering the source’s ownership and funding. Being aware of your own biases and how they might influence your interpretation of the news. ~ by DeepSeek **Assessment of Politico:** 1. **Overview and Reputation:** Politico, founded in 2007, is a prominent U.S.-based news outlet specializing in politics, policy, and governance, with a strong focus on Washington, D.C., and international affairs. It is widely regarded as credible and nonpartisan in its news reporting, though its opinion sections may reflect diverse ideological perspectives. Its reputation for breaking news and insider access, particularly through newsletters like *Playbook*, makes it a staple for policymakers, journalists, and politically engaged audiences. 2. **Content and Style:** – **Speed vs. Depth:** Known for rapid news updates, Politico balances quick scoops with in-depth policy analysis. While its breaking-news approach occasionally risks lacking context, its long-form journalism (e.g., policy deep dives) is well-researched. – **Audience:** Targets political insiders, which can lead to jargon-heavy content, though efforts to explain complex issues for broader audiences exist. 3. **Ownership and Expansion:** Acquired by Axel Springer (2021), Politico benefits from expanded resources and international reach, notably through *Politico Europe*. While maintaining a U.S. focus, this ownership may enhance cross-border reporting but raises questions about editorial independence (though no major shifts in tone have been observed post-acquisition). 4. **Criticisms and Controversies:** – **Sensationalism:** Critics argue its emphasis on scoops can prioritize speed over accuracy, as seen in a retracted 2020 story linking a Chinese scientist to COVID-19. – **Paywall:** Limits public access to content, potentially reducing its reach compared to free outlets. 5. **Influence and Impact:** Politico often sets the news agenda for other media, amplifying its influence in political discourse. Its awards (e.g., Pulitzer finalists) underscore journalistic rigor. However, its insider focus sometimes draws accusations of catering to elite narratives over grassroots perspectives. **Conclusion:** Politico is a key player in political journalism, valued for timely reporting and policy expertise. While generally credible, readers should remain mindful of potential sensationalism and seek diverse sources for balanced viewpoints. Its evolution under Axel Springer and global expansion will be critical to monitor for maintaining quality and impartiality. ~ Chat GPT 4 Politico is a well-known American news outlet that primarily covers politics and policy at the national and international levels. Founded in 2007, it has gained a reputation for in-depth reporting on U.S. government affairs, elections, and legislative developments. The publication is often cited for its inside-the-Beltway perspective, making it a go-to source for policymakers, journalists, and political enthusiasts. Politico is generally regarded as center-left or center in its editorial stance, though it aims for factual reporting rather than overt partisanship. It has expanded globally, including a strong presence in Europe, covering EU politics extensively. Analysis of Politico: Credibility, Bias, and Influence 1. Credibility Politico is generally regarded as a credible source for political news, with a strong focus on policy, elections, and government affairs. It employs professional journalists and adheres to journalistic standards, making it a reliable source of information. However, like any major news outlet, its coverage can sometimes reflect the priorities and perspectives of its editorial team. Strengths: In-depth investigative journalism on U.S. and European politics. Frequent scoops and exclusive reports on policy decisions. Well-sourced articles featuring lawmakers, experts, and officials. A mix of breaking news and long-form analysis. Weaknesses: Occasional reliance on anonymous sources, which can affect transparency. Fast-paced reporting can sometimes lead to minor inaccuracies that require corrections. 2. Bias and Editorial Stance Politico strives for neutrality, but media bias ratings generally place it as center-left or centrist, depending on the issue. Left-Leaning Elements: It often frames issues in ways that resonate with progressive or liberal audiences. Coverage of social policies may align more with Democratic viewpoints. Some of its journalists have backgrounds in left-leaning publications. Right-Leaning Elements: It covers economic and regulatory policies in a way that can appeal to free-market advocates. Some opinion pieces and contributors reflect conservative viewpoints. It maintains credibility among policymakers across the political spectrum. Fact-Checking and Corrections: Politico has been fact-checked by multiple independent organizations (e.g., Media Bias/Fact Check, AllSides) and is considered “mostly factual” with a history of issuing corrections when necessary. 3. Influence and Reach Politico has significant influence, particularly among policymakers, journalists, and political insiders. U.S. Influence: Frequently cited by other news outlets, politicians, and think tanks. Influences policy discussions, especially in Washington, D.C. Has a strong presence in political journalism, competing with outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Axios. Global Expansion: Politico Europe has become a major player in EU policy coverage. The outlet’s purchase by Axel Springer (a German media giant) in 2021 raised concerns about potential shifts in editorial independence. Final Verdict Is Politico credible? Yes, but like all outlets, its framing and emphasis can reflect subtle biases. Is it biased? Somewhat, leaning center-left, but it does provide diverse perspectives. Is it influential? Absolutely—especially in political and policy-making circles. ~ by Grok 3 Key Points Politico is a well-respected news outlet focusing on politics and policy, likely with a slight left-leaning bias according to some research. It was founded in 2007, is owned by Axel Springer SE, and covers the US and international politics. The evidence leans toward Politico being reliable, with a commitment to nonpartisan journalism, though bias ratings vary. Overview Politico is a digital newspaper company that provides in-depth coverage of political events, legislative activities, and policy issues. It aims to inform influential audiences with timely and accurate reporting. History and Ownership Founded in 2007 by Robert Allbritton, Politico was acquired in 2021 by Axel Springer SE, a German media company. This ownership change has not significantly altered its editorial stance, which focuses on politics in the US, EU, UK, and Canada. Bias and Reliability Research suggests Politico has a centrist to slightly left-leaning bias, with ratings from AllSides (“Lean Left”), Media Bias/Fact Check (“Left-Center”), and Ad Fontes Media (“neutral/balanced”). Its audience includes more consistent liberal readers, per Pew Research, but it strives for nonpartisan reporting. Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Politico as a News Outlet Politico, an American political digital newspaper company, has established itself as a key player in covering politics and policy since its founding in 2007 by Robert Allbritton. This analysis delves into its history, ownership, coverage scope, bias, and reliability, providing a detailed examination for readers seeking a thorough understanding. Historical Context and Ownership Politico was launched with a focus on fast-paced, detailed internet reporting on politics, akin to sports analysis on platforms like ESPN. Its founders, John F. Harris and Jim VandeHei, left The Washington Post to build Politico, which initially gained traction by prioritizing scoops and rapid production. By 2011, it expanded into long-form journalism and news analysis, hiring figures like Susan Glasser to enhance its opinion and storytelling capabilities. In August 2021, Politico was acquired by Axel Springer SE, a German media conglomerate and Europe’s largest newspaper publisher, for over $1 billion. This acquisition included other notable publications like Business Insider. Unlike Axel Springer’s German properties, Politico employees are not required to sign the company’s mission statement supporting Israel’s right to exist, maintaining editorial independence. This ownership structure has been noted in discussions about potential influences on content, but no significant shifts in editorial stance have been widely reported post-acquisition. Scope of Coverage Politico’s coverage extends beyond the US to include the European Union, United Kingdom, and Canada, with dedicated publications for each region. It distributes content through its website, a print newspaper (circulation around 32,000 in 2009, free in Washington, D.C., and Manhattan), radio, podcasts, and a bi-monthly magazine. Its focus areas include federal government activities, lobbying, media, and policy issues like healthcare, technology, and energy, particularly through its subscription-based service, Politico Pro, launched in 2010. Politico Pro offers policy intelligence for professionals, covering thousands of topics across 17 industry verticals and state-specific areas like California and Florida. It includes tools like Legislative Compass and Regulatory Compass for tracking bills and regulations, and Stakeholder Management for connecting with policy influencers. This service underscores Politico’s aim to serve political professionals with real-time, actionable insights. Bias and Audience Analysis The question of Politico’s bias is complex, with varying assessments from media bias rating organizations. AllSides rates Politico as “Lean Left,” with a bias meter value of -1.20, suggesting a moderate alignment with liberal, progressive, or left-wing agendas, primarily through story selection and focus on issues important to the political left. Media Bias/Fact Check rates it as “Left-Center,” with a bias rating of -2.8, indicating a slight liberal tilt, but also rates it “High” for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact-check record. Conversely, Ad Fontes Media rates it as “neutral/balanced” in bias and “Reliable, Analysis/Fact Reporting,” based on panels including left-leaning, right-leaning, and center-leaning analysts. A 2014 Pew Research Center study, “Where News Audiences Fit on the Political Spectrum,” found that just 16% of Politico’s audience has mixed ideological views, compared to 36% of all web users, with consistent liberals overrepresented and consistent conservatives represented on par with their proportion among all respondents. This suggests the audience leans left, which may influence perceptions of bias but does not directly reflect content bias. Critiques from both political spectrums exist. The Daily Caller and Breitbart, right-leaning outlets, claimed in 2011 and 2012 respectively that Politico has a liberal bias, while some left-leaning critics might argue it occasionally balances with center or right-leaning perspectives. Politico’s own statements, such as on its Pro platform, emphasize nonpartisan, fact-based reporting, with teams of policy-specific journalists keeping opinions out of stories to maintain credibility. Reliability and Editorial Practices Politico’s commitment to reliability is evident in its high factual reporting ratings from Media Bias/Fact Check and Ad Fontes Media. It strives to be the “dominant source for news on politics and policy,” as stated on its “About Us” page (About POLITICO), with a mission to provide accurate, nonpartisan information to influential audiences. Its coverage includes breaking news, opinion pieces, and features, with a focus on real-time tools to engage global citizenry. Examples of its reporting, such as the March 10, 2025, article “How the Navy SEALs Conquered Congress — And Became the Shock Troops of the MAGA Revolution” (Politico Article), demonstrate a feature-style approach exploring trends like the increasing presence of former Navy SEALs in Congress, without overt partisan framing. On contentious issues like abortion, articles like “How abortion coverage changed in the media, according to the data” (Politico Article) provide data-driven analysis, focusing on shifts in media coverage post-Dobbs, suggesting a balanced approach. Opinion pieces, such as “A Grand Compromise on Abortion” (Politico Opinion), propose middle-ground solutions, indicating an effort to present diverse viewpoints. This aligns with Politico’s stated goal of informing the powerful with insight, edge, and authority, without pushing a singular agenda. Comparative Analysis and Public Perception Public perception, as seen in forums like Reddit (Reddit Discussion), notes Politico as solid for current events but potentially myopic, focusing on political processes over policy outcomes. Critics like those at a Harvard IOP forum in November 2024 highlighted issues like parachute journalism, where Politico reporters might lack deep local knowledge, potentially affecting trust (Harvard Crimson Article). Despite these critiques, Politico’s traffic is high, with claims of 26 million unique visitors monthly to its American website in 2017, and it remains a go-to source for political professionals. Its subscription model, including Politico Pro, caters to lobbyists, analysts, and strategists, reinforcing its role as a policy intelligence platform. Conclusion Politico is a reputable news outlet with a strong focus on politics and policy, likely exhibiting a slight left-leaning bias according to some research, though it strives for nonpartisanship. Its ownership by Axel Springer SE and extensive coverage across multiple regions enhance its global influence. For readers, it offers reliable, in-depth reporting, but awareness of potential bias and supplementing with other sources can provide a fuller picture. | Aspect | Details | | --- | --- | | Founded | 2007 by Robert Allbritton | | Ownership | Acquired by Axel Springer SE in 2021 for over $1 billion | | Coverage Scope | US, EU, UK, Canada; politics, policy, lobbying, media | | Bias Ratings | AllSides: Lean Left; MBFC: Left-Center; Ad Fontes: Neutral/Balanced | | Audience Lean | Pew Research: More consistent liberal readers | | Reliability | High factual reporting, commitment to nonpartisan journalism | | Distribution | Website, print newspaper, radio, podcasts, magazine | This table summarizes key aspects, highlighting the variability in bias ratings and Politico’s broad reach, which may be an unexpected detail for readers expecting a more uniform bias assessment.

Please take a look at this article as well. Your comments, (any), will be appreciated. Prompt: Mention at least five instances where Adam Schiff has been found lying. ~ by Copilot Here are five instances where Adam Schiff has been accused of lying: 1. **Trump-Russia Collusion**: Schiff repeatedly claimed that there was clear evidence of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. However, the Mueller report found no conclusive evidence of such collusion. 2. **Steele Dossier**: Schiff promoted the Steele dossier, which was later discredited. He claimed it contained verified information, but it was revealed that the dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, and its credibility was highly questionable. 3. **Nunes Memo**: Schiff criticized the Nunes memo, which detailed the origins and lack of evidence supporting the Steele dossier. He claimed the memo was misleading and unsupported by facts, but later revelations showed that the memo’s claims were accurate. 4. **Impeachment Inquiry**: During the impeachment inquiry against President Trump, Schiff was accused of misrepresenting the contents of a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He later admitted that his summary was a “parody”. 5. **Public Statements vs. Closed Testimony**: Schiff made public statements asserting that there was direct evidence of collusion, but transcripts of closed-door testimonies revealed that key witnesses, including former Obama administration officials, stated they had no direct evidence of collusion. These instances have led to significant controversy and criticism of Schiff’s credibility. ~ by Perplexity The search results do not provide specific instances where Adam Schiff has been definitively found lying. However, they do mention several controversies and criticisms related to his statements and actions, particularly regarding the Trump-Russia investigation. Here are some of the key points: Claims of Collusion Evidence: Schiff repeatedly stated that there was evidence of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia, which was not supported by the Mueller or Durham investigations12. Critics argue that these claims were misleading or false. FISA Memo Controversy: The Schiff memo was criticized for containing false statements regarding the FISA warrant process for Carter Page. The Inspector General’s report supported many of the claims made in the Nunes memo, which contradicted Schiff’s assertions3. Whistleblower Testimony: There were false claims circulating about Schiff’s involvement with impeachment witnesses, including a bogus claim that he paid them over $40 million5. Censure by the House: Schiff was censured by the House for his comments on the Trump-Russia investigations, with the resolution stating that he “purposely deceived his Committee, Congress, and the American people”7. Assertions on Trump’s Actions: Schiff has been criticized for his interpretations of Trump’s actions, such as his claims about Trump’s handling of the Jamal Khashoggi murder investigation2. However, these are more about differing interpretations than outright lies. It’s important to note that while Schiff has faced significant criticism and controversy, not all of these instances necessarily constitute “lying” in a strict sense. Some may be seen as misinterpretations, exaggerations, or differing political perspectives.

It seems likely that Schiff lied about not speaking directly with the whistleblower, misrepresenting Trump’s Ukraine call, and promoting the Steele dossier. The evidence leans toward Schiff’s assertions of collusion being misleading, given the Mueller report’s findings, but definitions of “collusion” vary. Controversy exists, with Republicans accusing Schiff of lying, while Democrats defend him, highlighting political polarization. Background Adam Schiff, a Democratic politician from California, has been a prominent figure in U.S. politics, especially during the Trump era, serving as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. His statements, particularly on Trump’s alleged Russia connections, have drawn significant scrutiny, with accusations of lying from political opponents. Instances of False Statements Here are detailed instances where Schiff has been found lying, based on available evidence: Whistleblower Contact: In September 2019, Schiff claimed on MSNBC that his committee had not spoken directly with the whistleblower involved in the Trump-Ukraine complaint. However, it was later revealed that a staffer had communicated with the whistleblower, making this statement false (PolitiFact). Trump’s Ukraine Call: During a September 2019 House hearing, Schiff gave a dramatized account of Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which was not accurate to the transcript, leading to accusations of misrepresentation (CNN). Promotion of Steele Dossier: In March 2017, Schiff entered the unverified Steele dossier into the Congressional record, promoting its claims of Trump-Russia collusion, which were later discredited, contributing to false narratives (Fox News). Assertions of Collusion: Schiff repeatedly claimed there was evidence of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia, despite the Mueller report finding no criminal conspiracy, potentially misleading the public (POLITICO). Continued Insistence Post-Mueller: Even after the March 2019 Mueller report, Schiff maintained there was collusion, continuing to assert evidence existed, which some view as a lie given the report’s conclusions (The Washington Post). These instances reflect the complexity and controversy surrounding Schiff’s statements, with political implications shaping public perception. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Adam Schiff’s Alleged False Statements Adam Schiff, a Democratic U.S. Representative from California and former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has been a central figure in investigations into former President Donald Trump’s alleged ties to Russia, particularly during the 2016 election. His statements have faced significant scrutiny, with accusations of lying from Republican critics, while Democrats often defend him as a champion of oversight. This analysis explores five instances where Schiff has been found lying, based on available evidence, and provides a comprehensive overview of the context, controversy, and implications. Context and Political Landscape Schiff’s prominence grew during the Trump administration, especially through his role in the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the subsequent impeachment inquiries. His assertions of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia were met with counterclaims of fabrication, particularly after the Mueller report’s release in March 2019, which found no evidence of criminal conspiracy but confirmed Russian interference and Trump’s campaign’s receptiveness to it. The political polarization surrounding these issues has fueled debates over Schiff’s credibility, with Republicans seeking to censure him and Democrats viewing him as a target of political revenge. Detailed Instances of Alleged Lies The following table summarizes the five instances where Schiff has been found lying, with supporting details and sources: | Instance | Details | Date | Source URL | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | False statement about whistleblower contact | Claimed on MSNBC that committee had not spoken directly with whistleblower; staffer had contact. | September 2019 | PolitiFact | | Misleading account of Trump’s Ukraine call | Gave dramatized account in House hearing, not accurate to transcript, presented as parody. | September 2019 | CNN | | Promotion of Steele dossier as evidence of collusion | Entered unverified dossier into record in 2017, later discredited, promoted as evidence. | March 2017 | Fox News | | Assertions of collusion evidence | Repeatedly claimed evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, despite Mueller report’s findings. | Various, 2017-19 | POLITICO | | Continued insistence post-Mueller report | Maintained collusion evidence existed after March 2019 report, seen as misleading. | March 2019 | The Washington Post | Analysis of Each Instance Whistleblower Contact: In September 2019, during an MSNBC interview, Schiff stated, “We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower,” referring to the individual who filed a complaint about Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Subsequent reporting by The New York Times and FactCheck.org revealed that a House Intelligence Committee aide had received a vague outline of the whistleblower’s concerns and shared some with Schiff before the complaint was filed. This discrepancy led PolitiFact to rate the statement as false, highlighting Schiff’s lack of clarity, which he later attributed to referring to official interviews rather than staff communications. Trump’s Ukraine Call: During a September 2019 House Intelligence Committee hearing, Schiff presented a dramatized version of Trump’s July 25, 2019, phone call with Zelensky, saying, “I’m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent. Understand? Lots of it, on this and on that.” CNN fact-checked this, noting that Trump did not repeat demands seven times and did not instruct Zelensky to “make up dirt,” but rather asked to “look into” baseless claims. Schiff later claimed it was a parody, but the initial presentation caused confusion, leading to accusations of lying from Trump and his allies. Promotion of Steele Dossier: In March 2017, during a House Intelligence Committee hearing, Schiff read parts of the Steele dossier into the Congressional record, which contained unverified claims of Trump’s collusion with Russia, including allegations of a conspiracy with the Kremlin. The dossier, funded by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign, was later discredited by Special Counsel John Durham’s investigation, particularly after charges against Igor Danchenko, a key source, for lying to the FBI. Fox News reported Schiff’s defense, but critics argue he promoted it as evidence, contributing to false narratives. Assertions of Collusion Evidence: Throughout 2017-2019, Schiff made numerous statements asserting evidence of collusion, such as in February 2019 on CNN, saying, “You can see evidence in plain sight on the issue of collusion, pretty compelling evidence,” distinguishing between collusion and criminal conspiracy. However, the Mueller report, released in March 2019, found no evidence of criminal conspiracy, leading to accusations that Schiff misled the public. POLITICO covered this, noting his distinction, but the public perception of “collusion” as criminal activity fueled controversy. Continued Insistence Post-Mueller Report: After the Mueller report’s release, Schiff maintained in March 2019 to The Washington Post, “Undoubtedly there is collusion,” and continued to push for further investigation, despite the report’s findings. This insistence, seen by some as a lie given the lack of criminal conspiracy evidence, reflects his interpretation of “collusion” as broader coordination, but critics argue it perpetuated a false narrative, especially as Republicans sought to censure him in 2023. Controversy and Implications The controversy surrounding Schiff’s statements is deeply rooted in political polarization. Republicans, as seen in the 2023 House censure resolution, accused him of abusing his position to spread false allegations, with Rep. Anna Paulina Luna citing “baseless distortions” (Fox News). Democrats, however, defended him, with Rep. Jamie Raskin calling it an “embarrassing revenge tour” (PBS News). This divide highlights the challenge of distinguishing between factual inaccuracies and political rhetoric, especially on sensitive topics like election interference. The implications extend to public trust in Congress, with Schiff’s actions seen by some as damaging institutional integrity, while others view him as a necessary check on executive power. The complexity lies in the definitions used—collusion versus conspiracy—and the timing of statements relative to investigative findings, making it a debated topic as of February 27, 2025. Unexpected Detail: Impact on Media Coverage An unexpected detail is the significant media coverage Schiff received, amplifying his statements’ reach, as noted in The Hill’s critique of an “unquestioning press” promoting his book based on Russia fiction (The Hill). This media dynamic contributed to public perception, adding another layer to the controversy. This analysis, based on extensive research into fact-checking sites like PolitiFact and CNN, news reports from Fox News, POLITICO, and The Washington Post, and congressional records, provides a comprehensive view of Schiff’s alleged lies, acknowledging the complexity and ongoing debate.

It is led by Elon Musk and aims to streamline federal operations by reducing spending, cutting regulations, and modernizing governmental technology. Despite its name, DOGE is not a Cabinet-level department but rather a temporary organization operating under the United States DOGE Service, which was formerly known as the United States Digital Service[1][2][4]. ### Objectives and Actions DOGE’s primary mission includes: – **Slashing Federal Spending**: The organization has claimed to save over $1 billion by canceling various contracts related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives[2][3]. Musk has suggested that DOGE could potentially cut up to $2 trillion from the federal budget by eliminating redundant agencies and downsizing the workforce[1][3]. – **Dismantling Bureaucracy**: The initiative seeks to reduce what it perceives as excessive government bureaucracy and wasteful expenditures. This includes proposals to consolidate over 400 federal agencies into fewer than 100[1][4]. – **Controversial Methods**: DOGE’s approach has sparked significant controversy, including lawsuits from Democratic lawmakers who argue that its actions may violate constitutional provisions. Critics have labeled DOGE’s efforts as a “hostile takeover” of federal functions[2][4][5]. ### Legal and Political Implications The establishment of DOGE has raised questions regarding its legality and authority. Critics argue that it operates beyond its intended scope, potentially infringing on established governmental processes. Supporters, however, view it as a necessary reform to address what they see as bloated government spending amid rising national debt[2][5]. The organization is scheduled to operate until July 4, 2026, during which it aims to implement its ambitious agenda[1][3]. In summary, the Department of Government Efficiency represents a significant shift in how the U.S. government approaches efficiency and spending, spearheaded by high-profile figures like Elon Musk amidst considerable political contention.

Here are some key points about LCA and its benefits: 1. **Fat Absorption**: LCA acts as a detergent to solubilize fats for absorption in the intestine. 2. **Anti-Aging Effects**: Preliminary research suggests that LCA may have anti-aging effects, mimicking the benefits of calorie restriction. 3. **Anti-Tumor Properties**: LCA has been shown to selectively kill certain cancer cells, such as neuroblastoma cells, while sparing normal cells. 4. **Gut-Liver Axis**: LCA plays a role in the gut-liver axis, potentially regulating gut microbiota and intestinal barrier functions. 5. **Vitamin D Receptor Activation**: LCA can activate the vitamin D receptor without significantly raising calcium levels. 6. **Anti-Inflammatory Effects**: Some studies suggest that LCA may have anti-inflammatory properties. ~ by Perplexity Lithocholic acid (LCA), also known as 3α-hydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid, is a bile acid that functions as a detergent to help solubilize fats for absorption[1]. It is a monohydroxy bile acid produced by intestinal flora from chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) through bacterial action[2][3]. LCA was once considered toxic, but more recent studies have revealed that LCA and its derivatives may have anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects under certain conditions[2][3]. It goes through enterohepatic circulation along with other bile acids, impacting the gut microbiota, intestinal barrier, and relevant nuclear receptors[2][3]. Dietary fiber can bind to lithocholic acid, which can help protect against colon cancer by aiding in its excretion in stool[1]. Other effects and benefits of lithocholic acid: * **Anti-aging** LCA has demonstrated anti-aging effects in yeast, fruit flies, nematodes, and mice[1]. LCA can mimic the effects of calorie restriction, such as activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), enhancing muscle regeneration, and rejuvenating grip strength and running capacity[4][6]. * **Antimicrobial effects** LCA exhibits antibacterial effects against certain bacteria, such as *Helicobacter pylori*[3]. It can also show synergistic effects with clarithromycin or levofloxacin[3]. * **Antineoplastic effects** LCA has antitumor effects and can induce a multi-pronged antineoplastic program in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells[5]. It can inhibit cancer cell proliferation and reduce cell invasion capacity[5][8]. * **Vitamin D receptor activation** LCA can activate the vitamin D receptor without raising calcium levels as much as vitamin D itself[1]. * **NAPE-PLD binding** LCA binds with 20 μM affinity to the human membrane enzyme NAPE-PLD, enhancing dimer assembly and enabling catalysis. NAPE-PLD facilitates crosstalk between bile acid signals and lipid amide signals[1].

Copilot Incorporating Lithocholic Acid (LCA) into your body typically involves dietary supplements, as it is not commonly found in foods. Here are some ways to incorporate LCA: 1. **Supplements**: You can take LCA supplements available in health stores or online. Make sure to follow the dosage instructions provided by the manufacturer or consult with a healthcare professional. 2. **Probiotics**: Consuming probiotics can help promote the production of LCA in your gut. Probiotics like Lactobacillus and Clostridium species can convert primary bile acids into LCA. 3. **Calorie Restriction**: Some studies suggest that calorie restriction can increase the production of LCA in the body. While not a direct method of incorporating LCA, it may help boost its levels naturally. 4. **Healthy Diet**: Maintaining a healthy diet that supports gut health can also contribute to the production of LCA. Include foods rich in fiber, prebiotics, and probiotics to support your gut microbiota. Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen to ensure it is safe and appropriate for your individual health needs. Perplexity Incorporating lithocholic acid (LCA) into your body can be approached through dietary supplementation, but caution is advised due to its potential toxicity at high levels. Here are some methods and considerations for incorporating LCA: 1. **Dietary Sources**: LCA is naturally produced in the body from the metabolism of primary bile acids. While direct dietary sources of LCA are limited, it can be influenced by the consumption of foods high in fiber, which promote the growth of gut bacteria that convert primary bile acids into secondary bile acids like LCA. 2. **Supplementation**: LCA supplements are available on the market. If considering supplementation, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare provider to determine appropriate dosages and to monitor for any adverse effects, as excessive LCA can lead to liver damage or cholestasis[2][4]. 3. **Combination with Other Compounds**: Some studies suggest that combining LCA with other natural components may enhance its detoxification and reduce potential toxicity. For example, glycyrrhizin from licorice can promote detoxification processes that mitigate LCA-induced liver damage[2]. 4. **Research-Based Approaches**: Emerging research indicates that LCA may mimic certain effects of vitamin D and could be beneficial in specific contexts, such as enhancing calcium absorption or exhibiting anti-aging properties[3][5]. However, these benefits are primarily observed in controlled studies and may not translate directly to general dietary practices. 5. **Monitoring and Safety**: Regular monitoring of liver function and overall health is essential when incorporating LCA into your regimen, especially if taken in supplement form. The effects can vary significantly between individuals based on their health status and existing conditions. In summary, while there are ways to incorporate lithocholic acid into your body, it should be approached with care, considering both potential benefits and risks. Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.

Copilot Lithocholic Acid (LCA) can have some side effects, especially at higher doses. Here are a few potential side effects: 1. **Liver Toxicity**: High concentrations of LCA can be toxic to liver cells, potentially causing liver damage. 2. **Oxidative Stress**: LCA can induce oxidative stress and DNA damage, which may promote tumor development. 3. **Gastrointestinal Issues**: Some studies suggest that LCA might cause gastrointestinal discomfort or disturbances. 4. **Carcinogenic Potential**: There is some evidence that LCA could have carcinogenic properties, although this is still under investigation. It’s important to consult with a healthcare professional before taking LCA supplements to ensure they are safe and appropriate for your individual health needs. Perplexity Yes, there are known side effects associated with lithocholic acid (LCA)[2]. Once considered toxic, it can cause cholestatic liver injury and potentially lead to death from liver failure, especially in individuals with compromised sulfation[3]. Other potential side effects and considerations include: * **Carcinogenesis** It has been implicated in human and experimental animal carcinogenesis[6]. High concentrations of LCA can induce oxidative stress and DNA damage, potentially promoting tumor development by inhibiting DNA repair enzymes and encouraging cell proliferation[2]. * **Liver damage** Lithocholic acid is a liver-toxic metabolite[1]. Dietary administration of lithocholic acid to chickens has been reported to cause hepatic adenomatous hyperplasia[1]. * **Drug interactions** Bile acid sequestering agents like cholestyramine and colestipol may interfere with the action of Reltone by reducing its absorption. Aluminum-based antacids may also interfere with Reltone in the same manner. Estrogens, oral contraceptives, and clofibrate may counteract the effectiveness of ursodiol[1]. * **Gastrointestinal issues** Severe overdose with ursodiol would likely manifest as diarrhea[1]. * **Heart Symptoms** Serious heart symptoms such as fast, irregular, or pounding heartbeats, fluttering in your chest, shortness of breath, and sudden dizziness[1]. * **Other common side effects** Allergy, chest pain, fatigue, viral infection, abdominal pain, Cholecystitis, Constipation, Alopecia and Dysmenorrhea[1].

My wife and I are having a good marriage period but I dream very often that we get divorced/separated. Any thoughts? by Copilot Dreams can often reflect our subconscious thoughts, emotions, and anxieties, even if everything seems fine in our waking life. Here are a few thoughts on why you might be having these dreams: 1. **Subconscious Fears**: Even if your marriage is currently in a good place, you may have underlying fears about losing your partner or the stability of your relationship. These fears can manifest as dreams about separation or divorce. 2. **Change and Transition**: Dreams about separation can also symbolize changes or transitions in your life. It doesn’t necessarily mean a literal separation from your partner but could reflect other changes you’re experiencing or anticipating. 3. **Reflection of Stress**: If you’re experiencing stress or anxiety in other areas of your life, such as work or personal issues, these emotions might be seeping into your dreams and expressing themselves through themes of separation. 4. **Communication Needs**: Sometimes, these dreams might indicate a need for more communication or reassurance within your relationship. It could be your mind’s way of prompting you to check in with your partner and discuss any concerns, even if they’re minor. Remember, dreams are highly personal and can be influenced by many factors. While these are some general thoughts, your specific situation might have unique aspects. If these dreams are causing you distress, talking about them with your partner or a professional might help provide more clarity and peace of mind. by Perplexity Dreaming about divorce or separation can be unsettling, especially during a good period in your marriage. Dream analysis suggests various interpretations for such dreams: * **Fear and Insecurity**: Dreams of divorce can symbolize fear, threat, insecurity, sorrow, regret, and serious issues within your marriage[1]. It may also reflect a fear of change and uncertainty about the future[1]. * **Desire for Freedom**: A divorce dream may indicate a longing for freedom and liberation if you feel restricted or trapped, signaling a need to break away from old patterns[1]. * **Processing Unresolved Emotions**: Dreams of divorce can be an echo of complex emotions that remain to be fully processed, such as sadness, anger, or regret[3]. * **Reflection of Current Situation**: Dreaming about divorce could reflect your current situation, especially if the impact of a potential separation is affecting your subconscious mind[5]. * **Fear of Loss and Loneliness**: The dream may indicate a fear of losing loved ones or being separated from them, as well as a fear of loneliness and a desire to be among people[5]. * **Inner Transformation**: Such dreams can symbolize severing ties with an outdated version of yourself, which keeps you from living a more empowered and authentic life[3]. * **External Stressors**: Stress, fear, or anxiety in your life can manifest as dreams about divorce, indicating feelings of disconnection from your partner or yourself[1]. It may also be a sign to take appropriate steps to remove yourself from things that are not good for you[5]. Dreams are sensitive to our most important relationships, and a divorce is likely to dominate a person’s dreamscape for a long time[7]. It’s worth considering what these dreams might be telling you about your feelings, fears, or needs within the relationship.

Dreams about relationship troubles, including divorce, don’t necessarily reflect a desire for separation or predict future problems. In fact, they’re quite common even in happy relationships. These dreams often represent: 1. Processing natural anxieties about losing someone important to you 2. Working through past relationship experiences or witnessed divorces (perhaps from family or friends) 3. Dealing with normal relationship changes or growth periods 4. Managing general life stresses that might be manifesting in dream scenarios The fact that you’re in a good period in your marriage makes particular sense here – sometimes when things are going well, our subconscious mind processes our fears of losing that happiness. It’s similar to how parents might have nightmares about their children despite being wonderful parents, or professionals dream about failing at work despite being successful. by Gemini 2.0 Flash It’s understandable to be concerned when you’re dreaming about something that seems contrary to your waking life, especially when it involves your marriage. While I can’t give you a definitive interpretation (dream analysis is highly personal), I can offer some common reasons why you might be having these dreams, even during a happy period in your marriage. Here are some potential avenues to explore: 1. Anxiety about Loss and Change (Even Positive Change): Fear of losing what you have: Sometimes, when things are good, we subconsciously worry about losing them. Your dreams could be reflecting a fear that this happy period won’t last. It’s a manifestation of the anxiety that good times could end. Anxiety about change (even good change): Even positive changes in a relationship can trigger anxiety. Perhaps this “good period” involves new dynamics, deeper vulnerability, or future plans that are causing some subconscious unease. Are you stepping into new roles, facing new challenges, or making big decisions together? A need for control: The dream could be about feeling a lack of control over the future of your relationship. The divorce/separation symbolizes a major disruption, and the dream might be an attempt to grapple with the uncertainty inherent in any long-term commitment. 2. Exploring Unresolved Issues (Even if Subconscious): Dredged-up past hurts: Dreams can dredge up unresolved issues from the past, even if they seem insignificant in your waking life. Is there anything, even minor, that you or your wife haven’t fully processed or forgiven? Unmet needs: Even in a good marriage, there might be unspoken needs or desires. The dream could be a symbolic representation of a need for more emotional intimacy, greater freedom, or something else entirely. It’s not necessarily about your wife failing to meet these needs; it could be about your own difficulty expressing them. Self-sabotage: Although this is less likely, sometimes people subconsciously sabotage good things in their lives due to feelings of unworthiness or fear of commitment. The dream could be a manifestation of this self-sabotaging tendency. 3. Symbolism and Metaphor: “Divorce” as a metaphor for separation from a part of yourself: Dreams often use symbolic language. “Divorce” in your dream might not literally mean divorce from your wife, but rather a separation from a part of yourself or a way of life. Are you feeling disconnected from your passions, your identity, or your purpose outside of the marriage? Need for independence: The dream might reflect a need for more personal space or independence within the marriage. It’s not necessarily a negative thing; healthy relationships allow for individual growth and autonomy. End of a cycle: “Separation” could symbolize the end of a chapter in your life together. Perhaps you’re transitioning into a new phase of your marriage, and the dream is reflecting the letting go of the old. 4. General Stress and Anxiety: Unrelated stress: Stress from other areas of your life (work, finances, family) can manifest in dreams about your relationship, even if the stress isn’t directly related to your wife. Your subconscious might be using your marriage as a familiar framework to process general anxiety. Exaggerated fears: Sometimes, our dreams amplify our fears and insecurities. The dream might be an overblown representation of a small worry or concern you have about your marriage. What to Do: Reflect on the details of the dreams: What are the specific circumstances of the divorce/separation in the dream? Who initiates it? How do you feel in the dream (angry, sad, relieved, etc.)? These details can provide valuable clues. Talk to your wife (carefully): It’s important to approach this conversation gently. Don’t accuse her of anything or make her feel responsible for your dreams. You could say something like, “I’ve been having some unsettling dreams about separation, and I wanted to share them with you because I value our communication. I’m not blaming you, but I’m wondering if we can talk about any underlying anxieties or unmet needs we might have, even if they seem small.” Consider journaling: Writing down your dreams and exploring your feelings about them can help you uncover hidden meanings and patterns. Explore your own emotions and insecurities: Are there any areas in your life where you feel insecure, anxious, or out of control? Addressing these issues directly might help reduce the frequency of these dreams. If the dreams are causing significant distress, consider consulting a therapist: A therapist can provide a safe space for you to explore your subconscious anxieties and help you develop coping mechanisms. Important Note: Dreams are often symbolic and don’t necessarily predict the future. Don’t let these dreams create unnecessary anxiety or distrust in your relationship. Instead, use them as an opportunity for self-reflection and open communication with your wife. Good luck! by DeepSeek Dreams about divorce or separation, especially when your waking life feels stable and positive, can be unsettling. However, dreams often don’t reflect literal truths but instead symbolize deeper emotions, fears, or unresolved thoughts. Here are some possible interpretations to consider: 1. **Fear of Loss or Change**: Even in a happy marriage, it’s natural to have underlying fears about losing the relationship or facing unexpected changes. Your dream might be reflecting a subconscious fear of losing the connection you value so much. 2. **Personal Insecurities**: Sometimes, dreams about separation can stem from personal insecurities or self-doubt. You might be questioning your worthiness as a partner or worrying about whether you’re meeting your wife’s needs. 3. **Unresolved Conflict or Stress**: If there’s any minor tension or unresolved issue in your relationship (even something small or unspoken), it could manifest in your dreams as a more dramatic scenario, like divorce. 4. **Symbolic Transformation**: Dreams of separation or divorce don’t always relate to the relationship itself. They can symbolize a desire for personal growth or a need to let go of old habits, patterns, or aspects of yourself that no longer serve you. 5. **External Influences**: If you’ve recently been exposed to stories of divorce (e.g., from friends, family, or media), it might have triggered these dreams, even if they don’t reflect your own reality. ### What You Can Do: – **Reflect on Your Emotions**: Pay attention to how you feel in the dream and upon waking. Are you relieved, sad, or anxious? This can offer clues about what the dream might mean. – **Communicate with Your Wife**: If the dreams are bothering you, consider sharing them with your wife in a non-alarming way. It might open up a meaningful conversation about your relationship and strengthen your bond. – **Address Underlying Stress**: If you’re feeling stressed or insecure in other areas of life, those feelings might be spilling over into your dreams. Practicing self-care or journaling can help. – **Consider Professional Insight**: If the dreams persist and cause significant distress, talking to a therapist or dream analyst could provide deeper understanding. Remember, dreams are often symbolic and not literal. The fact that you’re having these dreams doesn’t mean your marriage is in trouble—it might simply be your mind processing emotions or fears in a safe, subconscious space. by OpenAi – ChatGPT 4 Dreams about divorce or separation, even during a happy marriage, can feel really unsettling. It’s important to remember that dream imagery often isn’t a literal reflection of reality but rather a symbolic expression of our subconscious mind. Here are a few thoughts on what might be happening: Underlying Fears or Anxieties: Even if things are going well in your marriage, there might be an underlying fear of loss, change, or uncertainty. Sometimes our subconscious mind uses dramatic imagery like divorce to express these anxieties. Symbolic Representation: Divorce in a dream might not literally mean the end of your relationship. It could symbolize a transformation or change—perhaps related to personal growth, evolving roles within your relationship, or even changes in life circumstances that you’re processing. Stress or Life Transitions: Recurring dreams, even pleasant ones, can sometimes be triggered by external stressors or significant life events. Reflect on whether there have been any recent changes, pressures, or decisions in your life that might be stirring up these feelings subconsciously. Personal Reflection: Sometimes, these dreams invite you to explore your inner feelings about independence, identity, or commitment. It might be worth considering if there’s an aspect of your personal life or self-image that’s undergoing change or if there’s an unspoken fear of losing something important—even if logically you know your relationship is secure. Ultimately, dreams are highly personal, and their meanings can vary widely from one person to another. If these dreams continue to bother you, discussing them with a trusted therapist or counselor might help uncover deeper insights and provide reassurance. Remember, the presence of such dreams doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with your marriage; they might simply be a natural part of processing complex emotions.

Note: Today I wrote in my page “Gratitude” this: February 14, 2025. Today, I express my deepest gratitude to the Creator for guiding and strengthening me over the past 11 years as I walk this path with my beloved JEAN. This day has a special place in my heart: Valentine’s Day, the day that marked the beginning of our relationship. That fateful February 14th marked the beginning of a love story that deepens with each passing day. We have faced difficult times, some of which were incredibly difficult, but we stayed on the path that was meant for us; Path written by THE CREATOR. Thank you, God, for blessing me with the joy of sharing my life with Jean, Alessandro and Jhonrick. Although I deeply miss Gian Kenzo, I respect and accept God’s plan for us.

(FEB 8-2025) ~ by Copilot A prophecy and a conspiracy theory share some common ground in terms of their speculative nature and the belief systems they often evoke. Here’s a brief comparison: Common Ground 1. Speculation Both prophecies and conspiracy theories involve speculation about future events or hidden truths. They are often based on interpretations of available information, sometimes without concrete evidence. 2. Belief Systems: They both can be tied to strong belief systems. Prophecies often stem from religious or spiritual beliefs, while conspiracy theories can arise from political, social, or cultural beliefs. 3. Prediction: Prophecies predict future events, often with a sense of inevitability or divine intervention. Conspiracy theories, while they do not necessarily predict the future, suggest hidden plans or secrets that can affect future outcomes. 4. Interpretation: Both rely heavily on interpretation of data, symbols, or events. In prophecies, interpretations can be of sacred texts or visions. In conspiracy theories, interpretations can be of information, news, and events. Differences 1. Basis: Prophecies are often rooted in religious or spiritual contexts, claimed to be divinely inspired. Conspiracy theories are typically based on an interpretation of real-world events, often questioning official narratives. 2. Purpose: The purpose of a prophecy is often to provide guidance, warning, or insight. Conspiracy theories aim to uncover hidden truths, challenge authority, or explain complex events with simplified, hidden narratives. Both prophecies and conspiracy theories can influence individuals and groups, often leading to strong convictions or actions based on these beliefs. ~ by Perplexity Conspiracy theories and prophecies both offer explanations of events through a narrative of good versus evil, often suggesting that nothing happens by accident and everything is interconnected[1]. They both simplify complex issues into simple causes and provide a sense of certainty about the present and future[1]. Similarities between conspiracy theories and prophecies: Narrative Structure: Both present a cosmic conflict between good and evil, occurring in visible and invisible realms[1]. Explanatory Power: They both promise to explain societal ills, typically through interconnected hypotheses[1]. Simplification: Both simplify complex issues into simple causes[1]. Psychological comfort: Conspiracy theories, like religious beliefs, can help people feel more in control by attributing random events to human actions or predetermined plans[3]. Elements of intrigue:They both contain a shred of interesting fact combined with partial evidence, rumor, and half-truths to make the theory believable[7].

Here are some key points of common ground: 1. Predictive Nature: Both prophecies and conspiracy theories often involve predictions about future events. Prophecies typically come from a religious or spiritual context, while conspiracy theories speculate about future events based on perceived hidden plots or agendas. 2. Uncertainty and Mystery: Both thrive on uncertainty and the unknown. Prophecies often involve mysterious or divine revelations, while conspiracy theories rely on hidden information or secretive actions by powerful groups. 3. Narrative Structure: Both often present a compelling narrative that explains complex events in a way that is easy to understand and emotionally engaging. This narrative can provide a sense of order or meaning to chaotic or random events. 4. Belief and Faith: Both require a level of belief or faith from their followers. Prophecies require faith in a divine or supernatural source, while conspiracy theories require belief in the existence of hidden forces or agendas. 5. Social and Psychological Functions: Both can serve social and psychological functions, such as providing a sense of control, understanding, or belonging. They can also offer explanations for events that are otherwise difficult to comprehend. 6. Skepticism of Authority: Both often involve a skepticism of established authorities or mainstream narratives. Prophecies may challenge religious or secular authorities, while conspiracy theories often distrust government, media, or scientific institutions. 7. Symbolism and Interpretation: Both rely heavily on symbolism and interpretation. Prophecies often use symbolic language that requires interpretation, while conspiracy theories interpret events, symbols, and actions as evidence of a hidden plot. 8. Community and Identity: Both can create a sense of community and identity among believers. Followers of a prophecy or a conspiracy theory may feel a sense of belonging and shared purpose with others who believe the same thing. While prophecies and conspiracy theories can be compelling and influential, it’s important to approach them critically and consider the evidence and sources behind them.

New players emerge, pricing changes, and feature sets are constantly updated. However, I can give you some strategies and names to watch for: Strategies for Finding the Best & Cheapest: Look for Freemium Models: Many AI video generators offer a free tier with limitations (watermarks, low resolution, limited usage). This allows you to test the platform and its capabilities before committing to a paid plan. This is a great way to find a cheap option that suits your needs. Consider Your Needs: Do you need high-resolution videos? Complex animations? Specific styles? Your requirements will greatly impact the cost. A simple video generator might suffice, avoiding expensive, feature-rich options. Watch for Sales and Promotions: Keep an eye on software review websites, newsletters, and the websites of the AI video generators themselves for discounts and special offers. Compare Feature Sets and Pricing: Don’t just look at the price tag. Compare the features offered by different platforms. A slightly more expensive option might offer better value if it has features that save you time and effort. Check Reviews: Read reviews from other users to gauge the quality of the videos produced, the ease of use, and the customer support provided by different platforms. Promising Candidates (but always check their current pricing and features): It’s impossible to definitively say which will be cheapest and best, as this is subjective and changes. However, these are frequently mentioned and offer various pricing tiers: Pictory AI: Known for its ease of use in creating videos from text or existing content. Likely to have a freemium model. Steve.AI: Focuses on making professional-looking videos quickly. Often compared to Pictory and may have competitive pricing. Synthesia: A popular choice for creating videos with AI avatars. Generally on the higher end of the pricing spectrum, but offers advanced features. Might have competitive pricing options for specific use cases. Kapwing: A versatile video editor with AI features. While not solely an AI video generator, its AI capabilities are powerful and it could be a cost-effective option depending on your needs. RunwayML: Offers a wide range of AI tools for video editing and generation, but it tends to be more expensive and geared towards professionals. Important Note: The “cheapest” option isn’t always the best. Consider the time you’ll save, the quality of the output, and the overall value you get for your money. A slightly more expensive option might save you significant time and frustration in the long run. Before making a decision, I strongly recommend visiting the websites of these platforms, checking their current pricing plans, and testing any free trials or freemium options available.
