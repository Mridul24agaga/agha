With the emergence of AI-powered tools, video creation and editing have seen groundbreaking advancements in the past few years. From increasing efficiency to improving creativity, AI-powered tools are changing the way we create and edit videos. In this blog post, we will present the top 10 AI tools that are revolutionizing video creation and editing. 1) Adobe Sensei Adobe Sensei is an AI platform that can analyze and generate various data sets to improve the efficiency of video editing. For instance, it can quickly identify specific parts of the video that require color correction, audio adjustment, or transitions. Adobe Sensei also allows for the automatic placement of text and captions. For instance, when working with lengthy video footage, Adobe Sensei can automatically identify and categorize scenes, allowing editors to easily locate specific sections without having to manually sift through hours of content. It can also recognize patterns and anomalies within the video, highlighting areas that may need additional enhancements or edits. This feature significantly cuts down post-production time, enabling creators to focus more on storytelling and less on technical aspects. Ease of Use: 4/5 2) Magisto Magisto is an AI-powered video editing tool that can automatically create promotional videos by using an algorithm to analyze raw footage. It can even add music, effects, and pre-defined themes with ease. Video editors can also make adjustments to individual frames. Magisto can turn a series of short, disparate video clips into a cohesive and engaging mini-movie. Simply upload your raw footage, choose a style or theme, and Magisto’s AI will analyze your footage to identify the best clips. It then seamlessly stitches these together, incorporating transitions and applying color correction as necessary. For businesses, Magisto is equipped to generate compelling marketing videos. By uploading product images and raw video footage, users can select from a library of commercially licensed songs and pre-designed styles. The AI then creates a video that highlights the product features, complete with music and text overlays to convey key messages. This powerful tool makes it possible for even small businesses to create high-quality promotional content quickly and inexpensively. Ease of Use: 4.5/5 3) Animoto Animoto is another versatile AI tool that can create professional-quality videos by adding motion graphics, music, and effects. It comes with several stylish templates that editors can choose from to create a unique video. Animoto’s AI algorithms automate the processes of cropping, resizing, and aligning videos for different social media platforms. Animoto can be utilized in various business contexts to bring your media to life. For instance, a real estate agent might leverage Animoto to develop a virtual tour of a property, incorporating photos and clips of the home, along with text overlays detailing the property’s key features. Non-profit organizations could use Animoto to create impactful story-driven videos that highlight their cause and the people they help, effectively appealing to potential donors. Teachers and educators can use Animoto to breathe life into their teaching materials, creating instructional videos and presentations with engaging visuals and audio. Additionally, small businesses can use Animoto to create product demos or customer testimonials, creating a more engaging shopping experience on their e-commerce sites. With Animoto, the possibilities for creating compelling video content are myriad. Ease of Use: 4.7/5 4) Filmora X Filmora X is an AI-powered video editing software known for its powerful plugins and cutting-edge features. It has an intuitive interface that allows even beginners to create pro-quality videos. The AI-powered tools allow for the smooth rendering of video in 4K, and it also includes motion tracking, audio separation, and noise reduction. Filmora X is not merely a tool for basic video editing but a comprehensive suite for cinematic creativity. Its capabilities extend beyond the norm, with features like key-framing, color matching, and audio ducking giving editors a vast range of options to customize their videos. The software’s green screen capabilities allow for the seamless incorporation of special effects, crafting a visual experience that captivates viewers. For instance, a travel vlogger could utilize Filmora X’s green screen to transport their audience to the exotic locations they are discussing, providing a rich, immersive viewer experience. The audio separation feature allows a user to extract the audio layer from a video effortlessly, making it easier to edit voiceovers or ambient noise separately. This could serve as a boon for documentary filmmakers who often have to deal with noisy on-location audio and need an easy way to isolate dialogue. With Filmora X, the possibilities for creating visually stunning and sonically crisp content are virtually limitless. Ease of Use: 4.8/5 5) Adobe Premiere Pro Adobe Premiere Pro is a popular video editor that has added AI capabilities through Adobe Sensei. Premiere Pro AI tools allow for the automatic adjustment of brightness, contrast, and saturation levels for each frame of your video. It can also analyze the footage and sync audio with ease. Adobe Premiere Pro’s AI capabilities are truly a game-changer in video editing. Not only does it automate basic adjustments such as brightness, contrast, and saturation levels, but it also delves into intricate, complex tasks which can drastically reduce post-production time. One such feature is Auto Reframe, which automatically tracks the most important content and quickly adjusts aspect ratios. This can be particularly handy when creating different versions of a video for various social media platforms. Furthermore, Premiere Pro offers Morph Cut, a tool that smooths out jump cuts in talking head shots, making the edits almost invisible and giving the impression of a seamless, continuous shot. This feature can save lots of time for editors who work on interviews or vlogs, providing a more polished finish. Lastly, it’s worth mentioning Premiere Pro’s Scene Edit Detection. This tool automatically identifies edits in previously cut videos, adding cut or dissolve transitions at each edit point. This could be a lifesaver when working with a rendered file, where the original cuts have been lost. These unique features elevate Adobe Premiere Pro from a standard video editor to an advanced, AI-powered editing suite. Ease of Use 3.5/5 6) Lumen5 Lumen5 is an AI-powered tool that automatically converts text into videos. Simply type in the text, and Lumen5 will use its AI algorithms to select appropriate images, music, fonts and create a compelling video. Even better, you can edit the video using drag-and-drop panels if you want to make modifications. For instance, a digital marketing agency might use Lumen5 to quickly transform a blog post into a video for a client’s social media campaign. The AI could select vibrant images of the product, uplifting music, and a modern font to create an engaging video. On the other hand, a vlogger might use Adobe Premiere Pro’s Auto Reframe feature to easily adapt a landscape travel video for Instagram’s vertical format. The AI would focus on the most visually interesting parts of the scenes, ensuring that none of the magic is lost in the aspect ratio adjustment. Similarly, a documentary filmmaker could use the Scene Edit Detection tool when faced with a previously edited interview where the original cuts were lost. The tool could identify where cuts were made and add transitions, saving the filmmaker the tedious task of manual detection. Ease of Use: 4/5 7) Vidnami Vidnami is an all-in-one video creation tool that uses AI to produce sleek and professional videos. This tool allows you to start with a script, and it will automatically cut intriguing footage, sync the audio precisely, and apply transitions. Vidnami offers a wealth of images and video clips that can be used to enhance the video’s production value, giving the finished product a professional touch. Vidnami’s interesting features include its AutoVoice technology, which can convert your scripts into a voiceover, assisting those who might be microphone-shy. The tool’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) carefully scans the text of your script and generates a storyboard, a process that includes choosing relevant images or video clips. Vidnami also incorporates the ability to add soundtracks, with a wide selection of royalty-free music that can be layered over your video to create an immersive audiovisual experience. Its user-friendly interface makes it easy for beginners to navigate, making professional video creation accessible to all. Ease of Use: 4.5/5 8) Shotcut Shotcut is a free, open-source video editing tool that uses AI to enable smooth video playback. The AI-powered filter can remove jittering and stabilize shaky footage. It also supports various video formats and has various plug-ins available. Shotcut’s most unique feature lies in its AI-powered filter, an impressive tool that can stabilize shaky footage. This feature is especially valuable for amateur filmmakers who shoot handheld footage and find it challenging to maintain a steady camera. By using AI to analyze the footage, identify the shaky parts, and then smooth them out, Shotcut significantly enhances the overall quality of the video, making it more professional and pleasing to the eye. This feature sets Shotcut apart from many other video editing tools, proving its value in the realm of video production. Ease of Use: 4/5 9) Lightworks Lightworks is an AI-powered video editor that supports advanced audio and video editing capabilities.

An AI video tool is software that uses artificial intelligence to assist in creating, editing, or refining video content. These tools use advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to automate complex tasks, improve efficiency, and improve the overall quality of video production. AI video generator capabilities often include automatic editing, scene detection, video summarization, special effects, and personalized content recommendations, making video production more accessible for users with varying levels of expertise. Benefits of using an AI Video tool for content creation According to a recent report, about 92% of video marketers think video content results in increased return on investment (ROI). AI video tools transform video production by facilitating faster turnaround times, reducing production costs, and increasing experimentation and innovation. Let’s explore the key benefits of AI video generators for content creators. 1. Increased efficiency AI automates repetitive tasks like editing out pauses and applying effects, reducing production time. Videos that once took days can be completed in hours or even minutes, allowing for faster content creation. 2. Effortless personalization AI can analyze data to tailor videos to individual viewers. Imagine educational content that adjusts difficulty based on a student’s progress or marketing campaigns with product recommendations specific to a customer’s browsing habits. Personalization allows deeper engagement and increases the impact of your message. 3. Accessibility for all AI video generators with user-friendly interfaces empower non-technical creators to produce high-quality videos. Pre-built templates and drag-and-drop functionality make video creation intuitive and accessible, democratizing the content creation process. 4. Global reach with localization AI can translate scripts and generate captions, breaking down language barriers and expanding your video’s reach to a worldwide audience. This allows you to cater to international markets and maximize the potential of your content. 5. Content experimentation at scale AI facilitates A/B testing of different video elements, enabling data-driven decisions about what resonates best with your audience. This allows you to experiment with various video parts, like introductions or calls to action, to optimize your content marketing for maximum engagement. Potential challenges of using AI video tools for content creation While AI video tools offer compelling benefits, it’s essential to understand the potential challenges of this evolving technology. Let’s discuss some key considerations when using AI video generators for content creation. 1. Ethical considerations and bias AI algorithms are trained on existing data, which can perpetuate societal biases. Be aware of potential biases in the AI’s output, such as gender or racial stereotypes, and actively mitigate them to ensure fair and inclusive content creation. 2. Copyright concerns AI tools that generate content based on existing data can raise copyright issues. Understand the legalities of using copyrighted material within your AI-generated videos and ensure proper attribution where necessary. Also, consider AI privacy and consider the ethical implications of using AI in your creations to avoid stepping into legal gray areas. 3. Creative control and nuance While AI excels at automation, capturing the human touch of storytelling and emotional resonance can be challenging. Nuances in humor, sarcasm, or cultural references may be missed by AI, requiring creators to carefully curate the creative direction and emotional tone of their videos. 4. Quality concerns AI-generated videos often struggle with maintaining consistency and realism, particularly in complex scenes or with nuanced human expressions. Additionally, AI systems are susceptible to hallucinations, fabricating details or producing false information.

We made this guide to help you navigate the crowded field and find the tool that suits your needs. We've carefully selected and reviewed seven top contenders, focusing on what they offer, where they excel, and where they might fall short. So, if you've ever wondered, \"What is the best AI video generator?\" you're in the right place. What is an AI video generator? In the simplest of terms, an AI video generator is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to automate the video creation process. Instead of manually editing clips, adding effects, and syncing audio, these tools handle the heavy lifting for you. You just input text, images, or other media, and AI turns that into a complete video through text to video generation. By using AI, these tools automatically select the best visuals, create smooth transitions, and even generate voiceovers with realistic AI avatars. This means you can focus more on crafting your message and less on getting bogged down in the technical details. How do AI video generators work? AI video generators work by using advanced algorithms to analyze and process your input, whether it’s text, images, or other media. When you provide the content, the AI interprets it and makes decisions about how to structure the video. This includes selecting visuals, syncing audio, and applying effects—all in a matter of minutes. ✨ From Photo AI image to video with @LumaLabsAI's video model that came out today called Dream Machine It's absolutely state of the art and the best video model available right now I think It's able to highly accurately predict 3d surroundings from just a photo, I think up… pic.twitter.com/KDetDBdGIS — @levelsio (@levelsio) June 13, 2024 At the core of these tools is machine learning, which allows the AI to improve over time. The more data it processes, the better it becomes at making creative decisions that result in high-quality videos. For example, if you input a script, the AI video tool can generate corresponding scenes, choose relevant images or video clips, and even create a voiceover. The process is surprisingly intuitive. You simply provide the material, and the AI organizes it into a cohesive video that aligns with your vision.

What really stands out is that you don't need precise details for motion areas, Dream Machine still manages to capture motion concepts effectively. Itfollows the laws of physics, ensuring that every shot feels grounded and realistic. Plus, it’s super fast! As their website mentions, Dream Machine can currently produce 120 frames in 120 seconds, which is not too shabby to say the least. Where Dream Machine could improve Although Dream Machine is generally fast, some users have experienced slower processing times when working on intricate projects with a lot of elements. The discard rate can be around 98% with Reddit users pointing that most of the videos generated are unusable because of random elements, incorrect motion, or distortion. Pricing options: Free Plan ($0.00) Lite Plan ($7.99/month) Standard Plan ($23.99/month) Plus Plan ($51.99/month) Pro Plan ($79.99/month) 3.

Learn how with today's Runway Academy: https://t.co/EUbxc4aA0D pic.twitter.com/qredD7vsXu — Runway (@runwayml) January 23, 2024 Why we like Runway: Most dynamic Runway's Gen-3 Alpha is one of the most impressive AI video generators we’ve come across. Not only is it a powerful tool for video that makes content creation seem limitless, but it has a shockingly friendly interface and is easy to use. With the Multi Motion Brush, you can select up to five areas with independent motion and control across 3 directional axis (x, y, z) for more precise and expressive generations. Another highlight is how well it handles human-like characters. The AI generates lifelike figures with natural expressions and gestures, adding a level of realism that’s hard to beat. We aren't exaggerating when we say you'll likely be blown away by what you generate with this tool. The videos are truly cinematic and offer an exciting glimpse into the future of creativity. Where Runway could improve Runway is an extraordinary tool, so it is hard to say where it can improve. Of course, with such a dynamic AI video generator comes cost, which might be the only thing holding back casual users or if you're on a budget. Plus, it is true that sometimes the final results might look a little \"wonky,\" but overall the quality is top-tier.

One of the standout features is its customizable templates, which allow users to tweak layouts, colors, and visual styles without advanced editing skills. So regardless of what kind of content you ar making, whether it's onboarding video or a marketing campaign, Hailuo AI makes sure your content looks tailored, not cookie-cutter. Where Hailuo AI Could Improve While the AI does a great job with automation, some users may find the customization options a bit limited. For example, while templates are helpful, they don’t always allow for fine-grained control over pacing and scene composition. Additionally, industries needing highly specific branding—like film production or high-end advertising—might need more flexibility in motion effects and camera angles. Pricing options: Standard plan ($14.90 per month) Unlimited plan ($94.90 per month) 5.

Thanks to its 3D face and body reconstruction technology, characters move fluidly and show natural emotions—all from a single image. Its physics engine also shines, allowing for believable object interactions and environments that behave like real-world scenes. Whether you're creating short films, virtual influencers, or AI-generated marketing content, Kling delivers a level of realism that’s hard to match. Where Kling AI could improve While Kling is impressive, it’s not perfect. Some users report slow processing times, especially for highly detailed scenes. Occasionally, minor inconsistencies appear, like hand distortions or subtle motion glitches. More control over camera angles and fine-tuning details would make it even stronger for professional creators.

It’s a company that knows its lane, and we can certainly appreciate its dedication to being the master of one instead of the jack of all AI video trades. Where revid AI could improve The main drawback with revid AI is that it is niche. This is fine if you need this specific type of content, but it may be lacking if you're searching for a more powerful tool. Pricing options Hobby ($49/month) Growth (Launch offer $49/month) Ultra ($199/month) 7. Colossyan Whether you're making screen recordings for employee training, video marketing content for social media platforms, or educational videos for compliance training, Colossyan offers features that simplify video making for established businesses. Why we like Colossyan: Best for large businesses Colossyan is awesome with AI video editing, offering tools like prompt to video and AI script assistants that help you create excellent videos without needing tons of experience. While it is definitely on the more corporate side of video creation, we saw this tool streamline the creation process and make it easy to produce high-quality generated videos super fast and efficiently. Plus, Colossyan’s extensive library of AI avatars and multilingual support make it a nice choice for large companies and diverse clients. Where Colossyan could improve While Colossyan has a ton of cool features, it may require a bit of a learning curve for those new to AI video tools. The sheer number of options, from AI avatars to multiple export formats, can be overwhelming for beginners. Pricing options Starter Plan ($19/month, annually) Pro Plan ($61/month, billed annually) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 8. HeyGen HeyGen is one of the more impressive platforms we tested. A big reason for this is because it is hassle-free and easy to use, so jumping in was a simple process. More specifically, HeyGen is one of the best when it comes to generating AI avatars. The process of creating a HeyGen avatar boils down to three steps: choosing or creating an avatar, recording or choosing a voice to go with it, selecting a video template, then letting HeyGen put it all together in a matter of minutes. Why we like HeyGen: Most intriguing video generator One of the coolest features of HeyGen is its AI avatars, which are constantly evolving. The platform frequently updates these avatars to include enhanced visual details, expanded speech abilities, and more lifelike animations. Another great feature is the change videos to multiple langauges. HeyGen allows you to create videos in over forty languages from your original video, letting you reach audiences from all parts of the world. Where HeyGen could improve While HeyGen offers a lot of flexibility, the pricing for the Team plan might be higher for smaller teams or individual creators. Additionally, the Free plan, although great for beginners, limits users to just 3 videos per month, which may not be enough for those who need to produce content regularly. Pricing options Free Plan ($0) Creator Plan ($24/mo) Team Plan ($69/seat/mo) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 9. Haiper AI After diving into Haiper AI, we quickly realized it’s a promising tool for anyone looking to explore the world of AI-driven video creation. One of the first things that stood out to us is how Haiper AI makes the video creation process both accessible and efficient, even for those just starting. With just 3 images, @escelce transported us through 3 different universes, holy cow! #KeyframeConditioning #AIvideo #MadeWithHaiper https://t.co/6FwlLObhIK pic.twitter.com/JZdJOq3QMb — Haiper AI (@HaiperGenAI) August 19, 2024 Why we like Haiper AI: Best for beginners What we appreciated most about Haiper AI is its flexibility and how user friendly it was. The platform allows for up to 10 creations per day on the Free plan, which is generous for a no-cost option. That, on top of the text-to-speech feature helps make Haiper a solid tool. For those who need more, the Explorer and Pro plans offer expanded features that cater to different levels of use. Where Haiper AI could improve One of the primary limitations is that the Free plan doesn’t allow for commercial use or watermark-free videos. This might be a dealbreaker for users who need to produce content for business purposes but aren’t ready to invest in a paid plan. Pricing options Free Plan (Beta, $0/month): Explorer Plan (Beta, $8/month, billed yearly) Pro Plan (Beta, $24/month, billed yearly) Enterprise APIs (Custom Pricing) ‍ 10. Synthesia Synthesia is a game-changer for simplifying the process of making (sometimes scarily) realistic AI avatars. With simple text-based prompts, Synthesia turns your script into a polished, video ready project featuring life-like avatars. Why we like Synthesia: Excellent for avatars Even if you're new to video Synthesia has an intuitive interface that makes creating and editing your video feel straightforward. You simply choose an avatar, input your text prompts, and watch as the AI works its magic, transforming your words into engaging content. Plus, the AI video editor allows you to tweak and refine your video, so you can take the time to make those small changes that really make your vision come to life. So whether it is explainer videos, content creation for blog posts, or other marketing projects, Synthesia is excellent for businesses who want to make videos for their products or services. Where Synthesia could improve One of the main limitations is the degree of control available for the AI avatars. The avatars do look polished, but the options for appearance and expressions are somewhat limited compared to more advanced tools. Pricing Options Free Plan (€0/mo) Starter Plan (€20/mo) Creator Plan (€59/mo) Enterprise Plan (custom pricing) ‍ ‍ Wrapping up: The future of AI Video Tools AI in video and avatar creation has come a long way. From quirky results to making videos you’d swear were real, AI's gotten pretty good at this stuff. But the trick isn’t just making videos look real—it’s about getting them to move right, too. With tools like Luma Labs’ Dream Machine or Synthesia, we see how far AI can go in understanding motion and realistic avatars. These advancements are opening doors to new ways to create and tell stories, and brands like Mcdonald's Japan aren't afraid to test it out. These tools aren't here to replace humans in the creative process; but to make it possible to do more, to be even more innovative, without needing blockbuster budgets. Thanks to AI, we’re moving toward a future where anyone can produce a mini-movie or use avatars for product demos. It’s exciting to think about how these tools will help us all be more creative and bring our wildest ideas to life. So, go ahead and play around with these AI video generators. See how they can improve your video project workflow or let you experiment with digital avatars. They're here to help, not to take over.

Make a Video Updated: 12/10/24 Published: 06/16/23 Videos are integral to any marketing campaign; however, they can be tedious and difficult to create if you aren’t savvy with editing or are short on time. Fortunately, you can leverage many AI video generators to streamline your production and create content that engages your audience. But what’s the best AI video generator for your tasks? This article will explore 12 different AI video generators, their features, and how you can best use them in your next video marketing campaign. Time to press play on easier video creation. Table of Contents Can AI make videos? How to Make AI Videos Transforming Text to Video With AI What makes a great AI video generator? Best AI Video Generators Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video Can AI make videos? Yes, AI can make videos. AI video generators can instantly produce basic presentation slides with text, B-roll, and background music, all the way up to advanced videos of lifelike AI avatars “speaking” to you. AI’s impressive — but it’s not perfect. What works well with AI video generators: Video scripts. Being able to generate video scripts in a few seconds is incredible and saves so much time. Stock imagery, B-roll, and background music. Even though it still requires editing, having multimedia pulled automatically for you by the video generator makes it feel like you have an assistant. Video editing. The video editing capabilities are incredible and often beginner-friendly, which is a huge leap in the video editing world. What isn’t working (yet): Believability. The realistic AI avatars are incredibly advanced, but the mannerisms and articulation make it obvious that they're, well, AI. Pacing. Much research has been done on how quickly a video moves from scene to scene to hold viewers’ attention, and I found that not all generators factored this into their algorithms. Decision overload. The number of video templates, AI avatars, and effects available can overwhelm the editing process. AI is rapidly advancing, and some of these quirks will soon be passé. How to Make AI Videos The process for making an AI video will vary depending on the tool or platform you're using. Some generators work by analyzing and creating a video based on the script you uploaded, while others will follow a prompt typed in by the user. The key is to find a tool or generator with the features you need to create the kind of content you want. Transforming Text to Video With AI When ChatGPT catapulted to popularity in 2022, I don’t think the average marketers knew just how quickly AI video would follow. It needs to be used ethically to be useful to society, but when leveraged correctly, it’s an incredible tool. The most sought-after AI video feature is the text-to-video generator. This allows you to type in a sentence and, in a few seconds, be presented with an editable AI-generated video. I tested this feature using two different prompts: A vague prompt: “I’d like to educate viewers about AI-generated video.” A specific prompt: “I’d like to inspire beginner marketers to try AI video generation. The video should explain the benefits of AI video generators and should inspire viewers to try this new video tool.” I used HubSpot’s free AI video generator Clip Creator, and here’s what I saw. They were both high-quality videos. Both videos had appropriate stock images and music tailored to human behavior. The content was very similar for both videos. After testing many AI generators, I’ve found that a marketer’s time is better spent editing rather than making their prompt more specific. No matter how perfect your prompt feels, the end result will still require edits.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now What makes a great AI video generator? So, how does one evaluate all of the different software on the market? The best AI video tools all have a mix of these different features. Intuitive User Interface While most platforms list a long list of fancy AI features, users need an easy-to-use AI studio first and foremost. This enables a quick editing process. AI Scripts Automatically-generated video scripts save an incredible amount of time when producing video content. They turn written content (such as a blog post, email, etc.) or a prompt into spoken language. Sometimes, they even use an AI narrator to read it out loud for you. Not all software can generate video scripts, but it’s an enormous time saver. To be fair to the software that doesn’t offer this, it’s replaceable with a few clicks in ChatGPT. After trying more than a dozen AI video generators, I found the AI scripts were one of the features that made the greatest difference, along with the next feature. Factoring in Human Behavior Some software have tailored their AI to match user behavior, and some haven’t. For example, most people prefer videos with a brisk pace and visuals that don’t stay on the screen too long. In the video world, this is referred to as “pacing.” Not all software is tailored for this, and as a result, it will produce slow, lengthy slides that feel like a bad PowerPoint presentation. This isn’t a detail that software companies list on their “features” page, but it’s something that’s apparent based on the first draft of the video that the software gives you. Template Library Start from scratch? What is it, 2018? There’s no need to start from scratch with video anymore, as most platforms have built-in template libraries. Bonus points if these libraries include variation in: Intended audience. Aspect ratio. Project type. Editing Capabilities It’s normal for different software to offer different editing options, but most AI studios will cover the basics, such as: Text. Fonts. Music. Colors. Timing. Transitions. Animations. Stock footage. Different video styles. Pricing Tiers (or Free Plan) An AI video generator costs $0 to $50 a month (paid annually). All paid software includes a discount when purchasing an annual package, and the cost of month-to-month service is always higher. I know you’re on a budget — all of the suggested AI tools below are either free or include a free trial/demo. Multilingual Look for software that supports multiple languages if your business requires it. A chart comparing 11 AI Video Generators Chart comparing AI video generators Best AI Video Generators AI video generators have come extremely far in a short time. You can now make professional videos with the numerous text-to-video generation tools on the market. I’ve tried all the most popular AI video generators, so you don’t have to. Here’s what I found. 1. Clip Creator Source Clip Creator is the best AI video generator for beginners. It can be used by someone with no video experience and walks you through the video creation process painlessly. You start by answering a few basic questions (like video type), then provide a brief overview of the video you’d like to create. You can choose from video templates, which are oriented for both landscape videos and vertical videos. Then, Clip Creator uses AI to generate the text on your slides, plus the background imagery. You’re instantly given a video with editable text, stock images, background music, etc. The video creation workflow is very intuitive. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video My experience: I love how streamlined this AI video creator is. Instead of bombarding you with endless features, options, and pop-ups, Clip Creator starts simple and allows you to make any edits you need after it generates the video. Source Pros: Incredibly intuitive user interface, great customization options, and makes for a very fast and efficient AI video creator. Cons: Smaller template library than paid AI video generators, and no advanced features like realistic AI avatars. Best for: Video creation beginners and marketers on a budget. Most user-friendly interface and best free AI video generator. 2. Pictory Source Pictory is an excellent AI video generator for creators and marketers who don’t have experience creating videos. All you have to do is provide a script or article to guide your video content. For example, you can submit a blog post to the AI video creator, and Pictory will create a video based on the post that can be used for social media or your website. Furthermore, you can edit videos in minutes by using text. Pictory also includes a feature that creates shareable video highlight reels that can be used as a trailer or a short-form video for social media such as a Reel. Even better, Pictory can automatically caption and summarize your videos.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: I provided the same prompt for Pictory as I did for the Clip Creator video, and it initially generated much less content (only 1 slide). I went back and instead provided a URL of a blog post and tested the blog-to-video generator. This feature automatically creates video scripts based on a blog post, and using their realistic AI voices, I could have it automatically narrated too. The writing on every slide needed to be edited significantly to be useful, but I was impressed with the options. Pictory supports multiple languages (currently English, Spanish, French, and German) and has a huge library of AI voices. Source Prices for Pictory start at $19 per month, and users can try a 2-week free trial. Pros: Users have a lot of options for how to begin their AI-generated videos, and they can thoroughly customize the video output. Cons: The first draft of the automatically-generated videos needs heavy editing. It may be faster to let ChatGPT write a script for you and use that. Best for: Marketers and creators with limited video editing experience who want to convert content like blog posts or webinars into shareable video content. 3. Simplified Source The Simplified AI video generator transforms a long-form video into multiple AI-enhanced clips with just one click. This allows users to create videos from text and make an entirely new video using its accessible editing interface. Simplified simplifies the way we produce content by providing users with easy access to an expansive in-app library that hosts thousands of templates, all available for free. I like that it guarantees exceptional video quality and pairs this with an intuitive, user-friendly interface, ensuring that users can craft high-quality videos without sacrificing ease of use. Its comprehensive suite of features goes beyond basic editing options to include animation enhancements and multilingual translation capabilities, making it a versatile all-in-one tool for video creation. Users can save their brand settings in Simplified’s “brand book” is a great time-saving feature. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just starting, this platform equips you with everything you need to bring your vision to life. Brands like Bloomberg, DuckDuckGo, and Cashify use Simplified for their marketing needs. My experience: I prompted Simplified the same way I prompted the other video generators, and I was immediately asked to describe my target audience and provide my video topic. This was a nice step toward more personalized videos, but it required more user-generated input than Clip Creator, which had a multiple-choice intake process. If you stick to the free plan, it’s time-consuming to sift through all the features to see what’s free to use. Source Prices for Simplified include a forever-free plan. Paid plans start from $15.20 a month and are billed annually. Pros: If you pay for this AI video creator, you have many creation options at your disposal that not all other platforms offer (AI meme creation, AI image generation, AI carousel maker, etc.). Cons: Not the best free AI video generator; other platforms are more generous with their features. You’re not able to test the text-to-video generator without joining a paid plan, as you’re about to do with other features. Best for: Creators who want to create, edit, and schedule videos for all social media platforms. 4. Movavi Video Editor Source Rather than generating AI videos from scratch, the Movavi Video Editor uses AI to make video editing easier. Video editing can be a time-consuming chore; for many, it’s the less enjoyable side of content creation. However, with Movavi Video Editor’s nonlinear AI technique, you’re not just replicating traditional tool functions but also enhancing your videos through advanced AI video editing. With AI background removal, you can cut out and replace backgrounds, adding a new dimension to your visuals. Plus, the AI noise removal feature enhances audio quality by automatically eliminating unwanted sounds, ensuring your videos are of the highest standard. Source The app also offers a host of advanced options like PiP, chroma-key, titles, keyframing, motion tracking, and more. Following the free 7-day trial, paid plans start at $49.95 per year. Pros: The presence of built-in training rapidly familiarizes you with the software, and it has features that many other AI video editors don’t. Cons: This AI video editor brings high-level tools (like color correction) to marketers, but total video newbies may be overwhelmed with some of the more advanced features. Best for: Creators and marketers who already have video footage and want help editing videos to be more engaging (or who just need to speed up the editing process). 5. Fotor AI Video Generator Source Fotor is an image and video editing platform that integrates various AI features, known for its creativity, intelligence, flexibility, and convenience. Its AI video generator fully utilizes advancements in AI technology, making video creation more efficient and enjoyable. Video creation is often a complex and professional process, but Fotor simplifies the steps. You just need to describe your creative ideas in text form and choose your desired style. AI will automatically analyze and generate a video you’ll be satisfied with. You can also upload images and add descriptions to generate a video. Whether you're an amateur video maker, a professional creator, or someone learning video production with no skills, AI will help you enjoy the efficiency and fun of video creation. Inspiration is important for video creators. Fotor AI video generator provides preset prompts and images, helping creators find more inspiration for their videos. My experience: Fotor’s interface is very user-friendly and simple. you can quickly find the features you need without any distracting ads or clutter. It also provides detailed step-by-step instructions, making it easy for new creators to get started. While creating videos, its preset text descriptions and high-quality images inspired me creatively. They also saved me time and greatly boosted my production efficiency. Source What I found most convenient was that after generating a video, I could perform basic edits directly in Fotor and I could also use their rich AI video tools, like one-click enhancement and beautification, background removal, and object elimination. Pros: The AI video generator supports creating videos in various styles, including Photography, Cinematic, Digital Art, Anime, Neopunk, Game Art, Illustration Art, and more. Catering to various creative ideas and needs. Cons: AI may not always fully understand textual descriptions or emotions and feelings, so some videos may not appear as realistic. Best for: Professional video creators, video creation beginners, social media video influencers, and users who enjoy trying and testing trendy and interesting features. 6. AI Studio Source With AI Studio, users can create videos by uploading their script and using the text-to-speech feature. The platform will then generate a video in five minutes or less. You can manually type in the script or copy and paste it into the platform. From there, you just need to select the appropriate language and AI model and finish editing. AI Studio allows users to select a custom-made avatar that suits their brand.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: New users can input a 300-character script, and an AI avatar will read your script using the AI text-to-video generator. I found the AI models to be less convincing than others; the mouths sometimes moved between sentences, and I think all viewers could identify these as AI. However, since the advent of TikTok’s text-to-speech narration feature, the public has become more accustomed to artificial narration, and there are many situations where this type of AI would work well. Source Prices for AI Studio start at $30 per month. Pros: The platform’s intuitive features make it excellent for beginners with limited or no video creation experience. Cons: The AI Studio avatars are identifiable as being artificial. Best for: Marketing videos that need text-to-speech narration and have visuals for B-roll. 7. Veed.io Source With Veed.io, you can use custom text, colors, font, and music to create a unique video for your brand. One of its standout features is Auto Transcribe. You can upload your video, hit the Auto Transcribe button, and immediately download the script. Even better, there is no software to download, and the platform is easy to use for those without video editing experience. My experience: I entered my “Pinterest marketing for beginners” prompt, and Veed.io quickly generated a short vertical video. The AI video generator automatically provided the script, AI narration, background music, stock videos, and close captioning. The on-screen captions were really engaging, using color-changing text and emojis — perfect for social media. Source Veed.io is free to use for videos under 10 minutes. To access more features, prices start at $18 per month (when billed annually) and go all the way up to enterprise custom pricing. Pros: The pacing, on-screen captions, slang, and approach were very engaging. Cons: The stock video that was automatically inserted into the video was off-topic at times but can be easily edited. Best for: Short-form videos designed to hold attention on social media. 8. Synthesia Source Synthesia's AI video generator enables users to create professional videos without requiring cameras, actors, or studios. Users can generate videos featuring realistic AI avatars that deliver content in over 140 languages by simply inputting text. This makes it an ideal tool for efficiently and at scale creating training materials, sales and marketing content, and internal communications. My experience: Synthesia's intuitive interface and extensive customization options make video creation straightforward. The platform's diverse range of avatars and multilingual support allowed me to produce engaging content tailored to a global audience. The quality of the AI-generated avatars is impressive, closely mimicking human expressions and speech patterns. Synthesia offers a free plan that includes 3 minutes of video per month, 9 AI avatars, and access to AI voices in 140+ languages. Paid plans are available for users requiring more features. Pros: Synthesia simplifies video creation with its intuitive interface and realistic AI avatars. Its support for over 140 languages makes it an excellent tool for creating global content. Cons: The free plan has limited features and is suitable only for basic use. Best for: Businesses and individuals seeking to create professional training videos, marketing content, or internal communications featuring AI avatars, especially when targeting a multilingual audience. 9. Elai.io Source Elai is simple and requires no video editing skills. To use Elai, copy and paste a blog post URL or HTML text, choose a template from its library, and let the generator do the rest. This AI video maker is specialized in corporate learning. Once the video is complete, review it to make any changes before rendering and downloading it. My experience: I found that Elai's format is unique. Even though the AI avatar doesn’t pass as a real human, its small display size makes it feel less distracting. The avatar compliments these videos instead of dominating them. I also really like the audio options: you can upload an audio file of you speaking, and Elai will generate a realistic AI avatar to narrate the text. Source Elai has over 60 languages and 25 avatars to choose from. You can use Elai for free with a 1-minute credit. For more features, Elai’s plans start at $23 per month (billed annually). Pros: As a specialized AI video generator, this tool allows you to quickly create training videos for new hires or product onboarding videos. Cons: Being a platform specialized for educational videos, it would be more time-consuming to create general marketing videos. Best for: Generating videos at scale and creating training videos and product videos. 10. Colossyan Source Colossyan provides a diverse range of avatars who can recite your script in various languages. You can also customize your avatar’s outfit. Colossyan’s key features are auto translations, subtitles, and the ability to enhance messages via screen recording. My experience: The AI avatar options from Colossyan are advanced. You can add multiple AI avatars to a single video screen in the video creation workflow, starting a “conversation.” You can even customize the pauses between speakers. Source There’s a free trial, and the prices start at $19 per month (when billed annually). Pros: The advanced avatar options make this a highly customizable AI video generator. Cons: The sound of the AI narrators isn’t the most natural-sounding. Best for: Creating training videos and explainers for workplace learning. 11. FlexClip Source This AI video generator features hundreds of video templates, AI-generated subtitles, background remover, and a text-to-speech engine. And its intuitive interface makes it simple for creators at any skill level. My experience: I created my video by inputting a URL and letting FlexClip automatically pull content from my website. The AI generator took an enormous amount of work out of the video creation process, but still required editing. The pacing of the video was slower than other AI tools, but I was able to easily customize all elements of the video. Source After the free plan, pricing starts at $9.99 per month (when billed annually, which saves 50%). Pros: The basic plan's price point makes this a very budget-friendly AI video generator. It is also a great, straightforward option for beginners who don’t want to feel overwhelmed. Cons: The AI-generated first draft requires more editing than some of the other platforms. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. 12. Wave Video Source Wave Video is a popular choice among content creators thanks to its many tools, which include image and video assets, text overlay effects, audio, and captions. The platform also provides a variety of video formats for Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and website-based applications. Other key features are: Text-to-video AI. Video hosting. Voiceovers. Text-to-speech. Millions of stock assets. My experience: I tested Wave Video by inserting a blog post URL and letting the AI video generator populate text and graphics based on the content. The video background graphics, pacing, and text populated on the slides needed significant editing to be ready for viewers. I like how easy it is to change the video format and edit any of the content. Wave Video also has many live-stream video tools. Source Wave Video is free, with monthly plans starting at $16 (paid annually). Pros: The features of this software are very beginner-friendly, and the user interface doesn’t feel overwhelming. Cons: The stock images it pulled were lower quality than the other AI tools. The images were blurry and stayed on screen much too long before switching slides (video pacing needed editing). Best for: Livestream videos. Making the Most of AI Video How will AI-generated video help your brand? With just a few clicks, you can create amazing videos, which was unimaginable a few years ago.

that will make video content creation a whole lot faster and easier and I wish I had some of these way back in the day I've been creating videos professionally for over 15 years and I've been on YouTube for over eight years and in the last couple years as these new tools came about I pretty much started testing all of them out and this is the list of the seven tools that I use every single week now okay the first one I wanted to show you has saved me a ton of time this is called opes clip and opes clip what it does is you give it a long form YouTube link or any type of video link and it will basically clip it into short format videos for Tik Tok YouTube shorts Instagram reels so seven new AI tools you won't believe exist that's the video that I posted on YouTube already but it's a longer video now let me show you in a few seconds what opes clip did it created all these different short format videos directly from the transcript some have different variety of length this one is 10 seconds 1 minute 17 seconds all from the transcript and then once I have it here you see on the left side it gives a score to every single one so you start from Top This is 99 out of 100 so it had a strong hook it had a good flow the value and Trend was also very good there is a new Option inside a haen called generate looks and it's really interesting you could generate an AI Avatar using multiple photos now the interesting thing is my video looked nothing like this I was just in the corner like the video you're watching right now I was just down in this corner so it picked up on that it put me in the bottom half of the video if you wanted to edit it you could go to this edit clip panel and you have all these different options that you could actually use inside of the editor so if you wanted to you could change the different transitions you could Auto generate AI Boll Clips too you could see all these AI generate Boll got added automatically it's captioned the whole video for us extremely useful for repurposing any type of content that you're going to create for other platforms and make them into short viral content too next on the list is descript and this one is an AI powered audio and video editing software and this one I've been using for a very long time actually for four or five years now well before using chat GPT now all you have to do is upload any audio or video file the unedited version of that and even a podcast you drop an entire podcast into it and in a few seconds it's going to go ahead and transcribe automatically now once the transcription is done this allows and you want to edit videos or audio files by editing text so if I wanted to get rid of this entire section right here this whole paragraph if I just press delete it deletes that from the actual video or audio file so it will jump from here to there I could even do it with smaller section let's say just this one sentence I want to go ahead and delete it I could delete it and it's now gone from the video okay so that part is cool saves you a lot of time allows anybody that doesn't know how to edit video or audio to be able to do it using text but they have an AI Suite up here it's called Underlord this does require the paid subscription though but it lets you do a ton of things with AI for example you could click edit for clarity and it will literally remove filler WS any time you bladder any obvious Cuts automatically so this becomes an AI powered editor for you they have this option that will remove filler WS they have an option that removes retakes a lot of times if I'm recording a video like this and I make a mistake well it will just take out the worst take here automatically any gaps between WS if I have any pauses you want really tight edits and this also has one of the most powerful AI green screen options so let's say I didn't like my background in this video after I was done editing it well you have this option this green screen option you could click it I'm not obviously sitting in front of a green screen but this could actually remove this background and then I could add a different background right inside of here and look how clean and professional this looks like around my shoulders is incredible and then under stock you could do all kinds of different backgrounds over here you could do different visuals over here and I could just drop that here as a new track and it becomes my new background track now maybe this for what I was creating was a much more suitable background and you could drop your own you don't have to pick from the stock Library a huge timesaver the next one on my list is called spotter Studio the sponsor for today's video and this one is one of the best brainstorming tools I've ever seen but it's really a AI power Creative Suite I want to show you some of the options that I use every single day since I got access to it and all you have to do is link your YouTube channel to it so this is really designed for YouTube creators once you link your YouTube channel over here the first thing you could do is just right on top get bunch of ideas for your titles your thumbnails and the hook for your video so I'm going to type in the idea I have for this video top AI tools for YouTube creators right it's okay but it's not highly clickable I want to get some ideas I'm just going to press go right here and look at this one just right on top seven essential AI tools having listicle videos just outperform other type of videos that's why I made this one like this so and I picked seven that's a that's a great number usually for these type of videos and then you have a bunch of different options and then if you want to expand I could press continue and have this one expand out so they have this option that I actually like for rephrasing using the same one as the base one and then it's going to give me a bunch of new ideas based on that must try AI tools for YouTube creators I could add that seven in front of it that's probably going to be my title for this video or I could do an entire mood shift here and get Alternatives but in a different tone okay and if I like any of them I could go ahead and keep it I'm actually going to go back I like that this keeps the history of everything that you do within the same chat I'm going to go ahead and keep this one it's going to add it over here then I could go ahead and come up with a bunch of different thumbnail ideas too the thumbnail allows you to use the slider to go go in between your style of thumbnails and YouTube best practices I've been on YouTube for a long time so I think I use pretty much most of YouTube's best practices so I'll leave it right in the middle here and look at this because I point a lot on my thumbnails like if you go to my channel I'm pretty much right here I wear a gray hat most of the time I point to the title must try AI tools for YouTube and then I have bunch of little icons for the different tools this first one is probably going to be something that I'm going to go ahead and use for mine and this works like the title so you could get variations of that one and I could see different versions of these and this is not going to be my exact thumbnail right this is more for brainstorming and ideation I probably still use Photoshop to design it with my own picture over here and then if you go to the hook tab right over here this is going to help you come up with a hook for your video your first 10 seconds of the video and they have ton of other things like this calendar tab is one of my favorites where I could add new projects do my brainstorming ahead of time and then use this as my schedule calendar they have this outliers tab which is cool so if I go to what my audience also watches this shows other AI channels in the same niche as me and then it shows how well those videos are doing 1.7 times better in this video compared to his regular video so I know this is some trending tool that I might want to cover which obviously I covered Sora on this channel before and under my favorite you could actually Link in the settings the channels that you want to keep track of so Matt wolf Matt Burman futurepedia those are the channels I watch Pretty consistently and then I could see how well these are doing and then get brainstorm ideas directly by clicking this tab and get those ideas as well based on how well those videos are performing something you just can't do manually right I'm not going to go through hundreds of videos and see how well they're they're doing I need a tool like this to help me with that so spotter gave me a special link that gets you a 60-day free trial that I'll link below that's double the length of the free trial they have in the regular website and they're also doing a 25 ,000 giveaway right now to YouTube creators that use spotter studio and create a new project and that's also included as part of the 60-day free trial that I have linked below and I think once you start using it it's going to become your regular workflow so right now I'm 100% relying on this every time I brainstorm a new idea next on my list is 11 labs this is probably the best AI power text to speeech platform available right now let me jump into the app to show you how it works okay inside of 11 Labs all you have to do is pick text to speech and then typing your script or paste your script right over here now the reason why I really like 11 Labs is because a lot of people they want to be content creators but they don't want to be on camera all the time or they want to tell stories where you need different voices than just your own voice and these are very humanlike AI voices that you could go ahead and pick from The Voice library and then if you click on their voices you could listen to different ones I'll just show you a couple here later that same evening detective Carlson received this is a deep voice I have crossed oceans of time to find you I'll choose this one here that I really like and then you just go ahead and generate the speech from here New York was booming with skyscrapers like the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building beginning to Define its iconic Skyline now how incredible is that I just still can't believe sometimes when I listen to these These are AI generated voices and now with 11 Labs you could just press download right over here and you could download this audio file and use it anywhere you want and then you could even go to this dubbing Studio here and this one lets you I was using it about a year ago pretty frequently where you could dub any type of video into a different language so I was making videos in Spanish and in Hindi and in languages I just don't speak and then I was able to post those in some other channels or provide some people that wanted access to my videos in a different language now the next one I want to show you is called pictory this is an all-in-one video creation platform and this literally could turn a single text into a complete video and do everything including voice over and including your text captioning now pictory has a bunch of different options but text to video is one of the best ones right here I'll show you so I'm going to paste a script here that I made with chat GPT again about New York City in the 1920s and I could even use the voiceover I got from 11 Labs but this I think they have a partnership with 11 Labs so I think it might be already using the voiceover from there and then it's going to take care of everything in the step and then you could edit everything it makes now this literally makes you the whole video and it breaks it up into different scenes but one of the reasons why I really like it is it lets you switch everything out so a lot of these platforms are not going to do a great job the first time and just give you a finished video you could post but this makes it really easy so if I wanted to change scene two I mean just look at the caption right here I would definitely want to cut this in half I think that's way too much on screen and I could literally go scene by scene and do that and if I want to change the background I could select the background and I could go ahead and swap that out under the audio tab this voiceover tab you could generate voiceovers again directly from here and yeah it is from 11 Labs with premium voices so if you have access to that membership you could do that and you could change the formatting so if you wanted to do something for short form you could go ahead and change it directly from here these are for Tik Tok and shorts and things like that and then when you're done just go ahead and press download right on top now the next one on my list is called Adobe podcast directly from Adobe and the reason why I wanted to include this is because a lot of YouTube creators have figured out a lot of things about making good videos except for Quality audio and this literally takes pretty bad audio and makes it into studio quality audio this option right here and right over here you just drop in your audio and pretty quickly this analyzes the clip and it completely enhances it makes it much closer to Studio sound than what it sounded like before so if you don't have professional mics like this or if you're using your phone to record or like a GoPro to record I highly recommend you drop it into here enhance it very quickly make sure this is turned on and then just download it from here this is just on the web and really easy to use next on my list is called capcut this is a very popular video editing platform but they've added so many different AI tools that I think this fits in the AI powered category I could do any traditional editing down here just like any other video but let me show you some of these AI tools that are used pretty frequently let me go to this text tab right over here and they have this autoc caption it transcribes the video and generates the caption okay if you look down here this is added a caption to this entire video and that took less than 60 seconds that's 11 minute video under templates they have all these different style of captions that completely change how your caption is animated on screen I'll just click on this one for example I mean look at that compared to the previous one that was there by default and look at these emojis that actually fit with what the text is saying too I mean this is just incredible and these are fully editable too so I could go ahead and resize these and this is just one of the many many different templates they have for captioning and they also have this whole AI Avatar category so you could choose from different AI avatars that will help you read the script and they kind of look like this very useful to do that right inside of an editing app too there are other apps like hayen for example that create these AI avatars but this is kind of interesting to have this built into the app like this and then ad script they have different voices available and these are all part of the Pro Plan inside of capcut so as someone that creates content pretty much every single day those are some of the top apps that I rely on as a Creator I hope you found some of these useful as well thanks for spotter for sponsoring this video I will catch you on the next one by",
