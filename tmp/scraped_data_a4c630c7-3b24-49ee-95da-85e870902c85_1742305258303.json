However, they grant AutomateTube a license to host and display that content.\n\n2. **Content Restrictions**: There are clear prohibitions against illegal, harmful, or copyrighted materials without permission, ensuring that the platform remains compliant with laws and regulations.\n\n3. **Account Security**: Users are responsible for maintaining accurate account information and security, with measures in place to prevent account sharing.\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\nThe site includes a dedicated FAQ section that addresses common queries, enhancing user confidence and understanding. Some of the questions it covers include:\n\n- **AI Caption Generation Accuracy**: Users can understand the reliability of the platform’s AI capabilities.\n\n- **Supported Video Formats**: Knowing what formats are accepted can influence user workflow.\n\n- **Processing Times**: Transparency regarding how long videos take to process helps manage expectations for potential users.\n\n### The Call to Action\n\nTowards the end of the content, there is a clear call to action encouraging users to start creating videos. The phrasing “Ready to get started? Start getting views today” is indicative of the platform’s goal: not only to provide tools but to foster growth and visibility for creators.\n\n### Legal and Policy Information\n\nLastly, AutomateTube includes foundational legal information such as their refund policy, privacy policy, and terms and conditions. This establishes a professional credibility and reassures users that their rights are protected, and the company operates transparently.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, AutomateTube emerges as a robust solution for aspiring and professional video creators alike. Its AI-driven tools allow for quick and easy video production, underpinned by a friendly user interface and supportive community.

Types of AI video generation Text-to-video Veo 2 is PURE FIRE 🔥 \"A small pink liquid monster, styled like a rapper with a backward cap and chunky gold chain, performing a kickflip down a flight of stairs. The skateboard spins multiple times underneath as the liquid creature's form ripples and splashes dynamically in… pic.twitter.com/0EEeWlPcHE — Javi Lopez ⛩️ (@javilopen) January 13, 2025 Text-to-video AI video generation allows users to create videos simply by describing a scene in text. The AI interprets the prompt and generates a matching video, complete with movement, lighting, and even physics. This is by far the most popular type of AI video generation. Image-to-video Look at that VEO 2 animates windows wallpaper! pic.twitter.com/qL51V8S4oA — testtm (@test_tm7873) December 26, 2024 Image-to-video AI video generation animates static images, bringing them to life with motion effects. AI can generate smooth transitions, camera movements, or even animate characters from a few frames. Image-to-video models are popular with AI video creators because they allow you to maintain character, scene and object consistency throughout your video. You would typically use these tools alongside an AI image generator like Midjourney. Video-to-video @runwayml has 4K upscaling now! 🤯 I did a comparison between Runway GEN-3 and Topaz Video AI's upscaler, from HD to 4K. Runway's file size footprint is 40% of Topaz (using the Theia model), and after reviewing the results on a 40\" monitor, there's little to no difference in… pic.twitter.com/GamPOXq9mr — Tom Blake (@Iamtomblake) January 9, 2025 Video-to-video AI video generation uses AI to enhance, modify, or transform existing videos rather than creating new ones from scratch. This can include improving video quality, changing styles, adding special effects, or even altering elements within the footage—like removing objects, or replacing backgrounds. Some good examples of video-to-video includes Synthesia's AI dubbing (with lip sync) or Topaz's video upscaling. Th‎e best AI video generator for studio-quality videos with AI avatars Synthesia PlayCreate an AI Video in 4 Minutes with Synthesia ⚡️ Verdict: Easy to use and great for training, internal communications, marketing, outreach and localisation/translation ‎Link: ‎https://www.synthesia.io/ Synthesia is a leading AI video generator that allows you to create studio-quality videos with AI avatars that can narrate your text. It includes more than 60 video templates you can start from, and you can choose between more than 230 AI avatars that speak more than 140 languages and accents. Here's an example video I made for a product launch: PlayProduct Introduction (Free AI Video Template) Synthesia can be used to create a variety of video types, with the most common use cases being learning and development videos, including training videos and other eLearning video production. It also excels at producing onboarding videos and video content for internal communications, as well as marketing and outreach videos. Synthesia is a top-ranked AI software, with 1150+ reviews on G2 and has a rating of 4.7 out of 5. The platform is being used by 50,000 companies of all sizes, with many big names among them, such as Reuters, Zoom, and Amazon. Synthesia is a browser-based platform and I found it easy to set up my first video. I simply typed in my script, selected an avatar from their library, customized my video with the AI video editor, and then Synthesia generated a polished video featuring one of its realistic AI avatars. With over 230 avatars to choose from, I easily found options that fit different tones and purposes. You can also make a custom avatar that looks like you. Synthesia supports over 140 languages, and I was able to create localized versions of my video with ease. The platform even has a multilingual video player that automatically translates videos to viewers’ preferred languages, making it useful for global audiences. I tried adding multiple avatars on screen to simulate conversations, which worked smoothly and could be helpful for training scenarios or role-playing videos. The platform has over 60 professionally designed video templates that make it easy to produce polished content quickly. Features like live collaboration tools allow teams to work together seamlessly, while detailed video analytics provide insights into video performance. Altogether, these capabilities make Synthesia a practical, efficient choice for professional projects. One of its most popular use cases is as training video software, but it's also great for other sales and marketing videos and multilingual content. Th‎e best AI video generators for creative video production Here's my rundown of the best text-to-video and image-to-video AI video generators for creative video production. Hailuo Hailuo Director Mode is so fun. Being able to combine camera shots is just fantastic. Here shaky camera and push in. pic.twitter.com/MfqBA22vm8 — Jerrod Lew (@jerrod_lew) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best free option for creative video production Link: ‎https://hailuoai.video/ Hailuo AI is an AI video generator that delivers high-quality 6-second video clips at 720p resolution. It offers text-to-video, image-to-video and a subject reference feature. Hailuo offers a 3-day free unlimited generation period so that you can generate a bunch of videos for free and really test the tool. Subject reference is a particularly cool feature. It lets you upload a photo of a character and then generate a scene with that character in it. I found the output to be pretty accurate, although I often needed to do some manual editing to maintain coherence. The model can also take multiple attempts to get it right, which will eat into your credits. The feature also often fails at close-ups (wide shots tend to work better but lose fine details). One of the first things that stood out to me was how well it understands prompts. Hailuo seemed to nail camera movements and scene composition accurately. The image quality is also noticeably high. However, generation times are limited to 6 seconds, which makes creating longer sequences more tedious. Al‎ibaba Qwen Another day, another release. Alibaba have quietly included video generation in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max and it's really good. Here are a few examples - check them out. pic.twitter.com/u6qptO59ai — TomLikesRobots🤖 (@TomLikesRobots) January 30, 2025 Verdict: Completely free and produces high quality videos, but often with unreliable generation Link: ‎‎‎‎https://chat.qwenlm.ai/ Alibaba included an AI video generator in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max. It’s a text-to-video only tool, but it’s completely free and I’ve been impressed by the quality. The one catch is that the generation is kind of unreliable. I often enter my prompt and the video generates up to 99% complete and then gets stuck for quite a while. In my experience the videos do eventually finish generating but be prepared to wait a little. The output quality seems to be really good, and while the functionality is limited, it’s completely free and the videos have no watermark. Kl‎ing If you’re looking to combine character consistency with high-quality VFX, @Kling_ai is the best choice. 🎥✨ Version 1.5 absolutely nails VFX. A true must-have! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/rO1WvmLj3k — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) January 12, 2025 Verdict: High quality output, but very long free plan generation wait times Link: ‎https://www.klingai.com/ Kling offers text-to-video and image-to-video features, along with free video generation credits for users who log in each month. Kling brings an impressive level of fluidity and realism to movement in videos. I found the adjustable creativity and relevance slider particularly useful for fine-tuning outputs. Its biggest strength lies in image-to-video generation (and in particular its elements feature), which is far superior to tools like Runway. The motion is smoother, and the AI follows prompts accurately. When I asked for a character to blink or walk forward while the camera zoomed in, Kling delivered exactly what I asked for. If you need storytelling or consistency between frames, Kling is a great option. Kling 1.5 also supports HD, which is a nice bonus. Kling has some drawbacks, the biggest being generation speed. On the free version, I sometimes had to wait an hour or more for a single clip, and I’ve heard of free users waiting a full day for results. This is a major issue if you need quick iterations. On a paid plan the generations are quicker, but I also noticed that Kling sometimes gets stuck at 99% completion and wastes credits. At the end of the day, if you prioritize quality, accuracy, and motion control, Kling is a great choice. The motion brush tool adds extra control, and the first-attempt success rate is high, meaning I spent less time fighting the AI to get what I wanted. Ru‎nway When setting up a shot in Runway, think carefully about where to put the camera. Consider what the camera placement tells the audience about the story, about the character, and about the moment. Every angle is a decision that affects how the audience will experience it. pic.twitter.com/XnijHcb0Jv — Cristóbal Valenzuela (@c_valenzuelab) November 11, 2024 Verdict: The Gen-3 model gives you great results and some amazing advanced features that come with a bit of a learning curve Link: ‎https://runwayml.com/ Runway’s latest Gen-3 model offers a comprehensive suite of creative tools, such as text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video, alongside advanced features like motion brush, keyframes, camera controls and inpainting. On the free basic plan, you can create short text-to-video clips (up to 10 seconds long or 16 seconds using the \"extend video\" feature in the older Gen-2 model) but can’t upscale resolution or remove watermarks. You also can’t generate videos directly from text using their Gen-3 Alpha model on the free plan (only images to video). However, you can still make great videos with just the image-video feature. Here's an example workflow to show you how I use Runway’s free plan to create AI-generated short story videos: Midjourney to generate images Runway for image-to-video Suno to generate music Elevenlabs for some effects Topaz for video upscaling Capcut for editing I found Runway’s advanced features to be pretty amazing. Camera control lets you adjust angles, focus, and movement to achieve a polished, professional look. The Motion brush tool allows you to add motion and direction to specific parts of a video, which is great for creating visually dynamic social media content. Keyframes allow you to configure the starting, middle, and ending frames to create smooth transitions between them. Inpainting lets you automatically remove unwanted objects throughout your clip. This tool handled complex scenes surprisingly well; I could remove background elements without affecting the continuity of the video, something that would usually require a lot of time and expertise. However, I found that these advanced features come with a learning curve, so if you’re new to video editing you might need a bit of practice to fully utilize Runway’s capabilities. I found Runway’s video generation process to be fast and reliable. I think the pricing is reasonable given the platform’s capabilities, especially for creators, filmmakers, and digital artists who want more control and creative freedom. However, the costs might feel high if you’re only looking for basic AI video generation, as Runway is designed for those looking to push creative boundaries and explore the possibilities of AI in video production. Go‎ogle Veo Been generating impossibly dangerous stunts with veo 2 using text prompts. Still surprising how realistic they can look (though not perfect yet). pic.twitter.com/0gETBwGH5y — Ethan Mollick (@emollick) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best option for creative video production, but limited access for now (US only waitlist) Link: ‎https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/ I was blown away by Google Veo 2’s realistic video generation capabilities. Every clip I produced, from a misty jungle scene to a foggy wildlife sequence, was rendered in stunning detail, and the visual fidelity was top-notch. One of the aspects that stood out for me was the advanced cinematic controls. I could specify everything from lens types to shot angles and even adjust depth-of-field effects, which made it feel like I had an entire professional film crew at my fingertips. The dolly zoom and pan shot features, in particular, added that extra layer of cinematic flair that really brought my scenes to life. In my tests, Veo 2 consistently produced more “correct” results compared to other tools like OpenAI’s Sora. The physics simulation is fantastic with objects and characters that move and interact in a way that feels natural and true to real-world behavior. I found that character consistency was excellent too; no matter how complex the scene, the generated characters maintained their look and identity throughout the video. Veo 2 supports high-resolution outputs (up to 4K) and longer video durations too, which simplifies your workflow as you won’t need upscaling tools. The only reason why Veo 2 isn’t my top pick for creative video production is because it’s still not publicly available - you have to join a waitlist and it’s still US only. There’s also room for improvement still, and I sometimes saw some strange character movements in my generated videos. Op‎enAI Sora 🚨 It’s crazy! #Sora just dropped, and it’s already blowing everyone’s minds! 😱🎥 Here are 10 mind-blowing examples showcasing its insane possibilities. 🔥 The future of video is here. 🚀👇 pic.twitter.com/Mcq2OepO3R — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Fun to play around with but needs to improve Link: ‎https://sora.com/ Sora is OpenAI’s entry into text-to-video AI video generation, and after spending some time with it, I’ve found it to be a mixed bag. On the one hand, when Sora works, it can deliver stunning, lifelike visuals, especially for abstract or artistic scenes. Its storyboard functionality is one of my favorite features, as it lets you prompt multiple shots in a single generation, and the “Blend” option adds a fun layer of creativity, allowing you to combine visual elements in unexpected ways. However, in my experience the model struggles with some critical aspects. Sora consistently fails when it comes to physics, general body movements, and character consistency. For example, I tried generating scenes as simple as making cats dance, only to be met with choppy motion, glitches, and overall results that were far from convincing. In several cases, the outputs felt like a gamble: some generations might be passable, but most of the time, prompts didn’t translate well into the expected actions or camera movements. I found that free or cheaper alternatives outperform Sora in accuracy and usability. There’s a steep learning curve, and despite the potential of the video-to-video remix functionality (which I’ve used to remaster some older AI-generated clips), the overall inconsistency is hard to overlook. You can access Sora on the plus plan ($20/month) which gives you 50 videos up to 720p resolution and 5 seconds long, or the pro plan ($200/month) for 500 videos up to 1080p resolution and 20 seconds long. Pi‎ka I had early access to the Pika 2.1 Model, A new journey begins, More clips to follow! @pika_labs pic.twitter.com/rN5OfMacoo — Stevie Mac (@StevieMac03) January 23, 2025 Verdict: The free plan isn’t great, but the premium plans have very good image-to-video features Link: ‎https://pika.art/ Pika offers a free plan that gives you access to Pika 1.5, which has text-to-video and image-to-video features and 150 monthly video credits. Videos can be downloaded without a watermark on the free plan. I wasn’t super impressed with the quality of the generated videos though. However, while Pika 1.5’s video output is nothing special, Pika 2.1 (available on the paid plan) offers an image-to-video feature called scene ingredients, which I think is pretty amazing. With scene ingredients you can build a shot from the exact character, object, wardrobe, and setting you want. It works by using reference images of each element and then providing a prompt. It’s similar to Kling’s elements feature in that it allows you to ensure creative consistency between scenes, which I found made it a super useful tool to produce actually usable videos. Lu‎ma First impression Luma > Sora pic.twitter.com/R2pXVsAesw — The Retro Burn (@burntheretro) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Their new Ray 2 model is great, but it’s a premium feature and it doesn’t offer image-to-video Link: ‎https://lumalabs.ai/ Luma's Ray 2 model has great motion realism and the physics feel really natural. The frame-to-frame consistency is a clear improvement over previous versions and it does an excellent job with cinematic elements, responding impressively to lighting, contrast, film formats, and camera motion. At times, it even seemed to intelligently structure shots. By using highly detailed prompts and running multiple generations, I found that it’s possible to create some truly stunning videos, though it does require some cherry-picking to get the best results. When I tested a sports car driving through snowy mountains at dawn, the scene composition was spot on and the snow, warm light, and camera tracking all felt smooth and natural. I also experimented with close-up shots of faces, and I was surprised by how well it captured emotional expressions, particularly in an extreme sadness prompt, where the eye movements and facial subtleties felt incredibly lifelike. Where Luma stands out is its ability to generate dynamic camera movements while keeping the scene coherent. It understands cinematic depth and framing in a way that makes it ideal for dramatic shots. I found that Luma is great at handling large-scale scene changes. For example, when I asked it to generate a collapsing building Luma delivered a convincing destruction sequence. Currently, Luma’s Ray 2 is only available to paid users and is capped at 720p resolution. Videos can be up to 10 seconds long, but I noticed that after about 7 seconds, scene consistency can start breaking down, occasionally shifting in unintended ways. Ad‎obe Firefly Here's another video created by Adobe Firefly.. a 3D printer, printing a car. Very impressed by the results. https://t.co/L5d8zf3TGv pic.twitter.com/ySylkRlDMS — techAU (@techAU) February 13, 2025 Verdict: Inconsistent motion and limited free use (only 2 free generations) make it hard to recommend Link: ‎‎https://firefly.adobe.com/ Adobe Firefly offers both text to video and image to video, both capable of producing 1080p clips from simple prompts or static images. Firefly struggles with distortion. I tested it by generating a video of \"a cyclist riding through a mountain trail in autumn,\" and while the colors and scenery were nice, the motion was noticeably unnatural. The cyclist's legs appeared to glitch mid-pedal, and the overall movement felt disjointed. Image to video fared better when creating abstract or background footage, but realistic human action remained a challenge. The output currently feels more like digital experiments than polished, usable content. On the positive side, Firefly's interface is intuitive. The built-in controls for adjusting camera angles, motion paths, and shot sizes make experimenting with different styles relatively simple. After generating two free videos, I was prompted to upgrade to either Firefly Standard or Pro for additional generations. While Firefly is enjoyable to explore and has clear creative potential, I’ll stick with more reliable alternatives for projects that need high-quality, natural-looking results. The best AI video generators for social media and YouTube content Fl‎exClip PlayHow to use FlexClip's AI Video Creator Verdict: User-friendly video tool with innovative AI features Link: ‎https://www.flexclip.com/ FlexClip is highly user-friendly platform that excels at helping you create professional-looking videos quickly and efficiently. I love the drag-and-drop editor. It’s perfect for creating videos on the fly without needing to spend hours on intricate editing. I’ve used it to create everything from social media content to promotional videos. The AI-powered text-to-video tool allows you to input simple text prompts, and the AI generates video clips based on the text, matching stock footage, adding text overlays, and even suggesting music. It's perfect for social media clips. While the AI can be a little hit or miss when it comes to perfectly matching footage to specific content, it’s an amazing tool for creating videos when you’re short on time or just need a draft to build upon, and I typically only need to make a few adjustments after generation. The AI script generator is another great feature. While the scripts are generally a good starting point, they often need a little fine-tuning to match the specific tone of the brand or subject matter. This is definitely a time-saver, though, especially when you’re stuck trying to put ideas into words. Another feature that impressed me was the AI background remover. It works surprisingly well. For most images, the background removal is clean, though it sometimes struggles with more intricate details like hair or small objects. It’s a great time-saver when you’re working with product images or need transparent backgrounds quickly. FlexClip also offers an auto-subtitle generator, which is a great tool for improving accessibility and engagement on social media platforms. It’s surprisingly accurate, and I’ve used it for videos on YouTube and Instagram. However, it does occasionally struggle with fast speech or complex accents, so if you’re working with content that has unclear audio, this may not always be 100% reliable. One area where FlexClip could improve is its media library. While it offers a decent range of stock footage and images, it’s not as extensive as some other platforms I’ve used. For niche content, I’ve often had to source additional media from other places. The stock library is good for general-purpose videos, but it may not always have exactly what you need. Ve‎ed PlayHow to Make a YouTube Intro Verdict: User-friendly browser-based video editor that streamlines social media content creation Link: ‎https://www.veed.io/ Veed is a user-friendly, browser-based video editor that made creating social media content incredibly easy for me. The intuitive layout and drag-and-drop functionality let me start projects quickly, and I loved using features like automatic subtitles, text-to-speech, and background removal to give my videos a professional touch. The templates and filters helped keep my style consistent, and with auto-translate, creating multilingual content was straightforward. The only downside I found was that the free plan includes a watermark, and complex scenes sometimes required a bit of manual tweaking to get the AI effects like background removal just right. Overall, Veed offered everything I needed for quick, polished videos with minimal effort. Ca‎nva PlayCreate content fast with Canva Video Verdict: AI-powered video editing with versatile templates Link: ‎https://www.canva.com/video-editor/ai/ Canva is not only a design tool; it’s also a great alternative for creating social media and YouTube videos. I tried its video editor, and I was impressed by how well it adapts to video creation. Canva’s templates make it easy to start projects tailored for platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. One of my favorite features is the automatic resizing, which lets me quickly reformat videos for different platforms without needing to start from scratch. The AI-powered suggestions for text and animations are also handy—it feels like Canva’s tools know how to keep my content consistent and visually engaging. With access to a vast library of stock media and music, I could easily enhance my videos, and the new AI text-to-speech and captioning features were a nice bonus, especially for making my videos more accessible. Overall, Canva’s video editing tools made it simple to produce polished, shareable content that looks just as good as anything created with dedicated video editors. The best AI-powered video editors Fi‎lmora PlayFilmora 14 is HERE! | Introducing a NEW way to edit Verdict: An affordable and user-friendly video editor with robust AI features Link: ‎https://filmora.wondershare.com/ When I first tried Filmora, I was immediately struck by how easy it was to navigate. The drag-and-drop functionality and straightforward interface made it simple to start editing, even without much prior experience. Filmora offers a robust library of transitions, effects, and templates, allowing me to quickly put together visually appealing videos, which is ideal for creating content for social media and YouTube. I appreciated how the platform balances usability with a range of features, making it suitable for both beginners and intermediate users who want to produce polished videos without a steep learning curve. Filmora’s pricing is also accessible, with options that cater to different types of users. They offer an annual subscription starting at around $49.99 per year, and for those looking for more flexibility, a lifetime license is available for around $79.99. There’s also a free version, which is great for testing the software before committing, but it does add a watermark to videos. For creators looking to edit consistently without major financial commitments, Filmora’s pricing offers a good balance of affordability and value, especially considering the powerful AI tools it includes. These plans are well-suited for individuals and small business owners who need regular access to professional-grade video tools without breaking the bank. Filmora's AI-powered tools bring a lot of convenience and creativity to the editing process. I'll run through each one. The AI Smart Cutout feature, for example, allows you to cut objects out of scenes by painting over the area, which is perfect for isolating specific subjects without complex masking. I also found AI Audio Denoise to be extremely useful for cleaning up background noise in my videos, especially when I recorded in less-than-ideal environments. The AI Audio Stretch tool was another handy feature that let me extend background music to match scene transitions, saving me the hassle of remixing or finding perfectly timed tracks. These AI tools are not only time-saving but also elevate the overall quality of the final video, helping users create professional-looking content with minimal effort. The AI Motion Tracking tool was a lot of fun to experiment with—it can be used to track faces or moving objects, allowing for privacy blurring or creative effects like pasting funny stickers over someone’s face to make meme-style videos. Another feature I really enjoyed was AI Remove Background, which made it easy to change the background of my videos without needing a green screen. I could, for instance, place a runner in an outer-space setting, which opens up endless creative possibilities. Additionally, Filmora’s AI Silence Detection tool helped speed up my editing by automatically removing pauses and hesitations, making it effortless to create snappy jump cuts. These tools make Filmora an efficient, AI-enhanced option for quick edits and visually dynamic effects. However, while these AI tools are great for general use, there are a few limitations. The precision of features like Smart Cutout and Remove Background isn’t perfect and might require manual touch-ups for complex scenes. Additionally, while Filmora handles most tasks smoothly, rendering can slow down when working with high-resolution files or when using multiple AI features in one project. This might be a drawback for users with demanding workflows or those creating high-quality, professional-grade content. Overall, though, Filmora’s AI tools make it an impressive choice for social media creators and hobbyists. In summary, Filmora is an accessible, budget-friendly video editor that packs a lot of AI-driven functionality into an affordable package. It’s particularly suited for those creating content for social media, YouTube, or personal projects. With its range of pricing options, Filmora offers a lot of value, especially for casual and intermediate creators who don’t need the high-end features of more advanced (and expensive) software.

When I tried it, I was impressed by how well it upscaled footage, even to resolutions as high as 16K, adding a cinematic clarity to older or lower-quality clips. The AI-driven noise reduction made a noticeable difference, effectively removing grain and artifacts that I struggled with in other software. I also found the frame rate enhancement and slow-motion features to be smooth and natural, making it ideal for creating professional-quality slow-motion shots or restoring archival footage. Priced at $299 for personal use and $1099 for commercial licensing, Topaz Video AI is an expensive but valuable investment for filmmakers, content creators, and digital archivists looking to elevate their work with high-end upscaling and video repair capabilities.

The array of AI-powered features—like background removal and automatic upscaling—made editing quick and straightforward, especially for creating social media content. The audio-to-text transcription was a time-saver, automatically adding captions that boosted accessibility and engagement on my videos. I liked tools like video stabilization and text-to-speech, which let me enhance video quality without needing complex software. CapCut’s collaborative features were also helpful, especially when working on shared projects, and the library of templates gave me plenty of creative options. Overall, CapCut’s versatility and ease of use make it a great choice for both personal and professional video editing. The best AI video generators for video repurposing Op‎usClip PlayOpusClip 3.0: The smartest AI clipping tool just got smarter Verdict: A smart and time-saving tool that repurposes long videos into engaging, platform-ready clips with minimal effort Link: ‎https://www.opus.pro/ Opus Clip has quickly become one of my favorite tools for repurposing long videos into social media-friendly clips. The AI-driven clip generation feature is surprisingly accurate, identifying the most engaging parts of my videos and saving me the time I’d usually spend sorting through footage. I appreciate how it automatically resizes clips to fit different platforms like TikTok and Instagram without any manual adjustments. Adding captions and even emojis is simple, and I noticed it makes the videos more engaging, especially for viewers who watch without sound. One of the standout features is the \"hook\" identification, which picks out key moments to grab attention quickly. Overall, Opus Clip made it easy to create compelling, shareable content from my existing videos, and the AI features really lightened my workload. Mu‎nch PlayMeet Munch Verdict: Efficiently converts long-form content into shareable social snippets using AI Link: ‎https://www.getmunch.com/ Munch is an AI-based tool for repurposing long-form video content into shorter clips suited for social media platforms. It identifies key moments in videos and includes features like auto-cropping, subtitles, and format adjustments to help optimize content for platforms such as Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok. Munch offers a streamlined way to create shareable content from existing videos, aimed at enhancing reach and engagement across various channels. I found the interface clean and easy to navigate, allowing me to jump right in without needing tutorials. One feature I particularly liked was the automatic detection of key moments. Munch’s AI identifies engaging segments, which saved me the time of manually sifting through my footage to find the best parts to share. For anyone looking to repurpose content across platforms, this automation is a real time-saver. Munch’s formatting tools also make it easy to resize videos for different social platforms. The auto-cropping options adjust clips to fit Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and more, making cross-platform distribution simpler. I appreciated the automatic subtitle feature, which made my videos accessible to a broader audience without much additional work. However, while these features are useful, they lack some customization. I couldn’t manually adjust the selected clips as much as I’d like, and sometimes the AI would pick sections that didn’t feel as relevant or engaging as I had hoped. One limitation I noticed is that the output quality and customization options are fairly basic compared to more advanced editing software. While auto-cropping and subtitles are convenient, the styling options for subtitles are limited, and I missed having more flexibility with transitions and effects. This might be a drawback if you’re aiming for highly polished, branded content, as Munch is more focused on speed and efficiency than fine-tuning. Overall, though, it’s a solid tool for quickly repurposing long videos into social-friendly snippets. If you need a quick way to generate clips from existing content and don’t require advanced editing, Munch is a handy addition to your toolkit. Wi‎secut PlayTurn long videos into shorts with Wisecut AI Verdict: Wisecut streamlines editing by automatically trimming dead space and adding professional touches Link: ‎https://www.wisecut.ai/ Wisecut automatically finds interesting moments in long clips and cuts them, adding music and subtitles. I tested it by uploading a raw clip full of awkward pauses and unnecessary dead spots, and Wisecut’s smart editing removed all the fluff. The auto-cut feature was spot-on, leaving me with a much tighter, more engaging video without having to painstakingly cut it all myself. The tool is super intuitive. It offers handy features like background noise cancellation and even let me choose whether to add background music, which really helped polish the final product. I also appreciated the straightforward interface—it made setting up projects and tweaking settings a breeze. In short, Wisecut has saved me a significant amount of time, letting me focus more on creating content rather than getting bogged down in editing. If you’re looking to streamline your workflow and produce cleaner, more professional videos, I’d highly recommend giving it a try. How did I decide on the best AI video generators?

Make a Video Updated: 12/10/24 Published: 06/16/23 Videos are integral to any marketing campaign; however, they can be tedious and difficult to create if you aren’t savvy with editing or are short on time. Fortunately, you can leverage many AI video generators to streamline your production and create content that engages your audience. But what’s the best AI video generator for your tasks? This article will explore 12 different AI video generators, their features, and how you can best use them in your next video marketing campaign. Time to press play on easier video creation. Table of Contents Can AI make videos? How to Make AI Videos Transforming Text to Video With AI What makes a great AI video generator? Best AI Video Generators Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video Can AI make videos? Yes, AI can make videos. AI video generators can instantly produce basic presentation slides with text, B-roll, and background music, all the way up to advanced videos of lifelike AI avatars “speaking” to you. AI’s impressive — but it’s not perfect. What works well with AI video generators: Video scripts. Being able to generate video scripts in a few seconds is incredible and saves so much time. Stock imagery, B-roll, and background music. Even though it still requires editing, having multimedia pulled automatically for you by the video generator makes it feel like you have an assistant. Video editing. The video editing capabilities are incredible and often beginner-friendly, which is a huge leap in the video editing world. What isn’t working (yet): Believability. The realistic AI avatars are incredibly advanced, but the mannerisms and articulation make it obvious that they're, well, AI. Pacing. Much research has been done on how quickly a video moves from scene to scene to hold viewers’ attention, and I found that not all generators factored this into their algorithms. Decision overload. The number of video templates, AI avatars, and effects available can overwhelm the editing process. AI is rapidly advancing, and some of these quirks will soon be passé. How to Make AI Videos The process for making an AI video will vary depending on the tool or platform you're using. Some generators work by analyzing and creating a video based on the script you uploaded, while others will follow a prompt typed in by the user. The key is to find a tool or generator with the features you need to create the kind of content you want. Transforming Text to Video With AI When ChatGPT catapulted to popularity in 2022, I don’t think the average marketers knew just how quickly AI video would follow. It needs to be used ethically to be useful to society, but when leveraged correctly, it’s an incredible tool. The most sought-after AI video feature is the text-to-video generator. This allows you to type in a sentence and, in a few seconds, be presented with an editable AI-generated video. I tested this feature using two different prompts: A vague prompt: “I’d like to educate viewers about AI-generated video.” A specific prompt: “I’d like to inspire beginner marketers to try AI video generation. The video should explain the benefits of AI video generators and should inspire viewers to try this new video tool.” I used HubSpot’s free AI video generator Clip Creator, and here’s what I saw. They were both high-quality videos. Both videos had appropriate stock images and music tailored to human behavior. The content was very similar for both videos. After testing many AI generators, I’ve found that a marketer’s time is better spent editing rather than making their prompt more specific. No matter how perfect your prompt feels, the end result will still require edits.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now What makes a great AI video generator? So, how does one evaluate all of the different software on the market? The best AI video tools all have a mix of these different features. Intuitive User Interface While most platforms list a long list of fancy AI features, users need an easy-to-use AI studio first and foremost. This enables a quick editing process. AI Scripts Automatically-generated video scripts save an incredible amount of time when producing video content. They turn written content (such as a blog post, email, etc.) or a prompt into spoken language. Sometimes, they even use an AI narrator to read it out loud for you. Not all software can generate video scripts, but it’s an enormous time saver. To be fair to the software that doesn’t offer this, it’s replaceable with a few clicks in ChatGPT. After trying more than a dozen AI video generators, I found the AI scripts were one of the features that made the greatest difference, along with the next feature. Factoring in Human Behavior Some software have tailored their AI to match user behavior, and some haven’t. For example, most people prefer videos with a brisk pace and visuals that don’t stay on the screen too long. In the video world, this is referred to as “pacing.” Not all software is tailored for this, and as a result, it will produce slow, lengthy slides that feel like a bad PowerPoint presentation. This isn’t a detail that software companies list on their “features” page, but it’s something that’s apparent based on the first draft of the video that the software gives you. Template Library Start from scratch? What is it, 2018? There’s no need to start from scratch with video anymore, as most platforms have built-in template libraries. Bonus points if these libraries include variation in: Intended audience. Aspect ratio. Project type. Editing Capabilities It’s normal for different software to offer different editing options, but most AI studios will cover the basics, such as: Text. Fonts. Music. Colors. Timing. Transitions. Animations. Stock footage. Different video styles. Pricing Tiers (or Free Plan) An AI video generator costs $0 to $50 a month (paid annually). All paid software includes a discount when purchasing an annual package, and the cost of month-to-month service is always higher. I know you’re on a budget — all of the suggested AI tools below are either free or include a free trial/demo. Multilingual Look for software that supports multiple languages if your business requires it. A chart comparing 11 AI Video Generators Chart comparing AI video generators Best AI Video Generators AI video generators have come extremely far in a short time. You can now make professional videos with the numerous text-to-video generation tools on the market. I’ve tried all the most popular AI video generators, so you don’t have to. Here’s what I found. 1. Clip Creator Source Clip Creator is the best AI video generator for beginners. It can be used by someone with no video experience and walks you through the video creation process painlessly. You start by answering a few basic questions (like video type), then provide a brief overview of the video you’d like to create. You can choose from video templates, which are oriented for both landscape videos and vertical videos. Then, Clip Creator uses AI to generate the text on your slides, plus the background imagery. You’re instantly given a video with editable text, stock images, background music, etc. The video creation workflow is very intuitive. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video My experience: I love how streamlined this AI video creator is. Instead of bombarding you with endless features, options, and pop-ups, Clip Creator starts simple and allows you to make any edits you need after it generates the video. Source Pros: Incredibly intuitive user interface, great customization options, and makes for a very fast and efficient AI video creator. Cons: Smaller template library than paid AI video generators, and no advanced features like realistic AI avatars. Best for: Video creation beginners and marketers on a budget. Most user-friendly interface and best free AI video generator. 2. Pictory Source Pictory is an excellent AI video generator for creators and marketers who don’t have experience creating videos. All you have to do is provide a script or article to guide your video content. For example, you can submit a blog post to the AI video creator, and Pictory will create a video based on the post that can be used for social media or your website. Furthermore, you can edit videos in minutes by using text. Pictory also includes a feature that creates shareable video highlight reels that can be used as a trailer or a short-form video for social media such as a Reel. Even better, Pictory can automatically caption and summarize your videos.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: I provided the same prompt for Pictory as I did for the Clip Creator video, and it initially generated much less content (only 1 slide). I went back and instead provided a URL of a blog post and tested the blog-to-video generator. This feature automatically creates video scripts based on a blog post, and using their realistic AI voices, I could have it automatically narrated too. The writing on every slide needed to be edited significantly to be useful, but I was impressed with the options. Pictory supports multiple languages (currently English, Spanish, French, and German) and has a huge library of AI voices. Source Prices for Pictory start at $19 per month, and users can try a 2-week free trial. Pros: Users have a lot of options for how to begin their AI-generated videos, and they can thoroughly customize the video output. Cons: The first draft of the automatically-generated videos needs heavy editing. It may be faster to let ChatGPT write a script for you and use that. Best for: Marketers and creators with limited video editing experience who want to convert content like blog posts or webinars into shareable video content. 3. Simplified Source The Simplified AI video generator transforms a long-form video into multiple AI-enhanced clips with just one click. This allows users to create videos from text and make an entirely new video using its accessible editing interface. Simplified simplifies the way we produce content by providing users with easy access to an expansive in-app library that hosts thousands of templates, all available for free. I like that it guarantees exceptional video quality and pairs this with an intuitive, user-friendly interface, ensuring that users can craft high-quality videos without sacrificing ease of use. Its comprehensive suite of features goes beyond basic editing options to include animation enhancements and multilingual translation capabilities, making it a versatile all-in-one tool for video creation. Users can save their brand settings in Simplified’s “brand book” is a great time-saving feature. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just starting, this platform equips you with everything you need to bring your vision to life. Brands like Bloomberg, DuckDuckGo, and Cashify use Simplified for their marketing needs. My experience: I prompted Simplified the same way I prompted the other video generators, and I was immediately asked to describe my target audience and provide my video topic. This was a nice step toward more personalized videos, but it required more user-generated input than Clip Creator, which had a multiple-choice intake process. If you stick to the free plan, it’s time-consuming to sift through all the features to see what’s free to use. Source Prices for Simplified include a forever-free plan. Paid plans start from $15.20 a month and are billed annually. Pros: If you pay for this AI video creator, you have many creation options at your disposal that not all other platforms offer (AI meme creation, AI image generation, AI carousel maker, etc.). Cons: Not the best free AI video generator; other platforms are more generous with their features. You’re not able to test the text-to-video generator without joining a paid plan, as you’re about to do with other features. Best for: Creators who want to create, edit, and schedule videos for all social media platforms. 4. Movavi Video Editor Source Rather than generating AI videos from scratch, the Movavi Video Editor uses AI to make video editing easier. Video editing can be a time-consuming chore; for many, it’s the less enjoyable side of content creation. However, with Movavi Video Editor’s nonlinear AI technique, you’re not just replicating traditional tool functions but also enhancing your videos through advanced AI video editing. With AI background removal, you can cut out and replace backgrounds, adding a new dimension to your visuals. Plus, the AI noise removal feature enhances audio quality by automatically eliminating unwanted sounds, ensuring your videos are of the highest standard. Source The app also offers a host of advanced options like PiP, chroma-key, titles, keyframing, motion tracking, and more. Following the free 7-day trial, paid plans start at $49.95 per year. Pros: The presence of built-in training rapidly familiarizes you with the software, and it has features that many other AI video editors don’t. Cons: This AI video editor brings high-level tools (like color correction) to marketers, but total video newbies may be overwhelmed with some of the more advanced features. Best for: Creators and marketers who already have video footage and want help editing videos to be more engaging (or who just need to speed up the editing process). 5. Fotor AI Video Generator Source Fotor is an image and video editing platform that integrates various AI features, known for its creativity, intelligence, flexibility, and convenience. Its AI video generator fully utilizes advancements in AI technology, making video creation more efficient and enjoyable. Video creation is often a complex and professional process, but Fotor simplifies the steps. You just need to describe your creative ideas in text form and choose your desired style.

Whether you're an amateur video maker, a professional creator, or someone learning video production with no skills, AI will help you enjoy the efficiency and fun of video creation. Inspiration is important for video creators. Fotor AI video generator provides preset prompts and images, helping creators find more inspiration for their videos. My experience: Fotor’s interface is very user-friendly and simple. you can quickly find the features you need without any distracting ads or clutter. It also provides detailed step-by-step instructions, making it easy for new creators to get started. While creating videos, its preset text descriptions and high-quality images inspired me creatively. They also saved me time and greatly boosted my production efficiency. Source What I found most convenient was that after generating a video, I could perform basic edits directly in Fotor and I could also use their rich AI video tools, like one-click enhancement and beautification, background removal, and object elimination. Pros: The AI video generator supports creating videos in various styles, including Photography, Cinematic, Digital Art, Anime, Neopunk, Game Art, Illustration Art, and more. Catering to various creative ideas and needs. Cons: AI may not always fully understand textual descriptions or emotions and feelings, so some videos may not appear as realistic. Best for: Professional video creators, video creation beginners, social media video influencers, and users who enjoy trying and testing trendy and interesting features. 6. AI Studio Source With AI Studio, users can create videos by uploading their script and using the text-to-speech feature. The platform will then generate a video in five minutes or less. You can manually type in the script or copy and paste it into the platform. From there, you just need to select the appropriate language and AI model and finish editing. AI Studio allows users to select a custom-made avatar that suits their brand.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: New users can input a 300-character script, and an AI avatar will read your script using the AI text-to-video generator. I found the AI models to be less convincing than others; the mouths sometimes moved between sentences, and I think all viewers could identify these as AI. However, since the advent of TikTok’s text-to-speech narration feature, the public has become more accustomed to artificial narration, and there are many situations where this type of AI would work well. Source Prices for AI Studio start at $30 per month. Pros: The platform’s intuitive features make it excellent for beginners with limited or no video creation experience. Cons: The AI Studio avatars are identifiable as being artificial. Best for: Marketing videos that need text-to-speech narration and have visuals for B-roll. 7. Veed.io Source With Veed.io, you can use custom text, colors, font, and music to create a unique video for your brand. One of its standout features is Auto Transcribe. You can upload your video, hit the Auto Transcribe button, and immediately download the script. Even better, there is no software to download, and the platform is easy to use for those without video editing experience. My experience: I entered my “Pinterest marketing for beginners” prompt, and Veed.io quickly generated a short vertical video. The AI video generator automatically provided the script, AI narration, background music, stock videos, and close captioning. The on-screen captions were really engaging, using color-changing text and emojis — perfect for social media. Source Veed.io is free to use for videos under 10 minutes. To access more features, prices start at $18 per month (when billed annually) and go all the way up to enterprise custom pricing. Pros: The pacing, on-screen captions, slang, and approach were very engaging. Cons: The stock video that was automatically inserted into the video was off-topic at times but can be easily edited. Best for: Short-form videos designed to hold attention on social media. 8. Synthesia Source Synthesia's AI video generator enables users to create professional videos without requiring cameras, actors, or studios. Users can generate videos featuring realistic AI avatars that deliver content in over 140 languages by simply inputting text. This makes it an ideal tool for efficiently and at scale creating training materials, sales and marketing content, and internal communications. My experience: Synthesia's intuitive interface and extensive customization options make video creation straightforward. The platform's diverse range of avatars and multilingual support allowed me to produce engaging content tailored to a global audience. The quality of the AI-generated avatars is impressive, closely mimicking human expressions and speech patterns. Synthesia offers a free plan that includes 3 minutes of video per month, 9 AI avatars, and access to AI voices in 140+ languages. Paid plans are available for users requiring more features. Pros: Synthesia simplifies video creation with its intuitive interface and realistic AI avatars. Its support for over 140 languages makes it an excellent tool for creating global content. Cons: The free plan has limited features and is suitable only for basic use. Best for: Businesses and individuals seeking to create professional training videos, marketing content, or internal communications featuring AI avatars, especially when targeting a multilingual audience. 9. Elai.io Source Elai is simple and requires no video editing skills. To use Elai, copy and paste a blog post URL or HTML text, choose a template from its library, and let the generator do the rest. This AI video maker is specialized in corporate learning. Once the video is complete, review it to make any changes before rendering and downloading it. My experience: I found that Elai's format is unique. Even though the AI avatar doesn’t pass as a real human, its small display size makes it feel less distracting. The avatar compliments these videos instead of dominating them. I also really like the audio options: you can upload an audio file of you speaking, and Elai will generate a realistic AI avatar to narrate the text. Source Elai has over 60 languages and 25 avatars to choose from. You can use Elai for free with a 1-minute credit. For more features, Elai’s plans start at $23 per month (billed annually). Pros: As a specialized AI video generator, this tool allows you to quickly create training videos for new hires or product onboarding videos. Cons: Being a platform specialized for educational videos, it would be more time-consuming to create general marketing videos. Best for: Generating videos at scale and creating training videos and product videos. 10. Colossyan Source Colossyan provides a diverse range of avatars who can recite your script in various languages. You can also customize your avatar’s outfit. Colossyan’s key features are auto translations, subtitles, and the ability to enhance messages via screen recording. My experience: The AI avatar options from Colossyan are advanced. You can add multiple AI avatars to a single video screen in the video creation workflow, starting a “conversation.” You can even customize the pauses between speakers. Source There’s a free trial, and the prices start at $19 per month (when billed annually). Pros: The advanced avatar options make this a highly customizable AI video generator. Cons: The sound of the AI narrators isn’t the most natural-sounding. Best for: Creating training videos and explainers for workplace learning. 11. FlexClip Source This AI video generator features hundreds of video templates, AI-generated subtitles, background remover, and a text-to-speech engine. And its intuitive interface makes it simple for creators at any skill level. My experience: I created my video by inputting a URL and letting FlexClip automatically pull content from my website. The AI generator took an enormous amount of work out of the video creation process, but still required editing. The pacing of the video was slower than other AI tools, but I was able to easily customize all elements of the video. Source After the free plan, pricing starts at $9.99 per month (when billed annually, which saves 50%). Pros: The basic plan's price point makes this a very budget-friendly AI video generator. It is also a great, straightforward option for beginners who don’t want to feel overwhelmed. Cons: The AI-generated first draft requires more editing than some of the other platforms. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. 12. Wave Video Source Wave Video is a popular choice among content creators thanks to its many tools, which include image and video assets, text overlay effects, audio, and captions. The platform also provides a variety of video formats for Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and website-based applications. Other key features are: Text-to-video AI. Video hosting. Voiceovers. Text-to-speech. Millions of stock assets. My experience: I tested Wave Video by inserting a blog post URL and letting the AI video generator populate text and graphics based on the content. The video background graphics, pacing, and text populated on the slides needed significant editing to be ready for viewers. I like how easy it is to change the video format and edit any of the content. Wave Video also has many live-stream video tools. Source Wave Video is free, with monthly plans starting at $16 (paid annually). Pros: The features of this software are very beginner-friendly, and the user interface doesn’t feel overwhelming. Cons: The stock images it pulled were lower quality than the other AI tools. The images were blurry and stayed on screen much too long before switching slides (video pacing needed editing). Best for: Livestream videos. Making the Most of AI Video How will AI-generated video help your brand? With just a few clicks, you can create amazing videos, which was unimaginable a few years ago.

Here's what we found. In today's world of powerful generative AI tools, having a top-tier AI video generator in your metaphorical back pocket is like having your own personal Hollywood film crew at your service. In fact, AI video generators are now so capable that major brands are switching from old video production methods to these modern AI-powered ones. Even the Tribeca Film Festival and other players in the film industry are jumping aboard the AI movement, highlighting just how dynamic and impressive these tools are becoming. But if you're reading this and think it sounds like AI video generators are just for the creative pros, don't worry because that's not the case. With AI text-to-video, AI-generated avatars, and tons of other awesome new AI video features, literally anyone can create unbelievably high-quality content. I made this anime trailer, and I think it’s pretty cool. The pictures, animation, and even the song were all generated by AI. Let me break down the process and tell you how it was done 👇 pic.twitter.com/Y117zidiei — Framer 🇱🇹 (@0xFramer) August 22, 2024 But with so many options flooding the market, it can be tough to figure out which tool is the right fit for you. Each promises to be the best, but how do you know which will deliver on that promise and actually be the best AI video generator? We made this guide to help you navigate the crowded field and find the tool that suits your needs. We've carefully selected and reviewed seven top contenders, focusing on what they offer, where they excel, and where they might fall short. So, if you've ever wondered, \"What is the best AI video generator?\" you're in the right place. What is an AI video generator? In the simplest of terms, an AI video generator is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to automate the video creation process. Instead of manually editing clips, adding effects, and syncing audio, these tools handle the heavy lifting for you. You just input text, images, or other media, and AI turns that into a complete video through text to video generation. By using AI, these tools automatically select the best visuals, create smooth transitions, and even generate voiceovers with realistic AI avatars. This means you can focus more on crafting your message and less on getting bogged down in the technical details. How do AI video generators work? AI video generators work by using advanced algorithms to analyze and process your input, whether it’s text, images, or other media. When you provide the content, the AI interprets it and makes decisions about how to structure the video. This includes selecting visuals, syncing audio, and applying effects—all in a matter of minutes. ✨ From Photo AI image to video with @LumaLabsAI's video model that came out today called Dream Machine It's absolutely state of the art and the best video model available right now I think It's able to highly accurately predict 3d surroundings from just a photo, I think up… pic.twitter.com/KDetDBdGIS — @levelsio (@levelsio) June 13, 2024 At the core of these tools is machine learning, which allows the AI to improve over time. The more data it processes, the better it becomes at making creative decisions that result in high-quality videos. For example, if you input a script, the AI video tool can generate corresponding scenes, choose relevant images or video clips, and even create a voiceover. The process is surprisingly intuitive. You simply provide the material, and the AI organizes it into a cohesive video that aligns with your vision. How we chose the best AI video generators To ensure you pick the best AI video generators and generative AI editing tools, we chose products that truly deliver on their promises of creating amazing videos. No matter how skilled you are at video editing, you need an AI tool that simplifies the process. Next, we evaluated the range of features. A great AI video maker should offer more than just basic editing—it should allow you to customize and tweak your video clips until they look like they were made by a professional film crew. We also compared the pricing plans, ensuring that they offer a solid mix of features without breaking the bank. Our goal was to find tools that help you save time and money. ‍ 1. AI Studios by Deepbrain AI DeepBrain AI’s video generator is a robust all-in-one tool that brings realistic AI avatars, natural text-to-speech, and intuitive video creation into one seamless platform. Whether you’re making educational videos, marketing content, or AI-powered presentations, it streamlines the entire process with easy-to-use tools and customizable features. The standout feature here? 150+ ready-to-use AI avatars that instantly add a human touch to your content. You can pair these avatars with lifelike AI voices, customize their look, and even use templates to get a head start. Tools like script generation, voice cloning, and text-to-speech make content creation feel effortless, even if you’re not a video editing pro. Why we like AI Studios by Deepbrain AI: New and powerful For teams, DeepBrain AI shines with collaborative features that let you sync up in a shared workspace. Add to that the ability to export videos in multiple formats, and you’ve got a powerful tool for turning ideas into polished videos – fast. Whether you're experimenting with the free plan or scaling up with Team and Enterprise options, the flexibility here ensures there’s something for everyone. Where AI Studios could improve We love the power and usability of this tool, but since they are relatively new to the space, they could benefit from more brand recognition. Once more people are familiar with this tool and how it can help with creative workflow, we are confident it will be a go-to product for designers and creatives of all stripes. Pricing options: Free plan ($0.00) Personal ($24.00/month) Team ($55.00/month) Enterprise (Custom) 2. Luma Dream Machine Dream Machine by Luma Labs is a video creation tool that uses AI to generate extremely lifelike videos. You can quickly turn your images or text prompts into professional-looking clips. The process of creating a video takes just a couple of minutes. Each video is about five seconds long and can include multiple shots, making them richer and more detailed than many competitors’ outputs. During my tests, some videos were ready quickly, while others took longer, but all captured motion better than any other tool I’ve tried. Whether you're crafting an epic scene or a visually intense moment, Dream Machine captures the essence of storytelling with visuals that feel straight out of Hollywood. Created product mockup videos with Luma Dream Machine V1.5 text-to-video model, and I’m really happy with the results. You can find the prompts in the thread, and you can use the same ones with Midjourney or Flux.#LumaDreamMachine pic.twitter.com/VISWZK8TEp — Gizem Akdag (@gizakdag) August 21, 2024 Why we like Dream Machine: Most cinematic If you're a creator with a flair for the cinematic, you're going to love making videos with Dream Machine. What really stands out is that you don't need precise details for motion areas, Dream Machine still manages to capture motion concepts effectively. Itfollows the laws of physics, ensuring that every shot feels grounded and realistic. Plus, it’s super fast! As their website mentions, Dream Machine can currently produce 120 frames in 120 seconds, which is not too shabby to say the least. Where Dream Machine could improve Although Dream Machine is generally fast, some users have experienced slower processing times when working on intricate projects with a lot of elements. The discard rate can be around 98% with Reddit users pointing that most of the videos generated are unusable because of random elements, incorrect motion, or distortion. Pricing options: Free Plan ($0.00) Lite Plan ($7.99/month) Standard Plan ($23.99/month) Plus Plan ($51.99/month) Pro Plan ($79.99/month) 3. Runway Gen-3 Alpha Runway calls their latest model, Gen-3 Alpha, the new frontier for video generation, and we are here to say that they could definitely be right. The Gen-3 Alpha supports text to video, image to video, advanced camera control, multi motion brush, and after testing some of these features out, we were seriously impressed by how smooth and sharp the results are. The video creation workflow feels super streamlined, thanks to the improved fidelity and motion—it’s clear this model was built for powerful things. Add expressiveness and intention to your generations with Multi Motion Brush. Learn how with today's Runway Academy: https://t.co/EUbxc4aA0D pic.twitter.com/qredD7vsXu — Runway (@runwayml) January 23, 2024 Why we like Runway: Most dynamic Runway's Gen-3 Alpha is one of the most impressive AI video generators we’ve come across. Not only is it a powerful tool for video that makes content creation seem limitless, but it has a shockingly friendly interface and is easy to use. With the Multi Motion Brush, you can select up to five areas with independent motion and control across 3 directional axis (x, y, z) for more precise and expressive generations. Another highlight is how well it handles human-like characters. The AI generates lifelike figures with natural expressions and gestures, adding a level of realism that’s hard to beat. We aren't exaggerating when we say you'll likely be blown away by what you generate with this tool. The videos are truly cinematic and offer an exciting glimpse into the future of creativity. Where Runway could improve Runway is an extraordinary tool, so it is hard to say where it can improve. Of course, with such a dynamic AI video generator comes cost, which might be the only thing holding back casual users or if you're on a budget. Plus, it is true that sometimes the final results might look a little \"wonky,\" but overall the quality is top-tier. Pricing options: Basic Plan ($0 per editor per month) Standard Plan ($12 per user per month, billed annually as $144) Pro Plan ($28 per user per month, billed annually as $336) Unlimited Plan ($76 per user per month, billed annually as $912) Enterprise Plan (Customized with Runway team) 4. Hailuo AI Hailuo AI is an AI-powered video generator designed to make content creation simple but still extraordinary. Whether you’re making cinematic videos for marketing, detailedproduct explainers, or social media ads, this tool automates the heavy lifting—giving you professional-looking results in minutes. Instead of spending hours fine-tuning every frame, creators can focus on storytelling while the AI ensures smooth motion, clean edits, and stunning visuals. #Hailuo AI is absolutely insane for creating Hollywood-style blockbuster scenes! 🎬🔥 Every test is a thrill pic.twitter.com/idaAJWb2BZ — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) March 6, 2025 Why we like Hailuo AI: Fast yet eye-popping For businesses and content creators who need speed, flexibility, and truly remarkable videos, Hailuo AI delivers. One of the standout features is its customizable templates, which allow users to tweak layouts, colors, and visual styles without advanced editing skills. So regardless of what kind of content you ar making, whether it's onboarding video or a marketing campaign, Hailuo AI makes sure your content looks tailored, not cookie-cutter. Where Hailuo AI Could Improve While the AI does a great job with automation, some users may find the customization options a bit limited. For example, while templates are helpful, they don’t always allow for fine-grained control over pacing and scene composition. Additionally, industries needing highly specific branding—like film production or high-end advertising—might need more flexibility in motion effects and camera angles. Pricing options: Standard plan ($14.90 per month) Unlimited plan ($94.90 per month) 5. Kling AI The Kling AI video generator produces highly realistic 1080p videos up to two minutes long, all from a single prompt. The key difference? It doesn’t just generate good-looking footage—it ensures movements and physics behave naturally, making everything feel more lifelike. Have an Amazing Day!☀️🙂☕️ Name: Flower Care Made with @Kling_ai 1.6 Text to Video#AIart Good Monday #MondayMotivation #Mondayvibes pic.twitter.com/MEvNj9HVrw — Jay Kay (@JayKay65220066) March 10, 2025 Why we like Kling AI: Smooth, natural motion What sets Kling apart is how well it captures human motion and expression. Thanks to its 3D face and body reconstruction technology, characters move fluidly and show natural emotions—all from a single image. Its physics engine also shines, allowing for believable object interactions and environments that behave like real-world scenes. Whether you're creating short films, virtual influencers, or AI-generated marketing content, Kling delivers a level of realism that’s hard to match. Where Kling AI could improve While Kling is impressive, it’s not perfect. Some users report slow processing times, especially for highly detailed scenes. Occasionally, minor inconsistencies appear, like hand distortions or subtle motion glitches. More control over camera angles and fine-tuning details would make it even stronger for professional creators. Pricing options: Basic (free) Standard ($72.90 yearly) Pro ($293.04 yearly) Premier ($728.64 yearly) 6. revid AI This tool might be new on the scene, but for improving video productivity for socials, revid is quickly becoming one of our favorites. Their mission is all about helping creators like you make short videos that have a potential to go viral. Why we like revid AI: Best for social media What we like most about revid AI is that it has a specific focus. The AI does the heavy lifting from finding ideas, adding sound effects, creating scripts, and then transforming everything into viral videos for your social media content. It’s a company that knows its lane, and we can certainly appreciate its dedication to being the master of one instead of the jack of all AI video trades. Where revid AI could improve The main drawback with revid AI is that it is niche. This is fine if you need this specific type of content, but it may be lacking if you're searching for a more powerful tool. Pricing options Hobby ($49/month) Growth (Launch offer $49/month) Ultra ($199/month) 7. Colossyan Whether you're making screen recordings for employee training, video marketing content for social media platforms, or educational videos for compliance training, Colossyan offers features that simplify video making for established businesses. Why we like Colossyan: Best for large businesses Colossyan is awesome with AI video editing, offering tools like prompt to video and AI script assistants that help you create excellent videos without needing tons of experience. While it is definitely on the more corporate side of video creation, we saw this tool streamline the creation process and make it easy to produce high-quality generated videos super fast and efficiently. Plus, Colossyan’s extensive library of AI avatars and multilingual support make it a nice choice for large companies and diverse clients. Where Colossyan could improve While Colossyan has a ton of cool features, it may require a bit of a learning curve for those new to AI video tools. The sheer number of options, from AI avatars to multiple export formats, can be overwhelming for beginners. Pricing options Starter Plan ($19/month, annually) Pro Plan ($61/month, billed annually) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 8. HeyGen HeyGen is one of the more impressive platforms we tested. A big reason for this is because it is hassle-free and easy to use, so jumping in was a simple process. More specifically, HeyGen is one of the best when it comes to generating AI avatars. The process of creating a HeyGen avatar boils down to three steps: choosing or creating an avatar, recording or choosing a voice to go with it, selecting a video template, then letting HeyGen put it all together in a matter of minutes. Why we like HeyGen: Most intriguing video generator One of the coolest features of HeyGen is its AI avatars, which are constantly evolving. The platform frequently updates these avatars to include enhanced visual details, expanded speech abilities, and more lifelike animations. Another great feature is the change videos to multiple langauges. HeyGen allows you to create videos in over forty languages from your original video, letting you reach audiences from all parts of the world. Where HeyGen could improve While HeyGen offers a lot of flexibility, the pricing for the Team plan might be higher for smaller teams or individual creators. Additionally, the Free plan, although great for beginners, limits users to just 3 videos per month, which may not be enough for those who need to produce content regularly. Pricing options Free Plan ($0) Creator Plan ($24/mo) Team Plan ($69/seat/mo) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 9. Haiper AI After diving into Haiper AI, we quickly realized it’s a promising tool for anyone looking to explore the world of AI-driven video creation. One of the first things that stood out to us is how Haiper AI makes the video creation process both accessible and efficient, even for those just starting. With just 3 images, @escelce transported us through 3 different universes, holy cow! #KeyframeConditioning #AIvideo #MadeWithHaiper https://t.co/6FwlLObhIK pic.twitter.com/JZdJOq3QMb — Haiper AI (@HaiperGenAI) August 19, 2024 Why we like Haiper AI: Best for beginners What we appreciated most about Haiper AI is its flexibility and how user friendly it was. The platform allows for up to 10 creations per day on the Free plan, which is generous for a no-cost option. That, on top of the text-to-speech feature helps make Haiper a solid tool. For those who need more, the Explorer and Pro plans offer expanded features that cater to different levels of use. Where Haiper AI could improve One of the primary limitations is that the Free plan doesn’t allow for commercial use or watermark-free videos. This might be a dealbreaker for users who need to produce content for business purposes but aren’t ready to invest in a paid plan. Pricing options Free Plan (Beta, $0/month): Explorer Plan (Beta, $8/month, billed yearly) Pro Plan (Beta, $24/month, billed yearly) Enterprise APIs (Custom Pricing) ‍ 10. Synthesia Synthesia is a game-changer for simplifying the process of making (sometimes scarily) realistic AI avatars. With simple text-based prompts, Synthesia turns your script into a polished, video ready project featuring life-like avatars. Why we like Synthesia: Excellent for avatars Even if you're new to video Synthesia has an intuitive interface that makes creating and editing your video feel straightforward. You simply choose an avatar, input your text prompts, and watch as the AI works its magic, transforming your words into engaging content. Plus, the AI video editor allows you to tweak and refine your video, so you can take the time to make those small changes that really make your vision come to life. So whether it is explainer videos, content creation for blog posts, or other marketing projects, Synthesia is excellent for businesses who want to make videos for their products or services. Where Synthesia could improve One of the main limitations is the degree of control available for the AI avatars. The avatars do look polished, but the options for appearance and expressions are somewhat limited compared to more advanced tools. Pricing Options Free Plan (€0/mo) Starter Plan (€20/mo) Creator Plan (€59/mo) Enterprise Plan (custom pricing) ‍ ‍ Wrapping up: The future of AI Video Tools AI in video and avatar creation has come a long way. From quirky results to making videos you’d swear were real, AI's gotten pretty good at this stuff. But the trick isn’t just making videos look real—it’s about getting them to move right, too. With tools like Luma Labs’ Dream Machine or Synthesia, we see how far AI can go in understanding motion and realistic avatars. These advancements are opening doors to new ways to create and tell stories, and brands like Mcdonald's Japan aren't afraid to test it out. These tools aren't here to replace humans in the creative process; but to make it possible to do more, to be even more innovative, without needing blockbuster budgets. Thanks to AI, we’re moving toward a future where anyone can produce a mini-movie or use avatars for product demos. It’s exciting to think about how these tools will help us all be more creative and bring our wildest ideas to life. So, go ahead and play around with these AI video generators.

An AI video tool is software that uses artificial intelligence to assist in creating, editing, or refining video content. These tools use advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to automate complex tasks, improve efficiency, and improve the overall quality of video production. AI video generator capabilities often include automatic editing, scene detection, video summarization, special effects, and personalized content recommendations, making video production more accessible for users with varying levels of expertise. Benefits of using an AI Video tool for content creation According to a recent report, about 92% of video marketers think video content results in increased return on investment (ROI). AI video tools transform video production by facilitating faster turnaround times, reducing production costs, and increasing experimentation and innovation. Let’s explore the key benefits of AI video generators for content creators. 1. Increased efficiency AI automates repetitive tasks like editing out pauses and applying effects, reducing production time. Videos that once took days can be completed in hours or even minutes, allowing for faster content creation. 2. Effortless personalization AI can analyze data to tailor videos to individual viewers. Imagine educational content that adjusts difficulty based on a student’s progress or marketing campaigns with product recommendations specific to a customer’s browsing habits. Personalization allows deeper engagement and increases the impact of your message. 3. Accessibility for all AI video generators with user-friendly interfaces empower non-technical creators to produce high-quality videos. Pre-built templates and drag-and-drop functionality make video creation intuitive and accessible, democratizing the content creation process. 4. Global reach with localization AI can translate scripts and generate captions, breaking down language barriers and expanding your video’s reach to a worldwide audience. This allows you to cater to international markets and maximize the potential of your content. 5. Content experimentation at scale AI facilitates A/B testing of different video elements, enabling data-driven decisions about what resonates best with your audience. This allows you to experiment with various video parts, like introductions or calls to action, to optimize your content marketing for maximum engagement. Potential challenges of using AI video tools for content creation While AI video tools offer compelling benefits, it’s essential to understand the potential challenges of this evolving technology. Let’s discuss some key considerations when using AI video generators for content creation. 1. Ethical considerations and bias AI algorithms are trained on existing data, which can perpetuate societal biases. Be aware of potential biases in the AI’s output, such as gender or racial stereotypes, and actively mitigate them to ensure fair and inclusive content creation. 2. Copyright concerns AI tools that generate content based on existing data can raise copyright issues. Understand the legalities of using copyrighted material within your AI-generated videos and ensure proper attribution where necessary. Also, consider AI privacy and consider the ethical implications of using AI in your creations to avoid stepping into legal gray areas. 3. Creative control and nuance While AI excels at automation, capturing the human touch of storytelling and emotional resonance can be challenging. Nuances in humor, sarcasm, or cultural references may be missed by AI, requiring creators to carefully curate the creative direction and emotional tone of their videos. 4. Quality concerns AI-generated videos often struggle with maintaining consistency and realism, particularly in complex scenes or with nuanced human expressions. Additionally, AI systems are susceptible to hallucinations, fabricating details or producing false information. Key factors to consider when choosing an AI video tool A recent study shows that as many as 91% of consumers want to see more online video content from brands, To harness the full potential of AI for your video creation needs, here are some key factors to consider as you choose the right AI video tool for your business: 1. Functionality and your business goals AI has made it possible to generate professional-looking videos from scratch. Here are some key functionalities to consider: Text-to-video: This feature allows you to create videos based on a written script or storyboard. The AI engine analyzes the text and generates visuals, music, and even narration, saving you significant time and resources. Consider the level of detail and creative control offered by the text-to-video functionality. Multimodal AI: Does the tool leverage multiple forms of generative AI, such as speech recognition and natural language processing, to improve your video creation process? Multimodal AI can automate tasks like generating captions, translating languages, and optimizing audio for different platforms. Hyper-personalization: This feature allows you to tailor your video content to specific audiences. Can the AI tool personalize visuals, narration, or music based on viewer demographics or preferences? 2. User interface and ease of use Even with powerful AI capabilities, a complex user interface can hinder productivity. Evaluate the tool’s ease of use. Consider factors like: Learning curve: How quickly can you become comfortable using the tool’s core functionalities? Intuitive interface: Is the interface clear, well-organized, and easy to navigate? Drag-and-drop functionality: Does the tool allow intuitive video editing through drag-and-drop actions? Template options: Does the tool offer pre-built templates to jumpstart the creation process, especially for beginners? Collaboration features: Can you easily collaborate with team members on video projects within the tool? 3. Output quality and control The quality of the final video is crucial. Assess the tool’s ability to generate: High-resolution visuals: Does the AI produce crisp, clear video outputs that meet your professional standards? Natural-sounding audio: For narrated videos, is the AI-generated narration clear, and engaging? Or is it artificial and robotic-sounding? Customization options: Does the tool allow you to refine the AI-generated content to your liking? Can you adjust video styles, music choices, or voiceovers? 4. Pricing and scalability AI video generators come with a variety of pricing models. Consider: Subscription plans: Do they offer tiered plans catering to different needs and budgets? Pay-per-use options: Are there options for occasional users who only need the tool for specific projects? Scalability: Can the tool handle your current and future video production needs as your business grows? 10 AI video tools to elevate your content creation AI video generators can significantly elevate your video production game from automating tedious tasks to crafting personalized content.

Each with different purposes and outputs! I decided to break this down into three different categories: 1. Generative AI 2. Complete AI video generators 3. AI Talking head avatars Throughout the year I have used tons of AI tools for content purposes, I've discovered Kling AI, Runwayml, Luma dream machine, invideo ai, fliki ai, pictory ai, heygen, synthesia, veed and many many more. Let me show you how they work and what you can do with them! My Complete YouTube Keyword Research Tutorial 👉 https://youtu.be/taI_CktpwOU?si=98iQlVKVbj-gZB_1 Follow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/yourivanhofwegen/ for inquiries: youri@flowflowmedia.com #YouTubeAutomation #YouriAutomation #YouTubeCashCow 39 comments there's brand new AI video generators popping up every single day in the last couple of months I have tested dozens of them I noticed that there's a lot of different AI tools with different outcomes and ideas behind it and so because all of that I just want to split this video into three different categories that I use myself and that I think are extremely useful the first one is generative AI video makers these are AI tools that use generative AI to create new pieces of cont content which will come in useful if you need b-roll footage or if you want to create fictional pieces of content that are simply impossible to make in real life number two complete AI video makers these are AI tools to create a full video for you with a script voice over and video footage and then the third category which is actually my favorite and I don't really see this talked about a lot but this would be AI Talking Hat avatars for anyone that wants to create videos but does not want to show their face this is going to be perfect and I've actually made a couple thousand from these by using one of my favorite Tools in this category but more about that later now with all of that said this is going to be quite a long video so if you're interested to learn more about AI video Tools in all sorts of categories with all sorts of outcomes get settled relax and then let's dive in starting off with generative AI video tools one of the current market leaders for this is Runway ml this is what Runway looks like in order to start generating AI content what you want to do is head over to generate a video on the left hand side which will bring you here this is where you can create your video the way you can do that is by giving it a prompt which basically means that you're going to tell it what you would like to create now what is very important is that you click on this guide link right here this opens up this page which is a page that goes over everything you need to know when it comes to prompting on Runway now I know that this might sound boring and you don't want to go through all of this stuff but trust me if you do the results you're going to get from this are going to be much better than if you were to just go over here and then just type in whatever you think is good trust me that's not the best way to go about this however with all of that said let me put in my first prompt camera is angled up at a woman wearing an all red dress as she stands in a tropical rainforest with colorful Flora the dramatic sky is blue and it's sunny in order to generate this without any image reference or video reference make sure that you select genf free Alpha instead of the Gen free turbo version then next up you can choose the duration right here I'm going to go for a 5 Seconds clip and I'm going to click generate just like that runwayml is now going to put any work and generate my video and there we go this is what our video looks like now it did exactly as I asked as you can see we've got this women from behind angled upwards in a all red dress in in the rainforest on a sunny day that in my opinion looks absolutely fantastic and it generated that in about 1 minute but that's only just one example let's do one more a static camera shot create a hyper laap shot of traffic in the streets of Los Angeles at night this one I'm going to make 10 seconds and then click generate now this actually looks extremely realistic I would not be able to tell that this is generated with AI rather than someone actually standing there on that bridge and filming the streets and that's why I always say that this is perfect for b-roll within your videos if you needed a shot like this you could either go to the streets of LA and then film that shot or you can just tell Runway to create it for you now let's put it to the test for real let's do a close-up shot of a man with curly hair standing on the beach the sunlight highlights his curls and he smiles warmly the ocean waves crash softly in the background with a gentle breeze brushing his hair that is very detailed and it's going to include a person in someone's face sometimes these AI generators can mess up when they do that so let's put it to the test I'll make this 5 seconds and click generate and then this is what it came up with as you can see it did exactly what we asked in my opinion it is realistic it kind of still gives off a creepy Vibe but that might also be the camera angle you can tell the emotion on the face is a little bit different than a real person would probably have however still it looks like a very realistic person there's probably someone out there that does exist and looks like that but that's not where run way stops if you go back to generate a video and then select the turbo model what you can do is turn an image into a video and so that's exactly what I want to do so if you click here select from assets you can upload any picture you want what I'm going to do is upload this picture from Switzerland which is a beautiful picture which just shows its environment and I'm going to turn this into a flying drone shot so I will say turn this picture into an fpv shot flying over this area I'm going to make that 10 seconds I'm going to click generate and there you go so as of right now this is just a picture there's no existing video from this however with Runway we're now going to turn this into a video that looks very realistic and as if there was actually a drone flying over that area and there you go this is what it generated now as you can see this does indeed look very realistic and it's the exact environment from the picture and that technology is extremely useful because you can now use any picture and turn it into a video as if that that was actually a real video now to prove my point with that I'm going to turn this picture right here where this guy is just sitting behind his desk into a video where we can see him actually working and typing and and moving like a real person so turn his picture into a man working behind his desk on his laptop and as you can see that really just does look like that person is sitting there working behind his laptop looks very realistic to me now what you can see though is that he's looking to the right side as if there are some piece of paper or or some piece of information that he's typing into the computer which does not seem to be the case so it could still improve a little bit however it's safe to say that it does look realistic overall Runway generates impressive b-roll footage that looks high quality however even though this is a good tool that creates goodlooking content I kind of feel like they lack customization which is something that the next AI generative tool actually does a lot better which is cling AI this is brand new and very prom ing clling AI is actually highly customizable allowing you to get closer to exactly what it is that you're trying to create let me show you how it works on clling AI this is what the dashboard looks like now first of all I want to mention that clling AI is more of a broader tool than runway for example you can see all of these different styles now all of these are AI image generated not video however do not that that is possible but if you're here just for videos like we are you want add over to AI videos which shows up right there now just like I said on Runway I highly recommend you open up the best practice document for clling AI so that you can figure out exactly how to create a prompt that generates the best results this guide is extremely detailed but still I highly recommend you check all of this out so that you get good results now with that said let me explain how this works it's actually straightforward there's text to video so this is where you would put in your prompt just like on Runway way and all of the other tools in the video which for comparison Reasons I'm just going to put in the same prompt that I just did on Runway just to see what I can generate now if you don't scroll down you've got the settings part now this is what I like because it kind of allows you to have a little bit more control of the output and you can customize your videos a little bit more starting off with the creativity and relevance bar now with this bar you can tell clling AI how realistic you want the video to be so if you would slide it over all the way to creativity it would kind of be very imaginary it would create a shot that in real life might not exist or might not be possible if you drag this all the way to relevance it will be very relevant as to real life and the prompt that you put and so you can play around with this to generate the result that you like I'm going to put this at one since I'm going to be generating a shot of a men and I want that to be as realistic as possible if you got a Premium plan like me you can choose professional mode which will create better results you can then choose the length of the video 5 or 10 seconds as well as the ASC ratio do you want a YouTube format a short form format or maybe Instagram that you can just choose that right here then you can choose the number of generations so for example if you want four videos to be generated which will all look different you can do that just know that that is going to cost you more credits as you can see right here then you'll be able to dictate the camera movement however do note that this is not possible yet on the clling 1.5 version which is completely new if you were to switch to cling 1.0 you can see that you could choose the camera movement and so you can choose whether you would like it to be vertical whether you would like it to zoom in and then you can play around with this bar to dictate the camera movement once again giving you control of the output that you generate however I like to create the best video possible so I'm going to switch to cling 1.5 and then all that's left which is optional is to give a negative prompt so this works the reverse way here's where you can tell it what to not do so for example if I don't want the men on the beach to have dark hair I can say that so the man on the beach should not have dark hair with all of that said we are now ready to generate our video now do know depending on the plan that you have on clling AI I personally found that it can take a little bit longer than Runway to get your video done and as you can see our video is done now this once again does look realistic similar as to Runway I feel like the emotion on the face is a little a little bit off but that is happening to all AI video generators as of right now but apart from that it does look realistic we are on a beach you do have the waves in the background the curly hair did exactly what we asked it to do and after that I just started playing around with this tool take a look at this video that I generated so we've got a panda sitting at a cafe drinking a coffee while reading a book next to the window wearing glasses as you can see in my opinion this is absolutely fantastic it kind of even looks realistic obviously apart from the fact that a pan that cannot be sitting like that in a cafe but hey it does look realistic it is a super cool shot that in real life you would not be able to make but with cling AI you can get this done and from there I just continue to play around now here is a hyperlapse shot of traffic in La this is my fault as I prompted this in a very bad way for this tool specifically it's the same prom that I put into runway on Runway it did create a good result on cling it did not so for each tool the prom system that you should be using might be different then as soon as I got it right I created this hyperlapse of LA with a zooming shot which in my opinion is quite nice then I wanted to test if I can get a very realistic shot of a person sitting somewhere and this is what I created so the prompt was a beautiful Western girl with western style is sitting on a couch in front of the couch is a table on the table is a warm coffee emitting Steam and now this is what it created in my opinion Absol fantastic spot on exactly what I asked to create now with this I actually put the relevance at one so that it would create a good shot because previously I had created this shot which I believe the relevance was a bit lower and then as you can see the shot is nice like it looks good but then there's this random lag showing up right here and instead of steam coming from the coffee it's actually fire which is kind of unrealistic and crazy and so I redid this and then this is what it generated as well as this because I decided to put the output on two videos this is the second shot that it made also quite cool zooming in you can see your face through the steam which is quite an aesthetic shot so overall really nice results with this however there's one more competitor in this category which is Luna dream machine Luna dream machine allows a lot of fictional pieces of content to be made in kind of like this dreamlike sequin that really push is the boundaries of what is possible now if you're confused by that let me show you what I mean this is what Luma Labs looks like now the entire thing is exactly the same so we're going to have to tell it what to create with a prompt right here now just like the other tools they have a prompt guide which you can open by clicking on that link which once again I highly recommend you go through this so that you can check out how prompting works best on Luma now Luma like I might have mentioned in the studio as well is more of a tool that push is the boundaries of what's possible so you can see that I've been playing around creating some funny content and let me show you how I put this together so you would basically type in your prompt right there you would click here and then it's going to generate it down here now I've already been playing around with this as you expect me to do and what I noticed is that some of the more realistic shots are actually turning out worse on Luma and then more of the imaginary shots are fantastic on Luma so here you can see a shot of the Man Standing on the beach with the curly hair which in my opinion looks a lot worse than the previous two tools that we have tested this on I think you'll agree his face looks a bit odd the movement is odd it doesn't really work this is not good and the same goes for the shot with the women in the red dress Runway ml generated a much better result in my opinion and the reason for this is because Luma is a dream machine the name already says it so if Luma you should be focused on creating clips that are more in the creative imaginary side of things and so when I started doing that I started getting results like this where I put a dog on a snow J ski cruising through the snow which looks very funny however at the end you could see that the movement is a bit off so I went back to the prompt guide I adjusted things quite a bit and then as you can see this is what I managed to create which looks fantastic and then slightly after that I made this shot right here which might be my favorite so far that I made with Luma so my prompt was a cozy living room with a crackling fireplace and a cat sleeping on the rug and then this is what it created and this is really where you can see the power of luma come in it is still a somewhat realistic shot but it also has that kind of like cartoon kind of like movie style Vibe which I can show you in a couple more shots so this one I put Ultra HD the Lost Temple AGI and then this is what I created which also looks very cool and then to top things off I wanted to see what the government's cash Reserve might look like so I created a prompt saying slow FBF drone shot flying into the cash Reserve Vault of the government and then this is what it created which also looks absolutely fantastic so Luna dreamlabs is perfect for creators looking to add a unique Artistic Touch to their content because the boundaries and limits with Luna well you can actually push them quite far which allows you to make content that is kind of like unrealistic but then it looks realistic if you get what I mean let's dive into the next category which are complete AI video makers so when I say complete AI video maker I want to give it a prompt and I want to have it make a full video for me one of which which is the current market leader is inv video AI inv video AI can create a full video for you with just a prompt this is what inv video AI looks like in order to now generate a video you have to tell it what to create remember this is prompt to video so here in this box simply write down exactly in a detailed way which video you want to make today I'm going to make a video about why Lisbon is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe so here's the prompt that I created create a 10-minute video showing why Lisbon Portugal is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe us a mil voice make the video in English be informational to the point you may include jokes where applicable so I've told it how long the video should be what the video topic is which kind of voice over it should use the language that it should be in and creative directions by mentioning that they should be informational to the point but also they might include jokes where it comes in in a funny way so with that said I can now click generate a video and what it's now going to do is analyze our prompt so it's not generating our video yet it is analyzing The Prompt as soon as that is done it's going to ask you two or three follow-up questions in order to dictate in which way they can create the best video possible for your needs and this is what that looks like so they're going to figure out which audience they should tailor your video to so you can choose travel enthusiasts history Buffs or culture lovers based on which option you choose the script that it would write is going to be different I'm going to stick to travel Enthusiast as that's what my video should be for then the look and feel it can be inspirational bright or clean I will go with clean for this one as I just want a simple video to be done about Lisbon our platform isn't going to be YouTube but do note that you can also make this for Facebook or even Instagram Tik Tok Etc with that said if I click on continue which I just done now nid ai is actually going to generate our entire video for us including a script voice over video footage and anything else you'd like I can even add subtitles and all of that automatically with just a prompt and this is the video I created let me play it for you Lisbon Portugal it's a city that Whispers rather than shouts its beauty tucked away on the Iberian Peninsula it often gets overlooked for its more popular European siblings now even though the first result was pretty decent from here we can customize anything we'd like also with a prompting system so whereas pretty much any video editor or AI tool out there you still have to customize everything yourself what we can do on in video AI is tell it what we would like to change with a prompt and you do that in the command box right here now let's say I want to change the opening shot to the trm which is a famous thing in Lisbon I can simply type in change the opening shot to the famous Lisbon Shem I can then click on generate and the AI is not going to replace that shot for me and there we go it just changed that literally within just 5 seconds and so this is perfect because if you don't have any editing experience you can still edit your video but you don't need the technical skills all you need to do is just be able to tell it what you would like to change and so let's say I want to add subtitles to my video instead of having to go to edit and then manually adding subtitles like you would do in a normal video editor what I can do is simply type add subtitles click generate and there we go the AI is now going to add subtitles in just a second there we go to my entire video if I play this for you you will see that the entire video now has subtitles apart from editing with the AI prompt you can also go to edit which is right here and then manually select anything You' like to replace so for example if I scroll through my video and I don't like this shot right here I can select it I can then go to search on the right hand side and search for anything else so if I just type in Lisbon then I will search for that it's going to search within their stock Library which has over 1 million Clips available I can scroll through and then replace it with any other clip that I want for example this Palace clip right here I can click replace and then I can click apply changes and then as you can see once again the AI is going to change that for you and that goes for the clips as well as for the script which you can open up right here as well as music which you can open up right here and by the way in order to clone your voice on a video AI which is very easy to do you simply want to navigate to the three lines in the top left corner which is where you'll see plugins and then under that you'll find voices if you click on that you can see that I've already cloned my voice 242 days ago for you to do the same all you need to do is click on add voice right here and then you want to submit a file that is at least 30 seconds long mention this sentence right there which is basically for the permission now don't worry only you can use your voice not anyone out there can use your clone voice as soon as you clone it it is just you on your account simply submit that audio file of your voice right here in high quality recording and then your clone voice voice will appear right here within just a minute from there on in order to use it you simply want to name the voice so you can do that right here and then whenever you're in the prompt you would say use Yuri voice and then it would actually do so in case you want to try this out for yourself I'll leave a link in the description down below you can try it out for free but in case you're serious about using this to create content I do recommend taking a pay plan for which you can use the code yv H50 which will give you twice the number of video generation minutes in the first month of your sub description so leave all of that mentioned in the description down below so nid AI is really efficient and it allows you to create high quality content within just one prompt in fact I'm building a YouTube channel within video AI That's currently doing about5 to $6,000 in revenue from their videos but there's actually a few competitors that are worth mentioning one of those is called flicky AI to get started on flicky AI you want to click on new file in the top right corner and it will then show you this this now in order to go from here to generating a full video you want to click on start with in an empty file and you want to click on prompt they actually have many different ways for you to generate a video with flick a AI however prompt a video is right here you can also already choose the language for your video as well as the dialect but I'm just going to stick to the basics here and then click submit this is where you're going to put in your prompt now to keep this fair I'm going to put in the exact same prompt as I just did on a video and I'm going to Slide the duration for this video also over to 10 minutes the next up you can choose how you want your video to be made whether it be with AI media stock media AI avatars Etc they have a lot of options here I do recommend choosing stock media and then stock videos for your video to be done but do know that you can also create an entire AI generated video if you choose this option right here for now I'm going to get started with stock media and then click submit right here and there we go as soon as this bar is all the way loaded up our video will be done this is what it generated so all of these scripts that are showing up on the left hand side are not made by me but done by their AI now what I do notice right away is that the default video is only 2 minutes long while I told it to have a Max duration of 10 minutes which I would say the video needs to be 10 minutes I guess because they label it Max duration it can be anywhere between zero and 10 minutes however that part I don't really like is that kind of gives you a lack of control of how long your video turns out to be however with that said let's take a look at the first result that it generated Rosio square is the Beating Heart of Lisbon bustling with activity surrounded by beautiful architecture it offers the perfect setting for people watching sipping coffee and soaking up the vibrant local atmosphere now what you might have noticed again is that flick AI also has a voice cloning feature in my opinion this one sounds less good than on in video AI where my voice pretty much sounds like like me in terms of the clips and the subtitles I'm also not a big fan of how the default version turned out so let's take a look at how we can customize our video from here and so the way you would do that is by simply selecting a scene so on the left hand side you'll have scene number one scene number two scene number three and that basically goes on for the duration of your video If you select any scene like scene one for example we can customize anything we want from here we can change the script by simply selecting a part that you like to change and then adding whatever you would like it to be we can also change the footage by clicking right here on media and then that would also open up their stock Library so if I want to change this I can simply type Lisbon hit search and then it's going to give me all of the E clips that I can use instead so if I want to go with this train video I then click continue and then it will be loaded into the video which you can see right here they also have an auto pick feature which you can click right here which will make it automatically select a new video based on their AI technology and so this is what it picked so that's also quite useful and a fast way to change all the Clips in your video when it comes to these subtitles you can simply click on them which will make you select it then you can drag this anywhere around on your video you can also make it bigger and smaller by simply dragging it now let's say I want to have it in the center right here I can do it like this and then what I can do is Click apply to all scenes right here click apply so that the subt titles will show up in the same way throughout each scene of your video you can also choose any font right here let's say that I would go with Chango I can simply select it I can choose the font size so I can make this very small or very big and then I can choose the placement click apply to all scenes again and then there we go each of these scenes throughout my video will now have that exact same font one more feature that I like to mention is that they have an AI generative feature within flicky AI so if you go to Media you can go to generate right here and then with a prompt you can tell it what you would like to create which could either be an image a video or a sticker and so if I go with a video and I tell it to create a video of the goben Keon Museum in Lisbon and then I click generate it's going to generate a clip for me you then want to click generate video clip using this image if you don't like it you can also regenerate it let me do that actually because this picture was kind of dark this one is a lot better so then click generate video and it's making that for me right now and there we go this is the clip that it generated which looks fantastic I can then click use this video clip and it will then insert that clip into that part of the video which is really cool and so what you could do on flicky is create your entire video with Clips generated by AI apart from that you can customize anything you want however do know that you have to do this manually simply by selecting the scene and then simply change in whatever it is you want to change with their drag and drop kind of editing system so flicky AI can be great for you if you kind of want to get the first part done with AI technology and then from there you want more control in terms of customizing your video and so then there is one left within this category now this tool is called pictory ai pictory ai is good for repurposing content and mainly turning a script or a Blog into a video pictory AI looks like this you'll see that it's design is a little bit different and also the features so in order to get a video done you want to go to script the video which is right there and then you need to start off by pasting your script I basically added the same prompt into Chad gbt and then wrote this entire script for me which I will not copy I'll then paste it here in pictory Ai and then as soon as this is done analyzing I can click on proceed just like that and right now pictory ai is creating our entire video for us which will also have video footage as well as voiceovers ET ET and there we go this is the video that I created now remember on pictory we made the script ourselves however all the video footage that shows up on the right hand side is inde put together by Ai and so as always let's first of all take a look at the default video that it made for [Music] us all right so the first thing I noticed is that there's no voice over applied automatically to our video do know that we can indeed do this by going to audio going to voice over and then choosing any voice over you want from here depending on the plan that you have on pictory which I have a paid plan I can choose voiceovers by 11 Labs which are the best in the world so that is good the way you would do that is by simply scrolling through the list and then previewing a voice over by clicking on this play button right here now obviously as I've used this before I've got a couple favorites that I'd like to use let's say I want to go with Harry I simply click generate and apply and then they will automatically apply the voice over with the script to your video you don't need to sync it yourself you don't need to do anything yourself basically and there we go voice over applied and how you would go about making your video from here is very similar to flicky so you would select a scene in which you would like to change something for example the background clip you would then go to visuals and you would search within their stock Library so if you search for a Lisbon they will load up all the clips for Lisbon in their library for example this one right here which is a hyperlapse which looks really cool you would click on it and then it will insert it into your video automatically and that's how you would do scene by scene in order to make a nice video a part from that you can of course customize the subtitles by clicking right here you can then change the font so for example we might want to go with popins extra you can then choose the sizing so you might want to make this 20 instead of 24 you can make it italic you can underline it you can do whatever you want basically in a very similar way as we just saw on flicky AI once you have customized that I do once again recommend you click apply to all so that you take that style into each scene of your video rather than each scene looking different or you having to customize each scene separately and so that's really it when it comes to pictory Ai and let's take a look at category number three which is actually my favorite out of the the whole video AI Talking Hat avatars AI Talking Hat avatars are people like you and I that actually went into a Production Studio like this and then the company behind the AI tool actually clone them and makes them available for us to use starting off with synesia which is one of the most common ones and the most well-known products in this category to get started on Synthesia you want to click on new video now from here you will see a lot of different templates will start showing up so in I in my opinion is more so made for people that want to create PowerPoint presentations with an actual human being being present on the screen which is what you'll see back in the type of templates that they have available right here now you can also choose to start from blank just for this demonstration that's exactly what I'm going to do and then this is where they'll send you this is basically the syia studio this is where you can put your video together what you'll see that by default there's this AI Avatar showing up on my screen screen which currently looks like this if I select this it will actually open up the editing system on the right hand side so I can either choose to have this character show up full body in the video or I can also place this in a face cam Circle in one of the corners or anywhere basically up on the screen for now I will go with full body and then I'm also going to click replace Avatar this will then open up all the avatars they have available on synesia which if I scroll down you can see that there's actually a lot of them what you will notice though is that some are different than others you can see here Ada for example if I click on this you will see that this actually opens up a full screen AI character it's not just partly this is actually a full screen AI character and so this is going to be useful when you're trying to do ugc content or ugc advertisements or anything like that for that matter and there's different types of characters on air as well you can see that this one is probably going to do some sort of yoga workout and throughout this list you have people sitting on a couch basically at home you've got people sitting at an office you've got people in front of a bookshelf and so they're starting to roll out all of these different kind of characters that you can use for different purposes which is something I really like and so once you've chosen your character you can type in your script right here so I'm going to try out this yoga scene and so I'm going to paste a script that is related to that so I've just said welcome to this morning yoga flow perfect for beginners and anyone looking to start their day with energy and calm all you need is your mat and a few moments for yourself then next up if I click on this right here I can choose the voice over that I like to use for this video if you click on that Arrow you will open up all the voiceovers that they have available and there's actually a lot of them so let's say I will go with empathetic welcome to this morning yoga flow perfect for beginners and anyone looking to start their day with energy and calm it will then preview your text in that voice so simply go through the list and choose the one you like the most and so this way you can continue to build out an entire video so on the left hand side you can click on ADD scene you would then choose one of the templates or one of the AI characters again and this where you can continue to build out your video Welcome to this morning yoga flow perfect for beginners and anyone looking to start their day with energy and calm all you need is your mat and a few moments for yourself in my opinion synesia has good quality it's it's decent it is solid it is not the best of the best but it's good but let's take a look at my personal favorite within the list which is haen AI this is what haen AI looks like currently they have 204 AI characters that you can use including their CEO which is quite funny to see now if I scroll through the list of AI characters you will notice that they've got tons of different kind of characters available man female Outside Inside we've got someone sitting on the couch we've got someone standing in some sort of like office or maybe also just a house we've got an office right here another couch and then we've got outdoor scenes so this person is standing in nature and that basically goes on and on so I can continue to scroll down we've got people with laptops sitting at a chair there is so many different characters on here and this is the tool that I said I like the most simply because they have a lot of choice and their quality is good so the way you would create a video on haen is you would start start off by choosing a character that you would like to go with for example if I would like an office vibee from this lady right here I can click on the plus sign and then choose the sizing for my video which for me is going to be landscape and that would open up the haen studio from here you can preview your video on the right hand side and you can also load in either a voice over or a script so this can be text to video or voice to video so if I want to do this with text to video you would click right here which will open up the script part of haen from here you simply put in the script in this box or what I actually like a lot about haen is that they've got CAD jpt 4 integrated in the software so if I would want to make a video about Paris and explaining why it's so beautiful I can simply tell it make a video explaining why Paris is beautiful I will click Send and right now the script writer is going to do all the work for me so it will start off by asking what are the key points I would like to include so I will send back a couple of things that I want to include in my video such as the Eiffel Tower The Lure and the sand and then it will include that and there we go that was actually a couple of seconds it wrote the script what I can now do is either make it shorter longer more professional or more engaging but let's say it's already good from the GetGo I can click apply and close and then I will insert all the parts right here for you and that's all you need to do from here the only thing left you need to do is choose voice over which once again they have hundreds of them available and so you will simply choose one I'm going to go with that voice right there and now all I need to do is make sure that the length of the video matches up with how much we're talking so you can see that the script is showing up at the bottom right there so all I need to do is simply drag this all the way to the end so that the video will play for the entire duration of the script and so when that is done you can click submit and then you can click submit right there and it's now going to render your video known as the City of Lights it's a place where history art and romance come alive at every corner additionally what you can also do apart from going from text to video is uploading a voice over file and it will then automatically lips sync it with the character that you chose so let's say that I want to have this guy on my video but I want to submit my own voiceover file I would click right here on upload audio so that I can shoes from my library so what I'm now going to do is render this video as well and then show you the result the second part video emphasizes the importance of creating content that meets viewers expectations and so I really hope you can see why I like H Andi when it comes to talking head avatars I actually build a YouTube channel with one of their avatars and actually make me thousands of dollars in affiliate commissions because within the video I was promoting a product and then there's one left which is mentioned many times over over and over again this one is called viio viio looks like this now viio in my opinion is more of an overall content creation tool but as you can see in the top right corner they do offer AI Avatar videos so if you click on this you'll see that this is what opens up so on the right hand side just like on any other tool we've got the video that will display for us and then on the left hand side we will have a bunch of characters now as you would expect in order for them to show up in your video and start off you would click right here on the character that you like to use for example Isabella you would click on it then you choose the language that you like to use it's already set to English so I'll keep that and then you need to type in your script so I will do that right here and then click generate video and there we go that is now done from here you can continue to build out your video now V is basically a video editor as well which is good to see so you can click on the background you can change it to any color or you can add an image now let's say I want to have it green so that I can turn this into a green screen type of video and I want to have the character somewhere else on my video I can simply drag it to anywhere I like it to be but let's say I want to have it on the right hand side of the screen just like that I can simply drag her there and that's where she would now show up now from here I find it quite hard to start building out and structuring my video so viio does have these AI characters but it's not specifically focused on just that if I go back to the homepage you'll see that there is a lot of other stuff showing up as well so it is more of a bra Creator tool which maybe I'll make a video about later on in the year and so with all of that said I'll leave resources in the description down below and I want you to let me know if you like a longer video like this where I kind of go more in depth I show you some stuff I talk about it show you some results that I have myself Etc and also what other AI video tools or categories you would like to see me talk about about with that said check out the links in the description down below subscribe if you're new like the video of course and then I'll see you in the next video have a good day",
