Here are 10 insane AI tools that you should not miss as a video creator. The first tool on our list is called Gling.ai. This tool can help you edit your videos super fast by removing the empty spaces and bad takes from the raw footage in an instant. I have downloaded the app from their website. Now I am uploading the raw footage. Make sure to select the Language. I want to remove both the empty spaces and the bad takes in the footage. How this works is it recognizes the audio and creates a transcript of the video. It will remove those parts where we have repeated or left the dialogues incomplete. You can choose to include those parts in the video if you need. Unbelievably good right. The best part is you can download the output as video or directly export to other video editors like fcp, premiere pro or Davinci resolve and continue to edit the clips The second tool in our list is Runway ml. This website is full of mind blowing AI tools. The tools here can be broadly categorized into 3 major categories. Video generation tools. Video editing tools. Audio and subtitle related tools. For the sake of time, I'm going to demonstrate only one tool, the Inpainting tool which is my favorite among all the tools here. First you have to upload a video clip. Now draw over the object you want to remove from the video. It will be removed just like a magic. Next on the list is Adobe podcast. This tool can change your audio recording that sounds noisy into a studio quality one. Just drag and drop the audio files into the website. You will get the clean and crisp out in just a few seconds. Very useful for creators who don't own a fancy studio setup. At Number 4 we have the Auto-Subtitle Generator from Animaker. This web based tool can recognize and auto-generate subtitles for your videos in more than 35 different languages. Upload the video and select the auto generate option. Subtitles Will be generated in a few mins. You can upload both vertical and horizontal videos. We can also find customization options for the subtitles. The subtitles can be downloaded as a separate file in file formats like .srt .vtt etc or directly embedded into the video. At Number 5 we have the website scrip.ai Twitter, linkedin, facebook, instagram, and Tiktok it has tools to generate content for every channel. My favorite is the short video script creator tool. All you have to do is to feed in the topic of the video. You can give a description about the video but this is optional. Video script will be generated in a few seconds. At Number 6 we have Bard from Google. This can be considered as an alternative for chat gpt. While the free version of chat gpt is limited to past data Bard can search the internet and give you answers. So bard is a better research tool. One major drawback with Bard is that it does not store previous chat as Chat GPT does. At Number 7 we have Steve.ai This is a great text to video generation tool that can convert any text or blog into a video. Once you paste the blog link the tool reads it and creates a video script. We can create both regular videos or animation videos. It also has an inbuilt text to speech software to add voice overs to the video. So cool, right. For creators who are looking to create faceless youtube videos this can be a great option. The tool at number 8 on our list is VIDYO.AI . It offers you the easiest way to convert any long video into short clips that can be shared as tiktok videos, shorts or as reels. All you have to do is just paste the link of the video clip. It will generate it into several short clips. Very useful for creators who post podcasts as short form videos. At Number 9 we have the Nvidia Canvas It is a downloadable software that lets you create realistic portraits of natural landscapes by drawing simple strokes. You can choose from 9 different styles. You would be amazed to see how realistic the output looks. The tenth one on the list is Beatoven.ai It lets you create custom music tracks that you can use as background score for your videos. Give a name and duration for the track. Now select the speed of the tempo. Finally you have to select the style before generating the music. Your supercool audio track will be ready in minutes. Very impressive right? With that we‚Äôve come to the end of this video. Hope you enjoyed it. For more AI related videos Subscribe to our channel.",

An AI video tool is software that uses artificial intelligence to assist in creating, editing, or refining video content. These tools use advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to automate complex tasks, improve efficiency, and improve the overall quality of video production. AI video generator capabilities often include automatic editing, scene detection, video summarization, special effects, and personalized content recommendations, making video production more accessible for users with varying levels of expertise. Benefits of using an AI Video tool for content creation According to a recent report, about 92% of video marketers think video content results in increased return on investment (ROI). AI video tools transform video production by facilitating faster turnaround times, reducing production costs, and increasing experimentation and innovation. Let‚Äôs explore the key benefits of AI video generators for content creators. 1. Increased efficiency AI automates repetitive tasks like editing out pauses and applying effects, reducing production time. Videos that once took days can be completed in hours or even minutes, allowing for faster content creation. 2. Effortless personalization AI can analyze data to tailor videos to individual viewers. Imagine educational content that adjusts difficulty based on a student‚Äôs progress or marketing campaigns with product recommendations specific to a customer‚Äôs browsing habits. Personalization allows deeper engagement and increases the impact of your message. 3. Accessibility for all AI video generators with user-friendly interfaces empower non-technical creators to produce high-quality videos. Pre-built templates and drag-and-drop functionality make video creation intuitive and accessible, democratizing the content creation process. 4. Global reach with localization AI can translate scripts and generate captions, breaking down language barriers and expanding your video‚Äôs reach to a worldwide audience. This allows you to cater to international markets and maximize the potential of your content. 5. Content experimentation at scale AI facilitates A/B testing of different video elements, enabling data-driven decisions about what resonates best with your audience. This allows you to experiment with various video parts, like introductions or calls to action, to optimize your content marketing for maximum engagement. Potential challenges of using AI video tools for content creation While AI video tools offer compelling benefits, it‚Äôs essential to understand the potential challenges of this evolving technology. Let‚Äôs discuss some key considerations when using AI video generators for content creation. 1. Ethical considerations and bias AI algorithms are trained on existing data, which can perpetuate societal biases. Be aware of potential biases in the AI‚Äôs output, such as gender or racial stereotypes, and actively mitigate them to ensure fair and inclusive content creation. 2. Copyright concerns AI tools that generate content based on existing data can raise copyright issues. Understand the legalities of using copyrighted material within your AI-generated videos and ensure proper attribution where necessary. Also, consider AI privacy and consider the ethical implications of using AI in your creations to avoid stepping into legal gray areas. 3. Creative control and nuance While AI excels at automation, capturing the human touch of storytelling and emotional resonance can be challenging. Nuances in humor, sarcasm, or cultural references may be missed by AI, requiring creators to carefully curate the creative direction and emotional tone of their videos. 4. Quality concerns AI-generated videos often struggle with maintaining consistency and realism, particularly in complex scenes or with nuanced human expressions. Additionally, AI systems are susceptible to hallucinations, fabricating details or producing false information. Key factors to consider when choosing an AI video tool A recent study shows that as many as 91% of consumers want to see more online video content from brands, To harness the full potential of AI for your video creation needs, here are some key factors to consider as you choose the right AI video tool for your business: 1. Functionality and your business goals AI has made it possible to generate professional-looking videos from scratch. Here are some key functionalities to consider: Text-to-video: This feature allows you to create videos based on a written script or storyboard. The AI engine analyzes the text and generates visuals, music, and even narration, saving you significant time and resources. Consider the level of detail and creative control offered by the text-to-video functionality. Multimodal AI: Does the tool leverage multiple forms of generative AI, such as speech recognition and natural language processing, to improve your video creation process? Multimodal AI can automate tasks like generating captions, translating languages, and optimizing audio for different platforms. Hyper-personalization: This feature allows you to tailor your video content to specific audiences.
