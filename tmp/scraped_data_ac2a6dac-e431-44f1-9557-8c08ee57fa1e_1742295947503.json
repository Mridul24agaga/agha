      "content": "How to Create Videos Without Showing Your Face About Courses Blog FREE MASTERCLASS Log In How to Create Videos Without Showing Your Face Not everyone who wants to create an eLearning course is comfortable showing their face on camera. That’s fine. You can be camera shy and still have a successful course. There are actually several types of videos to make without showing your face, and they all come down to a three-step process. Step #1: Assess When you are figuring out what type of videos to make without showing your face, think about the assets that you already have. Assess the digital assets and materials you have. PowerPoints are the best for many types of eLearning courses, but you can also use PDFs. Depending on what you want to show, you may not even need something created, as you will just walk students through a process on the computer. If that’s the case, think about the programs that you would walk students through. Step #2: Create Now, go back to your assessments and see what gaps you have. If you want to teach students something that you don’t currently have a digital asset for, go ahead and create one. As mentioned, PowerPoint is easily among the best tools for videos to make without showing your face. You may be hesitant to use PowerPoint or think it will be boring, but that’s not the case. Remember that your voice will be in the video even if your face isn’t. PowerPoints are also the easiest method. Step #3: Screen Capture Finally, it’s time to record your videos. Since all of your digital documents are on your computer, you’re going to use screen capture software to record your video. Your face won’t be visible. It will just be you doing things on the computer with your voice in the background. So, record yourself going through that PowerPoint or PDF. Or start your screen capture software, open the program you need to teach learners to use, and show them around step-by-step. You’ll notice that one of the best types of videos to make without showing your face is those showing processes. You can just walk people through using a piece of software, filling out a form, writing code, or doing anything else on the computer. For things that don’t involve a process, a PowerPoint will be ideal. Keep in mind that you can do this with any type of digital asset with information. It can be a series of photos, infographics, or anything else. You could even play videos on your computer (with or without sound) and add your voice as part of the lesson. We Suggest Loom You’ll notice that no matter the types of videos to make without showing your face, you will use screen capture software. We recommend using Loom for this. It is very easy to use, and you can even use it as an LMS, as it hosts your videos. There is also a free version of Loom that lets you create a limited number of videos. That free version should be enough for your first microlearning course, letting you confirm you like the software before paying for it. Conclusion To record eLearning videos without showing your face, start by assessing the digital content you have, focusing on PowerPoints. Create anything you need but don’t have. Then, use screen capture software and record your voice without showing your face. Want to create a successful online course?

comments here's how to make YouTube videos without showing your face we're going to show you the best ways to make faceless videos including some awesome AI tools so that you can start creating videos quickly and easily so I'm going to run through the top options for you but make sure you stick around to hear them all out because you'll likely find that the best one for you might actually be a combination of multiple of these options so the first method to make faceless videos could be to record your actions so that way you don't need to be on camera but you're showing something happening so it could be that you're recording your hands and you're showing you make something it could be that you're showing off a particular product or tool without you needing to be on camera now showing your actions could also be recording your computer or your phone screen to show something happening and this is great if you're going to create some sort of tutorial content but the idea here is that we're showing the thing or showing the action without us needing to be on camera now with this style of content you might choose to add in a voice over of you maybe narrating what's happening or you could even use an AI Voice or even just text on screen if you really don't want your voice in the video either and we'll touch a little more on those things as we go through as well the next option is to use stock video footage so you don't even need to go out and shoot all the video content yourself you can use stock footage sites that already have massive libraries of video files that you can then use in your videos to build out your story even for the types of videos that we make on this channel you'll see that there is a lot of stock footage that we use to help make the videos more engaging and to keep our viewers engaged so this is where recommend sites like story blocks motion array and even art list Maxs and I'll also have a bunch of links and resources in the description box so definitely check those out another way to do it could just be creating a slide presentation so think a keynote or a PowerPoint presentation where you've got the key information just listed on screen and then you can just cycle through the slides as your video obviously again we could add voice over we could add music and things to make it more engaging but depending on the video you also might not need to that help you create amazing looking slide presentations this is where you could use tools like canva that make the process really really easy or you can download pre-made templates from places like en elements and some of them look really really good another option is simply to have text on screen and some of these videos can be super engaging and there's videos out there that literally just have text showing up on screen that have millions and millions of views now usually when this is done it is in combination with some sort of voice over or narration human or AI but it could also be that you're just adding some music in with this text to help make it more engaging too and this is something that if you're animating the text or you're changing it up on screen enough that it can create a really engaging video just in and of itself too now while this is a suggestion I would say that if it was me I'd definitely be leaning into using this more in combination with your own footage or stock video files but it doesn't need to be either the next option is using photos or Graphics to create your video now this could be photos or images that you've taken yourself or you could also purchase images or photos that you could use in your videos online as well and you could either have these images showing up one by one either as static images you could also edit them and have them flashing up on screen to maybe match the music track that you're using or you can even add some simple animations to the images to make them more engaging now this is something that a lot of video editing tools out there does have some preset effects that you can drag and drop onto graphics and images to add a slow zoom in or a pan across the image but then there's also tools out there like cap cut which have some Next Level effects allowing you to quickly and easily create amazing looking videos just from photos there's also websites like playet and in video that will allow you to create animations really easy live on their websites to help you animate your graphics and images for extra engagement or for those of you looking for Next Level templates that you can customize up that's where invado elements would be my go-to place and again I got tutorials and a bunch of resources all linked below to help you with this stuff even further another option for faceless videos is to use animations like you would see in instructional videos so you might have seen those videos where there's a screen drawing things out or even more cartoon style videos where there's a character explaining something these can be a great simple fast and effective way for you to get your message across too now my top recommendations to help you create videos like this are doodle and animer now probably the newest and the fastest changing method of creating faceless videos is to use AI video generators there's so many of these tools out there now and they can help you generate everything from the video script to the voice over to adding video footage and music all within minutes now we've tried and tested so many of these tools and as I said this is an area that is changing really really fast but my top recommendation right now is inv video AI it's definitely worth checking out but you'll also find there's a bunch of AI Tools in software like cap cut as well that has a lot of this kind of functionality too so while these are my top recommendations right now to help you create faceless videos I personally think that if you can push past your comfort zones and get on camera it's going to allow you to build a deeper relationship and repour with your viewers much much quicker but I obviously totally understand if you can't or you really don't want to and again that's where one of these options or really a combination of these options could be the best option for you right now and still allow you to create some really engaging helpful content now if you want to level up your video editing skills you can download our free video editing guide which is linked on screen which which will take you through the most efficient video editing process we also have a dedicated cap cut course for those of you wanting to dive in deeper and to get up to speed quick you'll find links to those in the description box below along with a bunch of other resources to help you too I'll see you in the next video",

YouTube is one of the biggest platforms in the world, and has one of the highest earning potentials for content creation. YouTube offers endless ways to share your passions, with the potential to open doors to multiple revenue streams. Often, successful YouTubers turn out to be the self-made celebrities of this day and age. A faceless YouTube channel allows creators to share their passions and profit from them without every neighbour on their block knowing personal details about their life. While some people prefer to bask in the spotlight, not everyone dreams of this… to each their own! Essentially, a faceless YouTube channel allows creators to share their content without speaking directly in front of a camera. Rather, faceless YouTube channels prioritize alternative forms of presentation, such as animations, screen-recordings, tutorials, slideshows, on-screen text, and voiceovers to share knowledge and entertain audiences. One of the greatest benefits of learning how to start a YouTube channel without showing your face is that creators can remain anonymous and still earn a pretty penny. This is made true by the fact that a faceless content strategy is perfect for automation, allowing you to generate high quality, consistent content rapidly at a large scale through different AI tools. Here are a few reasons creators tend to opt for faceless YouTube channels: They are camera shy – Some creators aren’t comfortable sitting in front of a camera and talking to their audience. Stage fright is a real thing, and sometimes it’s simply not worth it to endure the anxiety that comes with being front-and-centre. The good news, you can always change your mind and do a face reveal to introduce yourself to your audience! They want their privacy – Even if you’re not camera shy, an advantage of having a faceless YouTube channel is the privacy it grants you. Unfortunately, being a content creator can lead to unwanted attention and harassment. People aren’t always kind online, and the YouTube comments section can often turn into a battleground with personal comments directed at creators. When you have a faceless YouTube channel, you can separate your digital identity from your authentic self. Anonymity – If you’re moonlighting as a YouTuber, it makes sense to have a faceless YouTube channel. While many companies are open to and even encourage their employees to be creators, some others haven’t caught up with the times. They feel like anything you do outside work reduces your 9-5 productivity. A faceless YouTube channel solves this dilemma! Reach a wider audience – YouTube channel ideas without showing your face can help you reach a wider audience by giving viewers a more educational experience – you can concentrate on facts and create valuable content. Many videos are actually more helpful to your audience if they can watch exactly what you’re doing rather than what you look like while you’re doing it! This is where hands-on videos are really useful, especially for how-to guides and tutorials. Related: How Much Money Do You Get Per View on YouTube?

Our tip is to test our different formats and styles to help find your groove. Creating faceless content can be more challenging for some than creating face-to-face content, so it may take a few tries to find what you’re good at. One of the biggest time savers is automating your content with the help of AI. For example, you can use tools like ChatGPT to help you save time with your script for videos. Lumen5 is another great tool and your gateway to video content, transforming written words into dynamic videos. Check out this guide on the best AI tools for content creators. Create your YouTube channel Once you’ve created some content, it’s time to get your YouTube channel up-and-running. Your channel is your public-facing page where you’ll upload all your videos.

You can also add links to your other sites – including your website, blog, online store, and social media channels. Once you’ve done that, you’re all set up and ready to start monetizing your faceless YouTube channel. Post YouTube videos consistently Consistency is key to building a community on YouTube and eventually earning a profit from your creations. As a faceless creator, you will have to work even harder to stay relevant and noticeable by your target audience. Posting everyday, or a few times a week, will make you stand out from your competitors and help you build a loyal following. Remember, don’t strive for perfection! Post as many videos as you can and eventually, your skills will sharpen over time.

These kinds of tutorials are all about teaching your audience something new and are a great option for creators looking for YouTube channel ideas without showing your face. For most how-to videos, your audience doesn’t need to see your face; they just need to see what you’re doing. YouTube is one of the most popular search engines in the world and a big portion of that traffic is people searching how to do something – from learning a musical instrument, creating beautiful nail art, or fixing vehicle problems. For example, if you’re fixing a nightmare plumbing problem, your audience wants to see what you’re doing with your hands, including how you’re using the tools and which pipes or valves you’re operating – no face needed! Other popular tutorial topics include: Life hacks Beauty and fashion Design Music Home renovations Sliday’s YouTube channel is a great example. It contains walkthrough videos showing how the audience can complete different tasks in Figma. Since there’s no narrator or voice over, each step is shown for a few seconds first before the demonstration of how it works. This helps the audience follow through smoothly. Pro tip: Include upbeat music to help your audience focus on the content throughout the video. Craft tutorials Showcasing how to do different crafts is one of the most popular faceless YouTube channels ideas, as it can cover a huge number of different topics and video styles. From teaching sewing patterns to making homemade soap to origami to designing lampshades to scrapbook hacks – the potential for craft tutorials is endless. The best part is, you will never need to show your face (or in some cases, even use your voice) for these tutorials to be effective. For example, Artkala specializes in captivating DIYs, life hacks, tutorials, nail art, and a ton of other imaginative ideas. Their faceless YouTube channel receives millions of views on their simple videos and is a great place to look for inspiration. Pro tip: Use voiceover technology to explain concepts more in-depth. STEM tutorials From teaching how to code online to educating others on how to use excel, tech tutorials are one of the faceless YouTube channel ideas that have the potential to really take off. Whether you use illustrations, animations, or share your screen, you can explain your ideas in the way that works best for you. For inspiration, check out Minute Physics for their straightforward illustrated videos, explaining physics topics and questions in a step-by-step way that anyone can understand. Created by Henry Reich in 2011, the channel has now grown to about 5.7 million subscribers thanks to its simple illustrations. Pro tip: Embrace simplicity and pass your message in an easy-to-understand manner. Art videos and illustrations Art videos and digital illustrations are another fun and versatile way to create YouTube content without showing your face. You can use illustrations simply to entertain or to explain ideas, depending on your YouTube channel idea. While most illustration videos on YouTube feature moving animations, you can also create stop-motion illustration videos. Thanks to digital illustration tools like ProCreate, you can easily create illustrated YouTube videos if you have some drawing skills – and lots of patience! Art videos such as teaching people how to sketch by hand, sculpt, or paint are very popular and high in-demand in the artist world. Creators like Proko post entertaining and educational art instruction tutorials, while also offering their more in-depth courses on the side. Pro tip: Use high-speed or slow-motion technology to highlight key parts of the video. Screen recordings Screen recording YouTube videos are extremely useful if you want to share more niche specialities. They are especially useful if you’re creating how-to videos for technical topics, such as ‘how to log in to Thinkific’ and ‘how to use Google Docs’. If you’ve ever watched an explainer video on YouTube, you’ve probably watched a screen recording video at some point. Many YouTube channel ideas without showing your face use screen recording software – but screen recordings themselves can also be a really effective form of YouTube content in their own right. Many businesses use screen recording videos as explainers and onboarding videos for their products to help improve customer success and show off top features. Zoom is a great example of this style of video – check out the Zoom YouTube channel for inspiration and ideas. Pro tip: Add intro and outro video clips to make your video more engaging. Cooking and food videos Who doesn’t love a good cooking video? Videos showing people what to eat and how to cook have become a profitable industry on YouTube, with channels ranging from simple food-related life hacks to deep dives into regional cuisines and complex cooking techniques. If your expertise lies in food, nutrition or a related topic, this could be the perfect YouTube channel idea without showing your face. Guga Foods is one example of a YouTube channel that’s successfully won millions of subscribers while rarely showing the creator’s face. Gustavo Tosta created Guga Foods to share meat-heavy recipes and inventive cooking experiments. One of their most popular videos is their 60 days dry-aged brisket experiment, which has an impressive 5.8 million views. This video only shows the chefs’ hands on a countertop – but it gives the audience everything they want. Pro tip: Sync your voiceover with the visual actions so that it’s easier for your audience to follow each step. Audio videos Meditation videos Meditation videos are a great idea for faceless audio-focused YouTube channels. Many people flock to YouTube looking for relaxation tips, calming sounds, and sleep-guides to help them find inner peace. The best part is that you won’t need to include many visuals, as listeners will most likely have their eyes closed. For an example of audio-only content, take a look at the Soothing Pod, which offers sleep meditations and bedtime stories. Most of their content features simple repeating videos of relaxing nature scenes, including waves, grass and rain – the most important thing is the audio content that guides listeners through different meditation and breathing exercises. Pro tip: Use AI to help with script writing. Podcasts For creators, audio-only podcast videos are one of the best YouTube channel ideas without showing your face. Whether you’re an educator, musician, or podcaster, this type of YouTube video lets you show off your audio content without distracting your audience with complex visuals. This kind of YouTube video also doesn’t focus as much on visuals, leaving less work for you. Dr. Laurie Santos is the host of The Happiness Lab podcast, which is a faceless YouTube channel that teaches listeners how to bring more joy into their lives through sharing wellness tips in this podcast. Pro tip: Limit visual distractions so that your audience can focus entirely on the audio. Commentary videos Commentary channels on YouTube are diverse, covering everything from true crime to celebrity news and more. If you want to create YouTube videos without showing your face, commentary videos are well-suited to this anonymous style of content creation. Iilluminaughtii is one of the most popular commentary channels on YouTube, racking up over 1.43 million subscribers with their video essays on corruption, crime and other exposés of corporations and individuals. The videos feature a combination of simple animation, video clips, photographs, and screenshots to illustrate each topic. They never show the creator’s face, giving them much-needed anonymity when investigating shady figures. Pro tip: Narrate using first-person to create a connection with your audience. Whiteboard videos Another really useful YouTube channel idea without showing your face that’s ideal for content creators and educators is whiteboard videos. Whiteboard videos utilize digital whiteboard and screen recording software to help educators illustrate different concepts. Whiteboard videos are a YouTube channel idea you can use to simplify complex information for your audience. Whiteboard-based YouTube channel ideas without showing your face can include: Math videos Science Languages Art and illustration Business and economics A great example of faceless whiteboard videos can be seen on the ExamSolutions channel by AirMaths. Many of their online video tutorials are explainer-style videos using a digital whiteboard. The tutor talks through concepts like math equations and scientific formulas while drawing step-by-step on a digital whiteboard. This format helps students follow along and learn – and it’s easy to replicate for your own YouTube channel without showing your face. Pro tip: Present the information slowly, like you’re chatting with a friend in the same room. ASMR videos ASMR stands for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response – and it’s gained quite the hype in recent years. It’s a type of video that emphasizes sensory sounds like the buzzes from a clipper during a haircut, gel nails tapping on glass, a puppy chewing on watermelon, or even whispers and scratches happening in an environment. These are sounds that one might ordinarily ignore. ASMR sounds help stimulate a soothing and relaxing feeling for audiences. A good example is this oil pastel drawing video from Building Toys. There’s nothing distracting the viewers from the sounds of the drawing. Pro tip: Use simple visuals to accompany your ASMR sounds. AI videos AI videos use software to create videos with AI avatars and voices, and are also a great way to create a YouTube channel without showing your face. You can create professional videos using a diverse range of AI avatars without needing to hire a film crew, actors, and editors. For example, YouTuber Jensen Tung created an AI channel that hit 100,000 views in 30 days. To try making your own AI videos, check out Elai.io. This user-friendly app lets you generate fully customizable videos in 40 languages with a real human presenter, using the text you already have in your course content. With Elai, you can utilize your existing content and turn it into engaging videos for your YouTube channel, all without showing your face. Pro tip: Experiment with creative prompts to shorten your creation time and effort. Quotes and inspirational videos You can never go wrong with sharing words of wisdom from popular philosophers and successful entrepreneurs, or even your own inspirational quotes. Turn these words of wisdom into text-on-canvas images and string them together to create a motivational video. Be sure to add inspirational background music that is soothing and matches the message of your video. Look at this example from Calm Motivation, which has gained thousands of followers and views simply from creating videos with spoken motivational statements to help inspire and motivate others. Pro tip: Ensure that your soundtrack and visuals match the tone and mood of the quotes you’re sharing. Book summaries Who doesn’t love a good book club? If you’re an avid reader, creating a book summary YouTube channel is the perfect way to share what you love without showing your face. Depending on how creative you want to get, while giving your book review you could have different animations or visuals in the background. Whether you are reviewing, summarizing, or critiquing and sharing recommendations, this faceless YouTube channel idea requires little effort and planning, except for sharing your thoughts.

Pro tip: Have a co-host or invite guest book reviewers to your channel for different perspectives Project videos Home decor and architecture People love to follow along and watch different projects get completed, either as a source of inspiration or entertainment. If you are good with your hands, why not record different aspects of your projects so that people can follow along? This is a popular niche industry that has the potential to do very well. It’s also another great way to create a YouTube channel without showing your face. For example, Homeedit is a home decor inspiration resource showcasing architecture, landscaping, furniture design, interior styles, and DIY home improvement methods. This faceless YouTube channel has millions of views on their project videos, and covers a wide range of topics. Pro tip: Develop a reusable intro and outro for each video and maintain a consistent theme. Gardening and plant care If you are passionate about nature and have a knack for gardening and planting, this is the faceless YouTube channel idea for you. The great thing about filming educational videos is that you don’t have to reveal who you are, you can just simply create content using your backyard, patio, or kitchen. For example, Huw Richards is a plant expert that shares all his gardening hacks while rarely showing his face to viewers. The Green Earth also shares videos on how to grow indoor plants, sharing useful tips without a gardener in sight! Pro tip: Make sure you film your content with good lighting so that your viewers can clearly see what you’re doing. DIY videos If you are ultra creative, DIY videos are a great way to create a YouTube channel without showing your face. People are constantly looking for nifty life hacks, and videos provide an entertaining way of educating others on how to do something in the most efficient way possible. YouTuber, HowToBasic, has over 17 million followers and an insane amount of views all from sharing DIY hacks for simple and seemingly ridiculous things to more complex tasks – while keeping his identity private. Pro tip: Inject humor and creativity into your content themes and video presentation. Science experiments Who doesn’t love a good science experiment?

For example, this video by Fun Science showing a compilation of experiments received a whopping 30 million views! Pro tip: Get creative with sounds and special effects. Visual videos Virtual tours The demand for virtual tours of all sorts has skyrocketed – all because people are curious creatures! Thanks to virtual tours, people can enjoy the beauty of different landscapes, look into luxurious homes or resorts, and tour underwater places all from the comfort of their homes. Virtual tours allow creators to take their viewers on a digital journey to various locations, landmarks, museums, houses, and unique destinations. It’s pretty straightforward to pull off if you’re already a travel creator. All you need to do is capture breathtaking images and footage during your trip, string them together to tell an interesting narrative, and upload to your YouTube channel. See how Virtual Tours TV pulls this off. Or how Erik Van Conover gets millions of views showcasing some of the most luxurious homes and places around the world. People will be so focused on the stunning views that you won’t need to show your face if you choose not to, making this the perfect faceless YouTube channel idea for any adventure junkies out there. Pro Tip: Figure out the story you want to tell with your video clips and images first before putting them together. Puppet videos If you are highly artistic and creative with a passion for storytelling, creating a puppet YouTube channel could be the way to go. It’s the perfect way to educate or entertain while remaining anonymous. Your puppets will have the full stage, leaving you out of the spotlight. The best part is, this niche is relatively untapped as there aren’t many puppet channels on YouTube, so you won’t be faced with much competition. Check out this creators puppet YouTube channel, nanalan’ official, for some inspiration. Pro tip: Create story narratives beforehand to help plan out your puppet show! Animation videos If you want to create interesting, addictive YouTube content for your audience, animated videos are a brilliant choice. Animation makes it easy to explain complex information in a bite-sized format that grabs your audience’s attention and helps them learn something new. One of the top animated education channels on YouTube is Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell, which has racked up a whopping 21.3 million subscribers — all without showing the creator’s face. This hugely popular channel uses minimalist animated content to educate and engage its audience on everything from what dinosaurs actually looked like to how the immune system works. The animations make big topics simple and easy to absorb. Pro tip: Combine creative storytelling with interesting visuals to keep your audience engaged. Slideshows For another straightforward YouTube channel idea without showing your face, you could try making slideshow videos. They simply involve uploading a presentation and adding music or a voiceover audio file to go along with the slideshow. You can also create slideshow videos directly on YouTube by uploading images straight to the platform as 4K TV Wallpapers and Screensavers does here. For content creators and educators, slideshow videos let you upload your webinars or masterclass content directly to YouTube, helping your audience access your content for longer, allowing more people to watch and learn from your live streams. This not only helps to extend the reach of your content, but it also gives you the chance to monetize your content on YouTube. Pro tip: Use beautiful visuals and ensure that each slide smoothly transitions into the next. Gameplay videos Another YouTube channel idea without showing your face is gameplay videos. Gameplay videos are direct footage from a video game, usually with a voiceover designed to show gamers what it’s like to play a game and how to learn tricks. Gaming videos are a very specific category of YouTube channel, and they’re not suited to everyone. But if you have a passion or business that revolves around gaming, this could be the channel idea for you! For inspiration, take a look at VanossGaming, which is now one of the top 20 YouTube Channels. Started by Evan Fong, VanossGaming has built up more than 25.7 million subscribers without Fong needing to show his face, although he occasionally makes guest appearances. Pro tip: Have a co-host or invite a guest to your channel for interesting dialogue. Documentary videos Vtuber videos Originating from Japan, VTubers are ‘virtual YouTubers’ who use motion-capture or AR face-tracking to create videos with a digital avatar. Similar to AI videos, VTubers often use anime-style characters for their digital personas, and they rarely show their real faces. One of the most popular English-language VTubers is Gawr Gura from HoloLive, who is the first VTuber to reach 4 million subscribers on YouTube. If you want to get started with this popular YouTube channel idea without showing your face, take a look at her content to see how it’s done. Pro tip: Use visual elements such as avatars and their actions to tell a compelling story. Silent vlogs Silent day-in-the-life videos are trending on social media, with people simply filming their daily lives. This type of YouTube video could also be classified as an ASMR video, as there is no talking. The best part is that this kind of video is unscripted and unplanned, leaving little work for the creator. Alternatively, you could also switch it up and do day-in-the-life videos with voiceovers. You still don’t need to show your face in these kinds of videos, just give viewers a taste of what it’s like to go through life with your POV. For example thisisMy’s perfectly executes the art of posting silent vlogs, letting the visuals in her videos do the talking instead. Pro tip: Don’t strive for perfection – post whatever your daily life is! Pet vlogs It’s okay if you aren’t a fan of the spotlight – but who’s to say your pet isn’t? In this day and age, if your pet doesn’t have their own social media platforms, what are you even doing? We live in a time where many pets are a heck of a lot more famous than their owners, raking in the big bucks. If you house an adorable animal with a unique personality, pet vlogs or day-in-the-life videos are the way to go. The creation process is endless, and the potential to create a successful faceless YouTube channel is more than attainable. For example It’s Ya Boy Winston is a popular channel from Winston’s POV, a sassy weiner dog. Pro tip: Try doing your pet’s voice overs using different sound effects. Landscape and wildlife videos Many types of documentary videos can be used as YouTube channel ideas without showing your face, and landscape and wildlife videos are extremely popular examples. While this idea is more niche and skill-based, if you have keen photography and videography skills and a passion for capturing the world on camera, this could be the channel idea for you! The best part? This idea is completely faceless. Nature, travel, and science documentaries all rely heavily on filmed footage without an on-screen presenter. Think National Geographic with its stunning photography and informational videos. Pro tip: Record high-quality video footage and pictures and string them together in a way that tells a compelling narrative, even if you don’t use a voiceover. Masked videos Masked videos are a popular content creation trend where YouTubers conceal their faces using masks, helmets, or other creative means to maintain anonymity or add an element of mystery to their videos. This approach allows creators to focus on their content, skills, or storytelling abilities without revealing their identity. An added advantage is you can record an unmasking video when you’re ready to let your audience see your face. Creator Axell is a dirtbiking pro that rarely shows his face, as his content mainly focuses on biking tips and tricks and bringing people along for his outdoor escapades. Pro tip: Pay special attention to your voice and vocal delivery. Since your face is concealed, your voice becomes one of the most critical tools for connecting with your audience. Compilation videos Compilation videos are a cluster of unrelated videos that usually follow some kind of theme. A great example of this is America’s Funniest Home Videos, which string together real clips of people hilariously failing in their lives. YouTube is well-known for its compilation videos – at one point or another, you’ve probably watched an array of different cute cats melded into one long video clip. This YouTube channel idea without showing your face is great for racking up lots of views without you needing to create the content from scratch. One of the top compilation channels is FailArmy, with over 16.1 million subscribers. This channel is all about putting the best or worst fails from around the world into compilation videos that regularly get millions of views. Pro tip: Make the video clips flow smoothly into each other. Product reviews and unboxing videos Another really popular YouTube channel idea without showing your face is product reviews and unboxing videos. With product reviews, you don’t need to show your face to talk about a product that you love, or that’s been newly released. Unboxing videos have also become very popular on YouTube, featuring the process of unwrapping or unboxing a new product step-by-step. These videos are focused on products – not you! This makes it a great YouTube channel idea without showing your face. The two most popular types of unboxing videos are electronic products and children’s toys. Take a look at FunToys Collector Disney Toys Review to see how you could use this YouTube channel idea to grow your audience. The channel’s host only shows her hands in her videos, keeping the camera directed at the products she’s reviewing. Pro tip: Zoom the camera into your actions so your audience can see the items clearly. Conclusion There you have it! 30 YouTube channel ideas without showing your face that cater to any and every niche. So, get out there and experiment with all the different ways you can start a faceless YouTube channel – eventually you will see how lucrative this industry can be, all while remaining anonymous.
