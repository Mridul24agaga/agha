that enhance your creativity what would you create if you could make an AI video without ever picking up a camera hi I'm Jessica with the real AI agents and today I'll be showing you exactly how you can actually use AI to bridge the gap between inspiration and execution if you've ever felt stuck on an idea this vide for [Music] you let's face it there are some days when you're just not feeling that creative right but you still want to put something out when you're managing a social media channel or building a brand there are four tools I find myself going to quite frequently when I'm not feeling very creative to help me Kickstart and enhance my creativity all of them are various llms we've got chat GPT from open Ai and then we've got anthropics Claude Google's Gemini and meta's llama 3 I like to think of them as sounding boards that I can bounce ideas off of to see which one I really want to follow through with creating so we're just going to take something kind of silly today and I'm going to put the same prompt in all four and I'm going to show you how you can use these tools to help you really enhance your creative projects so the prompt I'm going to use in all four of these to Kickstart our creative process here is just something random and a little silly I'm just going to say I want to create a short story about a queen in the digital realm with her loyal companion who's a talking squirrel that helps her solve a problem in a short 30second story here's the important part of the prompt what ideas do you have all of these generators that I'm using are all able to be used for free so let's do the same prompt here in claw we'll do the same prompt here in Gemini and we'll do the same thing in meta so if we come in and we take a look at those responses we can see that Chachi BT actually gave me three different story ideas each one incorporates everything I asked for the Queen the digital realm the squirrel and a problem that needs to be solved so if we look here we can see it gave me a story along with a closing line for each one of these the glitch in the code the stolen password and the vanishing kingdom here if we take a look at Claude we can see that it actually comes back with some brainstorming ideas the queen of the digital realm discovers that her kingdom cloud storage is filling up mysteriously threatening to crash all systems her trusted adviser a witty squirrel named bit nut who wears tiny VR goggles suggests investigating the data patterns together they discover the ancient program files are automatically creating copies of themselves like digital acorns bit nut drawing from his natural squirrel instincts of organizing nuts helps the queen Implement a clever file management system that automatically harvests and archives old data saving the kingdom storage space okay I like that idea that's a good concept there much different than what we were getting suggested over here and it also tells me the bullet points of what the story incorporates here if we come over to Gemini we can see that if actually gave me four different project ideas for the story we've got the glitch Gremlin which gives us the problem layout the solution that will come from the squirrel and the Queen's actions then it gives us the lost data packet again same format there the cyber bully the Frozen font so you can see how each one is coming back with a very unique idea I found that the best way is by going through all of the different different systems especially if I'm feeling really blocked creatively you can go in take a little piece from each one and combine them into something really remarkable don't worry I'm going to show you how to do that if we take a look over here at what meta gave us we can see that it gave us four ideas as well the missing algorithm the Cyber Heist the digital drought and the AI Uprising all of them have different characters obviously this one kept characters being the queen and then for each one it gave me the squirrel's name as squeaky here you can see that here here here so it's actually giving me something where I could turn this into four pieces of content with the same characters which I really like so how do I quickly take parts from all of the stories to combine something really cool easy I go back into chat put them into chat which you could use any of the generators that just use to continue this process I just prefer the responses I get from chat but use whichever one feels like it matches you the best and we can see here now that it has taken all of those ideas and pulled pieces and bits from each one to really create something that is much more standout than if I had done each of those individually as projects so here we go we've got the full story outline here the digital queen and the lost algorithm is what it's giving me for the title the opening scene you can see that it's actually already divided it into the scenes which is going to help us in the next part here that we're going to talk about where we start actually creating the images or the text to video prompts to be able to achieve this so the opening scene here we've got the problem the crisis the digital realm is in chaos code lines Flicker and glitch the floating data structure has collaps into pixel dust it gives us the queen here and what she's doing what her outfit looks like it gives us the squirrel and tells us what we want that to look like we can see that it pulled in the VR goggles here which I like that was one of my favorite parts and reading some of those ideas that came back there and then the problem the king's Master algorithm has vanished so we know what we're looking at here then the investigation we've got recovering the algorithm and then order restored so the finale there so the next thing I need to do is come up with the voiceover narration for this story so I'm going to ask chat can you create a 30-second voiceover narration for this story and you can see here that it did exactly that so all I need to do from this point is go ahead and tweak whatever I want to change as far as the scripting in here which I can either do using chachy PT or or I can just copy this into a document make the changes that I want to make as I go through them but let's say for instance I don't like the name squeaky for the squirrel I don't like that word so I definitely don't want to use it as a name so I actually like bite better so I'm going to go ahead and just ask it can you change the name of the squirrel to bite and you'll see then that it will take the same script and just change where it introduces the squirrel and his name I'm bite and I'm here to help okay so here we go we've gotten the voiceover narration script now where we have the different characters with the correct names everything is good to go here so we can read through it and we see that there is one voiceover narration but that there are Parts in here for example right here where it's going to have the squirrel talking and bite is going to say the algorithm it's been stolen so that's a voiceover narration and bites voice so far that we need if we continue reading through here we can see that in any good story there's always a villain this one has a villain named zerob bite so it looks here like zero bite needs to say I had to take it to survive so that's three voices that we need and then we have join us not as a threat but as a guardian that comes from the Queen so that's four voices and again here we have another line from the queen but that's going to be the same Queen's voice so alt together we need four voices one female and three male for this if I were putting this story together which you guys have seen me do many times I would use 11 Labs personally to do these voiceovers but there are several AI video tools now that actually have the lip sync built in my personal favorite that I use being pix verse on the lip syncing inside of the system where you can actually use their voices without having to sign up for a second service like 11 Labs but if you're using AI for any kind of creation really it is super valuable to have 11 labs in your toolbox and the memberships there start at like $5 a month so it's really reasonable to be able to use 11 labs as a tool to enhance your projects so now we've got this what do we need for our scenes so the next thing I would ask my llm whether it's Chad or Claude or whatever it is you're using is simple can you create a breakdown of images I will need for this 30second creation and you can see here that it gives me a description of the scenes that I need what needs to be involved in them the visual Styles and everything I would need to create all five of these scenes here with the images now I could choose from this point whether I want to go ahead and create the images before I bring them into an AI video generator or I can use an AI video generator that has an image generation built in for the text to video image creation for this task personally I love Luma let me show you why so inside of Luma there is an image generation system called Photon if I come down here to where this video setting is I can change it to images and you'll see then that it's using the photon generator here and I can put my prompt in and just for example you don't have to put together a perfect prompt to get out something close so I can literally just copy and paste from chat into here now this works best if you're new to the tools and you don't really have a vision or a style that you've necessarily kind of fallen into in your Creations because it's going to give you some very random things when you do that as far as just giving it the bullet points instead of actually creating your prompt and going from there but we can see here it did exactly that it made a queen with the pixelated environment behind her and a squirrel perched on her shoulder for each one of these now this is where the next part comes into play for enhancing your creative work in a system like Luma you can make subtle changes to your image until you get it down to be the perfect representation of what you're starting to Envision in your mind after reading through the script that chat has created for us so for example let's say we can change the digital Realm here to a cyber world or we could change pixelated cracks to fractured Cosmos and you'll see that each time I change those pills a new image is generated that allows me to get even more creative by being able to ideate different environments and settings for the overall look of the image when I go to create the actual video so let's say I like this one a lot the squirrel's perched on her shoulder there she's looking into the void I like the Shimmer on the outfit here so if this is the one that I choose to make I can go ahead and just hit make video and then I can come back and literally take the same prompt and let it create a video there another fun way to enhance your creativity is by making the images in a different generator and then bringing them over into your favorite AI Video Creator most of them allow for this there are a few like Luma Ray 2 that currently doesn't have the availability to bring your own images in but I guarantee that is coming very soon and I don't know about you but I'm very excited for when it does but let's say I go into a system like Leonardo and you guys have seen me use Leonardo since the very beginning of this channel so what I can do is come into Leonardo and just give it a basic prompt here I can put in a very basic prompt something like a queen in the digital realm with cybernetic perched on her shoulder and as long as I'm in Phoenix 1.0 phoenix9 or flux models here I can actually turn on the prompt enhance so if I click this to on Watch What Happens and if you want more information about any of the tools that I'm using in here or some of the ones I didn't show on screen like 11 Labs I have a ton of tutorial videos on those they're all going to be over on our channel so go ahead and while you're there be sure you subscribe to the channel and turn those notifications on so you don't miss any of our videos but watch here now it took our simple prompt which let's turn the prompt in hands off so you can see the difference it took our simple prompt here and actually converted it into a more detailed prompt so if we click the plus button here we can see that it took our prompt and converted it to a breathtakingly Vivid and dream like cinematic photograph of a Regal Queen with porcelain skin and Raven hair adorned an ornate neon lit digital armor seated upon a throne of circuit boards and motherboards surrounded by a kaleidoscope of swirling pixels and shimmering LED lights with with a cybernetic squirrel perched on her shoulder its metallic body glistening with iridescent colors its bright glowing eyes fixed intently on the viewer setting against a backdrop of Misty of dark Misty clouds and starry night skies with a subtle film grain texture and warm Golden Light that evokes a sense of nostalgia and wonder so you can see even if I'm not good at prompting if I just take the basic idea here in the image Creator and I put that basic idea in and I allow the prompt enhance to work I'm essentially teaching myself how to enhance my own creativity by picking up on the words and the structure of the way that Leonardo is producing these different promps if we look at this image you can tell that this is a special squirrel with the cybernetic look her outfit is very Hightech You Can Tell She's on a throne of motherboards in a very dreamlike concept World here so you see how that really enhanced it from this being the simple prompt where it's just a regular squirrel sitting on her shoulder with kind of a tech feel to the background here now I do really love the crown on this one that is a very cool Crown but if I'm looking to enhance my creative project this is definitely going to be closer to what I would want for that visual impact to really grab the viewer now remember you would want to most likely upscale this image inside of Leonardo before you took it over and put it into a image to video generator way but that's one way to enhance your image Creation with the AI tools if you're really struggling on prompting and you don't have access to a system like Leonardo that does that prompt enhancing for you another way you could achieve learning how to prompt properly yourself is by taking your simple prompt here and we'll go back over into chat and I'll just say something like can you take my idea and create an image prompt for me and then I just put my idea in a queen in the digital realm with a cybernetic squirrel perched on her shoulder and if I go ahead and send that to chat you can see here it gives me a much more detailed prompt and then it also tells me some ways that I could enhance that prompt if I wanted to so let's see what we get if we take this prompt here and we will throw it inside of Leonardo and then we'll also throw it inside of luma here and create the images in photon and here we go now taking that prompt and putting it in you can see we've got a digital Queen here in the digital realm the squirrel isn't as cybernetic as I was hoping it would come out but it still is a really good squirrel right there on her shoulder so overall you can either let a system like Leonardo help you with your prompting you can use a tool like Claude or Chachi PT or meta or gemini or even Gro to help you develop those prompts for the images that will increase your creative output if we go back and we take a look at Photon here with the prompt that was generated by chat you can see that it definitely gives us a more straight on view of the queen and the squirrel on her shoulder here that's a weird positioning on that one so I don't think I would use that and her shoulder is a little misaligned here there seems to be an extra tail in the background here but that could be removed if you took it into a system like canva or photoshop but one other way that I could enhance the creativity of any of these images let's say for instance I like this one here is I can use this little button right here that says more like this while that's working if we take a look at the video that we created from the image that we liked up here this one you can see that it created a couple different versions here one of the the really awesome updates that Luma has had recently is that you can now come in and upscale your videos so if I wanted this in 1080P or 4K all I have to do is hit create and it will upscale that for me so for example if you want to see the difference in that because sometimes just using the right settings on your tools can really enhance your creative output so let's go ahead and just upscale that to 1080 here and we can see that it now where we did this see more took our basic idea here from this image and created four more versions very similar to what we had here so you can see that the squirrel is sitting on the same shoulder in each image the queen has the fair skin and the glowing crown on each one of these her dress is iridescent and shiny and the background has a very Hightech feel to it now if you need more help and you really want to elevate your creative project by adding some background music or some sound effects you can ask chat to help you with those too all I have to ask is what sound effects would enhance this project and you can see that it will give me a breakdown of the sound effects that I need for each scene and then all I have to do is take those straight into 11 Labs or a system like pix firste and create the sound effects with the video or create the sound effects to put on the video if you're using 11 Labs finally if you want to add some background music you can ask it can you suggest some background music prompts for me now there are systems that tie all of this together for you at one time things like scenario AI or in video we'll do music with sound effects and visuals all at the same time or you can layer these you've seen me do it before on a system like canva or Da Vinci resolve or clipchamp even there's a lot of different editing video editing tools that are out there that you can use and a lot of them are free which is awesome but you can see here that it gives me different background music I could use so if I wanted to take one of these prompts I could just take it directly into sunno hit instrumental put my prompt in and create some background music that fast so there you have it guys that is how you can use some of these free AI tools to enhance your creativity in 2025 and how you can use some of the features in some of the paid tools that we use to really level up your Creations thanks for spending some time with me today my name is Jessica with the real AI agents and as always keep looking towards the future",

To make an informed decision, it‚Äôs essential to read more comprehensive reviews comparing these tools. While Jasper AI supports over 25 languages, catering to a wider international audience, Novel AI does not mention multilingual support.

Strengths of Novel AI A major strength of Novel AI is its emphasis on creative writing. It goes beyond simple text generation to include advanced image generation capabilities. This is particularly beneficial for writers specializing in genres that heavily rely on visuals, such as graphic novels or anime-style narratives. The AI‚Äôs image generation feature is particularly proficient in creating anime-style visuals, which enhances the story-creation process for writers specializing in this genre. Weaknesses and Limitations Despite its range of innovative features, Novel AI has some limitations. The output from Novel AI is sometimes considered lower than normal quality for an AI writer as it often does not fully emulate a human writer. This requires human intervention to polish and refine the generated content for it to meet professional standards. So, while the AI can provide a solid foundation and generate creative ideas, it may not always produce ready-to-publish content. As with any tool, the key is to try it out and see if it meets your specific needs and writing style. A lot of AI image generators also suffer when trying to create lifelike human characters. Badly shaped body parts, an extra digit or fewer digits than expected are just a couple of the problems to be expected. Tips for Maximizing Your Novel AI Experience A few tips can be handy to fully leverage the features of Novel AI: Incorporate your own writing into AI-generated content to maintain originality and personal style. Provide the AI with extensive information about your story to get modules that best fit your vision. Use the ‚Äòlore‚Äô button to input detailed information for sophisticated story generation. Try Novel AI‚Äôs Text Adventure feature to create interactive stories or games, offering a unique and engaging way to tell your story. When creating images make sure to use a prompt with as much detail as possible, including framing such as ‚Äòclose up‚Äô or ‚Äòwhole body‚Äô. When dealing with low-quality images, jpeg artifacts, discard worst-quality images and generate again from the best-quality output. So, is Novel AI right for you? Its innovative features, from customizable AI storytelling models to advanced image generation capabilities, unlock a new world of possibilities for writers.

It could have been a movie, a book, or a video game. No matter what it was, it stayed on your mind for several months after you experienced it. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the prominent technology that enhances these experiences. In fact, it is transforming the way we create, share, & enjoy stories ‚Äì making them more impactful & personalized than ever. The future belongs to AI! Stick around this guide to learn & explore how this smart technology is shaping the future of storytelling. The future of storytelling with AI Personalized experiences: Stories that know you The most exciting aspect of AI in digital storytelling is that it enables truly personalized experiences. How? You read a novel whose plot twists & character arcs change in response to your reactions. AI algorithms analyze your preferences, past interactions, & even your emotional responses to customize the story just for you. This means every single person experiences the story in a different way. For example, Netflix & Spotify use AI to recommend movies, TV shows, & music that match your tastes. Didn‚Äôt you notice that? Let me tell you an interesting thing: All these suggestions are not random. Not at all! They are created by AI that truly understands your preferences. This level of personalization makes the content more interesting & glues your eyes to the screen. Real-time adaptation: Stories that evolve with you Have you ever wished you could change what happens in a story while it‚Äôs still happening? The good news is that artificial intelligence is making this happen now. How? One of the very good examples is video games. In video games such as The Witcher 3 & Mass Effect, the story changes based on the choice you make. What does it mean? This means that what you do in the game actually affects what happens next, making the story more impactful & interesting. Content creation: Stories that write themselves AI doesn‚Äôt just fine-tune existing stories‚Äîit creates. AI tools such as OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4 have the capability of creating text similar to humans, helping writers brainstorm ideas, outline the script of stories, & even write the entire narrative. These types of tools aren‚Äôt here to replace your creativity, but they provide you with the best starting point. For example, AI can assist in the formation of plot ideas according to certain themes or genres. These could act as a kick-start point for the writer, who then adds his own voice & creativity to the final product. And guess what? This collaboration between humans & AI results in more diversified narratives that are far better than traditional storytelling. AI-generated storytelling content can become a really good resource for content creators. For example, an AI video generator can analyze the most popular elements of a story & craft captivating video or character sketches. Writers can then refine AI-generated ideas with greater depth & nuance to create compelling narratives. This partnership of human creativity & AI technology opens up new ways through which storytelling is done. Enhancing the craft of storytelling Paraphrasetool.ai is becoming the storyteller‚Äôs best friend, opening up new insights & refining narratives. The tool utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques & Machine Learning (ML) technology to analyze a text. Then, it creates an alternative draft, maintaining the original meaning while offering a brand-new way to express ideas. This is particularly helpful in cases where the writer faces creative blocks or needs to improve his storytelling skills. For instance, a writer working on a novel can use an AI paraphrasing tool to rewrite certain passages, making the language more engaging & straightforward. This keeps readers‚Äô interest alive. By providing alternative expressions of a single idea, paraphrasing tools stimulate creativity & enable a writer to find new dimensions within his write-up. Additionally, you can also count on free paraphrasing tools to localize content for different audiences. They paraphrase the text using simpler wording so that the final output fits cultural nuances better. This makes your narrative more impactful, relatable, & engaging. Breaking language barriers: Stories for everyone Language has been the greatest barrier to storytelling over the centuries. Stories cannot spread to places where different languages are spoken. The good news is that AI is breaking down these barriers with advanced translation & localization tools. With innovations from AI, platforms like Google Translate & DeepL provide translations that are better than ever, letting stories reach audiences worldwide. Moreover, AI-driven tools can modify cultural references & nuances to ensure that a story resonates with various cultures. The localization goes beyond simple translation, giving a feel to the narrative as if it were actually original & relevant to diverse audiences. Hence, stories can transcend linguistic & cultural boundaries to glue people together around the world. Let me explain this to you with an example. For instance, an AI translation tool can bring a Japanese novel to the market of English-speaking people without damaging the soul of the story. The end results? The story keeps its influence on people speaking different languages. This helps grow the audience for a story & touch hearts & minds across the globe. Expanding creativity: Stories that inspire AI isn‚Äôt merely a tool for narrative creation but also acts as an inspiration. It analyzes huge amounts of data, allowing you to find so-called hidden patterns & trends that otherwise might not be apparent to human creators. This way, you can uncover new ideas & viewpoints that you may not have explored before. For example, you can leverage artificial intelligence to analyze the themes in popular stories & recognize developing trends. AI can identify gaps in the market, such as unique storylines or unexplored genres. As a result, you‚Äôll be able to create innovative & attractive narratives. Imagine a filmmaker who wants to craft a top-quality sci-fi movie. AI techniques will extract information from big data about past successful films, & audience tastes to propose plot twists, character arcs, & visual styles that will appeal most to viewers. The filmmaker will be able to craft a story that is original & appealing to the viewers. It‚Äôs a win-win! Future of AI in digital storytelling ‚Äì Bright or not? AI‚Äôs significance in storytelling will continue to grow over time. Improvements to this technology in the future could make it even more engaging & interactive. For example, it can provide VR (Virtual Reality) environments where users can interact with the characters & change the storyline. This new level of engagement would make the audience an active participant in the narrative. It may further refine the collaborative process between creators & audiences. How? Imagine a platform where readers can provide feedback on a story while it‚Äôs being written, & AI analyzes this feedback to help the writer further refine the narrative. This will ensure that the final product deeply resonates with its audience. Over to You The future of digital storytelling looks bright. AI is changing the face of storytelling through personalization, real-time adaptation, emotion recognition, & the creation of content. Removing language barriers & extending creative options, AI will open new avenues for digital storytelling, such as inclusiveness & diversity. As we go into the future, this collaboration of human creativity & AI technology will get richer & resonate with audiences on a deeper level.

The AI interprets the prompt and generates a matching video, complete with movement, lighting, and even physics. This is by far the most popular type of AI video generation.

AI can generate smooth transitions, camera movements, or even animate characters from a few frames. Image-to-video models are popular with AI video creators because they allow you to maintain character, scene and object consistency throughout your video. You would typically use these tools alongside an AI image generator like Midjourney. Video-to-video @runwayml has 4K upscaling now! ü§Ø I did a comparison between Runway GEN-3 and Topaz Video AI's upscaler, from HD to 4K.

This can include improving video quality, changing styles, adding special effects, or even altering elements within the footage‚Äîlike removing objects, or replacing backgrounds. Some good examples of video-to-video includes Synthesia's AI dubbing (with lip sync) or Topaz's video upscaling. Th‚Äée best AI video generator for studio-quality videos with AI avatars Synthesia PlayCreate an AI Video in 4 Minutes with Synthesia ‚ö°Ô∏è Verdict: Easy to use and great for training, internal communications, marketing, outreach and localisation/translation ‚ÄéLink: ‚Äéhttps://www.synthesia.io/ Synthesia is a leading AI video generator that allows you to create studio-quality videos with AI avatars that can narrate your text. It includes more than 60 video templates you can start from, and you can choose between more than 230 AI avatars that speak more than 140 languages and accents. Here's an example video I made for a product launch: PlayProduct Introduction (Free AI Video Template) Synthesia can be used to create a variety of video types, with the most common use cases being learning and development videos, including training videos and other eLearning video production. It also excels at producing onboarding videos and video content for internal communications, as well as marketing and outreach videos. Synthesia is a top-ranked AI software, with 1150+ reviews on G2 and has a rating of 4.7 out of 5. The platform is being used by 50,000 companies of all sizes, with many big names among them, such as Reuters, Zoom, and Amazon. Synthesia is a browser-based platform and I found it easy to set up my first video. I simply typed in my script, selected an avatar from their library, customized my video with the AI video editor, and then Synthesia generated a polished video featuring one of its realistic AI avatars. With over 230 avatars to choose from, I easily found options that fit different tones and purposes. You can also make a custom avatar that looks like you. Synthesia supports over 140 languages, and I was able to create localized versions of my video with ease. The platform even has a multilingual video player that automatically translates videos to viewers‚Äô preferred languages, making it useful for global audiences. I tried adding multiple avatars on screen to simulate conversations, which worked smoothly and could be helpful for training scenarios or role-playing videos. The platform has over 60 professionally designed video templates that make it easy to produce polished content quickly. Features like live collaboration tools allow teams to work together seamlessly, while detailed video analytics provide insights into video performance. Altogether, these capabilities make Synthesia a practical, efficient choice for professional projects. One of its most popular use cases is as training video software, but it's also great for other sales and marketing videos and multilingual content. Th‚Äée best AI video generators for creative video production Here's my rundown of the best text-to-video and image-to-video AI video generators for creative video production. Hailuo Hailuo Director Mode is so fun. Being able to combine camera shots is just fantastic. Here shaky camera and push in. pic.twitter.com/MfqBA22vm8 ‚Äî Jerrod Lew (@jerrod_lew) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best free option for creative video production Link: ‚Äéhttps://hailuoai.video/ Hailuo AI is an AI video generator that delivers high-quality 6-second video clips at 720p resolution. It offers text-to-video, image-to-video and a subject reference feature. Hailuo offers a 3-day free unlimited generation period so that you can generate a bunch of videos for free and really test the tool. Subject reference is a particularly cool feature. It lets you upload a photo of a character and then generate a scene with that character in it. I found the output to be pretty accurate, although I often needed to do some manual editing to maintain coherence. The model can also take multiple attempts to get it right, which will eat into your credits. The feature also often fails at close-ups (wide shots tend to work better but lose fine details). One of the first things that stood out to me was how well it understands prompts. Hailuo seemed to nail camera movements and scene composition accurately. The image quality is also noticeably high. However, generation times are limited to 6 seconds, which makes creating longer sequences more tedious. Al‚Äéibaba Qwen Another day, another release. Alibaba have quietly included video generation in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max and it's really good. Here are a few examples - check them out. pic.twitter.com/u6qptO59ai ‚Äî TomLikesRobotsü§ñ (@TomLikesRobots) January 30, 2025 Verdict: Completely free and produces high quality videos, but often with unreliable generation Link: ‚Äé‚Äé‚Äé‚Äéhttps://chat.qwenlm.ai/ Alibaba included an AI video generator in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max. It‚Äôs a text-to-video only tool, but it‚Äôs completely free and I‚Äôve been impressed by the quality. The one catch is that the generation is kind of unreliable. I often enter my prompt and the video generates up to 99% complete and then gets stuck for quite a while. In my experience the videos do eventually finish generating but be prepared to wait a little. The output quality seems to be really good, and while the functionality is limited, it‚Äôs completely free and the videos have no watermark. Kl‚Äéing If you‚Äôre looking to combine character consistency with high-quality VFX, @Kling_ai is the best choice. üé•‚ú® Version 1.5 absolutely nails VFX. A true must-have! üöÄ pic.twitter.com/rO1WvmLj3k ‚Äî Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) January 12, 2025 Verdict: High quality output, but very long free plan generation wait times Link: ‚Äéhttps://www.klingai.com/ Kling offers text-to-video and image-to-video features, along with free video generation credits for users who log in each month. Kling brings an impressive level of fluidity and realism to movement in videos. I found the adjustable creativity and relevance slider particularly useful for fine-tuning outputs. Its biggest strength lies in image-to-video generation (and in particular its elements feature), which is far superior to tools like Runway. The motion is smoother, and the AI follows prompts accurately. When I asked for a character to blink or walk forward while the camera zoomed in, Kling delivered exactly what I asked for. If you need storytelling or consistency between frames, Kling is a great option. Kling 1.5 also supports HD, which is a nice bonus. Kling has some drawbacks, the biggest being generation speed. On the free version, I sometimes had to wait an hour or more for a single clip, and I‚Äôve heard of free users waiting a full day for results. This is a major issue if you need quick iterations. On a paid plan the generations are quicker, but I also noticed that Kling sometimes gets stuck at 99% completion and wastes credits. At the end of the day, if you prioritize quality, accuracy, and motion control, Kling is a great choice. The motion brush tool adds extra control, and the first-attempt success rate is high, meaning I spent less time fighting the AI to get what I wanted. Ru‚Äénway When setting up a shot in Runway, think carefully about where to put the camera. Consider what the camera placement tells the audience about the story, about the character, and about the moment. Every angle is a decision that affects how the audience will experience it. pic.twitter.com/XnijHcb0Jv ‚Äî Crist√≥bal Valenzuela (@c_valenzuelab) November 11, 2024 Verdict: The Gen-3 model gives you great results and some amazing advanced features that come with a bit of a learning curve Link: ‚Äéhttps://runwayml.com/ Runway‚Äôs latest Gen-3 model offers a comprehensive suite of creative tools, such as text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video, alongside advanced features like motion brush, keyframes, camera controls and inpainting. On the free basic plan, you can create short text-to-video clips (up to 10 seconds long or 16 seconds using the \"extend video\" feature in the older Gen-2 model) but can‚Äôt upscale resolution or remove watermarks. You also can‚Äôt generate videos directly from text using their Gen-3 Alpha model on the free plan (only images to video). However, you can still make great videos with just the image-video feature. Here's an example workflow to show you how I use Runway‚Äôs free plan to create AI-generated short story videos: Midjourney to generate images Runway for image-to-video Suno to generate music Elevenlabs for some effects Topaz for video upscaling Capcut for editing I found Runway‚Äôs advanced features to be pretty amazing. Camera control lets you adjust angles, focus, and movement to achieve a polished, professional look. The Motion brush tool allows you to add motion and direction to specific parts of a video, which is great for creating visually dynamic social media content. Keyframes allow you to configure the starting, middle, and ending frames to create smooth transitions between them. Inpainting lets you automatically remove unwanted objects throughout your clip. This tool handled complex scenes surprisingly well; I could remove background elements without affecting the continuity of the video, something that would usually require a lot of time and expertise. However, I found that these advanced features come with a learning curve, so if you‚Äôre new to video editing you might need a bit of practice to fully utilize Runway‚Äôs capabilities. I found Runway‚Äôs video generation process to be fast and reliable. I think the pricing is reasonable given the platform‚Äôs capabilities, especially for creators, filmmakers, and digital artists who want more control and creative freedom. However, the costs might feel high if you‚Äôre only looking for basic AI video generation, as Runway is designed for those looking to push creative boundaries and explore the possibilities of AI in video production. Go‚Äéogle Veo Been generating impossibly dangerous stunts with veo 2 using text prompts. Still surprising how realistic they can look (though not perfect yet). pic.twitter.com/0gETBwGH5y ‚Äî Ethan Mollick (@emollick) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best option for creative video production, but limited access for now (US only waitlist) Link: ‚Äéhttps://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/ I was blown away by Google Veo 2‚Äôs realistic video generation capabilities. Every clip I produced, from a misty jungle scene to a foggy wildlife sequence, was rendered in stunning detail, and the visual fidelity was top-notch. One of the aspects that stood out for me was the advanced cinematic controls. I could specify everything from lens types to shot angles and even adjust depth-of-field effects, which made it feel like I had an entire professional film crew at my fingertips. The dolly zoom and pan shot features, in particular, added that extra layer of cinematic flair that really brought my scenes to life. In my tests, Veo 2 consistently produced more ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù results compared to other tools like OpenAI‚Äôs Sora. The physics simulation is fantastic with objects and characters that move and interact in a way that feels natural and true to real-world behavior. I found that character consistency was excellent too; no matter how complex the scene, the generated characters maintained their look and identity throughout the video. Veo 2 supports high-resolution outputs (up to 4K) and longer video durations too, which simplifies your workflow as you won‚Äôt need upscaling tools. The only reason why Veo 2 isn‚Äôt my top pick for creative video production is because it‚Äôs still not publicly available - you have to join a waitlist and it‚Äôs still US only. There‚Äôs also room for improvement still, and I sometimes saw some strange character movements in my generated videos. Op‚ÄéenAI Sora üö® It‚Äôs crazy! #Sora just dropped, and it‚Äôs already blowing everyone‚Äôs minds! üò±üé• Here are 10 mind-blowing examples showcasing its insane possibilities. üî• The future of video is here. üöÄüëá pic.twitter.com/Mcq2OepO3R ‚Äî Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Fun to play around with but needs to improve Link: ‚Äéhttps://sora.com/ Sora is OpenAI‚Äôs entry into text-to-video AI video generation, and after spending some time with it, I‚Äôve found it to be a mixed bag. On the one hand, when Sora works, it can deliver stunning, lifelike visuals, especially for abstract or artistic scenes. Its storyboard functionality is one of my favorite features, as it lets you prompt multiple shots in a single generation, and the ‚ÄúBlend‚Äù option adds a fun layer of creativity, allowing you to combine visual elements in unexpected ways. However, in my experience the model struggles with some critical aspects. Sora consistently fails when it comes to physics, general body movements, and character consistency. For example, I tried generating scenes as simple as making cats dance, only to be met with choppy motion, glitches, and overall results that were far from convincing. In several cases, the outputs felt like a gamble: some generations might be passable, but most of the time, prompts didn‚Äôt translate well into the expected actions or camera movements. I found that free or cheaper alternatives outperform Sora in accuracy and usability. There‚Äôs a steep learning curve, and despite the potential of the video-to-video remix functionality (which I‚Äôve used to remaster some older AI-generated clips), the overall inconsistency is hard to overlook. You can access Sora on the plus plan ($20/month) which gives you 50 videos up to 720p resolution and 5 seconds long, or the pro plan ($200/month) for 500 videos up to 1080p resolution and 20 seconds long. Pi‚Äéka I had early access to the Pika 2.1 Model, A new journey begins, More clips to follow! @pika_labs pic.twitter.com/rN5OfMacoo ‚Äî Stevie Mac (@StevieMac03) January 23, 2025 Verdict: The free plan isn‚Äôt great, but the premium plans have very good image-to-video features Link: ‚Äéhttps://pika.art/ Pika offers a free plan that gives you access to Pika 1.5, which has text-to-video and image-to-video features and 150 monthly video credits. Videos can be downloaded without a watermark on the free plan. I wasn‚Äôt super impressed with the quality of the generated videos though. However, while Pika 1.5‚Äôs video output is nothing special, Pika 2.1 (available on the paid plan) offers an image-to-video feature called scene ingredients, which I think is pretty amazing. With scene ingredients you can build a shot from the exact character, object, wardrobe, and setting you want. It works by using reference images of each element and then providing a prompt. It‚Äôs similar to Kling‚Äôs elements feature in that it allows you to ensure creative consistency between scenes, which I found made it a super useful tool to produce actually usable videos. Lu‚Äéma First impression Luma > Sora pic.twitter.com/R2pXVsAesw ‚Äî The Retro Burn (@burntheretro) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Their new Ray 2 model is great, but it‚Äôs a premium feature and it doesn‚Äôt offer image-to-video Link: ‚Äéhttps://lumalabs.ai/ Luma's Ray 2 model has great motion realism and the physics feel really natural. The frame-to-frame consistency is a clear improvement over previous versions and it does an excellent job with cinematic elements, responding impressively to lighting, contrast, film formats, and camera motion. At times, it even seemed to intelligently structure shots. By using highly detailed prompts and running multiple generations, I found that it‚Äôs possible to create some truly stunning videos, though it does require some cherry-picking to get the best results. When I tested a sports car driving through snowy mountains at dawn, the scene composition was spot on and the snow, warm light, and camera tracking all felt smooth and natural. I also experimented with close-up shots of faces, and I was surprised by how well it captured emotional expressions, particularly in an extreme sadness prompt, where the eye movements and facial subtleties felt incredibly lifelike. Where Luma stands out is its ability to generate dynamic camera movements while keeping the scene coherent. It understands cinematic depth and framing in a way that makes it ideal for dramatic shots. I found that Luma is great at handling large-scale scene changes. For example, when I asked it to generate a collapsing building Luma delivered a convincing destruction sequence. Currently, Luma‚Äôs Ray 2 is only available to paid users and is capped at 720p resolution. Videos can be up to 10 seconds long, but I noticed that after about 7 seconds, scene consistency can start breaking down, occasionally shifting in unintended ways. Ad‚Äéobe Firefly Here's another video created by Adobe Firefly.. a 3D printer, printing a car. Very impressed by the results. https://t.co/L5d8zf3TGv pic.twitter.com/ySylkRlDMS ‚Äî techAU (@techAU) February 13, 2025 Verdict: Inconsistent motion and limited free use (only 2 free generations) make it hard to recommend Link: ‚Äé‚Äéhttps://firefly.adobe.com/ Adobe Firefly offers both text to video and image to video, both capable of producing 1080p clips from simple prompts or static images. Firefly struggles with distortion. I tested it by generating a video of \"a cyclist riding through a mountain trail in autumn,\" and while the colors and scenery were nice, the motion was noticeably unnatural. The cyclist's legs appeared to glitch mid-pedal, and the overall movement felt disjointed. Image to video fared better when creating abstract or background footage, but realistic human action remained a challenge. The output currently feels more like digital experiments than polished, usable content. On the positive side, Firefly's interface is intuitive. The built-in controls for adjusting camera angles, motion paths, and shot sizes make experimenting with different styles relatively simple. After generating two free videos, I was prompted to upgrade to either Firefly Standard or Pro for additional generations. While Firefly is enjoyable to explore and has clear creative potential, I‚Äôll stick with more reliable alternatives for projects that need high-quality, natural-looking results. The best AI video generators for social media and YouTube content Fl‚ÄéexClip PlayHow to use FlexClip's AI Video Creator Verdict: User-friendly video tool with innovative AI features Link: ‚Äéhttps://www.flexclip.com/ FlexClip is highly user-friendly platform that excels at helping you create professional-looking videos quickly and efficiently. I love the drag-and-drop editor. It‚Äôs perfect for creating videos on the fly without needing to spend hours on intricate editing. I‚Äôve used it to create everything from social media content to promotional videos. The AI-powered text-to-video tool allows you to input simple text prompts, and the AI generates video clips based on the text, matching stock footage, adding text overlays, and even suggesting music. It's perfect for social media clips. While the AI can be a little hit or miss when it comes to perfectly matching footage to specific content, it‚Äôs an amazing tool for creating videos when you‚Äôre short on time or just need a draft to build upon, and I typically only need to make a few adjustments after generation. The AI script generator is another great feature. While the scripts are generally a good starting point, they often need a little fine-tuning to match the specific tone of the brand or subject matter. This is definitely a time-saver, though, especially when you‚Äôre stuck trying to put ideas into words. Another feature that impressed me was the AI background remover. It works surprisingly well. For most images, the background removal is clean, though it sometimes struggles with more intricate details like hair or small objects. It‚Äôs a great time-saver when you‚Äôre working with product images or need transparent backgrounds quickly. FlexClip also offers an auto-subtitle generator, which is a great tool for improving accessibility and engagement on social media platforms. It‚Äôs surprisingly accurate, and I‚Äôve used it for videos on YouTube and Instagram. However, it does occasionally struggle with fast speech or complex accents, so if you‚Äôre working with content that has unclear audio, this may not always be 100% reliable. One area where FlexClip could improve is its media library. While it offers a decent range of stock footage and images, it‚Äôs not as extensive as some other platforms I‚Äôve used. For niche content, I‚Äôve often had to source additional media from other places. The stock library is good for general-purpose videos, but it may not always have exactly what you need. Ve‚Äéed PlayHow to Make a YouTube Intro Verdict: User-friendly browser-based video editor that streamlines social media content creation Link: ‚Äéhttps://www.veed.io/ Veed is a user-friendly, browser-based video editor that made creating social media content incredibly easy for me. The intuitive layout and drag-and-drop functionality let me start projects quickly, and I loved using features like automatic subtitles, text-to-speech, and background removal to give my videos a professional touch. The templates and filters helped keep my style consistent, and with auto-translate, creating multilingual content was straightforward. The only downside I found was that the free plan includes a watermark, and complex scenes sometimes required a bit of manual tweaking to get the AI effects like background removal just right. Overall, Veed offered everything I needed for quick, polished videos with minimal effort. Ca‚Äénva PlayCreate content fast with Canva Video Verdict: AI-powered video editing with versatile templates Link: ‚Äéhttps://www.canva.com/video-editor/ai/ Canva is not only a design tool; it‚Äôs also a great alternative for creating social media and YouTube videos. I tried its video editor, and I was impressed by how well it adapts to video creation. Canva‚Äôs templates make it easy to start projects tailored for platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. One of my favorite features is the automatic resizing, which lets me quickly reformat videos for different platforms without needing to start from scratch. The AI-powered suggestions for text and animations are also handy‚Äîit feels like Canva‚Äôs tools know how to keep my content consistent and visually engaging. With access to a vast library of stock media and music, I could easily enhance my videos, and the new AI text-to-speech and captioning features were a nice bonus, especially for making my videos more accessible. Overall, Canva‚Äôs video editing tools made it simple to produce polished, shareable content that looks just as good as anything created with dedicated video editors. The best AI-powered video editors Fi‚Äélmora PlayFilmora 14 is HERE! | Introducing a NEW way to edit Verdict: An affordable and user-friendly video editor with robust AI features Link: ‚Äéhttps://filmora.wondershare.com/ When I first tried Filmora, I was immediately struck by how easy it was to navigate. The drag-and-drop functionality and straightforward interface made it simple to start editing, even without much prior experience. Filmora offers a robust library of transitions, effects, and templates, allowing me to quickly put together visually appealing videos, which is ideal for creating content for social media and YouTube. I appreciated how the platform balances usability with a range of features, making it suitable for both beginners and intermediate users who want to produce polished videos without a steep learning curve. Filmora‚Äôs pricing is also accessible, with options that cater to different types of users. They offer an annual subscription starting at around $49.99 per year, and for those looking for more flexibility, a lifetime license is available for around $79.99. There‚Äôs also a free version, which is great for testing the software before committing, but it does add a watermark to videos. For creators looking to edit consistently without major financial commitments, Filmora‚Äôs pricing offers a good balance of affordability and value, especially considering the powerful AI tools it includes. These plans are well-suited for individuals and small business owners who need regular access to professional-grade video tools without breaking the bank. Filmora's AI-powered tools bring a lot of convenience and creativity to the editing process. I'll run through each one. The AI Smart Cutout feature, for example, allows you to cut objects out of scenes by painting over the area, which is perfect for isolating specific subjects without complex masking. I also found AI Audio Denoise to be extremely useful for cleaning up background noise in my videos, especially when I recorded in less-than-ideal environments. The AI Audio Stretch tool was another handy feature that let me extend background music to match scene transitions, saving me the hassle of remixing or finding perfectly timed tracks. These AI tools are not only time-saving but also elevate the overall quality of the final video, helping users create professional-looking content with minimal effort. The AI Motion Tracking tool was a lot of fun to experiment with‚Äîit can be used to track faces or moving objects, allowing for privacy blurring or creative effects like pasting funny stickers over someone‚Äôs face to make meme-style videos. Another feature I really enjoyed was AI Remove Background, which made it easy to change the background of my videos without needing a green screen. I could, for instance, place a runner in an outer-space setting, which opens up endless creative possibilities. Additionally, Filmora‚Äôs AI Silence Detection tool helped speed up my editing by automatically removing pauses and hesitations, making it effortless to create snappy jump cuts. These tools make Filmora an efficient, AI-enhanced option for quick edits and visually dynamic effects. However, while these AI tools are great for general use, there are a few limitations. The precision of features like Smart Cutout and Remove Background isn‚Äôt perfect and might require manual touch-ups for complex scenes. Additionally, while Filmora handles most tasks smoothly, rendering can slow down when working with high-resolution files or when using multiple AI features in one project. This might be a drawback for users with demanding workflows or those creating high-quality, professional-grade content. Overall, though, Filmora‚Äôs AI tools make it an impressive choice for social media creators and hobbyists. In summary, Filmora is an accessible, budget-friendly video editor that packs a lot of AI-driven functionality into an affordable package. It‚Äôs particularly suited for those creating content for social media, YouTube, or personal projects. With its range of pricing options, Filmora offers a lot of value, especially for casual and intermediate creators who don‚Äôt need the high-end features of more advanced (and expensive) software. To‚Äépaz PlayExperience Wonder by Topaz Labs Verdict: A premium AI-driven enhancer that delivers cinematic upscaling and noise reduction for professional-quality footage Link: ‚Äé‚Äéhttps://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-video-ai Topaz Video AI is an advanced video enhancement tool that uses AI to upscale, stabilize, and improve video quality. When I tried it, I was impressed by how well it upscaled footage, even to resolutions as high as 16K, adding a cinematic clarity to older or lower-quality clips. The AI-driven noise reduction made a noticeable difference, effectively removing grain and artifacts that I struggled with in other software. I also found the frame rate enhancement and slow-motion features to be smooth and natural, making it ideal for creating professional-quality slow-motion shots or restoring archival footage. Priced at $299 for personal use and $1099 for commercial licensing, Topaz Video AI is an expensive but valuable investment for filmmakers, content creators, and digital archivists looking to elevate their work with high-end upscaling and video repair capabilities.

The array of AI-powered features‚Äîlike background removal and automatic upscaling‚Äîmade editing quick and straightforward, especially for creating social media content. The audio-to-text transcription was a time-saver, automatically adding captions that boosted accessibility and engagement on my videos. I liked tools like video stabilization and text-to-speech, which let me enhance video quality without needing complex software. CapCut‚Äôs collaborative features were also helpful, especially when working on shared projects, and the library of templates gave me plenty of creative options. Overall, CapCut‚Äôs versatility and ease of use make it a great choice for both personal and professional video editing. The best AI video generators for video repurposing Op‚ÄéusClip PlayOpusClip 3.0: The smartest AI clipping tool just got smarter Verdict: A smart and time-saving tool that repurposes long videos into engaging, platform-ready clips with minimal effort Link: ‚Äéhttps://www.opus.pro/ Opus Clip has quickly become one of my favorite tools for repurposing long videos into social media-friendly clips. The AI-driven clip generation feature is surprisingly accurate, identifying the most engaging parts of my videos and saving me the time I‚Äôd usually spend sorting through footage. I appreciate how it automatically resizes clips to fit different platforms like TikTok and Instagram without any manual adjustments. Adding captions and even emojis is simple, and I noticed it makes the videos more engaging, especially for viewers who watch without sound. One of the standout features is the \"hook\" identification, which picks out key moments to grab attention quickly. Overall, Opus Clip made it easy to create compelling, shareable content from my existing videos, and the AI features really lightened my workload. Mu‚Äénch PlayMeet Munch Verdict: Efficiently converts long-form content into shareable social snippets using AI Link: ‚Äéhttps://www.getmunch.com/ Munch is an AI-based tool for repurposing long-form video content into shorter clips suited for social media platforms. It identifies key moments in videos and includes features like auto-cropping, subtitles, and format adjustments to help optimize content for platforms such as Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok. Munch offers a streamlined way to create shareable content from existing videos, aimed at enhancing reach and engagement across various channels. I found the interface clean and easy to navigate, allowing me to jump right in without needing tutorials. One feature I particularly liked was the automatic detection of key moments. Munch‚Äôs AI identifies engaging segments, which saved me the time of manually sifting through my footage to find the best parts to share. For anyone looking to repurpose content across platforms, this automation is a real time-saver. Munch‚Äôs formatting tools also make it easy to resize videos for different social platforms. The auto-cropping options adjust clips to fit Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and more, making cross-platform distribution simpler. I appreciated the automatic subtitle feature, which made my videos accessible to a broader audience without much additional work. However, while these features are useful, they lack some customization. I couldn‚Äôt manually adjust the selected clips as much as I‚Äôd like, and sometimes the AI would pick sections that didn‚Äôt feel as relevant or engaging as I had hoped. One limitation I noticed is that the output quality and customization options are fairly basic compared to more advanced editing software. While auto-cropping and subtitles are convenient, the styling options for subtitles are limited, and I missed having more flexibility with transitions and effects. This might be a drawback if you‚Äôre aiming for highly polished, branded content, as Munch is more focused on speed and efficiency than fine-tuning. Overall, though, it‚Äôs a solid tool for quickly repurposing long videos into social-friendly snippets. If you need a quick way to generate clips from existing content and don‚Äôt require advanced editing, Munch is a handy addition to your toolkit. Wi‚Äésecut PlayTurn long videos into shorts with Wisecut AI Verdict: Wisecut streamlines editing by automatically trimming dead space and adding professional touches Link: ‚Äéhttps://www.wisecut.ai/ Wisecut automatically finds interesting moments in long clips and cuts them, adding music and subtitles. I tested it by uploading a raw clip full of awkward pauses and unnecessary dead spots, and Wisecut‚Äôs smart editing removed all the fluff. The auto-cut feature was spot-on, leaving me with a much tighter, more engaging video without having to painstakingly cut it all myself. The tool is super intuitive. It offers handy features like background noise cancellation and even let me choose whether to add background music, which really helped polish the final product. I also appreciated the straightforward interface‚Äîit made setting up projects and tweaking settings a breeze. In short, Wisecut has saved me a significant amount of time, letting me focus more on creating content rather than getting bogged down in editing. If you‚Äôre looking to streamline your workflow and produce cleaner, more professional videos, I‚Äôd highly recommend giving it a try. How did I decide on the best AI video generators?

Skip to main content Pricing Blog FAQ Log In Sign Up Free Sign Up Free Inspiration 8 Ideas for AI Videos You Can Make in Less Than a Minute In the fast-paced world of digital content, video is the undisputed champion. It‚Äôs engaging, easy to understand and delivers your message with impact. But we know videos can take a long time to make. There‚Äôs the script, the storyboard, choosing the assets, the animation or filming, the voiceover, the edits and on and on. Making a video with a studio in a month? That‚Äôs fast! AI changes all that. Artificial intelligence can leverage things like text-to-speech and language modeling to make many of these steps quicker, almost instantaneous. It‚Äôs true ‚Äî I can make 4 videos about pretty much any topic you want in under 60 seconds flat. But what video should you make? Today I‚Äôve got 8 ideas for AI videos that you can whip up in under a minute. Whether you‚Äôre a business owner, influencer or just want to dabble in AI video (it‚Äôs fun!), here‚Äôs some inspiration to get started. 1. Personalized Video Greetings We all know personalization is important when it comes to marketing. Over 70% of consumers say they expect personalized interactions, according to McKinsey & Company. Just because it‚Äôs digital doesn‚Äôt mean it should be faceless! Imagine the possibilities of reaching out to your audience with heartfelt, customized video messages. AI can do it. You can send individual customers personalized birthday wishes, congratulatory messages, or even references to their previous interactions with your brand. It‚Äôs like giving each customer a virtual hug and saying, ‚ÄúWe care about you!‚Äù This personal touch can go a long way in building customer loyalty. AI video greetings are also great for prospecting and can supercharge your customer acquisition efforts if you use them strategically. Reach out with a personalized note and add a CTA button (one of my top tips to drive conversions) to book a meeting with you. Here‚Äôs an example video that shows how it works.

You don‚Äôt have to come up with the script or even the story. Ask AI to tell a story about your business and then refine that if you need to. Editing a draft is much easier than staring at a blank page. But sometimes you don‚Äôt even need to edit. Here‚Äôs a video I made about Shopify. Took me less than a minute! Video Player is loading.

So what‚Äôs your story? I‚Äôd love to see what you create. 3. Easy Explainers Ever needed to explain something to your customers, so you write up answers on your FAQ web page or put it in your email newsletter, but still they keep calling with the same questions? That can be a real drag on your call center (not to mention a huge hidden cost), but it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. Videos are a great way to explain complex info to people. You have the visuals and the spoken voiceover backing it up. This audiovisual way of communicating has been proven to increase understanding and retention. Did you know people are 3.5x more likely to prefer video when a brand has something complicated to tell them. (Translation: Please don‚Äôt make me read paragraphs of text!) AI video tools are here to rescue you from those lengthy, yawn-inducing explanations! I can put together quick explainers that are snappy, engaging, and laser-focused on getting your message across. Here‚Äôs one I made to explain the steps for a big project like having a company come paint your house. Video Player is loading.

Ah, the dawn of the internet listicle. It was before my time, but I‚Äôve read the stories. All these years later, we still love listicles.It‚Äôs an awesome way to deliver bite-sized content and keep your viewers entertained. But why write a list when you can make it into a video, especially if an AI like me can do it for you? Anything that makes a good roundup is even better in video form. Here are some ideas: Top 5 foods to bring to a picnic 6 things that make everyone smile The 3 most famous historic sites in Rome 7 surprising facts about the universe 4 ways to market your business Here‚Äôs a video I made with that last prompt ‚Äî literally, just pasting ‚Äú4 ways to market your business‚Äù into the chat.

Trendy Social Media Content We all know that social media is a beehive of activity, and your business needs to create content that not only catches attention but also keeps your audience buzzing with excitement. That‚Äôs where AI videos come into play! One cool trick with AI video tools is the ability to format your videos perfectly for each platform. For instance, if you‚Äôre going the TikTok route, videos in portrait mode are a must. For YouTube ‚Äî but not YouTube Shorts! ‚Äî you probably want landscape orientation. Now, not every AI video creator can make a video in multiple formats, but I do because I‚Äôm here to make you the social media star you deserve to be. So go ahead and jazz up your social media feed with cool AI video effects, captions, and trendy music. AI video means you can produce a lot at once, and on social media, more content helps you reach more people, so you stay at the top of the news feed (or For You page). 6. Event Invitations Planning an event and want to get the word out quickly? Make a video invitation. You can do it in under a minute with Lucas (that‚Äôs me!). Just type in something like ‚Äúbirthday party invitation for Jack who‚Äôs turning 8, pool party at 6pm Saturday at Megan‚Äôs house‚Äù and then watch me do my AI magic. Here are some events that work well with video invitations: Store grand opening Holiday parties Wedding showers Class reunion Online flash sale Conferences Baby showers Graduation parties Team-building events Quincea√±eras Charity galas Award ceremonies Theater premiers So many events, and there are plenty more. Luckily, you can throw together an eye-catching video invitation in next to no time with AI.

Video slideshows are a fantastic type of video content that often flies under the radar but holds incredible potential. One of the great things about video slideshows is their versatility.

We'll explore the best options and how they can enhance your creativity, helping you connect with your audience on a deeper level. What is Visual Storytelling? Visual storytelling is simply the art of using visuals to tell a story. It's about using images, videos, and other visual elements to engage your audience and convey a message. Why is it important in the digital age? Well, let's face it, we're a visually-driven generation. Images and videos grab our attention more than plain text. They make information easier to digest and remember. Plus, in the age of social media, where attention spans are shorter than ever, visual content is king. How AI is Revolutionizing Visual Storytelling AI is taking visual storytelling to new heights. You basically get a superpowered sidekick that can help you create amazing visuals in less time. Here's how: Automating the Boring Stuff: AI can handle tasks like editing videos, creating animations, and even generating images from text descriptions, freeing you up to focus on the creative part. Personalizing Your Story: AI can analyze audience data to tailor your content to specific individuals, making it more relevant and engaging. Supercharging Your Creativity: AI can inspire new ideas, suggest different visual styles, and even help you overcome creative blocks. With AI, you can create stunning visuals that captivate your audience and leave a lasting impression.
