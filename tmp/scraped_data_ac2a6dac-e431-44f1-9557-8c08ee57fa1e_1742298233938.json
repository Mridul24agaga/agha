An AI video tool is software that uses artificial intelligence to assist in creating, editing, or refining video content. These tools use advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to automate complex tasks, improve efficiency, and improve the overall quality of video production. AI video generator capabilities often include automatic editing, scene detection, video summarization, special effects, and personalized content recommendations, making video production more accessible for users with varying levels of expertise. Benefits of using an AI Video tool for content creation According to a recent report, about 92% of video marketers think video content results in increased return on investment (ROI). AI video tools transform video production by facilitating faster turnaround times, reducing production costs, and increasing experimentation and innovation. Let’s explore the key benefits of AI video generators for content creators. 1. Increased efficiency AI automates repetitive tasks like editing out pauses and applying effects, reducing production time. Videos that once took days can be completed in hours or even minutes, allowing for faster content creation. 2. Effortless personalization AI can analyze data to tailor videos to individual viewers. Imagine educational content that adjusts difficulty based on a student’s progress or marketing campaigns with product recommendations specific to a customer’s browsing habits. Personalization allows deeper engagement and increases the impact of your message. 3. Accessibility for all AI video generators with user-friendly interfaces empower non-technical creators to produce high-quality videos. Pre-built templates and drag-and-drop functionality make video creation intuitive and accessible, democratizing the content creation process. 4. Global reach with localization AI can translate scripts and generate captions, breaking down language barriers and expanding your video’s reach to a worldwide audience. This allows you to cater to international markets and maximize the potential of your content. 5.

This allows you to experiment with various video parts, like introductions or calls to action, to optimize your content marketing for maximum engagement. Potential challenges of using AI video tools for content creation While AI video tools offer compelling benefits, it’s essential to understand the potential challenges of this evolving technology. Let’s discuss some key considerations when using AI video generators for content creation. 1. Ethical considerations and bias AI algorithms are trained on existing data, which can perpetuate societal biases. Be aware of potential biases in the AI’s output, such as gender or racial stereotypes, and actively mitigate them to ensure fair and inclusive content creation. 2. Copyright concerns AI tools that generate content based on existing data can raise copyright issues. Understand the legalities of using copyrighted material within your AI-generated videos and ensure proper attribution where necessary. Also, consider AI privacy and consider the ethical implications of using AI in your creations to avoid stepping into legal gray areas. 3. Creative control and nuance While AI excels at automation, capturing the human touch of storytelling and emotional resonance can be challenging. Nuances in humor, sarcasm, or cultural references may be missed by AI, requiring creators to carefully curate the creative direction and emotional tone of their videos. 4. Quality concerns AI-generated videos often struggle with maintaining consistency and realism, particularly in complex scenes or with nuanced human expressions. Additionally, AI systems are susceptible to hallucinations, fabricating details or producing false information. Key factors to consider when choosing an AI video tool A recent study shows that as many as 91% of consumers want to see more online video content from brands, To harness the full potential of AI for your video creation needs, here are some key factors to consider as you choose the right AI video tool for your business: 1.

Can the AI tool personalize visuals, narration, or music based on viewer demographics or preferences? 2.

Customization options: Does the tool allow you to refine the AI-generated content to your liking? Can you adjust video styles, music choices, or voiceovers? 4. Pricing and scalability AI video generators come with a variety of pricing models. Consider: Subscription plans: Do they offer tiered plans catering to different needs and budgets? Pay-per-use options: Are there options for occasional users who only need the tool for specific projects?

Make a Video Updated: 12/10/24 Published: 06/16/23 Videos are integral to any marketing campaign; however, they can be tedious and difficult to create if you aren’t savvy with editing or are short on time. Fortunately, you can leverage many AI video generators to streamline your production and create content that engages your audience. But what’s the best AI video generator for your tasks? This article will explore 12 different AI video generators, their features, and how you can best use them in your next video marketing campaign. Time to press play on easier video creation. Table of Contents Can AI make videos? How to Make AI Videos Transforming Text to Video With AI What makes a great AI video generator? Best AI Video Generators Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video Can AI make videos? Yes, AI can make videos. AI video generators can instantly produce basic presentation slides with text, B-roll, and background music, all the way up to advanced videos of lifelike AI avatars “speaking” to you. AI’s impressive — but it’s not perfect. What works well with AI video generators: Video scripts. Being able to generate video scripts in a few seconds is incredible and saves so much time. Stock imagery, B-roll, and background music. Even though it still requires editing, having multimedia pulled automatically for you by the video generator makes it feel like you have an assistant. Video editing. The video editing capabilities are incredible and often beginner-friendly, which is a huge leap in the video editing world. What isn’t working (yet): Believability. The realistic AI avatars are incredibly advanced, but the mannerisms and articulation make it obvious that they're, well, AI. Pacing. Much research has been done on how quickly a video moves from scene to scene to hold viewers’ attention, and I found that not all generators factored this into their algorithms. Decision overload. The number of video templates, AI avatars, and effects available can overwhelm the editing process. AI is rapidly advancing, and some of these quirks will soon be passé. How to Make AI Videos The process for making an AI video will vary depending on the tool or platform you're using. Some generators work by analyzing and creating a video based on the script you uploaded, while others will follow a prompt typed in by the user. The key is to find a tool or generator with the features you need to create the kind of content you want. Transforming Text to Video With AI When ChatGPT catapulted to popularity in 2022, I don’t think the average marketers knew just how quickly AI video would follow. It needs to be used ethically to be useful to society, but when leveraged correctly, it’s an incredible tool. The most sought-after AI video feature is the text-to-video generator. This allows you to type in a sentence and, in a few seconds, be presented with an editable AI-generated video. I tested this feature using two different prompts: A vague prompt: “I’d like to educate viewers about AI-generated video.” A specific prompt: “I’d like to inspire beginner marketers to try AI video generation. The video should explain the benefits of AI video generators and should inspire viewers to try this new video tool.” I used HubSpot’s free AI video generator Clip Creator, and here’s what I saw. They were both high-quality videos. Both videos had appropriate stock images and music tailored to human behavior. The content was very similar for both videos. After testing many AI generators, I’ve found that a marketer’s time is better spent editing rather than making their prompt more specific. No matter how perfect your prompt feels, the end result will still require edits.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now What makes a great AI video generator? So, how does one evaluate all of the different software on the market? The best AI video tools all have a mix of these different features. Intuitive User Interface While most platforms list a long list of fancy AI features, users need an easy-to-use AI studio first and foremost. This enables a quick editing process. AI Scripts Automatically-generated video scripts save an incredible amount of time when producing video content. They turn written content (such as a blog post, email, etc.) or a prompt into spoken language. Sometimes, they even use an AI narrator to read it out loud for you. Not all software can generate video scripts, but it’s an enormous time saver. To be fair to the software that doesn’t offer this, it’s replaceable with a few clicks in ChatGPT. After trying more than a dozen AI video generators, I found the AI scripts were one of the features that made the greatest difference, along with the next feature. Factoring in Human Behavior Some software have tailored their AI to match user behavior, and some haven’t. For example, most people prefer videos with a brisk pace and visuals that don’t stay on the screen too long. In the video world, this is referred to as “pacing.” Not all software is tailored for this, and as a result, it will produce slow, lengthy slides that feel like a bad PowerPoint presentation. This isn’t a detail that software companies list on their “features” page, but it’s something that’s apparent based on the first draft of the video that the software gives you. Template Library Start from scratch? What is it, 2018? There’s no need to start from scratch with video anymore, as most platforms have built-in template libraries. Bonus points if these libraries include variation in: Intended audience. Aspect ratio. Project type. Editing Capabilities It’s normal for different software to offer different editing options, but most AI studios will cover the basics, such as: Text. Fonts. Music. Colors. Timing. Transitions. Animations. Stock footage. Different video styles. Pricing Tiers (or Free Plan) An AI video generator costs $0 to $50 a month (paid annually). All paid software includes a discount when purchasing an annual package, and the cost of month-to-month service is always higher. I know you’re on a budget — all of the suggested AI tools below are either free or include a free trial/demo. Multilingual Look for software that supports multiple languages if your business requires it. A chart comparing 11 AI Video Generators Chart comparing AI video generators Best AI Video Generators AI video generators have come extremely far in a short time. You can now make professional videos with the numerous text-to-video generation tools on the market. I’ve tried all the most popular AI video generators, so you don’t have to. Here’s what I found. 1. Clip Creator Source Clip Creator is the best AI video generator for beginners. It can be used by someone with no video experience and walks you through the video creation process painlessly. You start by answering a few basic questions (like video type), then provide a brief overview of the video you’d like to create. You can choose from video templates, which are oriented for both landscape videos and vertical videos. Then, Clip Creator uses AI to generate the text on your slides, plus the background imagery. You’re instantly given a video with editable text, stock images, background music, etc. The video creation workflow is very intuitive. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video My experience: I love how streamlined this AI video creator is. Instead of bombarding you with endless features, options, and pop-ups, Clip Creator starts simple and allows you to make any edits you need after it generates the video. Source Pros: Incredibly intuitive user interface, great customization options, and makes for a very fast and efficient AI video creator. Cons: Smaller template library than paid AI video generators, and no advanced features like realistic AI avatars. Best for: Video creation beginners and marketers on a budget. Most user-friendly interface and best free AI video generator. 2. Pictory Source Pictory is an excellent AI video generator for creators and marketers who don’t have experience creating videos. All you have to do is provide a script or article to guide your video content. For example, you can submit a blog post to the AI video creator, and Pictory will create a video based on the post that can be used for social media or your website. Furthermore, you can edit videos in minutes by using text. Pictory also includes a feature that creates shareable video highlight reels that can be used as a trailer or a short-form video for social media such as a Reel. Even better, Pictory can automatically caption and summarize your videos.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: I provided the same prompt for Pictory as I did for the Clip Creator video, and it initially generated much less content (only 1 slide). I went back and instead provided a URL of a blog post and tested the blog-to-video generator. This feature automatically creates video scripts based on a blog post, and using their realistic AI voices, I could have it automatically narrated too. The writing on every slide needed to be edited significantly to be useful, but I was impressed with the options. Pictory supports multiple languages (currently English, Spanish, French, and German) and has a huge library of AI voices. Source Prices for Pictory start at $19 per month, and users can try a 2-week free trial. Pros: Users have a lot of options for how to begin their AI-generated videos, and they can thoroughly customize the video output. Cons: The first draft of the automatically-generated videos needs heavy editing. It may be faster to let ChatGPT write a script for you and use that. Best for: Marketers and creators with limited video editing experience who want to convert content like blog posts or webinars into shareable video content. 3. Simplified Source The Simplified AI video generator transforms a long-form video into multiple AI-enhanced clips with just one click. This allows users to create videos from text and make an entirely new video using its accessible editing interface. Simplified simplifies the way we produce content by providing users with easy access to an expansive in-app library that hosts thousands of templates, all available for free. I like that it guarantees exceptional video quality and pairs this with an intuitive, user-friendly interface, ensuring that users can craft high-quality videos without sacrificing ease of use. Its comprehensive suite of features goes beyond basic editing options to include animation enhancements and multilingual translation capabilities, making it a versatile all-in-one tool for video creation. Users can save their brand settings in Simplified’s “brand book” is a great time-saving feature. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just starting, this platform equips you with everything you need to bring your vision to life. Brands like Bloomberg, DuckDuckGo, and Cashify use Simplified for their marketing needs. My experience: I prompted Simplified the same way I prompted the other video generators, and I was immediately asked to describe my target audience and provide my video topic. This was a nice step toward more personalized videos, but it required more user-generated input than Clip Creator, which had a multiple-choice intake process. If you stick to the free plan, it’s time-consuming to sift through all the features to see what’s free to use. Source Prices for Simplified include a forever-free plan. Paid plans start from $15.20 a month and are billed annually. Pros: If you pay for this AI video creator, you have many creation options at your disposal that not all other platforms offer (AI meme creation, AI image generation, AI carousel maker, etc.). Cons: Not the best free AI video generator; other platforms are more generous with their features. You’re not able to test the text-to-video generator without joining a paid plan, as you’re about to do with other features. Best for: Creators who want to create, edit, and schedule videos for all social media platforms. 4. Movavi Video Editor Source Rather than generating AI videos from scratch, the Movavi Video Editor uses AI to make video editing easier. Video editing can be a time-consuming chore; for many, it’s the less enjoyable side of content creation. However, with Movavi Video Editor’s nonlinear AI technique, you’re not just replicating traditional tool functions but also enhancing your videos through advanced AI video editing. With AI background removal, you can cut out and replace backgrounds, adding a new dimension to your visuals. Plus, the AI noise removal feature enhances audio quality by automatically eliminating unwanted sounds, ensuring your videos are of the highest standard. Source The app also offers a host of advanced options like PiP, chroma-key, titles, keyframing, motion tracking, and more. Following the free 7-day trial, paid plans start at $49.95 per year. Pros: The presence of built-in training rapidly familiarizes you with the software, and it has features that many other AI video editors don’t. Cons: This AI video editor brings high-level tools (like color correction) to marketers, but total video newbies may be overwhelmed with some of the more advanced features. Best for: Creators and marketers who already have video footage and want help editing videos to be more engaging (or who just need to speed up the editing process). 5. Fotor AI Video Generator Source Fotor is an image and video editing platform that integrates various AI features, known for its creativity, intelligence, flexibility, and convenience. Its AI video generator fully utilizes advancements in AI technology, making video creation more efficient and enjoyable. Video creation is often a complex and professional process, but Fotor simplifies the steps. You just need to describe your creative ideas in text form and choose your desired style.

Inspiration is important for video creators. Fotor AI video generator provides preset prompts and images, helping creators find more inspiration for their videos. My experience: Fotor’s interface is very user-friendly and simple. you can quickly find the features you need without any distracting ads or clutter. It also provides detailed step-by-step instructions, making it easy for new creators to get started. While creating videos, its preset text descriptions and high-quality images inspired me creatively. They also saved me time and greatly boosted my production efficiency. Source What I found most convenient was that after generating a video, I could perform basic edits directly in Fotor and I could also use their rich AI video tools, like one-click enhancement and beautification, background removal, and object elimination. Pros: The AI video generator supports creating videos in various styles, including Photography, Cinematic, Digital Art, Anime, Neopunk, Game Art, Illustration Art, and more. Catering to various creative ideas and needs. Cons: AI may not always fully understand textual descriptions or emotions and feelings, so some videos may not appear as realistic. Best for: Professional video creators, video creation beginners, social media video influencers, and users who enjoy trying and testing trendy and interesting features. 6. AI Studio Source With AI Studio, users can create videos by uploading their script and using the text-to-speech feature. The platform will then generate a video in five minutes or less. You can manually type in the script or copy and paste it into the platform. From there, you just need to select the appropriate language and AI model and finish editing. AI Studio allows users to select a custom-made avatar that suits their brand.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: New users can input a 300-character script, and an AI avatar will read your script using the AI text-to-video generator. I found the AI models to be less convincing than others; the mouths sometimes moved between sentences, and I think all viewers could identify these as AI. However, since the advent of TikTok’s text-to-speech narration feature, the public has become more accustomed to artificial narration, and there are many situations where this type of AI would work well. Source Prices for AI Studio start at $30 per month. Pros: The platform’s intuitive features make it excellent for beginners with limited or no video creation experience. Cons: The AI Studio avatars are identifiable as being artificial. Best for: Marketing videos that need text-to-speech narration and have visuals for B-roll. 7. Veed.io Source With Veed.io, you can use custom text, colors, font, and music to create a unique video for your brand. One of its standout features is Auto Transcribe. You can upload your video, hit the Auto Transcribe button, and immediately download the script. Even better, there is no software to download, and the platform is easy to use for those without video editing experience. My experience: I entered my “Pinterest marketing for beginners” prompt, and Veed.io quickly generated a short vertical video. The AI video generator automatically provided the script, AI narration, background music, stock videos, and close captioning. The on-screen captions were really engaging, using color-changing text and emojis — perfect for social media. Source Veed.io is free to use for videos under 10 minutes. To access more features, prices start at $18 per month (when billed annually) and go all the way up to enterprise custom pricing. Pros: The pacing, on-screen captions, slang, and approach were very engaging. Cons: The stock video that was automatically inserted into the video was off-topic at times but can be easily edited. Best for: Short-form videos designed to hold attention on social media. 8. Synthesia Source Synthesia's AI video generator enables users to create professional videos without requiring cameras, actors, or studios. Users can generate videos featuring realistic AI avatars that deliver content in over 140 languages by simply inputting text. This makes it an ideal tool for efficiently and at scale creating training materials, sales and marketing content, and internal communications. My experience: Synthesia's intuitive interface and extensive customization options make video creation straightforward. The platform's diverse range of avatars and multilingual support allowed me to produce engaging content tailored to a global audience. The quality of the AI-generated avatars is impressive, closely mimicking human expressions and speech patterns. Synthesia offers a free plan that includes 3 minutes of video per month, 9 AI avatars, and access to AI voices in 140+ languages. Paid plans are available for users requiring more features. Pros: Synthesia simplifies video creation with its intuitive interface and realistic AI avatars. Its support for over 140 languages makes it an excellent tool for creating global content. Cons: The free plan has limited features and is suitable only for basic use.

This AI video maker is specialized in corporate learning. Once the video is complete, review it to make any changes before rendering and downloading it. My experience: I found that Elai's format is unique. Even though the AI avatar doesn’t pass as a real human, its small display size makes it feel less distracting. The avatar compliments these videos instead of dominating them. I also really like the audio options: you can upload an audio file of you speaking, and Elai will generate a realistic AI avatar to narrate the text. Source Elai has over 60 languages and 25 avatars to choose from. You can use Elai for free with a 1-minute credit. For more features, Elai’s plans start at $23 per month (billed annually). Pros: As a specialized AI video generator, this tool allows you to quickly create training videos for new hires or product onboarding videos. Cons: Being a platform specialized for educational videos, it would be more time-consuming to create general marketing videos. Best for: Generating videos at scale and creating training videos and product videos. 10. Colossyan Source Colossyan provides a diverse range of avatars who can recite your script in various languages. You can also customize your avatar’s outfit. Colossyan’s key features are auto translations, subtitles, and the ability to enhance messages via screen recording. My experience: The AI avatar options from Colossyan are advanced. You can add multiple AI avatars to a single video screen in the video creation workflow, starting a “conversation.” You can even customize the pauses between speakers. Source There’s a free trial, and the prices start at $19 per month (when billed annually). Pros: The advanced avatar options make this a highly customizable AI video generator. Cons: The sound of the AI narrators isn’t the most natural-sounding. Best for: Creating training videos and explainers for workplace learning. 11. FlexClip Source This AI video generator features hundreds of video templates, AI-generated subtitles, background remover, and a text-to-speech engine. And its intuitive interface makes it simple for creators at any skill level. My experience: I created my video by inputting a URL and letting FlexClip automatically pull content from my website. The AI generator took an enormous amount of work out of the video creation process, but still required editing. The pacing of the video was slower than other AI tools, but I was able to easily customize all elements of the video. Source After the free plan, pricing starts at $9.99 per month (when billed annually, which saves 50%). Pros: The basic plan's price point makes this a very budget-friendly AI video generator. It is also a great, straightforward option for beginners who don’t want to feel overwhelmed. Cons: The AI-generated first draft requires more editing than some of the other platforms. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. 12. Wave Video Source Wave Video is a popular choice among content creators thanks to its many tools, which include image and video assets, text overlay effects, audio, and captions. The platform also provides a variety of video formats for Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and website-based applications. Other key features are: Text-to-video AI. Video hosting. Voiceovers. Text-to-speech. Millions of stock assets. My experience: I tested Wave Video by inserting a blog post URL and letting the AI video generator populate text and graphics based on the content. The video background graphics, pacing, and text populated on the slides needed significant editing to be ready for viewers. I like how easy it is to change the video format and edit any of the content. Wave Video also has many live-stream video tools.

      "content": "Runway vs Pika Labs — which is the best AI video tool? I put them head-to-head to find out When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. There has been a flurry of new artificial intelligence video generators in the past few months. Despite this, Runway’s Gen-2 and Pika Lab’s Pika 1.0 are among the most rounded and high profile, largely because they got there early and through continued innovation. In addition to impressive video generation, both have fine-tuned control over the motion in the video and custom functionality such as Motion Brush in Runway or Modify Region from Pika Labs. Both services have similar price points and commercial agreements. They also produce between 2-3 second clips, have the option to extend clips and take text, image or video inputs when generating a new clip. I’ve put them head to head to see how well they compare. Comparing Runway vs Pika Labs Doing a comparison between two video AI models involves picking a series of prompts and having them both generate output based on that prompt. I’ve tried to come up with a range of ideas testing camera motion, individual item motion and motion among more than one item. With all of the tests there are ways to get better output with custom instructions, better prompting or using the native features within the tools. As both Runway and Pika Labs takes a slightly different approach I made as few changes as possible. Test 1: Drone footage over a forest fire This was a simple text-to-video test on both models, using default settings and no custom camera motion. It presents a chance to test the raw output of the underlying model. I used the prompt for this test: “Drone footage flying over a forest fire. Photorealistic. Flames leaping towards the camera.” This tests different aspects of the model including how it handles the camera motion from the drone, the flames moving and the visuals of trees and fire. Runway was an easy and clear winner on this test. The flames were more natural and it felt closest to a real video. Pika seemed to struggle with realistic flames and it threw the video off. Test 2: A Yeti walking in snow This was a chance to see how well each of the two AI video tools handled animation character movement within a scene. Again it was text-to-video with default settings but with a 4-second extension to see how the models handle consistency. The prompt was created by ChatGPT as I wanted to see how well one AI could instruct another, suggesting they visualize: “An imposing, majestic Yeti, towering at eight feet tall with a thick, shaggy coat of white fur that glistens in the sun, is captured mid-stride as it traverses a narrow, snow-covered mountain pass in the heart of the Himalayas during mid-winter.” The overall scenery for the Runway creation was more photorealistic, but the character animation from Pika Labs was better. I think overall Pika Labs wins this round. Test 3: A future city from an image For this test, I pulled in an image as the prompt rather than using just text. It was a text and image to video but all other settings kept on default. The image was generated in Night Cafe Studio using the SDXL 1.0 model from StabilityAI. The prompt for the video: “The camera moves through the city, showcasing towering skyscrapers with holographic advertisements, flying vehicles zooming past, and a bustling, technologically advanced urban landscape.” Neither provided an outright victory in this round but I’m giving it to Pika Labs as it produced animation closer to the description and the point is a test of motion. It was close though as Runway generated a crisper video closer to the original image. Test 4: Multiple characters in a frame One of the areas all generative video models struggle with is multiple characters moving within a single view. For this experiment, I once again used both text and image but ramped up the motion level on both by two points. I didn’t change any other settings. The prompt for both image and video: “Norman knights charge against Saxon shield wall. The camera pans over clashing swords and spears, focusing on William the Conqueror leading the charge, with Harold Godwinson defending.” Neither won this round. It’s not because the output is similar, as it is surprisingly different given both come from the same source image and text. The issue is that as with all AI video models, neither coped well with multiple characters. Runway would have won if I were using their multi-motion brush feature as it allows you to set motion by region. Test 5: Fish swimming in a clear sea For this test, it was all about the text. A well-formed prompt designed to see how well each of the models handled complex, but less cluttered motion against a simple environment. The prompt: “A vibrant coral reef teeming with marine life. The scene is from the perspective of slowly gliding through the water, with colorful fish darting in and out of the coral, and a gentle current causing the sea plants to sway.” I liked both approaches here and they were distinct from one another. Both also did a great job on diversity of motion, with Pika Labs going down the more diverse but simpler lane and Runway adding considerably more fish into the scene. It was a close call but I gave it to Pika Labs because the Runway video was less consistent in its character motion. Some of the fish merge and others seem to move backwards. Test 6: Unique feature test For the sixth test, I once again turned to image-to-video. Specifically, I had Leonardo.ai generate an image of an alien creature overlooking a vast expanse. The goal of this test wasn’t so much how it handled the motion, as the type of image is normally relatively easy for AI video tools — minimal movement, large background and few characters. The test here was one of the features unique to each of the models and which proved more useful. For Runway it was Multi Motion Brush and for Pika Labs I turned to Modify Region. While I think Modify Region is an impressive feature, especially if you only want to change a small aspect of a source image, Runway’s multi-motion brush is a game changer and that is why I’ve given this round to Runway. Test 7: Video-to-video This final test is one of the video-to-video features available from each model. Runway has a slight edge going into the test as it has a dedicated video-to-video model that includes a range of style options including from a text, image or preset prompt. Both models work by overlaying the uploaded source video with the style from your prompt. For Pika Labs this is only available from a test prompt, although you could use Modify Region to set a specific part of the frame to be changed. As I had the Yeti on my mind from an earlier test I gave it the prompt: “Yeti as a YouTuber,” with a video of me talking to the camera as the source material. Neither did a great job so, to be fair to the test I tried again with the prompt: “Futuristic android character as a YouTuber.” I’ve used video-to-video models before and they’ve managed to make the mouth move in time to the words being spoken but this time around Runway struggled. However, visually it fit the brief well and mirrored the source video movement. Pika Labs failed to create a well-formed character, kept flipping me upside down and didn’t change the overall view by much. Runway was the easy winner in this round. Runway vs Pika Labs: Winner Neither of the models won outright across the board. Runway took three of the tests, Pika Labs also took three and in one category neither model won. However, the one that they both lost would have gone to Runway under normal circumstances thanks to its Multi-Motion Brush. The issue was that characters merged into each other, which can be solved by defining individual motion for each. Sign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox. Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips. While I'm a big fan of Pika Labs and its approach, I think I will give the final victory to Runway, particularly its Gen-2 model largely because of the work on creating new features and refining pre-generation settings.

Here's what we found. In today's world of powerful generative AI tools, having a top-tier AI video generator in your metaphorical back pocket is like having your own personal Hollywood film crew at your service. In fact, AI video generators are now so capable that major brands are switching from old video production methods to these modern AI-powered ones. Even the Tribeca Film Festival and other players in the film industry are jumping aboard the AI movement, highlighting just how dynamic and impressive these tools are becoming. But if you're reading this and think it sounds like AI video generators are just for the creative pros, don't worry because that's not the case. With AI text-to-video, AI-generated avatars, and tons of other awesome new AI video features, literally anyone can create unbelievably high-quality content. I made this anime trailer, and I think it’s pretty cool. The pictures, animation, and even the song were all generated by AI. Let me break down the process and tell you how it was done 👇 pic.twitter.com/Y117zidiei — Framer 🇱🇹 (@0xFramer) August 22, 2024 But with so many options flooding the market, it can be tough to figure out which tool is the right fit for you. Each promises to be the best, but how do you know which will deliver on that promise and actually be the best AI video generator? We made this guide to help you navigate the crowded field and find the tool that suits your needs. We've carefully selected and reviewed seven top contenders, focusing on what they offer, where they excel, and where they might fall short. So, if you've ever wondered, \"What is the best AI video generator?\" you're in the right place. What is an AI video generator? In the simplest of terms, an AI video generator is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to automate the video creation process. Instead of manually editing clips, adding effects, and syncing audio, these tools handle the heavy lifting for you. You just input text, images, or other media, and AI turns that into a complete video through text to video generation. By using AI, these tools automatically select the best visuals, create smooth transitions, and even generate voiceovers with realistic AI avatars. This means you can focus more on crafting your message and less on getting bogged down in the technical details. How do AI video generators work? AI video generators work by using advanced algorithms to analyze and process your input, whether it’s text, images, or other media. When you provide the content, the AI interprets it and makes decisions about how to structure the video. This includes selecting visuals, syncing audio, and applying effects—all in a matter of minutes. ✨ From Photo AI image to video with @LumaLabsAI's video model that came out today called Dream Machine It's absolutely state of the art and the best video model available right now I think It's able to highly accurately predict 3d surroundings from just a photo, I think up… pic.twitter.com/KDetDBdGIS — @levelsio (@levelsio) June 13, 2024 At the core of these tools is machine learning, which allows the AI to improve over time. The more data it processes, the better it becomes at making creative decisions that result in high-quality videos. For example, if you input a script, the AI video tool can generate corresponding scenes, choose relevant images or video clips, and even create a voiceover. The process is surprisingly intuitive. You simply provide the material, and the AI organizes it into a cohesive video that aligns with your vision.

What really stands out is that you don't need precise details for motion areas, Dream Machine still manages to capture motion concepts effectively. Itfollows the laws of physics, ensuring that every shot feels grounded and realistic. Plus, it’s super fast! As their website mentions, Dream Machine can currently produce 120 frames in 120 seconds, which is not too shabby to say the least. Where Dream Machine could improve Although Dream Machine is generally fast, some users have experienced slower processing times when working on intricate projects with a lot of elements. The discard rate can be around 98% with Reddit users pointing that most of the videos generated are unusable because of random elements, incorrect motion, or distortion. Pricing options: Free Plan ($0.00) Lite Plan ($7.99/month) Standard Plan ($23.99/month) Plus Plan ($51.99/month) Pro Plan ($79.99/month) 3. Runway Gen-3 Alpha Runway calls their latest model, Gen-3 Alpha, the new frontier for video generation, and we are here to say that they could definitely be right.

Learn how with today's Runway Academy: https://t.co/EUbxc4aA0D pic.twitter.com/qredD7vsXu — Runway (@runwayml) January 23, 2024 Why we like Runway: Most dynamic Runway's Gen-3 Alpha is one of the most impressive AI video generators we’ve come across. Not only is it a powerful tool for video that makes content creation seem limitless, but it has a shockingly friendly interface and is easy to use. With the Multi Motion Brush, you can select up to five areas with independent motion and control across 3 directional axis (x, y, z) for more precise and expressive generations. Another highlight is how well it handles human-like characters. The AI generates lifelike figures with natural expressions and gestures, adding a level of realism that’s hard to beat. We aren't exaggerating when we say you'll likely be blown away by what you generate with this tool. The videos are truly cinematic and offer an exciting glimpse into the future of creativity. Where Runway could improve Runway is an extraordinary tool, so it is hard to say where it can improve. Of course, with such a dynamic AI video generator comes cost, which might be the only thing holding back casual users or if you're on a budget. Plus, it is true that sometimes the final results might look a little \"wonky,\" but overall the quality is top-tier. Pricing options: Basic Plan ($0 per editor per month) Standard Plan ($12 per user per month, billed annually as $144) Pro Plan ($28 per user per month, billed annually as $336) Unlimited Plan ($76 per user per month, billed annually as $912) Enterprise Plan (Customized with Runway team) 4.

One of the standout features is its customizable templates, which allow users to tweak layouts, colors, and visual styles without advanced editing skills. So regardless of what kind of content you ar making, whether it's onboarding video or a marketing campaign, Hailuo AI makes sure your content looks tailored, not cookie-cutter. Where Hailuo AI Could Improve While the AI does a great job with automation, some users may find the customization options a bit limited. For example, while templates are helpful, they don’t always allow for fine-grained control over pacing and scene composition. Additionally, industries needing highly specific branding—like film production or high-end advertising—might need more flexibility in motion effects and camera angles. Pricing options: Standard plan ($14.90 per month) Unlimited plan ($94.90 per month) 5. Kling AI The Kling AI video generator produces highly realistic 1080p videos up to two minutes long, all from a single prompt. The key difference? It doesn’t just generate good-looking footage—it ensures movements and physics behave naturally, making everything feel more lifelike. Have an Amazing Day!☀️🙂☕️ Name: Flower Care Made with @Kling_ai 1.6 Text to Video#AIart Good Monday #MondayMotivation #Mondayvibes pic.twitter.com/MEvNj9HVrw — Jay Kay (@JayKay65220066) March 10, 2025 Why we like Kling AI: Smooth, natural motion What sets Kling apart is how well it captures human motion and expression. Thanks to its 3D face and body reconstruction technology, characters move fluidly and show natural emotions—all from a single image. Its physics engine also shines, allowing for believable object interactions and environments that behave like real-world scenes. Whether you're creating short films, virtual influencers, or AI-generated marketing content, Kling delivers a level of realism that’s hard to match. Where Kling AI could improve While Kling is impressive, it’s not perfect. Some users report slow processing times, especially for highly detailed scenes. Occasionally, minor inconsistencies appear, like hand distortions or subtle motion glitches. More control over camera angles and fine-tuning details would make it even stronger for professional creators. Pricing options: Basic (free) Standard ($72.90 yearly) Pro ($293.04 yearly) Premier ($728.64 yearly) 6. revid AI This tool might be new on the scene, but for improving video productivity for socials, revid is quickly becoming one of our favorites. Their mission is all about helping creators like you make short videos that have a potential to go viral. Why we like revid AI: Best for social media What we like most about revid AI is that it has a specific focus. The AI does the heavy lifting from finding ideas, adding sound effects, creating scripts, and then transforming everything into viral videos for your social media content. It’s a company that knows its lane, and we can certainly appreciate its dedication to being the master of one instead of the jack of all AI video trades. Where revid AI could improve The main drawback with revid AI is that it is niche. This is fine if you need this specific type of content, but it may be lacking if you're searching for a more powerful tool. Pricing options Hobby ($49/month) Growth (Launch offer $49/month) Ultra ($199/month) 7. Colossyan Whether you're making screen recordings for employee training, video marketing content for social media platforms, or educational videos for compliance training, Colossyan offers features that simplify video making for established businesses. Why we like Colossyan: Best for large businesses Colossyan is awesome with AI video editing, offering tools like prompt to video and AI script assistants that help you create excellent videos without needing tons of experience. While it is definitely on the more corporate side of video creation, we saw this tool streamline the creation process and make it easy to produce high-quality generated videos super fast and efficiently. Plus, Colossyan’s extensive library of AI avatars and multilingual support make it a nice choice for large companies and diverse clients. Where Colossyan could improve While Colossyan has a ton of cool features, it may require a bit of a learning curve for those new to AI video tools. The sheer number of options, from AI avatars to multiple export formats, can be overwhelming for beginners. Pricing options Starter Plan ($19/month, annually) Pro Plan ($61/month, billed annually) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 8. HeyGen HeyGen is one of the more impressive platforms we tested. A big reason for this is because it is hassle-free and easy to use, so jumping in was a simple process. More specifically, HeyGen is one of the best when it comes to generating AI avatars. The process of creating a HeyGen avatar boils down to three steps: choosing or creating an avatar, recording or choosing a voice to go with it, selecting a video template, then letting HeyGen put it all together in a matter of minutes. Why we like HeyGen: Most intriguing video generator One of the coolest features of HeyGen is its AI avatars, which are constantly evolving. The platform frequently updates these avatars to include enhanced visual details, expanded speech abilities, and more lifelike animations. Another great feature is the change videos to multiple langauges. HeyGen allows you to create videos in over forty languages from your original video, letting you reach audiences from all parts of the world. Where HeyGen could improve While HeyGen offers a lot of flexibility, the pricing for the Team plan might be higher for smaller teams or individual creators. Additionally, the Free plan, although great for beginners, limits users to just 3 videos per month, which may not be enough for those who need to produce content regularly. Pricing options Free Plan ($0) Creator Plan ($24/mo) Team Plan ($69/seat/mo) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 9. Haiper AI After diving into Haiper AI, we quickly realized it’s a promising tool for anyone looking to explore the world of AI-driven video creation. One of the first things that stood out to us is how Haiper AI makes the video creation process both accessible and efficient, even for those just starting. With just 3 images, @escelce transported us through 3 different universes, holy cow! #KeyframeConditioning #AIvideo #MadeWithHaiper https://t.co/6FwlLObhIK pic.twitter.com/JZdJOq3QMb — Haiper AI (@HaiperGenAI) August 19, 2024 Why we like Haiper AI: Best for beginners What we appreciated most about Haiper AI is its flexibility and how user friendly it was. The platform allows for up to 10 creations per day on the Free plan, which is generous for a no-cost option. That, on top of the text-to-speech feature helps make Haiper a solid tool. For those who need more, the Explorer and Pro plans offer expanded features that cater to different levels of use. Where Haiper AI could improve One of the primary limitations is that the Free plan doesn’t allow for commercial use or watermark-free videos. This might be a dealbreaker for users who need to produce content for business purposes but aren’t ready to invest in a paid plan. Pricing options Free Plan (Beta, $0/month): Explorer Plan (Beta, $8/month, billed yearly) Pro Plan (Beta, $24/month, billed yearly) Enterprise APIs (Custom Pricing) ‍ 10. Synthesia Synthesia is a game-changer for simplifying the process of making (sometimes scarily) realistic AI avatars. With simple text-based prompts, Synthesia turns your script into a polished, video ready project featuring life-like avatars. Why we like Synthesia: Excellent for avatars Even if you're new to video Synthesia has an intuitive interface that makes creating and editing your video feel straightforward. You simply choose an avatar, input your text prompts, and watch as the AI works its magic, transforming your words into engaging content. Plus, the AI video editor allows you to tweak and refine your video, so you can take the time to make those small changes that really make your vision come to life. So whether it is explainer videos, content creation for blog posts, or other marketing projects, Synthesia is excellent for businesses who want to make videos for their products or services. Where Synthesia could improve One of the main limitations is the degree of control available for the AI avatars. The avatars do look polished, but the options for appearance and expressions are somewhat limited compared to more advanced tools. Pricing Options Free Plan (€0/mo) Starter Plan (€20/mo) Creator Plan (€59/mo) Enterprise Plan (custom pricing) ‍ ‍ Wrapping up: The future of AI Video Tools AI in video and avatar creation has come a long way. From quirky results to making videos you’d swear were real, AI's gotten pretty good at this stuff. But the trick isn’t just making videos look real—it’s about getting them to move right, too. With tools like Luma Labs’ Dream Machine or Synthesia, we see how far AI can go in understanding motion and realistic avatars. These advancements are opening doors to new ways to create and tell stories, and brands like Mcdonald's Japan aren't afraid to test it out. These tools aren't here to replace humans in the creative process; but to make it possible to do more, to be even more innovative, without needing blockbuster budgets. Thanks to AI, we’re moving toward a future where anyone can produce a mini-movie or use avatars for product demos. It’s exciting to think about how these tools will help us all be more creative and bring our wildest ideas to life. So, go ahead and play around with these AI video generators. See how they can improve your video project workflow or let you experiment with digital avatars. They're here to help, not to take over. And while you’re at it, make sure to explore our Midjourney SREF codes to get even more incredible AI images.

      "content": "ByBernard Marr 5 Generative AI Video Tools Everyone Should Know About ByBernard Marr , Contributor. 5 Generative AI Video Tools Everyone Should Know About While last year was all about chatbots and image generators, this year, generative AI tools that help us create and edit videos are all the rage. Now, these aren’t (yet) as advanced as AI image generators, so don’t think you can just type “make a new Star Wars movie,” and it will create a blockbuster for you. Instead, what they do is automate many of the tasks involved in video editing, such as cutting footage to insert, re-ordering scenes, adding audio effects, generating captions, and adding avatars, graphics, or animations. However, they are becoming more powerful and flexible by the day, so who knows what they will be capable of soon? Whether you want to speed up the process of making corporate how-to videos or try your hand at becoming the next Stanley Kubrick, here’s a rundown of some of the top generative AI platforms for creating and editing videos today. Five Of My Favorite Generative AI Video Tools Synthesia Synthesia is a generative AI video tool that is particularly great when it comes to creating digital avatars and bringing them to life with realistic voice and animation. It’s used by businesses to create training materials as well as by marketers for promotional and advertising content, and it would also be a great choice for educational videos. Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 The avatars it creates can speak in multiple languages and accents, with convincingly human gestures and facial expressions. This means it’s easy to create content and then quickly localize it for different markets, products and services. It’s relatively easy to use – you simply type the script and hear it spoken back to you. Like many of the tools here, it offers a free account that gives you access to many of the basic features, meaning you can easily find out if it’s right for you before spending any money. Descript Descript is something of a disruptive player in the generative video market as a startup launched by one of the co-founders of Groupon. By gaining a reputation as a powerful tool for social media content creators and TikTok kids, it’s hit a marketing sweet spot, but it’s also used across a wide range of corporate and educational use cases. Descript users start with a script and then build their video out from there. You just pull in footage that can be manipulated and enhanced with AI, as well as audio that can be imported or generated from text, mimicking the user’s voice. You can then edit and re-arrange the timeline simply by snipping and moving the text. Descript stands out from other AI video editing tools – particularly ones that are available free online – with its user-friendliness and range of features. Everything is set up to make it quick for anybody to start producing and editing videos. Handy features such as eye-contact correction and “one-click” studio-quality sound are signs that the team is looking to add valuable innovations as the tool evolves. Adobe Premiere Pro with Sensei Another example of an industry-standard tool being given a generative AI makeover for the modern age. Adobe Premiere Pro has long been a video editing tool of choice for professionals and enthusiasts and now has a suite of new features powered by Adobe’s Sensei generative AI platform. Functions like transcription, inserting and re-ordering scenes, color correction, and audio adjustment, such as remixing music to match the timing of visuals, can now be streamlined and automated using natural language. It also has a text-to-speech feature that simplifies the process of creating captions and transcripts. This reduces the time that creators need to spend on manual tasks, allowing them to focus on more creative elements of their work. Adobe is going all-in on generative AI, adding tools and capabilities across its entire Creative Cloud suite, and video production is just one area where it is leading the field today. Pictory Pictory aims to automate the process of turning scripts and blogs into videos with minimal user effort. It’s great for those who want to make quick, snappy videos for marketing or just for fun. It can also be used by educators and online course creators to make lively learning material. One of the tasks it specializes in is automatically creating highlight reels showcasing the most important, exciting or interesting moments from longer videos. It then makes it simple to quickly repurpose them as trailers or social clips to engage more viewers. Generative AI is clearly going to make a big splash in the world of marketing, and there are plenty of tools designed to fit the needs of marketers. User-friendliness is a key feature of this platform, which focuses on making it simple to create the type of videos that millions of businesses across the world need every day. Runway Runway is different from the other platforms I’ve highlighted here because it does – to an extent – offer straightforward text-to-video generative AI. This means you can type “Sun rising over a beach at sunset,” and it will create a completely synthetic video. Alternatively, you can upload an image and bring it to life. When I tried it, the results were sometimes not exactly what I was hoping for, but they were impressive nonetheless, and it’s mind-boggling to think what this technology might be capable of in the not-too-distant future. As with ChatGPT and any generative AI tool with language-based input, the results can be greatly improved by taking some time to learn about the best ways to communicate what you want it to do.
