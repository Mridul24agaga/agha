Types of AI video generation Text-to-video Veo 2 is PURE FIRE 🔥 \"A small pink liquid monster, styled like a rapper with a backward cap and chunky gold chain, performing a kickflip down a flight of stairs. The skateboard spins multiple times underneath as the liquid creature's form ripples and splashes dynamically in… pic.twitter.com/0EEeWlPcHE — Javi Lopez ⛩️ (@javilopen) January 13, 2025 Text-to-video AI video generation allows users to create videos simply by describing a scene in text. The AI interprets the prompt and generates a matching video, complete with movement, lighting, and even physics. This is by far the most popular type of AI video generation. Image-to-video Look at that VEO 2 animates windows wallpaper! pic.twitter.com/qL51V8S4oA — testtm (@test_tm7873) December 26, 2024 Image-to-video AI video generation animates static images, bringing them to life with motion effects. AI can generate smooth transitions, camera movements, or even animate characters from a few frames. Image-to-video models are popular with AI video creators because they allow you to maintain character, scene and object consistency throughout your video. You would typically use these tools alongside an AI image generator like Midjourney. Video-to-video @runwayml has 4K upscaling now! 🤯 I did a comparison between Runway GEN-3 and Topaz Video AI's upscaler, from HD to 4K. Runway's file size footprint is 40% of Topaz (using the Theia model), and after reviewing the results on a 40\" monitor, there's little to no difference in… pic.twitter.com/GamPOXq9mr — Tom Blake (@Iamtomblake) January 9, 2025 Video-to-video AI video generation uses AI to enhance, modify, or transform existing videos rather than creating new ones from scratch. This can include improving video quality, changing styles, adding special effects, or even altering elements within the footage—like removing objects, or replacing backgrounds. Some good examples of video-to-video includes Synthesia's AI dubbing (with lip sync) or Topaz's video upscaling. Th‎e best AI video generator for studio-quality videos with AI avatars Synthesia PlayCreate an AI Video in 4 Minutes with Synthesia ⚡️ Verdict: Easy to use and great for training, internal communications, marketing, outreach and localisation/translation ‎Link: ‎https://www.synthesia.io/ Synthesia is a leading AI video generator that allows you to create studio-quality videos with AI avatars that can narrate your text. It includes more than 60 video templates you can start from, and you can choose between more than 230 AI avatars that speak more than 140 languages and accents. Here's an example video I made for a product launch: PlayProduct Introduction (Free AI Video Template) Synthesia can be used to create a variety of video types, with the most common use cases being learning and development videos, including training videos and other eLearning video production. It also excels at producing onboarding videos and video content for internal communications, as well as marketing and outreach videos. Synthesia is a top-ranked AI software, with 1150+ reviews on G2 and has a rating of 4.7 out of 5. The platform is being used by 50,000 companies of all sizes, with many big names among them, such as Reuters, Zoom, and Amazon. Synthesia is a browser-based platform and I found it easy to set up my first video. I simply typed in my script, selected an avatar from their library, customized my video with the AI video editor, and then Synthesia generated a polished video featuring one of its realistic AI avatars. With over 230 avatars to choose from, I easily found options that fit different tones and purposes. You can also make a custom avatar that looks like you. Synthesia supports over 140 languages, and I was able to create localized versions of my video with ease. The platform even has a multilingual video player that automatically translates videos to viewers’ preferred languages, making it useful for global audiences. I tried adding multiple avatars on screen to simulate conversations, which worked smoothly and could be helpful for training scenarios or role-playing videos. The platform has over 60 professionally designed video templates that make it easy to produce polished content quickly. Features like live collaboration tools allow teams to work together seamlessly, while detailed video analytics provide insights into video performance. Altogether, these capabilities make Synthesia a practical, efficient choice for professional projects. One of its most popular use cases is as training video software, but it's also great for other sales and marketing videos and multilingual content. Th‎e best AI video generators for creative video production Here's my rundown of the best text-to-video and image-to-video AI video generators for creative video production. Hailuo Hailuo Director Mode is so fun. Being able to combine camera shots is just fantastic. Here shaky camera and push in. pic.twitter.com/MfqBA22vm8 — Jerrod Lew (@jerrod_lew) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best free option for creative video production Link: ‎https://hailuoai.video/ Hailuo AI is an AI video generator that delivers high-quality 6-second video clips at 720p resolution. It offers text-to-video, image-to-video and a subject reference feature. Hailuo offers a 3-day free unlimited generation period so that you can generate a bunch of videos for free and really test the tool. Subject reference is a particularly cool feature. It lets you upload a photo of a character and then generate a scene with that character in it. I found the output to be pretty accurate, although I often needed to do some manual editing to maintain coherence. The model can also take multiple attempts to get it right, which will eat into your credits. The feature also often fails at close-ups (wide shots tend to work better but lose fine details). One of the first things that stood out to me was how well it understands prompts. Hailuo seemed to nail camera movements and scene composition accurately. The image quality is also noticeably high. However, generation times are limited to 6 seconds, which makes creating longer sequences more tedious. Al‎ibaba Qwen Another day, another release. Alibaba have quietly included video generation in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max and it's really good. Here are a few examples - check them out. pic.twitter.com/u6qptO59ai — TomLikesRobots🤖 (@TomLikesRobots) January 30, 2025 Verdict: Completely free and produces high quality videos, but often with unreliable generation Link: ‎‎‎‎https://chat.qwenlm.ai/ Alibaba included an AI video generator in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max. It’s a text-to-video only tool, but it’s completely free and I’ve been impressed by the quality. The one catch is that the generation is kind of unreliable. I often enter my prompt and the video generates up to 99% complete and then gets stuck for quite a while. In my experience the videos do eventually finish generating but be prepared to wait a little. The output quality seems to be really good, and while the functionality is limited, it’s completely free and the videos have no watermark. Kl‎ing If you’re looking to combine character consistency with high-quality VFX, @Kling_ai is the best choice. 🎥✨ Version 1.5 absolutely nails VFX. A true must-have! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/rO1WvmLj3k — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) January 12, 2025 Verdict: High quality output, but very long free plan generation wait times Link: ‎https://www.klingai.com/ Kling offers text-to-video and image-to-video features, along with free video generation credits for users who log in each month. Kling brings an impressive level of fluidity and realism to movement in videos. I found the adjustable creativity and relevance slider particularly useful for fine-tuning outputs. Its biggest strength lies in image-to-video generation (and in particular its elements feature), which is far superior to tools like Runway. The motion is smoother, and the AI follows prompts accurately. When I asked for a character to blink or walk forward while the camera zoomed in, Kling delivered exactly what I asked for. If you need storytelling or consistency between frames, Kling is a great option. Kling 1.5 also supports HD, which is a nice bonus. Kling has some drawbacks, the biggest being generation speed. On the free version, I sometimes had to wait an hour or more for a single clip, and I’ve heard of free users waiting a full day for results. This is a major issue if you need quick iterations. On a paid plan the generations are quicker, but I also noticed that Kling sometimes gets stuck at 99% completion and wastes credits. At the end of the day, if you prioritize quality, accuracy, and motion control, Kling is a great choice. The motion brush tool adds extra control, and the first-attempt success rate is high, meaning I spent less time fighting the AI to get what I wanted. Ru‎nway When setting up a shot in Runway, think carefully about where to put the camera. Consider what the camera placement tells the audience about the story, about the character, and about the moment. Every angle is a decision that affects how the audience will experience it. pic.twitter.com/XnijHcb0Jv — Cristóbal Valenzuela (@c_valenzuelab) November 11, 2024 Verdict: The Gen-3 model gives you great results and some amazing advanced features that come with a bit of a learning curve Link: ‎https://runwayml.com/ Runway’s latest Gen-3 model offers a comprehensive suite of creative tools, such as text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video, alongside advanced features like motion brush, keyframes, camera controls and inpainting. On the free basic plan, you can create short text-to-video clips (up to 10 seconds long or 16 seconds using the \"extend video\" feature in the older Gen-2 model) but can’t upscale resolution or remove watermarks. You also can’t generate videos directly from text using their Gen-3 Alpha model on the free plan (only images to video). However, you can still make great videos with just the image-video feature. Here's an example workflow to show you how I use Runway’s free plan to create AI-generated short story videos: Midjourney to generate images Runway for image-to-video Suno to generate music Elevenlabs for some effects Topaz for video upscaling Capcut for editing I found Runway’s advanced features to be pretty amazing. Camera control lets you adjust angles, focus, and movement to achieve a polished, professional look. The Motion brush tool allows you to add motion and direction to specific parts of a video, which is great for creating visually dynamic social media content. Keyframes allow you to configure the starting, middle, and ending frames to create smooth transitions between them. Inpainting lets you automatically remove unwanted objects throughout your clip. This tool handled complex scenes surprisingly well; I could remove background elements without affecting the continuity of the video, something that would usually require a lot of time and expertise. However, I found that these advanced features come with a learning curve, so if you’re new to video editing you might need a bit of practice to fully utilize Runway’s capabilities. I found Runway’s video generation process to be fast and reliable. I think the pricing is reasonable given the platform’s capabilities, especially for creators, filmmakers, and digital artists who want more control and creative freedom. However, the costs might feel high if you’re only looking for basic AI video generation, as Runway is designed for those looking to push creative boundaries and explore the possibilities of AI in video production. Go‎ogle Veo Been generating impossibly dangerous stunts with veo 2 using text prompts. Still surprising how realistic they can look (though not perfect yet). pic.twitter.com/0gETBwGH5y — Ethan Mollick (@emollick) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best option for creative video production, but limited access for now (US only waitlist) Link: ‎https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/ I was blown away by Google Veo 2’s realistic video generation capabilities. Every clip I produced, from a misty jungle scene to a foggy wildlife sequence, was rendered in stunning detail, and the visual fidelity was top-notch. One of the aspects that stood out for me was the advanced cinematic controls. I could specify everything from lens types to shot angles and even adjust depth-of-field effects, which made it feel like I had an entire professional film crew at my fingertips. The dolly zoom and pan shot features, in particular, added that extra layer of cinematic flair that really brought my scenes to life. In my tests, Veo 2 consistently produced more “correct” results compared to other tools like OpenAI’s Sora. The physics simulation is fantastic with objects and characters that move and interact in a way that feels natural and true to real-world behavior. I found that character consistency was excellent too; no matter how complex the scene, the generated characters maintained their look and identity throughout the video. Veo 2 supports high-resolution outputs (up to 4K) and longer video durations too, which simplifies your workflow as you won’t need upscaling tools. The only reason why Veo 2 isn’t my top pick for creative video production is because it’s still not publicly available - you have to join a waitlist and it’s still US only. There’s also room for improvement still, and I sometimes saw some strange character movements in my generated videos. Op‎enAI Sora 🚨 It’s crazy! #Sora just dropped, and it’s already blowing everyone’s minds! 😱🎥 Here are 10 mind-blowing examples showcasing its insane possibilities. 🔥 The future of video is here. 🚀👇 pic.twitter.com/Mcq2OepO3R — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Fun to play around with but needs to improve Link: ‎https://sora.com/ Sora is OpenAI’s entry into text-to-video AI video generation, and after spending some time with it, I’ve found it to be a mixed bag. On the one hand, when Sora works, it can deliver stunning, lifelike visuals, especially for abstract or artistic scenes. Its storyboard functionality is one of my favorite features, as it lets you prompt multiple shots in a single generation, and the “Blend” option adds a fun layer of creativity, allowing you to combine visual elements in unexpected ways. However, in my experience the model struggles with some critical aspects. Sora consistently fails when it comes to physics, general body movements, and character consistency. For example, I tried generating scenes as simple as making cats dance, only to be met with choppy motion, glitches, and overall results that were far from convincing. In several cases, the outputs felt like a gamble: some generations might be passable, but most of the time, prompts didn’t translate well into the expected actions or camera movements. I found that free or cheaper alternatives outperform Sora in accuracy and usability. There’s a steep learning curve, and despite the potential of the video-to-video remix functionality (which I’ve used to remaster some older AI-generated clips), the overall inconsistency is hard to overlook. You can access Sora on the plus plan ($20/month) which gives you 50 videos up to 720p resolution and 5 seconds long, or the pro plan ($200/month) for 500 videos up to 1080p resolution and 20 seconds long. Pi‎ka I had early access to the Pika 2.1 Model, A new journey begins, More clips to follow! @pika_labs pic.twitter.com/rN5OfMacoo — Stevie Mac (@StevieMac03) January 23, 2025 Verdict: The free plan isn’t great, but the premium plans have very good image-to-video features Link: ‎https://pika.art/ Pika offers a free plan that gives you access to Pika 1.5, which has text-to-video and image-to-video features and 150 monthly video credits. Videos can be downloaded without a watermark on the free plan. I wasn’t super impressed with the quality of the generated videos though. However, while Pika 1.5’s video output is nothing special, Pika 2.1 (available on the paid plan) offers an image-to-video feature called scene ingredients, which I think is pretty amazing. With scene ingredients you can build a shot from the exact character, object, wardrobe, and setting you want. It works by using reference images of each element and then providing a prompt. It’s similar to Kling’s elements feature in that it allows you to ensure creative consistency between scenes, which I found made it a super useful tool to produce actually usable videos. Lu‎ma First impression Luma > Sora pic.twitter.com/R2pXVsAesw — The Retro Burn (@burntheretro) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Their new Ray 2 model is great, but it’s a premium feature and it doesn’t offer image-to-video Link: ‎https://lumalabs.ai/ Luma's Ray 2 model has great motion realism and the physics feel really natural. The frame-to-frame consistency is a clear improvement over previous versions and it does an excellent job with cinematic elements, responding impressively to lighting, contrast, film formats, and camera motion. At times, it even seemed to intelligently structure shots. By using highly detailed prompts and running multiple generations, I found that it’s possible to create some truly stunning videos, though it does require some cherry-picking to get the best results. When I tested a sports car driving through snowy mountains at dawn, the scene composition was spot on and the snow, warm light, and camera tracking all felt smooth and natural. I also experimented with close-up shots of faces, and I was surprised by how well it captured emotional expressions, particularly in an extreme sadness prompt, where the eye movements and facial subtleties felt incredibly lifelike. Where Luma stands out is its ability to generate dynamic camera movements while keeping the scene coherent. It understands cinematic depth and framing in a way that makes it ideal for dramatic shots. I found that Luma is great at handling large-scale scene changes. For example, when I asked it to generate a collapsing building Luma delivered a convincing destruction sequence. Currently, Luma’s Ray 2 is only available to paid users and is capped at 720p resolution. Videos can be up to 10 seconds long, but I noticed that after about 7 seconds, scene consistency can start breaking down, occasionally shifting in unintended ways. Ad‎obe Firefly Here's another video created by Adobe Firefly.. a 3D printer, printing a car. Very impressed by the results. https://t.co/L5d8zf3TGv pic.twitter.com/ySylkRlDMS — techAU (@techAU) February 13, 2025 Verdict: Inconsistent motion and limited free use (only 2 free generations) make it hard to recommend Link: ‎‎https://firefly.adobe.com/ Adobe Firefly offers both text to video and image to video, both capable of producing 1080p clips from simple prompts or static images. Firefly struggles with distortion. I tested it by generating a video of \"a cyclist riding through a mountain trail in autumn,\" and while the colors and scenery were nice, the motion was noticeably unnatural. The cyclist's legs appeared to glitch mid-pedal, and the overall movement felt disjointed. Image to video fared better when creating abstract or background footage, but realistic human action remained a challenge. The output currently feels more like digital experiments than polished, usable content. On the positive side, Firefly's interface is intuitive. The built-in controls for adjusting camera angles, motion paths, and shot sizes make experimenting with different styles relatively simple. After generating two free videos, I was prompted to upgrade to either Firefly Standard or Pro for additional generations. While Firefly is enjoyable to explore and has clear creative potential, I’ll stick with more reliable alternatives for projects that need high-quality, natural-looking results. The best AI video generators for social media and YouTube content Fl‎exClip PlayHow to use FlexClip's AI Video Creator Verdict: User-friendly video tool with innovative AI features Link: ‎https://www.flexclip.com/ FlexClip is highly user-friendly platform that excels at helping you create professional-looking videos quickly and efficiently. I love the drag-and-drop editor. It’s perfect for creating videos on the fly without needing to spend hours on intricate editing. I’ve used it to create everything from social media content to promotional videos. The AI-powered text-to-video tool allows you to input simple text prompts, and the AI generates video clips based on the text, matching stock footage, adding text overlays, and even suggesting music. It's perfect for social media clips. While the AI can be a little hit or miss when it comes to perfectly matching footage to specific content, it’s an amazing tool for creating videos when you’re short on time or just need a draft to build upon, and I typically only need to make a few adjustments after generation. The AI script generator is another great feature. While the scripts are generally a good starting point, they often need a little fine-tuning to match the specific tone of the brand or subject matter. This is definitely a time-saver, though, especially when you’re stuck trying to put ideas into words. Another feature that impressed me was the AI background remover. It works surprisingly well. For most images, the background removal is clean, though it sometimes struggles with more intricate details like hair or small objects. It’s a great time-saver when you’re working with product images or need transparent backgrounds quickly. FlexClip also offers an auto-subtitle generator, which is a great tool for improving accessibility and engagement on social media platforms. It’s surprisingly accurate, and I’ve used it for videos on YouTube and Instagram. However, it does occasionally struggle with fast speech or complex accents, so if you’re working with content that has unclear audio, this may not always be 100% reliable. One area where FlexClip could improve is its media library. While it offers a decent range of stock footage and images, it’s not as extensive as some other platforms I’ve used. For niche content, I’ve often had to source additional media from other places. The stock library is good for general-purpose videos, but it may not always have exactly what you need. Ve‎ed PlayHow to Make a YouTube Intro Verdict: User-friendly browser-based video editor that streamlines social media content creation Link: ‎https://www.veed.io/ Veed is a user-friendly, browser-based video editor that made creating social media content incredibly easy for me. The intuitive layout and drag-and-drop functionality let me start projects quickly, and I loved using features like automatic subtitles, text-to-speech, and background removal to give my videos a professional touch. The templates and filters helped keep my style consistent, and with auto-translate, creating multilingual content was straightforward. The only downside I found was that the free plan includes a watermark, and complex scenes sometimes required a bit of manual tweaking to get the AI effects like background removal just right. Overall, Veed offered everything I needed for quick, polished videos with minimal effort. Ca‎nva PlayCreate content fast with Canva Video Verdict: AI-powered video editing with versatile templates Link: ‎https://www.canva.com/video-editor/ai/ Canva is not only a design tool; it’s also a great alternative for creating social media and YouTube videos. I tried its video editor, and I was impressed by how well it adapts to video creation. Canva’s templates make it easy to start projects tailored for platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. One of my favorite features is the automatic resizing, which lets me quickly reformat videos for different platforms without needing to start from scratch. The AI-powered suggestions for text and animations are also handy—it feels like Canva’s tools know how to keep my content consistent and visually engaging. With access to a vast library of stock media and music, I could easily enhance my videos, and the new AI text-to-speech and captioning features were a nice bonus, especially for making my videos more accessible. Overall, Canva’s video editing tools made it simple to produce polished, shareable content that looks just as good as anything created with dedicated video editors. The best AI-powered video editors Fi‎lmora PlayFilmora 14 is HERE! | Introducing a NEW way to edit Verdict: An affordable and user-friendly video editor with robust AI features Link: ‎https://filmora.wondershare.com/ When I first tried Filmora, I was immediately struck by how easy it was to navigate. The drag-and-drop functionality and straightforward interface made it simple to start editing, even without much prior experience. Filmora offers a robust library of transitions, effects, and templates, allowing me to quickly put together visually appealing videos, which is ideal for creating content for social media and YouTube. I appreciated how the platform balances usability with a range of features, making it suitable for both beginners and intermediate users who want to produce polished videos without a steep learning curve. Filmora’s pricing is also accessible, with options that cater to different types of users. They offer an annual subscription starting at around $49.99 per year, and for those looking for more flexibility, a lifetime license is available for around $79.99. There’s also a free version, which is great for testing the software before committing, but it does add a watermark to videos. For creators looking to edit consistently without major financial commitments, Filmora’s pricing offers a good balance of affordability and value, especially considering the powerful AI tools it includes. These plans are well-suited for individuals and small business owners who need regular access to professional-grade video tools without breaking the bank. Filmora's AI-powered tools bring a lot of convenience and creativity to the editing process. I'll run through each one. The AI Smart Cutout feature, for example, allows you to cut objects out of scenes by painting over the area, which is perfect for isolating specific subjects without complex masking. I also found AI Audio Denoise to be extremely useful for cleaning up background noise in my videos, especially when I recorded in less-than-ideal environments. The AI Audio Stretch tool was another handy feature that let me extend background music to match scene transitions, saving me the hassle of remixing or finding perfectly timed tracks. These AI tools are not only time-saving but also elevate the overall quality of the final video, helping users create professional-looking content with minimal effort. The AI Motion Tracking tool was a lot of fun to experiment with—it can be used to track faces or moving objects, allowing for privacy blurring or creative effects like pasting funny stickers over someone’s face to make meme-style videos. Another feature I really enjoyed was AI Remove Background, which made it easy to change the background of my videos without needing a green screen. I could, for instance, place a runner in an outer-space setting, which opens up endless creative possibilities. Additionally, Filmora’s AI Silence Detection tool helped speed up my editing by automatically removing pauses and hesitations, making it effortless to create snappy jump cuts. These tools make Filmora an efficient, AI-enhanced option for quick edits and visually dynamic effects. However, while these AI tools are great for general use, there are a few limitations. The precision of features like Smart Cutout and Remove Background isn’t perfect and might require manual touch-ups for complex scenes. Additionally, while Filmora handles most tasks smoothly, rendering can slow down when working with high-resolution files or when using multiple AI features in one project. This might be a drawback for users with demanding workflows or those creating high-quality, professional-grade content. Overall, though, Filmora’s AI tools make it an impressive choice for social media creators and hobbyists. In summary, Filmora is an accessible, budget-friendly video editor that packs a lot of AI-driven functionality into an affordable package. It’s particularly suited for those creating content for social media, YouTube, or personal projects. With its range of pricing options, Filmora offers a lot of value, especially for casual and intermediate creators who don’t need the high-end features of more advanced (and expensive) software. To‎paz PlayExperience Wonder by Topaz Labs Verdict: A premium AI-driven enhancer that delivers cinematic upscaling and noise reduction for professional-quality footage Link: ‎‎https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-video-ai Topaz Video AI is an advanced video enhancement tool that uses AI to upscale, stabilize, and improve video quality. When I tried it, I was impressed by how well it upscaled footage, even to resolutions as high as 16K, adding a cinematic clarity to older or lower-quality clips. The AI-driven noise reduction made a noticeable difference, effectively removing grain and artifacts that I struggled with in other software. I also found the frame rate enhancement and slow-motion features to be smooth and natural, making it ideal for creating professional-quality slow-motion shots or restoring archival footage. Priced at $299 for personal use and $1099 for commercial licensing, Topaz Video AI is an expensive but valuable investment for filmmakers, content creators, and digital archivists looking to elevate their work with high-end upscaling and video repair capabilities. Ca‎pCut PlayLearn How to Create Amazing Content using CapCut Web Version | CapCut Verdict: A free and versatile editor with intuitive AI tools that make crafting polished content effortless across devices Link: https://www.capcut.com/ CapCut is a free, all-in-one video editing tool that I found easy to use across mobile, desktop, and browser platforms. The array of AI-powered features—like background removal and automatic upscaling—made editing quick and straightforward, especially for creating social media content. The audio-to-text transcription was a time-saver, automatically adding captions that boosted accessibility and engagement on my videos. I liked tools like video stabilization and text-to-speech, which let me enhance video quality without needing complex software. CapCut’s collaborative features were also helpful, especially when working on shared projects, and the library of templates gave me plenty of creative options. Overall, CapCut’s versatility and ease of use make it a great choice for both personal and professional video editing. The best AI video generators for video repurposing Op‎usClip PlayOpusClip 3.0: The smartest AI clipping tool just got smarter Verdict: A smart and time-saving tool that repurposes long videos into engaging, platform-ready clips with minimal effort Link: ‎https://www.opus.pro/ Opus Clip has quickly become one of my favorite tools for repurposing long videos into social media-friendly clips. The AI-driven clip generation feature is surprisingly accurate, identifying the most engaging parts of my videos and saving me the time I’d usually spend sorting through footage. I appreciate how it automatically resizes clips to fit different platforms like TikTok and Instagram without any manual adjustments. Adding captions and even emojis is simple, and I noticed it makes the videos more engaging, especially for viewers who watch without sound. One of the standout features is the \"hook\" identification, which picks out key moments to grab attention quickly. Overall, Opus Clip made it easy to create compelling, shareable content from my existing videos, and the AI features really lightened my workload. Mu‎nch PlayMeet Munch Verdict: Efficiently converts long-form content into shareable social snippets using AI Link: ‎https://www.getmunch.com/ Munch is an AI-based tool for repurposing long-form video content into shorter clips suited for social media platforms. It identifies key moments in videos and includes features like auto-cropping, subtitles, and format adjustments to help optimize content for platforms such as Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok. Munch offers a streamlined way to create shareable content from existing videos, aimed at enhancing reach and engagement across various channels. I found the interface clean and easy to navigate, allowing me to jump right in without needing tutorials. One feature I particularly liked was the automatic detection of key moments. Munch’s AI identifies engaging segments, which saved me the time of manually sifting through my footage to find the best parts to share. For anyone looking to repurpose content across platforms, this automation is a real time-saver. Munch’s formatting tools also make it easy to resize videos for different social platforms. The auto-cropping options adjust clips to fit Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and more, making cross-platform distribution simpler. I appreciated the automatic subtitle feature, which made my videos accessible to a broader audience without much additional work. However, while these features are useful, they lack some customization. I couldn’t manually adjust the selected clips as much as I’d like, and sometimes the AI would pick sections that didn’t feel as relevant or engaging as I had hoped. One limitation I noticed is that the output quality and customization options are fairly basic compared to more advanced editing software. While auto-cropping and subtitles are convenient, the styling options for subtitles are limited, and I missed having more flexibility with transitions and effects. This might be a drawback if you’re aiming for highly polished, branded content, as Munch is more focused on speed and efficiency than fine-tuning. Overall, though, it’s a solid tool for quickly repurposing long videos into social-friendly snippets. If you need a quick way to generate clips from existing content and don’t require advanced editing, Munch is a handy addition to your toolkit. Wi‎secut PlayTurn long videos into shorts with Wisecut AI Verdict: Wisecut streamlines editing by automatically trimming dead space and adding professional touches Link: ‎https://www.wisecut.ai/ Wisecut automatically finds interesting moments in long clips and cuts them, adding music and subtitles. I tested it by uploading a raw clip full of awkward pauses and unnecessary dead spots, and Wisecut’s smart editing removed all the fluff. The auto-cut feature was spot-on, leaving me with a much tighter, more engaging video without having to painstakingly cut it all myself. The tool is super intuitive. It offers handy features like background noise cancellation and even let me choose whether to add background music, which really helped polish the final product. I also appreciated the straightforward interface—it made setting up projects and tweaking settings a breeze. In short, Wisecut has saved me a significant amount of time, letting me focus more on creating content rather than getting bogged down in editing. If you’re looking to streamline your workflow and produce cleaner, more professional videos, I’d highly recommend giving it a try. How did I decide on the best AI video generators? I focused on the following factors when building this list: Quality of Output – I evaluated whether each tool produces videos with the resolution, length, and overall quality required for professional results Ease of Use and Customization – I looked for an intuitive interface and flexible customization options to accommodate different skill levels and creative needs Platform Compatibility and Export Options – I checked if the tool is compatible across devices and offers export options suitable for various platforms Pricing and Free Plan Limitations – I compared pricing structures and the limitations of free plans to ensure they offer good value for different budgets AI Capabilities and Features – I specifically assessed the AI-driven features About the author Content Writer & Marketing Expert Ema Lukan Ema Lukan is a seasoned Content Writer and Marketing Expert with a rich history of collaborating with marketing agencies, SaaS companies, and film studios.

Make a Video Updated: 12/10/24 Published: 06/16/23 Videos are integral to any marketing campaign; however, they can be tedious and difficult to create if you aren’t savvy with editing or are short on time. Fortunately, you can leverage many AI video generators to streamline your production and create content that engages your audience. But what’s the best AI video generator for your tasks? This article will explore 12 different AI video generators, their features, and how you can best use them in your next video marketing campaign. Time to press play on easier video creation. Table of Contents Can AI make videos? How to Make AI Videos Transforming Text to Video With AI What makes a great AI video generator? Best AI Video Generators Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video Can AI make videos? Yes, AI can make videos. AI video generators can instantly produce basic presentation slides with text, B-roll, and background music, all the way up to advanced videos of lifelike AI avatars “speaking” to you. AI’s impressive — but it’s not perfect. What works well with AI video generators: Video scripts. Being able to generate video scripts in a few seconds is incredible and saves so much time. Stock imagery, B-roll, and background music. Even though it still requires editing, having multimedia pulled automatically for you by the video generator makes it feel like you have an assistant. Video editing. The video editing capabilities are incredible and often beginner-friendly, which is a huge leap in the video editing world. What isn’t working (yet): Believability. The realistic AI avatars are incredibly advanced, but the mannerisms and articulation make it obvious that they're, well, AI. Pacing. Much research has been done on how quickly a video moves from scene to scene to hold viewers’ attention, and I found that not all generators factored this into their algorithms. Decision overload. The number of video templates, AI avatars, and effects available can overwhelm the editing process. AI is rapidly advancing, and some of these quirks will soon be passé. How to Make AI Videos The process for making an AI video will vary depending on the tool or platform you're using. Some generators work by analyzing and creating a video based on the script you uploaded, while others will follow a prompt typed in by the user. The key is to find a tool or generator with the features you need to create the kind of content you want. Transforming Text to Video With AI When ChatGPT catapulted to popularity in 2022, I don’t think the average marketers knew just how quickly AI video would follow. It needs to be used ethically to be useful to society, but when leveraged correctly, it’s an incredible tool. The most sought-after AI video feature is the text-to-video generator. This allows you to type in a sentence and, in a few seconds, be presented with an editable AI-generated video. I tested this feature using two different prompts: A vague prompt: “I’d like to educate viewers about AI-generated video.” A specific prompt: “I’d like to inspire beginner marketers to try AI video generation. The video should explain the benefits of AI video generators and should inspire viewers to try this new video tool.” I used HubSpot’s free AI video generator Clip Creator, and here’s what I saw. They were both high-quality videos. Both videos had appropriate stock images and music tailored to human behavior. The content was very similar for both videos. After testing many AI generators, I’ve found that a marketer’s time is better spent editing rather than making their prompt more specific. No matter how perfect your prompt feels, the end result will still require edits.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now What makes a great AI video generator? So, how does one evaluate all of the different software on the market? The best AI video tools all have a mix of these different features. Intuitive User Interface While most platforms list a long list of fancy AI features, users need an easy-to-use AI studio first and foremost. This enables a quick editing process. AI Scripts Automatically-generated video scripts save an incredible amount of time when producing video content. They turn written content (such as a blog post, email, etc.) or a prompt into spoken language. Sometimes, they even use an AI narrator to read it out loud for you. Not all software can generate video scripts, but it’s an enormous time saver. To be fair to the software that doesn’t offer this, it’s replaceable with a few clicks in ChatGPT. After trying more than a dozen AI video generators, I found the AI scripts were one of the features that made the greatest difference, along with the next feature. Factoring in Human Behavior Some software have tailored their AI to match user behavior, and some haven’t. For example, most people prefer videos with a brisk pace and visuals that don’t stay on the screen too long. In the video world, this is referred to as “pacing.” Not all software is tailored for this, and as a result, it will produce slow, lengthy slides that feel like a bad PowerPoint presentation. This isn’t a detail that software companies list on their “features” page, but it’s something that’s apparent based on the first draft of the video that the software gives you. Template Library Start from scratch? What is it, 2018? There’s no need to start from scratch with video anymore, as most platforms have built-in template libraries. Bonus points if these libraries include variation in: Intended audience. Aspect ratio. Project type. Editing Capabilities It’s normal for different software to offer different editing options, but most AI studios will cover the basics, such as: Text. Fonts. Music. Colors. Timing. Transitions. Animations. Stock footage. Different video styles. Pricing Tiers (or Free Plan) An AI video generator costs $0 to $50 a month (paid annually). All paid software includes a discount when purchasing an annual package, and the cost of month-to-month service is always higher. I know you’re on a budget — all of the suggested AI tools below are either free or include a free trial/demo. Multilingual Look for software that supports multiple languages if your business requires it. A chart comparing 11 AI Video Generators Chart comparing AI video generators Best AI Video Generators AI video generators have come extremely far in a short time. You can now make professional videos with the numerous text-to-video generation tools on the market. I’ve tried all the most popular AI video generators, so you don’t have to. Here’s what I found. 1. Clip Creator Source Clip Creator is the best AI video generator for beginners. It can be used by someone with no video experience and walks you through the video creation process painlessly. You start by answering a few basic questions (like video type), then provide a brief overview of the video you’d like to create. You can choose from video templates, which are oriented for both landscape videos and vertical videos. Then, Clip Creator uses AI to generate the text on your slides, plus the background imagery. You’re instantly given a video with editable text, stock images, background music, etc. The video creation workflow is very intuitive. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video My experience: I love how streamlined this AI video creator is. Instead of bombarding you with endless features, options, and pop-ups, Clip Creator starts simple and allows you to make any edits you need after it generates the video. Source Pros: Incredibly intuitive user interface, great customization options, and makes for a very fast and efficient AI video creator. Cons: Smaller template library than paid AI video generators, and no advanced features like realistic AI avatars. Best for: Video creation beginners and marketers on a budget. Most user-friendly interface and best free AI video generator. 2. Pictory Source Pictory is an excellent AI video generator for creators and marketers who don’t have experience creating videos. All you have to do is provide a script or article to guide your video content. For example, you can submit a blog post to the AI video creator, and Pictory will create a video based on the post that can be used for social media or your website. Furthermore, you can edit videos in minutes by using text. Pictory also includes a feature that creates shareable video highlight reels that can be used as a trailer or a short-form video for social media such as a Reel. Even better, Pictory can automatically caption and summarize your videos.

Marketing AI Tools Practical Tips Trends and Statistics And More! Get Your Free Report Learn more Get Your Free Report Download Free All fields are required. You're all set! Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: I provided the same prompt for Pictory as I did for the Clip Creator video, and it initially generated much less content (only 1 slide). I went back and instead provided a URL of a blog post and tested the blog-to-video generator. This feature automatically creates video scripts based on a blog post, and using their realistic AI voices, I could have it automatically narrated too. The writing on every slide needed to be edited significantly to be useful, but I was impressed with the options. Pictory supports multiple languages (currently English, Spanish, French, and German) and has a huge library of AI voices. Source Prices for Pictory start at $19 per month, and users can try a 2-week free trial. Pros: Users have a lot of options for how to begin their AI-generated videos, and they can thoroughly customize the video output. Cons: The first draft of the automatically-generated videos needs heavy editing. It may be faster to let ChatGPT write a script for you and use that. Best for: Marketers and creators with limited video editing experience who want to convert content like blog posts or webinars into shareable video content. 3. Simplified Source The Simplified AI video generator transforms a long-form video into multiple AI-enhanced clips with just one click. This allows users to create videos from text and make an entirely new video using its accessible editing interface. Simplified simplifies the way we produce content by providing users with easy access to an expansive in-app library that hosts thousands of templates, all available for free. I like that it guarantees exceptional video quality and pairs this with an intuitive, user-friendly interface, ensuring that users can craft high-quality videos without sacrificing ease of use. Its comprehensive suite of features goes beyond basic editing options to include animation enhancements and multilingual translation capabilities, making it a versatile all-in-one tool for video creation. Users can save their brand settings in Simplified’s “brand book” is a great time-saving feature. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just starting, this platform equips you with everything you need to bring your vision to life. Brands like Bloomberg, DuckDuckGo, and Cashify use Simplified for their marketing needs. My experience: I prompted Simplified the same way I prompted the other video generators, and I was immediately asked to describe my target audience and provide my video topic. This was a nice step toward more personalized videos, but it required more user-generated input than Clip Creator, which had a multiple-choice intake process. If you stick to the free plan, it’s time-consuming to sift through all the features to see what’s free to use. Source Prices for Simplified include a forever-free plan. Paid plans start from $15.20 a month and are billed annually. Pros: If you pay for this AI video creator, you have many creation options at your disposal that not all other platforms offer (AI meme creation, AI image generation, AI carousel maker, etc.). Cons: Not the best free AI video generator; other platforms are more generous with their features. You’re not able to test the text-to-video generator without joining a paid plan, as you’re about to do with other features. Best for: Creators who want to create, edit, and schedule videos for all social media platforms. 4. Movavi Video Editor Source Rather than generating AI videos from scratch, the Movavi Video Editor uses AI to make video editing easier. Video editing can be a time-consuming chore; for many, it’s the less enjoyable side of content creation. However, with Movavi Video Editor’s nonlinear AI technique, you’re not just replicating traditional tool functions but also enhancing your videos through advanced AI video editing. With AI background removal, you can cut out and replace backgrounds, adding a new dimension to your visuals. Plus, the AI noise removal feature enhances audio quality by automatically eliminating unwanted sounds, ensuring your videos are of the highest standard. Source The app also offers a host of advanced options like PiP, chroma-key, titles, keyframing, motion tracking, and more. Following the free 7-day trial, paid plans start at $49.95 per year. Pros: The presence of built-in training rapidly familiarizes you with the software, and it has features that many other AI video editors don’t. Cons: This AI video editor brings high-level tools (like color correction) to marketers, but total video newbies may be overwhelmed with some of the more advanced features. Best for: Creators and marketers who already have video footage and want help editing videos to be more engaging (or who just need to speed up the editing process). 5. Fotor AI Video Generator Source Fotor is an image and video editing platform that integrates various AI features, known for its creativity, intelligence, flexibility, and convenience. Its AI video generator fully utilizes advancements in AI technology, making video creation more efficient and enjoyable. Video creation is often a complex and professional process, but Fotor simplifies the steps. You just need to describe your creative ideas in text form and choose your desired style.

Inspiration is important for video creators. Fotor AI video generator provides preset prompts and images, helping creators find more inspiration for their videos. My experience: Fotor’s interface is very user-friendly and simple. you can quickly find the features you need without any distracting ads or clutter. It also provides detailed step-by-step instructions, making it easy for new creators to get started. While creating videos, its preset text descriptions and high-quality images inspired me creatively. They also saved me time and greatly boosted my production efficiency. Source What I found most convenient was that after generating a video, I could perform basic edits directly in Fotor and I could also use their rich AI video tools, like one-click enhancement and beautification, background removal, and object elimination. Pros: The AI video generator supports creating videos in various styles, including Photography, Cinematic, Digital Art, Anime, Neopunk, Game Art, Illustration Art, and more. Catering to various creative ideas and needs. Cons: AI may not always fully understand textual descriptions or emotions and feelings, so some videos may not appear as realistic. Best for: Professional video creators, video creation beginners, social media video influencers, and users who enjoy trying and testing trendy and interesting features. 6. AI Studio Source With AI Studio, users can create videos by uploading their script and using the text-to-speech feature. The platform will then generate a video in five minutes or less. You can manually type in the script or copy and paste it into the platform. From there, you just need to select the appropriate language and AI model and finish editing. AI Studio allows users to select a custom-made avatar that suits their brand.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: New users can input a 300-character script, and an AI avatar will read your script using the AI text-to-video generator. I found the AI models to be less convincing than others; the mouths sometimes moved between sentences, and I think all viewers could identify these as AI. However, since the advent of TikTok’s text-to-speech narration feature, the public has become more accustomed to artificial narration, and there are many situations where this type of AI would work well. Source Prices for AI Studio start at $30 per month. Pros: The platform’s intuitive features make it excellent for beginners with limited or no video creation experience. Cons: The AI Studio avatars are identifiable as being artificial. Best for: Marketing videos that need text-to-speech narration and have visuals for B-roll. 7. Veed.io Source With Veed.io, you can use custom text, colors, font, and music to create a unique video for your brand. One of its standout features is Auto Transcribe. You can upload your video, hit the Auto Transcribe button, and immediately download the script. Even better, there is no software to download, and the platform is easy to use for those without video editing experience. My experience: I entered my “Pinterest marketing for beginners” prompt, and Veed.io quickly generated a short vertical video. The AI video generator automatically provided the script, AI narration, background music, stock videos, and close captioning. The on-screen captions were really engaging, using color-changing text and emojis — perfect for social media. Source Veed.io is free to use for videos under 10 minutes. To access more features, prices start at $18 per month (when billed annually) and go all the way up to enterprise custom pricing. Pros: The pacing, on-screen captions, slang, and approach were very engaging. Cons: The stock video that was automatically inserted into the video was off-topic at times but can be easily edited. Best for: Short-form videos designed to hold attention on social media. 8. Synthesia Source Synthesia's AI video generator enables users to create professional videos without requiring cameras, actors, or studios. Users can generate videos featuring realistic AI avatars that deliver content in over 140 languages by simply inputting text. This makes it an ideal tool for efficiently and at scale creating training materials, sales and marketing content, and internal communications. My experience: Synthesia's intuitive interface and extensive customization options make video creation straightforward. The platform's diverse range of avatars and multilingual support allowed me to produce engaging content tailored to a global audience. The quality of the AI-generated avatars is impressive, closely mimicking human expressions and speech patterns. Synthesia offers a free plan that includes 3 minutes of video per month, 9 AI avatars, and access to AI voices in 140+ languages. Paid plans are available for users requiring more features. Pros: Synthesia simplifies video creation with its intuitive interface and realistic AI avatars. Its support for over 140 languages makes it an excellent tool for creating global content. Cons: The free plan has limited features and is suitable only for basic use. Best for: Businesses and individuals seeking to create professional training videos, marketing content, or internal communications featuring AI avatars, especially when targeting a multilingual audience. 9. Elai.io Source Elai is simple and requires no video editing skills. To use Elai, copy and paste a blog post URL or HTML text, choose a template from its library, and let the generator do the rest. This AI video maker is specialized in corporate learning. Once the video is complete, review it to make any changes before rendering and downloading it. My experience: I found that Elai's format is unique. Even though the AI avatar doesn’t pass as a real human, its small display size makes it feel less distracting. The avatar compliments these videos instead of dominating them. I also really like the audio options: you can upload an audio file of you speaking, and Elai will generate a realistic AI avatar to narrate the text. Source Elai has over 60 languages and 25 avatars to choose from. You can use Elai for free with a 1-minute credit. For more features, Elai’s plans start at $23 per month (billed annually). Pros: As a specialized AI video generator, this tool allows you to quickly create training videos for new hires or product onboarding videos. Cons: Being a platform specialized for educational videos, it would be more time-consuming to create general marketing videos. Best for: Generating videos at scale and creating training videos and product videos. 10. Colossyan Source Colossyan provides a diverse range of avatars who can recite your script in various languages. You can also customize your avatar’s outfit. Colossyan’s key features are auto translations, subtitles, and the ability to enhance messages via screen recording. My experience: The AI avatar options from Colossyan are advanced. You can add multiple AI avatars to a single video screen in the video creation workflow, starting a “conversation.” You can even customize the pauses between speakers. Source There’s a free trial, and the prices start at $19 per month (when billed annually). Pros: The advanced avatar options make this a highly customizable AI video generator. Cons: The sound of the AI narrators isn’t the most natural-sounding. Best for: Creating training videos and explainers for workplace learning. 11. FlexClip Source This AI video generator features hundreds of video templates, AI-generated subtitles, background remover, and a text-to-speech engine. And its intuitive interface makes it simple for creators at any skill level. My experience: I created my video by inputting a URL and letting FlexClip automatically pull content from my website. The AI generator took an enormous amount of work out of the video creation process, but still required editing. The pacing of the video was slower than other AI tools, but I was able to easily customize all elements of the video. Source After the free plan, pricing starts at $9.99 per month (when billed annually, which saves 50%). Pros: The basic plan's price point makes this a very budget-friendly AI video generator. It is also a great, straightforward option for beginners who don’t want to feel overwhelmed. Cons: The AI-generated first draft requires more editing than some of the other platforms. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. 12. Wave Video Source Wave Video is a popular choice among content creators thanks to its many tools, which include image and video assets, text overlay effects, audio, and captions. The platform also provides a variety of video formats for Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and website-based applications. Other key features are: Text-to-video AI. Video hosting. Voiceovers. Text-to-speech. Millions of stock assets. My experience: I tested Wave Video by inserting a blog post URL and letting the AI video generator populate text and graphics based on the content. The video background graphics, pacing, and text populated on the slides needed significant editing to be ready for viewers. I like how easy it is to change the video format and edit any of the content. Wave Video also has many live-stream video tools. Source Wave Video is free, with monthly plans starting at $16 (paid annually). Pros: The features of this software are very beginner-friendly, and the user interface doesn’t feel overwhelming. Cons: The stock images it pulled were lower quality than the other AI tools. The images were blurry and stayed on screen much too long before switching slides (video pacing needed editing). Best for: Livestream videos. Making the Most of AI Video How will AI-generated video help your brand? With just a few clicks, you can create amazing videos, which was unimaginable a few years ago.

      "content": "ByBernard Marr 5 Generative AI Video Tools Everyone Should Know About ByBernard Marr , Contributor. 5 Generative AI Video Tools Everyone Should Know About While last year was all about chatbots and image generators, this year, generative AI tools that help us create and edit videos are all the rage. Now, these aren’t (yet) as advanced as AI image generators, so don’t think you can just type “make a new Star Wars movie,” and it will create a blockbuster for you. Instead, what they do is automate many of the tasks involved in video editing, such as cutting footage to insert, re-ordering scenes, adding audio effects, generating captions, and adding avatars, graphics, or animations. However, they are becoming more powerful and flexible by the day, so who knows what they will be capable of soon? Whether you want to speed up the process of making corporate how-to videos or try your hand at becoming the next Stanley Kubrick, here’s a rundown of some of the top generative AI platforms for creating and editing videos today. Five Of My Favorite Generative AI Video Tools Synthesia Synthesia is a generative AI video tool that is particularly great when it comes to creating digital avatars and bringing them to life with realistic voice and animation. It’s used by businesses to create training materials as well as by marketers for promotional and advertising content, and it would also be a great choice for educational videos. Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 The avatars it creates can speak in multiple languages and accents, with convincingly human gestures and facial expressions. This means it’s easy to create content and then quickly localize it for different markets, products and services. It’s relatively easy to use – you simply type the script and hear it spoken back to you. Like many of the tools here, it offers a free account that gives you access to many of the basic features, meaning you can easily find out if it’s right for you before spending any money. Descript Descript is something of a disruptive player in the generative video market as a startup launched by one of the co-founders of Groupon. By gaining a reputation as a powerful tool for social media content creators and TikTok kids, it’s hit a marketing sweet spot, but it’s also used across a wide range of corporate and educational use cases. Descript users start with a script and then build their video out from there. You just pull in footage that can be manipulated and enhanced with AI, as well as audio that can be imported or generated from text, mimicking the user’s voice. You can then edit and re-arrange the timeline simply by snipping and moving the text. Descript stands out from other AI video editing tools – particularly ones that are available free online – with its user-friendliness and range of features. Everything is set up to make it quick for anybody to start producing and editing videos. Handy features such as eye-contact correction and “one-click” studio-quality sound are signs that the team is looking to add valuable innovations as the tool evolves. Adobe Premiere Pro with Sensei Another example of an industry-standard tool being given a generative AI makeover for the modern age. Adobe Premiere Pro has long been a video editing tool of choice for professionals and enthusiasts and now has a suite of new features powered by Adobe’s Sensei generative AI platform. Functions like transcription, inserting and re-ordering scenes, color correction, and audio adjustment, such as remixing music to match the timing of visuals, can now be streamlined and automated using natural language. It also has a text-to-speech feature that simplifies the process of creating captions and transcripts. This reduces the time that creators need to spend on manual tasks, allowing them to focus on more creative elements of their work. Adobe is going all-in on generative AI, adding tools and capabilities across its entire Creative Cloud suite, and video production is just one area where it is leading the field today. Pictory Pictory aims to automate the process of turning scripts and blogs into videos with minimal user effort. It’s great for those who want to make quick, snappy videos for marketing or just for fun. It can also be used by educators and online course creators to make lively learning material. One of the tasks it specializes in is automatically creating highlight reels showcasing the most important, exciting or interesting moments from longer videos. It then makes it simple to quickly repurpose them as trailers or social clips to engage more viewers. Generative AI is clearly going to make a big splash in the world of marketing, and there are plenty of tools designed to fit the needs of marketers. User-friendliness is a key feature of this platform, which focuses on making it simple to create the type of videos that millions of businesses across the world need every day. Runway Runway is different from the other platforms I’ve highlighted here because it does – to an extent – offer straightforward text-to-video generative AI. This means you can type “Sun rising over a beach at sunset,” and it will create a completely synthetic video. Alternatively, you can upload an image and bring it to life. When I tried it, the results were sometimes not exactly what I was hoping for, but they were impressive nonetheless, and it’s mind-boggling to think what this technology might be capable of in the not-too-distant future. As with ChatGPT and any generative AI tool with language-based input, the results can be greatly improved by taking some time to learn about the best ways to communicate what you want it to do. Other Great Generative AI Video Tools Beyond the five tools listed above, there are many other tools rapidly developing in the field of generative AI video creation, with the most noteworthy ones listed below for their innovative contributions and capabilities.

As we journey through the landscape of generative AI and its impact on video creation, it's clear that the tools we've explored are just the tip of the iceberg. The array of emerging tools rapidly developing in this space promises to further revolutionize how we create, edit, and envision video content. The potential for generative AI in video creation is vast, and as these tools become more sophisticated and accessible, we stand on the brink of a new era of storytelling and content creation.",

Text-to-Video Content Generation Many users do not have coding experience or the time to learn the finer details of video software. That’s why many AI video generation tools include text-to-video content generation capabilities, allowing users to easily turn their scripts or other written text into video content that may include human-looking AI avatars, AI voices, and other elements that create a professional-looking and sounding video. Vocal and Audio Synthesis With an AI video tool, AI speech and audio synthesis make it so any number of videos can be made without a human actor or voice. These platforms take text or rough-spoken recordings and transform them into video-ready voices that are synthetically generated. These voices should be available in a variety of languages and, in most cases, users are able to adjust the tone, pitch, accent, and other elements of speech to make the voice sound more believable. Video Templates A number of AI tools now give users a baseline video template from which to build their video content. These templates may focus on specific industry use cases, a certain social media or digital platform, or a video format with animation or transitional elements. Users can often customize these templates and add their own branding, but the video template gives them the creative ideas and basic design to get started. AI Avatars Many businesses do not have the budgets to pay actors or employees to act as talking heads for brand videos, but they nonetheless want the personal touch of an onscreen personality. AI avatars can be developed to match different appearances, genders, and other expectations, with personalities, tones, accents, and other unique features added to synthetic voices. The best AI avatar solutions create natural-looking avatars and give users the ability to custom-create their own avatars. These avatars can be used for personalized sales and marketing videos, e-learning and training videos, and other forms of media that benefit from a friendly face. Low-Code/No-Code Usability and Video Editing Regardless of how much work AI features can do to put together the final product, users typically want some hands-on control over the video creation and editing process. To make this as simple as possible, most AI video generation tools provide a low-code/no-code user interface, giving customers the ability to adjust slides, audio and visual elements, and other pieces of their video with a drag-and-drop editing tool. How I Evaluated AI Video Generator Tools In comparing and contrasting AI video generator solutions, I scored each option against six key criteria for teams and businesses needing robust yet cost-effective features. From there, I divided each category into weighted subcriteria and assigned an overall score out of five to determine the winner for each category. Evaluation Criteria In scoring the AI video generator solutions, I placed the most emphasis on core features and enterprise features, as top software options should provide standard and advanced capabilities. I also evaluated each platform’s pricing, customization, ease of use, and customer support. Core Features (25 percent): The best AI video generation tools give users the standard capabilities and features necessary to create compelling marketing, sales, training, and customer service videos. Criteria Winner: Invideo Enterprise Features (20 percent): Although many other AI video generation tools exist for casual mobile users and use cases, I mostly steered away from those tools in favor of platforms that offer enterprise features such as multi-language support, automated scene selection, and feedback and optimization. Criteria Winner: Synthesia Pricing (20 percent): When considering the cost of video generation tools, I looked for both affordability and a range of subscription options. In terms of affordability, I sought out tools that offered free versions and/or useful demos and trial periods. Criteria Winner: Lumen5, VEED Customization (15 percent): Flexible platforms allow you to create hyper-targeted videos for specific audiences. I assessed if each tool offers a wide range of customizable avatars, fonts, transitions, voices, and templates. Criteria Winner: Invideo, Lumen5 Ease of Use (10 percent): A platform’s usability impacts user adoption and overall efficiency. Here, I evaluated each tool’s ratings across certified sites, its user interface, active user community, and knowledge base. Criteria Winner: Synthesia User Support (10 percent): For this category, I looked into support channels for each AI video generator via live chat and email and also looked into real user ratings from reputable sites. Criteria Winner: Synthesia Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Find answers to some of the most common questions about AI video generators below: *How Do I Choose the Best AI Video Platform for My Business?*Choosing the right AI video software for your business can feel like an overwhelming process, especially in a market that is increasingly saturated with viable solutions. The best way forward is to consider which features are most important to you, who will be using this software, and what your budget looks like for these requirements. Pay close attention to user reviews on each tool you’re considering, particularly noticing any comments on ease of use or team-based capabilities. For the best possible outcome, reach out to your top vendors to request a product demo and, if possible, see if they can cater that demo to your organization’s specific wants and needs. Going through this preselection process will typically save you time and money in the long run, as you’re less likely to make multiple switches mid-subscription. *What Is an AI-Generated Video?*An AI-generated video is a piece of video content with audio, voices, images, footage, graphics, and other elements that are created with AI rather than by human manipulation. The main use cases for AI-generated video include text-to-video generation and AI-driven video editing. *Can I Use ChatGPT to Make Videos?*No, you cannot directly use ChatGPT to make videos. However, you can generate video scripts and images that can be used in AI videos. Some AI video tools are also integrated with ChatGPT to make text and script generation run more smoothly. Bottom Line: AI Video Generators AI video generators simplify digital marketing and communication, helping users complete many of the most complicated video tasks, ranging from editing footage and audio to creating shorter clips and summaries from long-form content. This type of tool enables greater scalability and a simpler approach to multichannel content creation. Before deciding which tool you should use for your business, consider our list or look into what AI companies can offer to help you narrow down your choices.

Here's what we found. In today's world of powerful generative AI tools, having a top-tier AI video generator in your metaphorical back pocket is like having your own personal Hollywood film crew at your service. In fact, AI video generators are now so capable that major brands are switching from old video production methods to these modern AI-powered ones. Even the Tribeca Film Festival and other players in the film industry are jumping aboard the AI movement, highlighting just how dynamic and impressive these tools are becoming. But if you're reading this and think it sounds like AI video generators are just for the creative pros, don't worry because that's not the case. With AI text-to-video, AI-generated avatars, and tons of other awesome new AI video features, literally anyone can create unbelievably high-quality content. I made this anime trailer, and I think it’s pretty cool. The pictures, animation, and even the song were all generated by AI. Let me break down the process and tell you how it was done 👇 pic.twitter.com/Y117zidiei — Framer 🇱🇹 (@0xFramer) August 22, 2024 But with so many options flooding the market, it can be tough to figure out which tool is the right fit for you. Each promises to be the best, but how do you know which will deliver on that promise and actually be the best AI video generator? We made this guide to help you navigate the crowded field and find the tool that suits your needs. We've carefully selected and reviewed seven top contenders, focusing on what they offer, where they excel, and where they might fall short. So, if you've ever wondered, \"What is the best AI video generator?\" you're in the right place. What is an AI video generator? In the simplest of terms, an AI video generator is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to automate the video creation process. Instead of manually editing clips, adding effects, and syncing audio, these tools handle the heavy lifting for you. You just input text, images, or other media, and AI turns that into a complete video through text to video generation. By using AI, these tools automatically select the best visuals, create smooth transitions, and even generate voiceovers with realistic AI avatars. This means you can focus more on crafting your message and less on getting bogged down in the technical details. How do AI video generators work? AI video generators work by using advanced algorithms to analyze and process your input, whether it’s text, images, or other media. When you provide the content, the AI interprets it and makes decisions about how to structure the video. This includes selecting visuals, syncing audio, and applying effects—all in a matter of minutes. ✨ From Photo AI image to video with @LumaLabsAI's video model that came out today called Dream Machine It's absolutely state of the art and the best video model available right now I think It's able to highly accurately predict 3d surroundings from just a photo, I think up… pic.twitter.com/KDetDBdGIS — @levelsio (@levelsio) June 13, 2024 At the core of these tools is machine learning, which allows the AI to improve over time. The more data it processes, the better it becomes at making creative decisions that result in high-quality videos. For example, if you input a script, the AI video tool can generate corresponding scenes, choose relevant images or video clips, and even create a voiceover. The process is surprisingly intuitive. You simply provide the material, and the AI organizes it into a cohesive video that aligns with your vision. How we chose the best AI video generators To ensure you pick the best AI video generators and generative AI editing tools, we chose products that truly deliver on their promises of creating amazing videos. No matter how skilled you are at video editing, you need an AI tool that simplifies the process. Next, we evaluated the range of features. A great AI video maker should offer more than just basic editing—it should allow you to customize and tweak your video clips until they look like they were made by a professional film crew. We also compared the pricing plans, ensuring that they offer a solid mix of features without breaking the bank. Our goal was to find tools that help you save time and money. ‍ 1. AI Studios by Deepbrain AI DeepBrain AI’s video generator is a robust all-in-one tool that brings realistic AI avatars, natural text-to-speech, and intuitive video creation into one seamless platform. Whether you’re making educational videos, marketing content, or AI-powered presentations, it streamlines the entire process with easy-to-use tools and customizable features. The standout feature here? 150+ ready-to-use AI avatars that instantly add a human touch to your content. You can pair these avatars with lifelike AI voices, customize their look, and even use templates to get a head start. Tools like script generation, voice cloning, and text-to-speech make content creation feel effortless, even if you’re not a video editing pro. Why we like AI Studios by Deepbrain AI: New and powerful For teams, DeepBrain AI shines with collaborative features that let you sync up in a shared workspace. Add to that the ability to export videos in multiple formats, and you’ve got a powerful tool for turning ideas into polished videos – fast. Whether you're experimenting with the free plan or scaling up with Team and Enterprise options, the flexibility here ensures there’s something for everyone. Where AI Studios could improve We love the power and usability of this tool, but since they are relatively new to the space, they could benefit from more brand recognition. Once more people are familiar with this tool and how it can help with creative workflow, we are confident it will be a go-to product for designers and creatives of all stripes. Pricing options: Free plan ($0.00) Personal ($24.00/month) Team ($55.00/month) Enterprise (Custom) 2. Luma Dream Machine Dream Machine by Luma Labs is a video creation tool that uses AI to generate extremely lifelike videos. You can quickly turn your images or text prompts into professional-looking clips. The process of creating a video takes just a couple of minutes. Each video is about five seconds long and can include multiple shots, making them richer and more detailed than many competitors’ outputs. During my tests, some videos were ready quickly, while others took longer, but all captured motion better than any other tool I’ve tried. Whether you're crafting an epic scene or a visually intense moment, Dream Machine captures the essence of storytelling with visuals that feel straight out of Hollywood. Created product mockup videos with Luma Dream Machine V1.5 text-to-video model, and I’m really happy with the results. You can find the prompts in the thread, and you can use the same ones with Midjourney or Flux.#LumaDreamMachine pic.twitter.com/VISWZK8TEp — Gizem Akdag (@gizakdag) August 21, 2024 Why we like Dream Machine: Most cinematic If you're a creator with a flair for the cinematic, you're going to love making videos with Dream Machine. What really stands out is that you don't need precise details for motion areas, Dream Machine still manages to capture motion concepts effectively. Itfollows the laws of physics, ensuring that every shot feels grounded and realistic. Plus, it’s super fast! As their website mentions, Dream Machine can currently produce 120 frames in 120 seconds, which is not too shabby to say the least. Where Dream Machine could improve Although Dream Machine is generally fast, some users have experienced slower processing times when working on intricate projects with a lot of elements. The discard rate can be around 98% with Reddit users pointing that most of the videos generated are unusable because of random elements, incorrect motion, or distortion. Pricing options: Free Plan ($0.00) Lite Plan ($7.99/month) Standard Plan ($23.99/month) Plus Plan ($51.99/month) Pro Plan ($79.99/month) 3. Runway Gen-3 Alpha Runway calls their latest model, Gen-3 Alpha, the new frontier for video generation, and we are here to say that they could definitely be right. The Gen-3 Alpha supports text to video, image to video, advanced camera control, multi motion brush, and after testing some of these features out, we were seriously impressed by how smooth and sharp the results are. The video creation workflow feels super streamlined, thanks to the improved fidelity and motion—it’s clear this model was built for powerful things. Add expressiveness and intention to your generations with Multi Motion Brush. Learn how with today's Runway Academy: https://t.co/EUbxc4aA0D pic.twitter.com/qredD7vsXu — Runway (@runwayml) January 23, 2024 Why we like Runway: Most dynamic Runway's Gen-3 Alpha is one of the most impressive AI video generators we’ve come across. Not only is it a powerful tool for video that makes content creation seem limitless, but it has a shockingly friendly interface and is easy to use. With the Multi Motion Brush, you can select up to five areas with independent motion and control across 3 directional axis (x, y, z) for more precise and expressive generations. Another highlight is how well it handles human-like characters. The AI generates lifelike figures with natural expressions and gestures, adding a level of realism that’s hard to beat. We aren't exaggerating when we say you'll likely be blown away by what you generate with this tool. The videos are truly cinematic and offer an exciting glimpse into the future of creativity. Where Runway could improve Runway is an extraordinary tool, so it is hard to say where it can improve. Of course, with such a dynamic AI video generator comes cost, which might be the only thing holding back casual users or if you're on a budget. Plus, it is true that sometimes the final results might look a little \"wonky,\" but overall the quality is top-tier. Pricing options: Basic Plan ($0 per editor per month) Standard Plan ($12 per user per month, billed annually as $144) Pro Plan ($28 per user per month, billed annually as $336) Unlimited Plan ($76 per user per month, billed annually as $912) Enterprise Plan (Customized with Runway team) 4. Hailuo AI Hailuo AI is an AI-powered video generator designed to make content creation simple but still extraordinary. Whether you’re making cinematic videos for marketing, detailedproduct explainers, or social media ads, this tool automates the heavy lifting—giving you professional-looking results in minutes. Instead of spending hours fine-tuning every frame, creators can focus on storytelling while the AI ensures smooth motion, clean edits, and stunning visuals. #Hailuo AI is absolutely insane for creating Hollywood-style blockbuster scenes! 🎬🔥 Every test is a thrill pic.twitter.com/idaAJWb2BZ — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) March 6, 2025 Why we like Hailuo AI: Fast yet eye-popping For businesses and content creators who need speed, flexibility, and truly remarkable videos, Hailuo AI delivers. One of the standout features is its customizable templates, which allow users to tweak layouts, colors, and visual styles without advanced editing skills. So regardless of what kind of content you ar making, whether it's onboarding video or a marketing campaign, Hailuo AI makes sure your content looks tailored, not cookie-cutter. Where Hailuo AI Could Improve While the AI does a great job with automation, some users may find the customization options a bit limited. For example, while templates are helpful, they don’t always allow for fine-grained control over pacing and scene composition. Additionally, industries needing highly specific branding—like film production or high-end advertising—might need more flexibility in motion effects and camera angles. Pricing options: Standard plan ($14.90 per month) Unlimited plan ($94.90 per month) 5. Kling AI The Kling AI video generator produces highly realistic 1080p videos up to two minutes long, all from a single prompt. The key difference? It doesn’t just generate good-looking footage—it ensures movements and physics behave naturally, making everything feel more lifelike. Have an Amazing Day!☀️🙂☕️ Name: Flower Care Made with @Kling_ai 1.6 Text to Video#AIart Good Monday #MondayMotivation #Mondayvibes pic.twitter.com/MEvNj9HVrw — Jay Kay (@JayKay65220066) March 10, 2025 Why we like Kling AI: Smooth, natural motion What sets Kling apart is how well it captures human motion and expression. Thanks to its 3D face and body reconstruction technology, characters move fluidly and show natural emotions—all from a single image. Its physics engine also shines, allowing for believable object interactions and environments that behave like real-world scenes. Whether you're creating short films, virtual influencers, or AI-generated marketing content, Kling delivers a level of realism that’s hard to match. Where Kling AI could improve While Kling is impressive, it’s not perfect. Some users report slow processing times, especially for highly detailed scenes. Occasionally, minor inconsistencies appear, like hand distortions or subtle motion glitches. More control over camera angles and fine-tuning details would make it even stronger for professional creators. Pricing options: Basic (free) Standard ($72.90 yearly) Pro ($293.04 yearly) Premier ($728.64 yearly) 6. revid AI This tool might be new on the scene, but for improving video productivity for socials, revid is quickly becoming one of our favorites. Their mission is all about helping creators like you make short videos that have a potential to go viral. Why we like revid AI: Best for social media What we like most about revid AI is that it has a specific focus. The AI does the heavy lifting from finding ideas, adding sound effects, creating scripts, and then transforming everything into viral videos for your social media content. It’s a company that knows its lane, and we can certainly appreciate its dedication to being the master of one instead of the jack of all AI video trades. Where revid AI could improve The main drawback with revid AI is that it is niche. This is fine if you need this specific type of content, but it may be lacking if you're searching for a more powerful tool. Pricing options Hobby ($49/month) Growth (Launch offer $49/month) Ultra ($199/month) 7. Colossyan Whether you're making screen recordings for employee training, video marketing content for social media platforms, or educational videos for compliance training, Colossyan offers features that simplify video making for established businesses. Why we like Colossyan: Best for large businesses Colossyan is awesome with AI video editing, offering tools like prompt to video and AI script assistants that help you create excellent videos without needing tons of experience. While it is definitely on the more corporate side of video creation, we saw this tool streamline the creation process and make it easy to produce high-quality generated videos super fast and efficiently. Plus, Colossyan’s extensive library of AI avatars and multilingual support make it a nice choice for large companies and diverse clients. Where Colossyan could improve While Colossyan has a ton of cool features, it may require a bit of a learning curve for those new to AI video tools. The sheer number of options, from AI avatars to multiple export formats, can be overwhelming for beginners. Pricing options Starter Plan ($19/month, annually) Pro Plan ($61/month, billed annually) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 8. HeyGen HeyGen is one of the more impressive platforms we tested. A big reason for this is because it is hassle-free and easy to use, so jumping in was a simple process. More specifically, HeyGen is one of the best when it comes to generating AI avatars. The process of creating a HeyGen avatar boils down to three steps: choosing or creating an avatar, recording or choosing a voice to go with it, selecting a video template, then letting HeyGen put it all together in a matter of minutes. Why we like HeyGen: Most intriguing video generator One of the coolest features of HeyGen is its AI avatars, which are constantly evolving. The platform frequently updates these avatars to include enhanced visual details, expanded speech abilities, and more lifelike animations. Another great feature is the change videos to multiple langauges. HeyGen allows you to create videos in over forty languages from your original video, letting you reach audiences from all parts of the world. Where HeyGen could improve While HeyGen offers a lot of flexibility, the pricing for the Team plan might be higher for smaller teams or individual creators. Additionally, the Free plan, although great for beginners, limits users to just 3 videos per month, which may not be enough for those who need to produce content regularly. Pricing options Free Plan ($0) Creator Plan ($24/mo) Team Plan ($69/seat/mo) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 9. Haiper AI After diving into Haiper AI, we quickly realized it’s a promising tool for anyone looking to explore the world of AI-driven video creation. One of the first things that stood out to us is how Haiper AI makes the video creation process both accessible and efficient, even for those just starting. With just 3 images, @escelce transported us through 3 different universes, holy cow! #KeyframeConditioning #AIvideo #MadeWithHaiper https://t.co/6FwlLObhIK pic.twitter.com/JZdJOq3QMb — Haiper AI (@HaiperGenAI) August 19, 2024 Why we like Haiper AI: Best for beginners What we appreciated most about Haiper AI is its flexibility and how user friendly it was. The platform allows for up to 10 creations per day on the Free plan, which is generous for a no-cost option. That, on top of the text-to-speech feature helps make Haiper a solid tool. For those who need more, the Explorer and Pro plans offer expanded features that cater to different levels of use. Where Haiper AI could improve One of the primary limitations is that the Free plan doesn’t allow for commercial use or watermark-free videos. This might be a dealbreaker for users who need to produce content for business purposes but aren’t ready to invest in a paid plan. Pricing options Free Plan (Beta, $0/month): Explorer Plan (Beta, $8/month, billed yearly) Pro Plan (Beta, $24/month, billed yearly) Enterprise APIs (Custom Pricing) ‍ 10. Synthesia Synthesia is a game-changer for simplifying the process of making (sometimes scarily) realistic AI avatars. With simple text-based prompts, Synthesia turns your script into a polished, video ready project featuring life-like avatars. Why we like Synthesia: Excellent for avatars Even if you're new to video Synthesia has an intuitive interface that makes creating and editing your video feel straightforward. You simply choose an avatar, input your text prompts, and watch as the AI works its magic, transforming your words into engaging content. Plus, the AI video editor allows you to tweak and refine your video, so you can take the time to make those small changes that really make your vision come to life. So whether it is explainer videos, content creation for blog posts, or other marketing projects, Synthesia is excellent for businesses who want to make videos for their products or services. Where Synthesia could improve One of the main limitations is the degree of control available for the AI avatars. The avatars do look polished, but the options for appearance and expressions are somewhat limited compared to more advanced tools. Pricing Options Free Plan (€0/mo) Starter Plan (€20/mo) Creator Plan (€59/mo) Enterprise Plan (custom pricing) ‍ ‍ Wrapping up: The future of AI Video Tools AI in video and avatar creation has come a long way. From quirky results to making videos you’d swear were real, AI's gotten pretty good at this stuff. But the trick isn’t just making videos look real—it’s about getting them to move right, too. With tools like Luma Labs’ Dream Machine or Synthesia, we see how far AI can go in understanding motion and realistic avatars. These advancements are opening doors to new ways to create and tell stories, and brands like Mcdonald's Japan aren't afraid to test it out. These tools aren't here to replace humans in the creative process; but to make it possible to do more, to be even more innovative, without needing blockbuster budgets. Thanks to AI, we’re moving toward a future where anyone can produce a mini-movie or use avatars for product demos. It’s exciting to think about how these tools will help us all be more creative and bring our wildest ideas to life. So, go ahead and play around with these AI video generators. See how they can improve your video project workflow or let you experiment with digital avatars. They're here to help, not to take over. And while you’re at it, make sure to explore our Midjourney SREF codes to get even more incredible AI images.
