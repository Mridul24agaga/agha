But today, we have come a long way! Thanks to technology, we can now stream any song we want from Spotify. Spotify has managed to become a fan favourite in the streaming world by hitting all the right notes with its personalized algorithm. What's the secret to Spotify's success? It's all about the algorithm, my friend. Let's dive in and explore the history of Spotify, the technology behind its personalized recommendations, and why you should pay for its premium service for an unmatched listening experience. From Sweden to the World Ah, Sweden. The land of ABBA, IKEA, and, of course, Spotify. Founded in 2006 by two young visionaries, Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, Spotify had a rocky start. Major record labels were hesitant to join forces with the up-and-coming music streaming platform, but that didn't stop Ek and Lorentzon from pursuing their dream. Fast forward to 2008, and Spotify officially launched, taking the world by storm. It's safe to say that Spotify has completely changed the game when it comes to music distribution. Who needs traditional radio when you can stream any song you want with just a few clicks? Thanks to Spotify, artists can now reach audiences they never would have been able to before. It's a win-win situation, really. Musicians get the exposure they need to grow their fanbase, and fans get to discover new music they might not have found otherwise. Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room - the difference between the free and premium versions of Spotify. Sure, the free version is great and all, but if you really want to experience the full potential of the platform, you gotta go premium. With premium, you get ad-free listening (no more annoying ads interrupting your vibe), offline playback (perfect for long flights or road trips), and higher-quality audio (because who doesn't love crisp, clear sound?). How Spotify's Algorithm Gets You Jamming Personalization is the holy grail of music streaming, and Spotify has certainly cracked the code. Its algorithm is like a personal DJ who knows all your favourite tunes and curates a playlist that will keep you dancing all night long. The algorithm takes into account your music preferences, listening history, and even your mood to create a personalized experience that is unparalleled in the streaming world. It's like having a best friend who knows your taste in music better than you do. Spotify's algorithm is a music genie that grants your every wish and takes you on a musical journey that you never want to end. It's no wonder that Spotify has become the go-to platform for music lovers everywhere. With its personalized listening experience, you'll never have to hear a song you don't like again. The beauty of Spotify's algorithm is that it's always evolving. As you listen to more music, the algorithm learns more about your taste and makes even more accurate recommendations. It's like having a personal music coach who knows your strengths and weaknesses and helps you discover new artists that you never knew existed When Robots Become Your Personal DJ If you thought only human DJs could create the perfect playlist, think again. Spotify's machine-learning algorithm has taken over the DJ booth and is now spinning the tunes for you. The algorithm analyzes user data like a musical detective, gathering clues from your listening history, search queries, and even user-generated playlists to curate a personalized listening experience just for you. Collaborative filtering is just one of the ways Spotify's algorithm works its magic. By analyzing the listening habits of millions of users, the algorithm identifies patterns and trends to make accurate and personalized recommendations for each individual user. It's like having your personal music concierge that knows your taste in music better than you do. With machine learning, Spotify has taken personalization to a whole new level. Not only does it provide a customized experience for each user, but it also continually learns and adapts to your changing musical tastes. So even if you suddenly develop a love for Mongolian throat-singing, Spotify's algorithm will be right there with you, recommending the best throat-singing tunes to add to your playlist.

The Podcasting 10 months ago Talking the Talk: How NLP Helps Spotify Read Your Mind Have you ever found yourself at a loss for words when trying to describe the type of music you're in the mood for? Fear not, because Spotify's algorithm can understand you better than your best friend. Thanks to natural language processing (NLP), Spotify can decipher your musical desires from your words alone. NLP is a powerful tool that helps the algorithm understand the context of user queries and generate relevant recommendations. For example, let's say you're planning a road trip and want to create a playlist to accompany you on your journey. Instead of struggling to come up with the perfect description, you can simply name the playlist \"Road Trip.\" Spotify's algorithm will use NLP to determine that you're looking for upbeat, energetic songs that are perfect for a long drive. It's like having a personal DJ who knows your taste and mood, without you having to say a word. Thanks to NLP, Spotify can interpret user queries in a more sophisticated way, taking into account not just the words themselves, but also the underlying intent and context. This allows the algorithm to provide even more accurate and personalized recommendations. So the next time you're struggling to find the right words to describe your musical taste, just let Spotify do the talking – or should we say, listening? You Are So Special, Even Spotify Knows It! Ah, the power of personalization. With Spotify's algorithm, you are no longer just another face in the crowd. Instead, the platform treats you like the unique snowflake that you are. The algorithm analyzes your listening history, your search queries, your playlist choices, and even your mood to provide you with music recommendations that fit your tastes like a glove. It's like having your very own DJ who always knows what you want to hear next. And with this personalized experience, you can trust that Spotify has got your back, ensuring that you never have to suffer through another terrible song recommendation again. Plus, who doesn't love feeling special? With Spotify, you'll feel like the coolest kid on the block, with a musical taste that's the envy of all your friends. Spotify's Algorithm: From 'Spot-on' to 'Spot-ify Spotify's algorithm is already one of the most sophisticated in the music streaming industry. But the company isn't content with resting on its laurels. Spotify is continuously investing in cutting-edge technologies like machine learning and data analysis to refine its algorithm and take personalization to the next level. In the future, we can expect Spotify's algorithm to get even smarter, providing users with even more tailored recommendations. Who knows, maybe it will even start predicting our mood and offering us music that perfectly matches our state of mind. Or maybe it will develop a sense of humour and start recommending songs that make us laugh. Either way, the future of Spotify's algorithm is exciting, and we can't wait to see what the company has in store for us. With Spotify's algorithm, the possibilities are endless. Maybe one day it will even start recommending songs before we even know we want to listen to them. Now, that would truly be 'spot-ify'ing. Conclusion Spotify has changed the game with its personalized algorithm that makes every listener feel like a VIP. Gone are the days of shuffling through countless songs to find the perfect one – Spotify's algorithm does the heavy lifting for you. And let's be real, who has time for that anyways? By taking advantage of machine learning and NLP, Spotify has set the standard for music streaming services. With its premium features and personalized recommendations, it's no wonder why so many music lovers have made the switch to Spotify. And as for the future of Spotify's algorithm, we can only imagine what's in store. Perhaps it will be able to predict our mood and recommend the perfect song for every occasion. Or maybe it will be able to create personalized playlists based on our daily activities. The possibilities are endless, and we can't wait to see what Spotify has in store for us. So, let's raise a glass (or should we say headphones) to the future of music streaming, where personalized playlists reign supreme. Cheers to that!

With 72% of users happy with the vast music library and easy access, the impact of streaming on the music industry is clear. Streaming services have reshaped how we listen to and enjoy music. Technological advancements driving the music and streaming industry The world of music streaming is constantly evolving, and technology is a major driving force behind the changes in how we consume and interact with music. With the help of sophisticated recommendation algorithms and immersive audio technologies, each innovation transforms how we discover, enjoy, and engage with our favorite songs. How streaming changed the music industry?Since 2018, streaming revenues have surged from $11.7 billion to an expected $25.8 billion, marking a 120% increase in just five years, as reported by Statista Market Insights. The U.S. leads the growth, accounting for 40% of 2023’s revenue, followed by China, the U.K., and Germany (Statista, 2022). New technologies offering alternative ways of music consumption, like personalized AI-curated playlists and virtual concerts that enhance the listening experience, are a motor of change in music consumption. They encourage more frequent music consumption through convenient solutions that do not require much more than pushing the play button. Let’s look into how these advancements shape the platforms we use and fundamentally change how we experience music in the digital age. 5G Connectivity The rollout of 5G networks marks a revolutionary shift in music streaming, offering unprecedented speed and reliability. According to RCRwirelessNews, by Q3 2023, 121 operators had adopted 5G Standalone architecture, with 280 networks launched globally (RCRwireless, 2023) and a forecast for 45% global 5G coverage by year’s end (Ericsson, 2020). This expansion highlights 5G’s significant impact, including a projected increase by Statista from 1.9 in 2023 to 5.9 billion subscriptions by 2027 (Statista, 2023). We have gotten used to certain sound quality after years of compressed music files and streams. Meanwhile, 5G, coupled with the latest audio technologies, can provide an intense multilayered music experience. 5G eliminates buffering, enabling high-quality, interruption-free listening. Qualcomm reports that 5G is up to 100 times faster than 4G (Qualcomm, n.d.), greatly enhancing audio quality and supporting lossless formats for a superior listening experience. Beyond improved fidelity, 5G transforms live music, directly facilitating high-definition streaming of concerts and festivals to your device and paving the way for widespread virtual reality. This technology enhances the music experience and broadens access to live performances, creating new opportunities for artists and the industry. 5G is a revolutionary technology consumers and service providers eagerly anticipate becoming widely available. With 5G, we can expect faster connection speeds, near real-time data transfer, and the ability to utilize immersive technologies. According to Finances Online prognosis, there will be over 3 billion active 5G subscriptions by 2025 (Finances Online, 2021). Smart devices for personalized music streaming As smart homes and connected devices gain popularity, music streaming is becoming an increasingly integrated part of our daily lives. Voice-activated systems are evolving to understand contextual requests better, playing music to match our mood, time of day or even specific activities. This integration is making the consumption of music a personalized experience tailored specifically to our lifestyles. Integrating smart devices has significantly shifted how we access and interact with music streaming services. The innovations have gone beyond traditional interaction methods and provided users with a frictionless, hands-free experience in controlling their music playback. From simple voice commands to complex requests for personalized playlists, smart devices have empowered users with unparalleled convenience and accessibility, enabling them to enjoy their favorite tunes with ease. Smart speakers Smart speakers are extremely popular in countries like the United States, Canada and Australia, with ownership rates of 35%, 30% and 28% respectively. These devices have become a central feature in many households, with over half (52%) of them placed in common areas for shared use, promoting a communal approach to their benefits. Smart speakers are increasingly relied upon to facilitate various tasks, from checking the weather to online shopping, still “90% of the 71 million smart speaker users in the United States use their devices to stream music – some listening for over six hours every week” (Wagoner, C.V., n.d.). Another standout feature of smart speakers is their ability to integrate seamlessly with a variety of streaming services like Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Apple HomePod, transforming into hubs for home entertainment. The personalisation aspect of these devices is particularly noteworthy. Using advanced AI algorithms, voice assistants can suggest new music based on users’ listening habits, continually enhancing the discovery process and adapting to evolving preferences. A simple request such as “Play something I’d like” can lead to the introduction of a new favorite artist or genre. Voice assistance and Natural Language Processing Streaming platforms are improving their suggestions through the use of new and advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning. They are likely to adopt initiatives like Spotify’s AI DJ, which not only takes into account listeners’ musical preferences but also considers factors such as their location, time of day, current weather, and more. All of this is aimed at providing users with the most accurate and personalized music recommendations. AI-powered music recommendation systems rely on sophisticated technical mechanisms to predict user preferences. These systems analyze user behavior patterns, textual context of songs, and even the auditory features of the music to provide highly accurate and personalized recommendations. Collaborative Filtering utilizes user behavior patterns to recommend songs enjoyed by similar users. Meanwhile, Natural Language Processing (NLP) deciphers lyrics and textual data to understand song context, while Audio Modeling analyzes the song’s audio features. These models work both individually and together to create a personalized music experience for the user. Voice-activated controls and AI personal assistants are becoming essential components of music streaming services, enhancing voice recognition accuracy and contextual understanding for intuitive search and playback commands. This elevates the user experience, making music streaming services more accessible and enjoyable. Generative AI in music industry plays a pivotal role in generating dynamic content recommendations directly within the user interface. Real-time analysis of user behavior and trends enables AI to suggest playlists or new releases aligned with the user’s preferences, ensuring fresh and personalized content with each interaction. This level of personalization enhances platform engagement, making every interaction unique for the user. Audio quality evolution As technology advances rapidly, our ability to experience high-fidelity audio in immersive formats is also increasing. From the scratchy vinyl records of the past to today’s digital files, audio quality has evolved through innovation and refinement. Technological advancements and changing consumer behaviors have influenced the evolution of audio quality. For instance, smartphone audio playback has evolved significantly, improving speaker quality, frequency response, distortion, spatial reproduction, and volume. These changes have contributed to a more immersive and enjoyable audio experience. Digital audio technology has undergone a meteoric evolution, driven by advancements in digital electronics, computer technology, DSP theory and techniques, and auditory modeling. The transformation has made music and speech accessible and is a significant component of the information-age revolution. We have explored several technological breakthroughs shaping our perception and appreciation of sound, ultimately revealing the substantial impact of audio quality evolution on music listening experiences. From mono to stereo The shift from mono to stereo sound was a significant milestone in music streaming and recording. It brought about a paradigm shift in how people interacted with audio content. This evolutionary leap, which spatially separated sound channels, not only enriched the auditory experience but also fundamentally transformed how music was produced, consumed, and appreciated. Stereo sound has shaped the modern audio industry, setting the stage for a new era of immersive and captivating musical experiences. In the mono era, all sound elements – vocals, instruments, everything – were mixed into a single channel. It meant that no matter how you listened, whether through a speaker or headphones, all components of the music blended into one monolithic block of sound. While it had its charm and simplicity, it lacked depth and spatial awareness. Music in mono was like a painting in one dimension, presenting a flattened, centralized soundscape. The advent of stereo sound transformed this landscape dramatically. Stereo introduced two separate audio channels, one for the left and the other for the right speaker or earphone. This seemingly simple change had profound implications. It allowed for the placement of different sounds across a horizontal plane, giving a sense of width and space. Instruments and vocals could now be separated and positioned within a virtual stage, providing a richer, more realistic listening experience. It was like stepping from a world of flat, monochromatic images into one filled with depth, color, and dimension. The introduction of stereo sound revolutionized music production and consumption. Producers and artists now had a broader canvas to paint their sonic pictures, experimenting with the placement of sounds to create immersive and dynamic audio experiences. For listeners, this meant a more engaging and lifelike experience. The music felt closer and more tangible as if it were being performed live in front of them. The stereo era brought listeners into a new realm of audio fidelity, where they could hear the music and feel its movement and texture. Introduction of digital audio The advent of digital audio marked a significant turning point in the music industry. This innovation revolutionized recording, storing, and streaming our favorite tunes. Traditional analogue methods gave way to a new era of precision, flexibility, and accessibility with the introduction of digital technology. The digital revolution in audio began with the transition from analogue to digital recording. In the analogue world, sound waves were captured in their original form, often resulting in imperfections and noise. Digital audio changed the game by converting sound into a digital format, typically through Pulse Code Modulation (PCM). The conversion involved sampling the sound wave at regular intervals and representing these samples in binary code. The result was a cleaner, more consistent sound quality, free from the hisses and distortions characteristic of analogue recordings. Digital audio has surpassed analogue in terms of fidelity, convenience, and versatility, fundamentally and permanently transforming how we experience music. Digital audio brought about a significant enhancement in sound quality. It allowed for greater dynamic range, reduced noise, and more precise control over the recording process. Moreover, the compactness of digital audio files, such as the widely used MP3 format, made storing, sharing, and streaming music easier. This accessibility revolutionized music consumption, paving the way for the rise of digital music libraries, portable music players, and, eventually, music streaming services. Spatial Audio And 3D Sound Music streaming has been going through a major transformation in recent years, thanks to the introduction of spatial audio and 3D sound technologies. These advancements improve the sound quality and transform our auditory experiences by providing a new sense of depth, immersion, and realism. Let’s examine how these cutting-edge technologies change how we perceive and interact with music in the digital age, as this advancement is not just an improvement in audio quality; it’s a complete reimagining of the music experience. Spatial audio and 3D sound technologies, like Dolby Atmos Music and Sony 360 Reality Audio, are changing the way we perceive music. Traditional stereo audio confines sound to a two-dimensional plane, but spatial audio breaks these boundaries, creating a three-dimensional soundscape. This technology places individual sounds and instruments around the listener, crafting a truly immersive experience. It’s like being in a concert hall, with music coming from all directions. The listener is no longer a passive recipient but an active participant in the musical journey, fully immersed in the sound. Impact of streaming on music industry Looking ahead, the future of music streaming is poised for exciting advancements that will further revolutionize the industry. Personalized AI-curated playlists are set to become even more sophisticated, tailoring music recommendations based on listening habits, moods, and contexts for a truly customized experience. Virtual reality and augmented reality technologies are also on the horizon, promising to transform live music with virtual concerts that fans can attend from anywhere, creating immersive and interactive experiences that go beyond geographical boundaries. The impact of streaming on the music industry is profound and ongoing. As streaming continues to integrate more deeply into our daily lives, the bond between artists and listeners will strengthen, fostering new opportunities for growth and interaction.

I use the case study of Spotify Blend, an automated, personalized, mock-collaborative playlist feature that combines up to ten users’ music taste and listening histories and regenerates its content daily. I defend the characterization of Spotify Blend as an example of “remix” (or an example of “mashup,” a related concept), wherein the source material being remixed is user listening data and wherein sampling is the primary remix tactic. In fleshing out this characterization, I discuss how the concepts of “authorship” and “attribution” operate in the context of Spotify Blend, with the important acknowledgment that Spotify’s algorithm remains opaque to users. I also compare Spotify Blend with user-generated, actively collaborative playlists created on the same platform. Observations about Blend and its features of use derive mostly from personal experience with the program. Keywords: Spotify Blend, digital music playlists, remix, mashup, authorship, attribution, collaboration potify is a music streaming service that gives users access to a cloud-based library of recorded music and a variety of tools for sorting music and interacting with music “recommendations.” Spotify Blend premiered in August 2021 (Spotify, 2021), adding to the platform’s existing and increasing suite of personalized, algorithmically generated playlist options. Blend allows between two and ten Spotify users to “bond” over their respective music tastes by automatically generating a 50-track music playlist with songs “from” each user’s listening history (Spotify, 2021). Any Spotify user—anyone with a Spotify profile—can initiate a Blend playlist by sharing a Spotify-generated link with others; to join the Blend, other users would simply click the S To Cite: Jael, M.

Figure 1 iPhone Screenshot of a Blend Playlist (March 2, 2023) Note. Courtesy of the Author. Whereas other algorithmically personalized playlists on Spotify, such as “Discover Weekly” and “Release Radar,” are unique to individual users and are generated based on individual listening data, Blend playlists combine the listening data of multiple users. The curatorial goals of the feature, according to Spotify designers, are “creating a cohesive playlist” and “representing […] users’ tastes accurately” (Maharjan & Lamere, 2021, para. 13). The option to “invite collaborators” to personal playlists predates the option to “create a Blend” on the platform. Any existing user-generated playlist can be made “collaborative,” which allows multiple users to manually add, remove, and reorder JAEL 30 tracks. Like with Spotify Blend, users generate invitation links in-app to send to potential collaborators and profile photos are attached to the constituent tracks of a collaborative playlist to denote which user had added which songs (Spotify, 2020). Users can still create these original collaborative personal playlists—Blend playlists did not replace them—but “the playlists which Spotify [creates] and [manages] in-house,” including Blend, tend to be understood as having broader cultural impact than user-created playlists (Morgan, 2020, p. 36). Since collaborative digital playlists are “a form of everyday musical engagement” for many people (Harris, 2022, p. 2), Spotify’s algorithmic proxy for collaborative playlist-making (its Blend playlist feature), and its mediation of the social playlist experience more broadly, are worth analyzing. Finally, it is worth noting Blend’s name and branding. Merriam-Webster (n.d.) defines “blend” as “to combine or associate so that the separate constituents or the line of demarcation cannot be distinguished.” Spotify “Blend” therefore evokes automated combination into something seamless. As I will discuss, though, the degree of seamlessness of the playlist also depends greatly on how much existing “taste overlap” (Lamere, 2021) there is between the participant users. Relevant Literature about Spotify Playlists In this section, I present sources representing different aspects of the recent literature related to Spotify and its (algorithmic) curation of content. A full-scale literature review is outside the scope of this case study. First, Maria Eriksson et al. (2019) in Spotify Teardown document a large-scale attempt to “follow the files” of the now-ubiquitous music streaming service from a user experience perspective, an industry research perspective, and a back-end programming perspective—to the extent that the latter is even possible. Eriksson et al. present Spotify as an increasingly active “producer of unique musical experiences” (p. 64), which supports my exploration of the concept of “authorship” with reference to Spotify Blend. Robert Prey (2020) writes about the phenomenon of corporate sponsorship on Spotify and artists’ goal of “getting playlisted”: that is, having their tracks added to influential Spotify-generated playlists (p. 3). The practice of “attribution,” the other concept I will explore with reference to Spotify Blend, is relevant to Prey’s claim that “there is no way for an artist or their label to know precisely why a particular track was REMIXING “TASTE” Pathfinder: A Canadian Journal for Information Science Students and Early Career Professionals  Morghen Jael 2023. Published by the University of Alberta Libraries. 31 placed, or replaced, on a playlist” (p. 3). The opacity of the processes behind the organization and presentation of content is a dominant critique of digital streaming services. In a different but related part of the academic conversation, Anja Nylund Hagen (2015) writes about the personal playlist experience and the concept of music “collection” in a digital streaming environment. As I will explore, Spotify Blends are algorithmic playlists that resemble user-generated collaborative playlists, but Blends are automatically shuffled and edited every day. My case study, Spotify Blend, therefore represents a notable departure from the personal playlist grooming and the maintenance of a “collection” of music articulated by Hagen. Eriksson et al. (2019) make the important point that Spotify is constantly “[generating] data based on its music streaming that allow for the study of human behaviour at scale” (p. 4). Similarly, David Hesmondhalgh (2022) asserts that listening to music on streaming services necessarily “[converts] user activities into data” (p. 5). Though Spotify’s user data collection and (re)use are not the focus of this paper (not least because Spotify fiercely guards the details of its recommender algorithms), it is clear that listeners participating in Blend playlists are being interpreted and re-presented as banks of historic and ongoing listening data. The status of people’s online activity as “data”—and what such a status might mean, philosophically and practically—seems to be a foundational question in information studies. Finally, Hesmondhalgh (2022) helpfully intervenes in the academic conversation about streaming services in remarking that “recent critiques of streaming often draw upon long-standing aesthetic anxieties about the effects of technologies on music” (pp. 5–6). Such anxieties include concerns about musical experiences becoming “passive” or “fragmented” due to technological intervention or conduction (p. 3). Hesmondhalgh encourages a nuanced perspective: that digital music streaming does not exclusively or necessarily cause passive, fragmented listening, and that such passivity or fragmentation is not exclusively or necessarily a bad thing. Though in the presentation of this case study I am ultimately critical and suspicious of Spotify’s dubious authorship and attribution remix practices, it is important to remember that many people may enjoy JAEL 32 and derive benefits (functional, aesthetic, or otherwise) from Spotify Blend and other automated playlists. Spotify Blend as a “Remix” Following Knobel and Lankshear (2008), who point out that remix is increasingly understood expansively, beyond merely creating an alternative mix of a song (p. 22), I interpret the term “remix” broadly in this paper. The remix product at hand here is the representation—and subsequent daily re-representation—of Spotify users’ listening habits and “taste” in Blend playlists. Streaming services like Spotify play an active and extensive “role in organizing and programming the content they carry” (Prey, 2020, p. 1). Eriksson et al. (2019), drawing from Bruno Latour’s (2005) Reassembling the Social, also portray Spotify as a mediating “actor that transforms, translates, and modifies the meaning” of its elements despite its “self-definition as intermediary” (p. 15). Spotify can therefore be understood as not only a structural shaper of music-listening, but as an occasionally active “remixer” of content, too. Virginia Kuhn (2012) describes a “remixer” as an “interlocuter in the digital conversation” (section 2.6). Spotify’s algorithms and engineers curate actively enough that they warrant the label of “remixer” (or, collectively, the Spotify platform might be the “remixer”). In the following subsections, I present different ways in which Spotify Blend playlists are or resemble remixes. Sampling Spotify Blend is a type of remix in that its software uses the technique of “sampling” to create a new musical compilation. According to Abigail De Kosnik (2019), sampling involves “the acts of copying, cutting, and mixing” (p. 157). To create a Blend playlist, Spotify selects bits from each user’s listening history and mixes these bits into a playlist; sampling, understood loosely, is Spotify Blend’s primary remix tactic. According to Hess (2006), sampling “transforms, critiques, and responds to sources” (p. 282). If we understand users’ listening statistics as the “sources” in use, a Spotify Blend playlist “critiques and responds to” them by providing an encapsulation and representation of users’ “taste” to their friends participating in the playlist with them. Blend subsequently “transforms” users’ listening habits because the automated playlist is meant to be listened to and used for music discovery (Spotify, 2021). Although music listening REMIXING “TASTE” Pathfinder: A Canadian Journal for Information Science Students and Early Career Professionals  Morghen Jael 2023. Published by the University of Alberta Libraries. 33 data—potentially understood as a stand-in for the users themselves, people with music “tastes”—may be an atypical “source” for remix as it is commonly understood, Spotify Blend effectively cuts and re-presents it in a playlist using algorithmic sampling. It is fitting that Spotify’s remix output takes the form of a playlist, since the platform has always been playlist-oriented (Hesmondhalgh, 2022; Prey, 2020). To Spotify, just like to electronic music creators and DJs, a “playlist [is] just as valuable as a song” (Fischer, 2014, p. 27). As Fischer notes, there is legal precedent, at least in the United States, for creative compilations like playlists being successfully copyrighted, because “there is an expressive element in selecting the order of songs on a playlist” (p. 28). Therefore, playlists themselves are reasonable candidates for “remix,” beyond and besides any individual tracks within them being “remixes,” which they certainly may be. Use of Source Material Knobel and Lankshear (2008) define the verb “to remix” as “to take cultural artifacts and combine and manipulate them into new kinds of creative blends” (p. 22). In the case of Spotify Blend, users’ listening habits and profile information are the “cultural artifacts” being remixed. In other words, Spotify creates a “mashup” or a “remix” using the “pre-existing data” of users’ listening history on the platform (Harrison & Navas, 2018, p. 197). User listening habits are popularly understood as being indicative of users’ music “tastes,” so “taste” is another candidate for the status of “source material” in a Blend playlist. Nick Seaver (2022) points out that “taste is not only something people have, but it is also something they do” (p. 11), which makes taste knowable and interpretable by the software programs that users interact with. Kuhn (2012) presents a similar but distinct perspective on source material in remix, characterizing remix as a “digital argument” (1.3) and interpreting “its use of source material as citation—a form of evidence necessary to make one’s point” (3.2). Listener data in a Spotify Blend playlist, operating as its source material, is cited by the company as evidence of common ground between friends and as evidence of the presence of endless, daily-updating music to bond over (Spotify, 2021). As a result, Spotify Blend is “about” the participating Spotify accounts much more than it is “about” the songs or artists that happen to be featured on any given day. JAEL 34 Regeneration and “Endlessness” Spotify Blend is not a static remix product, since it changes daily and is responsive to the continued listening of its participant users over time. In fact, it is “remixed” daily; Blend playlists tend to look similar but slightly different day-to-day. I have observed that the songs with only one “attribution” (with only one Blend participant’s listening history matching it) tend to become swapped out day-to-day more frequently than the songs with multiple attributions. With common ground as the central “argument” (Kuhn, 2012) of the playlist, tracks with shared listener history seem to survive the day-to-day turnover more reliably. In some ways, Blend playlists embody the remix characteristic Knobel and Lankshear (2008) call “endlessness.” Unless participants manually leave a Blend, “there is no end to remixing” (p. 26); the playlist will regenerate every day, whether users are even listening to it or not. The daily regeneration of content supports streaming services’ broader goal of “[keeping] the user within their ecosystem by continually suggesting more songs to listen to” (Morgan, 2020, p. 35). Spotify explicitly encourages users to “keep on listening” to ensure the algorithmic representations of their taste remain accurate (Spotify, n.d.). However, the automatic daily regeneration of content in Spotify Blend playlists defies the ethos and common practice associated with the user-generated collaborative playlists they resemble; static collaborative playlists are often created “for later use at a specific event (e.g., a birthday party)” (Harris, 2022, p. 3). Spotify Blend and Attribution Attribution in Blend playlists is indicated through small profile photo icons that indicate to whose listening habits each of the tracks corresponds. Track attribution causes Blend playlists to resemble what Harrison and Navas (2018) call “mashup”: a remixed product whose “elements operate together but remain discrete” (p. 197). Algorithmic Opacity Spotify does the bare minimum to reveal how or why it is attributing particular songs to particular Blend participants, and its algorithm is opaque to the average user (Prey, 2020). Eriksson et al. (2019) use the metaphor of the “black box”: they argue that Spotify’s inner machinations are often invisible and unquestioned and that the service REMIXING “TASTE” Pathfinder: A Canadian Journal for Information Science Students and Early Career Professionals  Morghen Jael 2023. Published by the University of Alberta Libraries. 35 supposedly “no longer needs to be reconsidered” (p. 7). The software uses “data-driven and automated curation” when it creates Blend playlists, but its precise tactics are a “commercial secret” (Freeman et al., 2022, para. 3). Clicking on the profile photo icons attributed to a song in a Blend generates a pop-up window with information about which person listened to “this track” or “this artist” (e.g., Figure 2). When a user has listened to both the track and the artist, the software picks one of the two attribution explanations seemingly at random, or at least for reasons unclear to users. Figure 2 iPhone screenshot of a pop-up attribution description (March 2, 2023) Note. Courtesy of the Author. The opacity of Spotify Blend’s algorithm opposes the ethos of remix culture more generally, despite my characterizing these Blend playlists as otherwise remix-like. Remix has been traditionally understood as “linked to open-source and do-it-yourself (DIY) activities” (Navas et al., 2018, p. 2). The efforts of non-automated, grassroots JAEL 36 remixers “often expose the process of creation” (Kuhn, 2012, 2.6), and attributing or citing sources in detail is one way to do so (Hess, 2006). Conversely, Spotify’s remixing and attribution are secretive and “effortlessly” automatic, literally taking place overnight and leaving no record of the changes that were made. As a result, Blend participants do not require much technical “literacy” in the software, like they might if they engaged in a more active form of remix (Knobel & Lankshear, 2008). Beyond the Blend algorithm being opaque to users, there are frequent discrepancies in attribution. Lamere (2021) claims that Spotify is aiming for participants in a Blend to be “represented equally” (para. 4). In practice, though all participants in a Blend have at least some tracks attributed to them, I have observed that participants with more “taste overlap” with others (Lamere, 2021) generally receive more co-attributions to songs and their profile therefore appears to have an outsized influence on the content of the Blend. Another example of discrepancy involves the attribution of songs that users have never personally listened to but, for example, were performed by an artist a user has listened to. In Blend playlists, despite Spotify’s goal of “making sure that this specific user would agree the song listed is representative of their taste” (Lamere, 2021, para. 4), I have observed songs being automatically attributed to me that I had never heard before and that I would not necessarily recommend to others. Why Attribute in the First Place? Designers and engineers at Spotify chose to put profile photo attributions beside songs in Blends, but this feature would not be strictly necessary to create a playlist that “blends” a group’s music tastes. (In fact, the demarcation of the “constituent” playlist parts defies the dictionary definition of the word “blend”). There is clearly enough imagined interest in the provenance of the songs—provenance not in terms of song production or performance credits but in terms of whose listening data they were identified within—to warrant Spotify’s choice to “attribute” using profile photo icons. Diakopoulos et al. (2007) point out, though, that there are different norms for attribution when “the audience is expected to already recognize the reference without explicit attribution” (p. 136). If users in a Blend playlist know each other’s music taste well, the attributions in a Blend may become less necessary for interpreting the mix. Furthermore, Harrison and Navas (2018) describe the personal “thrill of being able to REMIXING “TASTE” Pathfinder: A Canadian Journal for Information Science Students and Early Career Professionals  Morghen Jael 2023. Published by the University of Alberta Libraries. 37 identify [the] elements” of a mashup through deduction and cultural awareness (p. 197). The profile photo attributions potentially make Spotify Blend less “thrilling” than other forms of remix, especially for participants who already know each other well. Spotify Blend and Authorship To strengthen my case that Spotify Blend can be understood as an example of remix, Diakopoulos et al. (2007) define “authorship” as the act of “making choices and selections concerning the structure and content of media elements within the constraints of a particular medium in order to make meaning” (p. 133). The Spotify algorithm makes choices and selections of what songs appear on a Blend playlist day-to-day; in that respect, it could be seen as the “author” of any given Blend. However, participants have some agential capacity, including the ability to leave, and thereby delete, the Blend. Spotify’s Agency Navas et al. (2018) claim that “remix and its preceding forms have continually disrupted the concept of the individual creator” (p. 6). Spotify’s Blend playlists represent a further disruption. These playlists imply multiple creators by attributing the presence of songs in the mix to different participants, but they are in fact automated and created by private Spotify software. Though Spotify Blend is an example of “post-individualistic authorship” associated with remix (Vallier, 2018, p. 39)—since “Spotify” is not an individual producing a discrete work—it still opposes the user-focused democratization that is generally attributed to remix culture. The fact that Blend playlists are exclusively accessible within the Spotify application brands Spotify—and its algorithmic system that is “full of people who make choices” (Seaver, 2022)—as the author(s). Despite allusions to user collaboration through profile photo icons, Spotify’s interface and algorithm “set the boundaries and possibilities for music listening” on the platform (Freeman et al., 2022, para. 9). Most simply, it is Spotify’s algorithm, not the users, that adds and orders the songs in a Blend playlist. On another level, Freeman et al. (2022) describe how music recommender software can be understood by users as having “human-like agency” in music curation (para. 15) and frequently becomes involved in “complex socio-technical relationships” JAEL 38 with them (para. 1). Therefore, Spotify (the program, the system) is reasonably conceivable as an informed authorial agent in the production of Blend playlists. It “knows” users’ music tastes, and in initiating a Blend link, users give Spotify permission to represent their taste in a remix. Blend Participants’ Agency Although Blend participants cannot alter the song order or add/remove songs, they can rename the playlist (from the “Friend 1 + Friend 2 + Friend 3” default) and they can opt to “leave” it. “Leaving” a one-on-one (two-person) Blend will instantly delete the playlist for both parties, no matter which of them initiated the Blend link. The initiator of the playlist therefore does not have special authority over the work. This “leave” function also means that Blend participants have ultimate control over the presence or absence of the remix—though whether or not a record of the playlist’s former existence remains on Spotify’s “back end” is unclear (Eriksson et al., 2019). Additionally, though they cannot adjust the track listing, participants in a Blend playlist have control over its broader components (i.e., the remixed and sampled Spotify profiles). For example, if a playlist has not yet reached the maximum attendance of ten users, anyone in a Blend can invite new users via invite link. Adding a new user to a Blend instantly changes the playlist content, shifting the track list to accommodate the new user’s taste history and recalibrating the “common ground.” Spotify might “author” the daily Blend playlist, but it is instantly responsive to certain user actions. The Illusion of Collaboration and Effort Ilana Harris (2022) defines collaborative playlist-making as “a form of music co-curation where two or more people select and order recorded music together” (p. 1). On Spotify, user-generated playlists can be made collaborative via direct invite link and become “essentially personal playlists with co-editing functionalities” (Park & Kaneshiro, 2022, pp. 1–2). Blend playlists, in contrast, are not “personal” playlists and users cannot directly alter them. However, the profile photo attributions in Blend playlists are visually identical to the designation system Spotify has been using for user-generated collaborative playlists since 2020 (Spotify, 2020), making the two playlist types difficult to differentiate at a glance. REMIXING “TASTE” Pathfinder: A Canadian Journal for Information Science Students and Early Career Professionals  Morghen Jael 2023. Published by the University of Alberta Libraries. 39 Spotify Blend also mimics collaboratively created playlists in the rhetoric of its invitation to “Create a Blend.” For a user, “creating” a Blend amounts to copying an instantly-generated link and sending it to a friend. An invitation to “initiate” or “generate” would be more apt. Spotify wants users to feel like they are “creating” the playlist, despite the otherwise obvious passivity of the situation. Aram Sinnreich (2018), in a chapter of Keywords in Remix Studies, points out that “the root of the word ‘collaborative’ is ‘labor’” (p. 56). In this sense, Spotify Blend is the opposite of the user-generated collaborative playlists found elsewhere on its platform, because Blend playlists require very little work to create and no work, beyond a user’s normal streaming activity, to update. Harris (2022) describes how ongoing cooperation and discussion is required to create and maintain a traditional collaborative playlist (p. 6). Spotify Blend playlists, on the other hand, do not require any continued coordination between the users “in” them, besides the initial sending and clicking of the Blend initiation link. Knobel and Lankshear (2008) distinguish between the “art” (the “aesthetics, appreciation, form, and composition”; p. 26) and the “craft” (the “knowledge of its technical aspects”; p. 27) of remix. Spotify lets users feel like semi-contributors to the “art” of a Blend playlist, while the platform handles and obscures the “craft” aspects of the project. For example, participants in a Blend might feel like partial creators of the playlist if they had been actively “curating” their recommender algorithms, as participants in a study by Freeman et al. (2022) intentionally did. However, their contribution to the Blend is always indirect, and being skilled at using a recommender system does not amount to the internal, algorithmic “craft” of an automatically generated music playlist. Conclusion and Invitations to Remix In this paper, I presented the ways in which Spotify Blend playlists resemble “remix” products and practices. I discussed the implications for “attribution” and “authorship” that accompany this characterization of Blend playlists as remixes, with reference to existing scholarly conversation about Spotify’s curatorial power and about what it fundamentally means to “remix” or be “remixed.” Overall, I found that Spotify JAEL 40 Blend remixes user listening data via sampling while mimicking organic user collaboration. This veneer of active participation and co-creation matters. It helps to ease potential suspicions about Spotify’s increasing curatorial interventions, which represent a shift away from the company’s original ethos of “the centrality of the search box” (Erikson et al., 2019, p. 34). The veneer of active participation also encourages Spotify users to spend time—and monthly subscription fees, in the “funnel” toward Spotify Premium (Prey, 2020)—to continually train the algorithm to “know” their music taste. Further, the case of Spotify Blend can be seen as part of a broader trend towards algorithmic content generation and recommender systems in areas of digital activity that intersect heavily with remix culture: digital music streaming services, like Spotify or Apple Music, as well as digital streaming services across media types. Freeman et al. (2022) put the concern succinctly: “[H]uman processes of curation and discovery are increasingly mediated by algorithmic systems” (para. 10). Though Hesmondhalgh (2022) would caution us to avoid thinking of technological involvement in musical experiences as something new, the extent and instantaneity of Spotify’s algorithmic remixing is undeniable. Future research (i.e., remixes of my work, to invoke Hess’ [2006] conception of academic citation as remix) could consider how—or even whether—Blend playlists are listened to by their participants. Another gap to fill would be studying the way that Spotify Blend reflects, or fails to reflect, the history of collaborative mixtapes and music-sharing. Finally, Spotify Blend could be further analyzed from an everyday information behaviour perspective, such as the framework presented by Melissa Ocepek (2017). For example, how often and in what ways do listeners use Spotify Blend as a tool for new music discovery? Are discoveries serendipitous and secondary to what Laplante and Downie (2015) would call the “hedonic” experience of generating and enjoying the Blend, or are they a primary goal? To end on a realistic note, while Blend playlists seem to save users “time and effort” in showing off their music taste to friends (Mackay, 2022), it is likely that Spotify users do not tend to value them as much as the truly collaborative (user-generated) playlists in their digital libraries. Freeman et al. (2022) found that “for many listeners a human recommendation or personal discovery had more meaning than an automated REMIXING “TASTE” Pathfinder: A Canadian Journal for Information Science Students and Early Career Professionals  Morghen Jael 2023. Published by the University of Alberta Libraries. 41 recommendation” (para. 56). Though Spotify Blend is a fascinating case of algorithmic remix, it seems unlikely that it will supplant collaborative digital playlist-making in contemporary remix culture in its current form.

Shrey Tuning UX for Music Streaming Apps Date published ( 3.7.2024 ) Read time ( 5 mins ) Introduction to Music Streaming Apps Imagine being on a long commute, cooking dinner in your kitchen, being at the gym, strolling through the park, or just relaxing at home. In all these moments, music is our constant companion. From timeless classics to the latest hits, we’ve got an endless variety at our fingertips, thanks to music streaming apps. These apps have revolutionized how we explore vast music libraries and create personalized playlists. But have you ever wondered what makes navigating these apps such a breeze? What’s behind their engaging, user-friendly design? The secret lies in their UX – the user experience. It’s the invisible force that ensures every tap, swipe, and search feels intuitive and enjoyable. Let’s dive into the world of music streaming apps and uncover how UX shapes the way we listen to our favorite tunes. Understanding User Experience (UX) What is UX? User Experience, or UX, is all about how a person feels when interacting with a system. In the world of apps, it’s the difference between a frustrating ordeal and a delightful journey. From intuitive interfaces to seamless functionality, UX design is the key to making music streaming apps not just tools, but enjoyable companions. Importance of UX in Music Streaming Apps Imagine opening your favorite music app and struggling to find your go-to playlist. Frustrating, right? That’s where UX comes in. A well-designed user experience ensures that every interaction is smooth, intuitive, and enjoyable. For music streaming apps, good UX means users can effortlessly find their favorite tunes, discover new music, and enjoy a personalized listening experience without any hiccups. It’s about creating an interface that feels natural and efficient, so users don’t have to think twice about where to click or tap. Great UX design also considers the diverse needs of users, offering features like seamless integration across devices, voice search capabilities, and offline listening options. It’s about anticipating user needs and reducing friction points, ensuring that the app not only meets but exceeds expectations. This level of thoughtfulness in design keeps users engaged and loyal, transforming a simple music app into an indispensable part of their daily routine. Whether it’s curating a playlist for a workout or finding the perfect song to unwind, the magic of UX lies in making the entire process feel effortless and enjoyable. Key Features of Music Streaming Apps Personalized Recommendations Ever wondered how your music app seems to know exactly what you want to hear next? It’s all thanks to personalized recommendations. By analyzing your listening habits, these apps serve up playlists and tracks tailored just for you. This keeps users engaged by continually offering fresh and relevant content, enhancing their overall experience by introducing them to new music they might love. User-Friendly Interface Of course, these recommendations would be meaningless without a user-friendly interface to navigate them. A clear, intuitive design is the backbone of any successful music streaming app. Users should be able to dive into their music with just a few taps, finding controls and features without having to navigate through a maze of confusing menus. An aesthetically pleasing design also plays a crucial role in making the app enjoyable to use. Offline Listening In our always-on-the-go world, offline listening is a game-changer. This feature allows users to download their favorite tracks and playlists, so they can enjoy their music without needing an internet connection. Whether you’re on a plane, in a remote area, or simply conserving data, offline listening ensures your music is always within reach. Social Integration Music is often a shared experience, and many streaming apps enhance this by integrating social features. Users can share their favorite songs, playlists, and even see what their friends are listening to. This social aspect not only boosts user engagement but also creates a sense of community within the app. By connecting with others through music, users find even more value and enjoyment in their listening experience. Together, these features create a comprehensive and enjoyable music streaming experience, keeping users coming back for more. Challenges in UX Design for Music Streaming Apps Diverse User Preferences One of the biggest challenges is catering to a wide array of user preferences. Music taste is incredibly personal and varied, which means the app needs to be flexible and adaptable to different listening habits. Some users might prioritize discovering new music, while others might focus on building extensive playlists of their favorite tracks. The app must seamlessly support these differing needs without overwhelming the user with too many options. Cross-Device Consistency Ensuring consistent performance across various devices is another significant hurdle. Users expect a seamless experience whether they’re on their smartphones, tablets, or desktops. This requires meticulous attention to detail in design and development to maintain a uniform interface and smooth functionality across all platforms. Any discrepancies can lead to frustration and potentially drive users away. Balancing Features and Simplicity Striking the right balance between offering robust features and maintaining a simple, user-friendly interface is crucial. Music streaming apps are packed with features, from personalized recommendations to social sharing. However, too many features can clutter the interface and confuse users. Designers must carefully prioritize and integrate features in a way that enhances the user experience without overwhelming it. Performance and Reliability Performance and reliability are critical for music streaming apps. Users expect fast load times, uninterrupted playback, and minimal bugs. Achieving this level of performance requires constant optimization and rigorous testing. Any lag or glitch can significantly detract from the user experience, so ensuring smooth and reliable operation is essential. Accessibility Ensuring accessibility for all users, including those with disabilities, is another important challenge. This means designing with features like screen reader compatibility, voice commands, and customizable text sizes. Accessibility considerations are crucial for creating an inclusive experience that all users can enjoy. Keeping Up with Technological Advances Lastly, keeping up with rapidly evolving technology and user expectations is an ongoing challenge. As new devices, operating systems, and features emerge, ux design agency must continually adapt and innovate. Staying ahead of trends and incorporating new technologies, like voice integration and virtual reality, can set a music streaming app apart from the competition. Strategies for Improving UX in Music Streaming Apps Enhancing Personalization Algorithms One of the key strategies for improving UX is refining personalization algorithms. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, apps can offer even more accurate and relevant recommendations. These algorithms analyze a user’s listening habits, preferences, and behaviors to curate playlists and suggest tracks that resonate with their unique tastes. Moreover, incorporating real-time feedback loops can further enhance these recommendations. For instance, if a user skips a recommended track, the algorithm can quickly learn and adjust future suggestions. This level of personalization not only keeps users engaged but also creates a sense of connection and loyalty to the app, as it feels tailor-made for their preferences. Simplifying Navigation Simplified navigation is crucial for a smooth user experience. Users should be able to access their favorite features and content with minimal effort. This involves reducing the number of steps required to perform common actions, such as finding a specific song or creating a playlist. Implementing intuitive gestures, like swiping to add a song to a playlist or long-pressing to see more options, can make navigation more fluid and enjoyable. Additionally, ensuring a clean and uncluttered layout helps users focus on their music rather than getting lost in a sea of buttons and menus. Thoughtful organization of content and clear labeling of navigation elements are key to achieving this. Optimizing Performance Performance optimization is another critical area. Fast load times, smooth playback, and minimal bugs are essential for keeping users happy. Lagging and buffering can significantly detract from the user experience, leading to frustration and potential abandonment of the app. Regular updates and thorough testing are vital to maintain high-performance standards. This includes optimizing the app’s codebase for efficiency, ensuring compatibility with the latest devices and operating systems, and conducting rigorous quality assurance testing. Additionally, proactive monitoring and quick response to performance issues can help maintain a seamless user experience. Case Studies: Successful UX Designs in Music Streaming Apps We’ll be assessing the home screen, design features and playlist design Spotify Founded in 2006, Spotify has grown into a billion-dollar company, renowned for its user-friendly interface and vast music library. Its success in UX design is evident through several key features. Home Screen –Spotify’s home screen is strategically designed to display personalized music recommendations and listening history. Unlike some competitors, Spotify aims to create an ambiance by curating music that suits different moods. The UX design emphasizes easy navigation through various sections, offering users an intuitive and engaging experience. Design – Spotify’s playful design features a green color scheme and circular buttons, adhering to a philosophy of simplicity. The straightforward, uncluttered interface ensures that users can easily navigate the app without any confusion, highlighting the importance of a simplified user experience. Playlists – Playlists are a cornerstone of Spotify’s user experience. Users can create unlimited playlists, each holding up to 10,000 tracks. Spotify also offers recommendations for similar music, enhancing the personalization aspect and keeping users engaged with content that suits their tastes. Apple Music Since acquiring Beats Electronics and its streaming platform, Beats Music, in 2014, Apple Music has expanded to over 100 countries. Its success is rooted in delivering high-quality music combined with an exceptional user experience. Home Screen – Apple Music prioritizes personalization on its home screen. The app uses nearly all available space to highlight user-specific playlists, songs, and recommendations. This approach ensures that users are immediately presented with content that is relevant to their listening habits.

This data typically shapes the listening experience from behind the scenes: it’s used to make recommendations for what the listener might want to hear based on their previous habits, but the data itself is not surfaced to the listener as each track is selected. This is especially true when listening is happening on voice-activated devices, where ephemeral interactions provide less context for users. This is what we refer to as silent data: Information that drives the listening experience, but is not surfaced to listeners directly.. To explore how to make silent data meaningful to music listeners, we conducted design workshops with 10 Spotify listeners to assess how listeners might imagine new ways of interacting with their personal listening history data in the context of using a voice assistant. *Our research process: Design workshops using personal music listening data as a material* We conducted an empirical study consisting of workshops where we asked participants to design potential future interactions with a voice assistant around music. This approach draws on the tradition of research through design, where design practices are used to generate knowledge about how people interact with technology. We recruited 10 highly active Spotify listeners who regularly use voice assistants and self-track personal data in some way, like keeping a journal or wearing a smartwatch. We focused on these extreme users in order to push beyond current listening and voice paradigms. As a prompt, we gave each participant a customized data profile, generated from their Spotify listening history, that included top most-played songs, temporal patterns, and genre preferences. This is an example of a personal data profile for one of our participants that we created from data about their Spotify account. It included information like top songs (of the past month and all time), top genres, how many playlists they created, and what time of day and week they listen to Spotify. We conducted the workshops in pairs (five workshops total) so that participants could interpret their personal data in a social context and bounce ideas off each other. The workshops included a range of design activities that encouraged participants to reflect on their data in diverse ways: A guided visualization exercise imagining a hypothetical interaction with one of their most-played songs and a voice assistant Mapping out conversational voice interactions with structured dialog cards Exchanging data profiles and discussing them Building a timeline of voice interactions unfolding over the course of someone’s life. Interacting with Wizard of Oz prototypes of their new voice interactions, that incorporated text-to-speech, music, and sound effects. An overview of the design workshops structure, which started with activities that encourage participants to take a designer perspective and finished with activities that encourage them to take a user perspective. A full study protocol is available in our_ supplemental materials in the ACM digital library_. A screenshot of our Wizard of Oz prototyping environment, which allowed us to queue and play songs, custom-recorded sound effects, and text-to-speech voice responses. From the workshops, we landed on four key takeaways that emerged about how we might use personal data as a design resource to inspire new voice interactions. *Theme 1: Personal data helps people reflect on their identities as listeners* Through viewing their personal listening history data, participants reflected on their identities as music listeners. Sometimes, the data validated pre-existing views participants held – like how they’re a person who has eclectic taste, or is a superfan of an artist. Other times, the data caused participants to change how they thought about themselves. A data metric can hold many meanings. Take play counts: A song with a lot of plays could indeed be someone’s favorite. Or it could be the music they listen to while they sleep, or their child’s favorite song. Or, consider the act of listening itself: One participant associated listening with being busy at work. Upon seeing how many hours a week he listens to music, he said that he needs to work less, and “get outside more.” Whereas another participant saw that same metric and commented that he needs to listen to more music – something he associates with downtime. These reflections on what it means to be a music listener – inspired by the act of looking at and discussing logged listening data – could lead to deeper, more deliberate music listening practices. Engaging with logged data can lead to reflections on identity and listening practices. *Theme 2: Personal data grounds futuristic thinking in current experiences* As participants interpreted, reflected on, and designed with their data, they grounded their futuristic thinking in their current experiences. For example, one participant reflected on discrepancy between her top songs of the past month and her top songs of all time. She described how she goes through phases where she becomes obsessed with an artist or song and listens nonstop until she gets burnt out and can’t listen anymore. To remedy this, she imagined a voice assistant that could help her manage this behavior and extend the pre-burnout phase: I wish it was like when I hit five listens in one day, it was like, “You’ve listened five times. Here’s another artist that opened for her.” Or if it gave me other context where I could get distracted from her a little bit. This futuristic interaction solves a real, everyday problem. An example of the data in one of the participant’s data profiles and the novel voice experience that reflecting on this data inspired. We also shared metadata that participants might not have been aware of, such as genres of their favorite artists or their geographic origins. Some participants imagined a voice assistant prompting them with these metadata dimensions, like: “You listen to more artists from Detroit than any other city – would you like to hear a Detroit playlist?” Thus,exposure to this metadata provided a new lens on participants’ existing behaviors, enabling them to imagine new interactions that authentically reflect their current listening practices. *Theme 3: Data can be a trigger for interaction, rather than a focus* Going into this study, we hypothesized that people might want to explore their data using sound and voice as a standalone activity, and would perhaps want something like an voice-mediated version of Spotify’s year-end “Wrapped” feature. Instead, personal data served as a trigger, not a focus, of voice interactions: Participants honed in on data milestones—the 100th song added to a playlist, the anniversary of the first time they heard a song—as events that might trigger a voice assistant to suggest actions, like sharing the playlist, or exploring adjacent music. These interactions explicitly reference data points, but the data isn’t the point. The point was an enhanced way to meaningfully explore music, using personal data as salient ways to enter these new interactions. Logged data, like the date a user first listened to a song or the number of songs in their playlists, could become data milestones that trigger voice suggestions for action, such as exploration or sharing. *Theme 4: Data can help us take voice assistants from voice-activated remote controls to personalized music coaches* One of the main ways people use voice assistants and smart speakers is to play music, but they tend to use simple functions, like asking for a song or pausing playback, treating them as glorified voice-activated remote controls. In our workshops, however, we found that participants imagined something less like a voice-activated remote control and more like a music coach who could proactively support them as they expanded their musical personalities and evolved their musical tastes. Participants imagined voice assistants that have musical intelligence, and that leverage to do things like jumping straight to the chorus, reciting back lyrics, or explaining the meaning of a song. Some participants imagined that this musical intelligence might even be combined with intelligence about them, the listener. But people acknowledged that this might not work right off the bat, and that they’d have to collaborate with the voice assistant and teach it their preferred ways to interact. This process might unfold through errors: Participants didn’t expect a voice assistant will always get things right, but they did hope that it might ask for feedback so it could course-correct when it gets things wrong. Another way participants might teach a voice assistant how they like to interact is through tagging the music with their own language, “I feel like it’d be really easy to be like, ‘I like that…that song makes me feel really happy’ or ‘I’m feeling uplifted.”’ Through this kind of specific, on-the-fly labeling of their music experiences, participants described building a personalized, shared language with the voice assistant. They also imagined dialogs where they could decide, with the voice assistant, what to listen to—collaborating with the voice assistant, as a music coach, to figure out what to play, rather than simply commanding it. Considering these findings, we leave you a challenge for applying this approach to your research and design work. Challenge: Turn silent data into a vocabulary for exploration – alongside end-users We found that presenting people with silent data provided a new lens on their existing behaviors and a new vocabulary for understanding them. This new vocabulary can also scaffold people as they discover features or content. Exposing silent data may be a way to tackle a common problem in voice interaction design: How do users figure out what they can do with voice assistants? Imagine this interaction: A user asks a voice assistant, “Play more music like this.” The voice assistant might respond, “Ok, how would you describe this song in your own words?” Involving end-users in the process of logging and interpreting meta-data could be an inroad into feature discovery in voice interactions. Or, after playing an algorithmically selected song, a voice assistant could ask users why they think it chose that song, then respond with the reasoning behind the recommendation. These types of interactions expose and build the system’s contextual intelligence, while also teasing out a user’s preferences. Thus we challenge you to consider additional ways previously silent data might become a new vocabulary for exploration. But in order to use silent data to derive a user-centric vocabulary of exploration, we first have to understand it. One way to do this is to involve end-users in the design of data logging capabilities. Users have valuable knowledge about what data metrics mean that are often unavailable to designers. Data-inspired design activities, with end users, can spark forward-focused, generative discussions about what people can do with their data.
