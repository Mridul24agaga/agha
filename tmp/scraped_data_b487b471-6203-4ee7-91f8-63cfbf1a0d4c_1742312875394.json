      "content": "3 reasons to use streaming audio over traditional radio When you jump in your car, do you listen to the radio or plug in your phone and stream your favorite playlist? Chances are, it’s the latter, especially with CarPlay becoming standard in newer vehicles. According to a 2020 report by research firm Strategy Analytics, fewer people around the world are using AM/FM car radios due to various factors, including a marked decline in commutes to work. “2020 is the year that in-car AM/FM radio has hit the proverbial ‘iceberg,’” the report said. Derek Viita, report author and Senior Analyst of Strategy Analytics’ IVX group, said, “While radio still has unique advantages, the pandemic has only worked to increase adoption of other media sources,” Viita continued, “some radio providers in the West are reporting that their ratings have nose-dived because many of those who listened on their commute have not rejoined from home.” When you’re at home relaxing, do you dial into your favorite radio station on your boombox or open your favorite audio streaming app on your phone or smart device? Again, chances are the latter. You might think, ‘well, 2020 was a few years ago’, however, a 2022 statistic states that 74% of U.S. internet users, or 222.7 million people, listened to digital audio. (That’s two-thirds of the U.S. population!) Of these digital audio listeners, 40% are using ad-supported versions. Though the growth of that market share will slow, the time each listener spends is rapidly increasing. In 2022, U.S. internet users spent nearly as much time streaming music and podcasts as they spent watching broadcast TV daily (which still accounts for the largest share of U.S. internet users’ time spent with media). The road to audio streaming began in 1993 when the MP3 was introduced and the ability to download music through the internet was launched. More than two decades later, what began as having to purchase individual songs has turned into the ability to listen to all the songs you wanted, as long as you listen to the occasional ad or pay for the monthly subscription. According to data from the Recording Industry Association of America, streaming grew from 7% of the U.S. music market in 2010 to an incredible 80% at the end of the decade. And according to research conducted by Edison Research: Now, is there a time and place for traditional “terrestrial” radio, especially when, according to Nielsen, radio still reaches 86% of Americans 18+ every week? Of course, but that’s not what this article is about. Reason 1: Targeting Understanding your audience and figuring out how to reach them is crucial to advertising. Where traditional radio listenership relies on estimates, the innate nature of digital media provides advertisers with a better understanding of who’s listening. Demographics, location, device usage, and listening habits are things that you can target with streaming audio. As you can see, the targeting capabilities with streaming audio can be robust, enabling advertisers to meet consumers where they are at with messaging tailored to them. This precision in targeting is not available through traditional radio. According to the 2023 released streaming statistics by Headphones Addict, U.S. users also almost entirely use streaming to listen to music. Here are the use percentages of music streaming services by age group: Reason 2: Key Performance Indicators Key performance indicators (KPIs) – are a way to track campaigns and know if they are providing results. For example, when running spots on traditional radio, you get a report back at the end of the campaign on the days and times your spot was broadcast, even with an estimated total reach. When you place an ad on a streaming audio platform, you gain insight into much more. Like other digital advertising channels, data is available for the four basic performance metrics: A metric unique to streaming audio is the Audio Completion Rate. This is the percentage of ads served that were played to the end. The benchmark for audio completion of ads on Spotify is 91% — in traditional radio, you can’t account for if someone changes stations when commercials come on (and where you only know when the spot was played and their estimated listenership). With the ability to track, respond, and modify approaches for target audiences, streaming audio makes optimizing easier and allows for a more effective campaign. Reason 3: Cost Though you can allocate the same amount to traditional radio and streaming audio, what you receive in return is vastly different. Many streaming platforms have minimum spend requirements of just a few hundred dollars ($250 is the minimum for Spotify). In contrast, the necessary budget for traditional radio depends on your market but typically is in the thousands. With the ability to target more precisely, obtain accurate reporting, and maximize your budget, streaming audio is worth considering for your next targeted campaign.

With digital technology and the internet at the forefront, music enthusiasts now have access to an expansive library of songs spanning genres and eras at their fingertips. In this blog, we delve into the changing dynamics of music consumption, comparing the strengths and challenges of music streaming and traditional radio and exploring how these two mediums coexist in the modern music world. Join us as we explore the fascinating journey of Music Streaming vs. Traditional Radio and its impact on how we experience and enjoy music today. Unstoppable Growth of Music Streaming The dominance of music streaming platforms, like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music, has revolutionized how we listen to music. These platforms offer a treasure trove of songs on-demand, empowering users to curate personalized playlists and effortlessly explore new music. With its great convenience, diverse selection, and accessibility, music streaming has witnessed exponential growth in recent years. Recent Statistics The IFPI’s report revealed that in 2020, streaming accounted for a staggering 62% of global music industry revenues, amounting to an impressive $13.4 billion. With over 345 million monthly active users as of March 2023, Spotify is the largest music streaming service, proving its widespread appeal. Moreover, paid music streaming subscriptions worldwide reached an astounding 487 million in 2020, showcasing a remarkable 23% increase from the previous year. Advantages of Music Streaming: Limitless Variety and Accessibility Music streaming platforms boast an extensive library encompassing a wide array of genres, eras, and languages, catering to the diverse musical tastes of listeners. Users can enjoy their favorite tracks anytime, anywhere, with a simple internet connection. Personalization at its Finest Sophisticated algorithms and user data analysis power personalized music recommendations and curated playlists, enhancing music discovery and introducing users to new artists and genres. Cost-Effective Flexibility Embracing free and premium subscription models, music streaming services provide affordable and flexible options for music lovers to access their favorite tunes legally without breaking the bank. Empowering Independent Artists Streaming platforms serve as a global stage for independent artists to showcase their work, reaching a vast audience and potentially catapulting them into the spotlight. This democratization of the music industry fosters equal opportunities for emerging talents. Waning Influence of Traditional Radio While music streaming thrives, traditional radio has experienced a decline in listenership. Once a primary source for music discovery, radio stations now face fierce competition from streaming services. Noteworthy statistics highlight this shift: Nielsen’s study indicated that radio’s average weekly reach in the United States decreased from 92% in 2008 to 88% in 2018, with younger demographics showing the sharpest decline. According to Edison Research’s Infinite Dial 2022 report, the percentage of Americans aged 12-34 who use AM/FM radio as their primary audio source dropped from 33% in 2018 to 20% in 2022. Understanding Radio’s Challenges Limited Choice Traditional radio’s narrow playlist and genre-specific approach fail to cater to the diverse musical preferences of modern listeners, limiting its appeal. Interruptive Advertising Frequent advertisements and commercials disrupt the radio listening experience, contrasting with the uninterrupted flow enjoyed through music streaming platforms. Lack of Control Unlike music streaming, where users have control over song selection and order, traditional radio offers limited customization, not aligning with the personalized experience sought by today’s listeners. Geographical Boundaries Geographical limitations restrict traditional radio’s reach, whereas music streaming transcends these boundaries, offering a boundless world of music. Ending Note The music industry has witnessed a transformation in recent years, with music streaming platforms taking center stage and traditional radio experiencing a decline in popularity. However, it is worth noting that radio still holds relevance for specific demographics and live programming. With the change in the music industry, artists, labels, and broadcasters must adapt to the changing dynamics and search for innovative ways to engage audiences across different platforms. Music streaming software has proven instrumental in meeting the growing demand for convenient and personalized music consumption. With expansive music catalogs, personalized recommendations, quick accessibility, interactive features, and a focus on artist promotion and discovery, streaming platforms have effectively stayed ahead in the market. By embracing technology and user-centric strategies, these platforms have transformed the music industry and provided listeners with an immersive and tailored music experience.

      "content": "Anima The Future of Music Consumption: Streaming Vs Traditional Radio February, 2025 In recent years, the way we consume music has changed dramatically. The transition from traditional media to digital platforms has transformed the music industry, redefining listening habits and the relationship between artists and audiences. Streaming services have emerged as the new leaders in music distribution, driving significant changes in the industry and raising questions about the future of traditional radio. However, while streaming has revolutionized how we discover and listen to music, radio still plays a fundamental role in music dissemination and promotion. The Rise of Music Streaming As previously mentioned, streaming services have experienced exponential growth in recent years, deeply impacting both the revenue of the music industry and how people consume music. By 2020, streaming accounted for 62% of global music industry revenue, with giants like Spotify amassing over 345 million monthly active users—figures that have nearly doubled in the past four years. Changes in Audience and Preferences Streaming platforms not only provide vast music catalogs but also incorporate sophisticated personalization features tailored to user preferences. These features enhance the listening experience through personalized recommendations and curated playlists, attracting a large segment of the traditional radio audience, particularly younger demographics. As a result, radio declined by 13% as the primary audio source among individuals aged 12 to 34 in 2022. The Impact on Traditional Radio Globally, despite the exponential growth of streaming services, traditional radio (AM/FM) still retains a substantial audience, reaching over 90% of the world's population each month, according to industry data, with notable figures in countries such as Brazil, Japan, and several European nations. However, competition from streaming services has diminished radio’s role as the primary medium for discovering new music, particularly among younger audiences. To counteract this impact, many radio stations have diversified their offerings by integrating content into digital platforms, including streaming, mobile apps, podcasts, and live broadcasts, aiming to maintain relevance in an increasingly technological and competitive media landscape. How the Music Industry is Adapting As the music industry continues evolving, record labels and radio stations must adopt new strategies to remain competitive and relevant. Record Labels and Artists With streaming services dominating music consumption, record labels have adjusted their strategies to stay ahead. Some of their key adaptations include: • Data-Driven Talent Acquisition: using streaming analytics and social media trends to identify emerging artists and trending songs that might not yet be widely known. • Focus on Digital Marketing: shifting promotional efforts from traditional methods to social media campaigns, influencer collaborations, and targeted digital advertising, ensuring better engagement with younger audiences. • Innovations in Licensing and Revenue: negotiating complex licensing deals with streaming platforms and exploring blockchain technologies to enable transparent revenue distribution. • Support for Independent Artists: providing distribution and promotional infrastructure for artists who prefer to operate independently, allowing labels to expand their reach to a broader audience. Radio’s Response to Digital Disruption Like record labels, radio stations are evolving by integrating digital and technological strategies into their operations. Some of their key adaptations include: Hybrid Content Offering: Enhanced Interactivity: Technological Integration: Conclusion The landscape of music and radio consumption is undergoing a fundamental transformation, with streaming services leading the redefinition of user engagement. Although traditional radio faces significant challenges, it still holds a place in the industry, particularly in live programming and among certain audience segments, with a brand recall rate significantly higher than other advertising media.

If you like what you see, follow us on our social channels for more! ReviewsInterviewsConcertsFestivals SubmitSearch 10 Advantages Listeners Can Enjoy with an Online Radio Station With technology constantly evolving, the way we consume media has undergone a drastic transformation. Traditional radio stations are facing stiff competition from online radio stations, which offer a myriad of advantages for listeners. In this blog post, we will explore ten benefits that listeners can enjoy by tuning in to an online radio station. From limitless music choices to the ability to listen on-the-go, online radio stations have revolutionized the way we experience audio content. 1. Diverse and Extensive Music Library One of the most significant advantages of online radio stations is their vast and diverse music library. Unlike traditional radio stations that stick to a limited playlist determined by program directors, online platforms offer an abundance of genres and artists to choose from. Listeners can explore different styles and eras of music with just a few clicks. This variety ensures that there is something for everyone's taste and mood. 2. Personalized Listening Experience Online radio stations also give listeners the power to customize their listening experience based on their preferences. Many platforms offer features such as personalized playlists, curated recommendations based on previous listening habits, and the option to create custom stations tailored to specific genres or artists. These features enable users to discover new music while enjoying their favorites. 3. Ad-Free Listening Traditional radio often interrupts the flow of music with advertisements and commercials. However, many online radio stations provide ad-free listening experiences for their subscribers or premium members who pay a monthly fee. This uninterrupted listening allows you to fully immerse yourself in your favorite songs without any unwanted interruptions. 4. On-The-Go Access The convenience of accessing your favorite music anytime anywhere is another advantage offered by online radio stations. With smartphones and mobile apps becoming increasingly common, listeners can tune in from virtually anywhere with an internet connection – whether you're commuting to work or going for a run in the park. 5. Enhanced Sound Quality While traditional FM and AM radio broadcasts often suffer from a loss in sound quality due to signal limitations, online radio stations prioritize high-quality audio. Many platforms stream at high bitrates, ensuring that listeners can enjoy their favorite tracks with crystal-clear sound. This enhanced sound quality enhances the overall listening experience. 6. Discover New Artists Online radio stations are excellent platforms for discovering new and emerging artists who may not receive airplay on traditional stations. These platforms often promote independent musicians, enabling them to reach a wider audience and gain popularity. With features like algorithm-based recommendations and artists in similar genres, you can stumble upon hidden gems that you may have otherwise overlooked. 7. Interaction with DJs and Other Listeners Unlike traditional radio stations, where listener interaction is limited or non-existent, online radio stations foster a sense of community among listeners through various interactive features. Some platforms allow listeners to chat with DJs or other users in real time while the music is playing, creating a virtual gathering space for like-minded individuals who share similar musical interests. 8. Podcasts and Talk Shows In addition to music, many online radio stations also offer podcasts, talk shows, and audio documentaries on various topics of interest. These programs provide an alternative form of entertainment for those seeking informative content or engaging discussions beyond just music. Whether you're interested in politics, health, or storytelling – there's likely a podcast or talk show for you on online radio stations. 9. Time-Shifting Capabilities Did you miss your favorite radio program? Online radio stations save the day with time-shifting capabilities that enable listeners to catch up on missed shows or listen to them at their convenience. Many platforms have built-in archiving features that allow users to access past episodes of shows they may have missed during their original broadcast timeslot. 10. Global Reach and Cultural Exposure Finally, online radio stations give you access to an international landscape of music from across the globe – without booking a flight ticket! These platforms enable listeners to indulge in various cultural experiences by exploring music from different countries and regions. Whether you're craving the vibrant beats of Latin America or the soulful melodies of Africa, online radio stations expand our musical horizons and promote cultural diversity. Conclusion The advent of online radio stations has transformed the way we enjoy audio content. With a diverse music library, personalized listening experiences, ad-free listening, and time-shifting capabilities, online platforms offer numerous advantages over traditional radio broadcasts. Furthermore, the ability to discover new artists, interact with DJs and other listeners, access podcasts and talk shows, and experience global music make online radio stations a compelling option for any music enthusiast.

Output Nov 02, 2018 Are playlists good for musicians? This is a question that’s been dissected every which way for years. Let’s break down the pros and cons. Are playlists good for musicians? This is a question that’s been thrown around and dissected every which way for years. Playlists undoubtedly give musicians some huge benefits. But there may also be a few negative consequences to be found in a world that now largely looks to playlists in order to fulfill their music listening needs. Let’s break down the pros and cons. Playlists changed Starley’s life. A 2017 article published in Wired Magazine tells the story of how one of her songs showing up on popular Spotify playlists made her a huge star in a couple of months. Now racking up plays in the millions, Starley’s story shows how much power and influence playlists hold in the music industry. Unfortunately, the impact they have on artists isn’t always positive. Playlists are great at entertaining listeners, but are they a suitable replacement for albums? When taking a look at how much musicians are now earning and their artistic impact, some might not think so. How playlists are edging out albums Audiences around the world are listening to playlists more and albums less. Playlists accounted for 31 percent of music listening time, according to a survey conducted in 2016. Albums only made up 22 percent of that time. Statistics in a recent TechCrunch article shows similar results: “Album sales, including both digital and physical, fell 17.7 percent last year to 169.15 million copies, down from 205.5 million in 2016. Meanwhile, streaming once again soared, leading the overall music industry to growth, largely due to the significant 58.7 percent increase in on-demand audio streams over last year.” TechCrunch Audiences use Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon to stream albums, but listening trends now favor playlists in a big way. Since albums have been the world’s main listening format for decades, the shift to playlists is a huge deal. What does it mean for musicians? Like everything in our world today, the answer is complicated. What playlists give musicians When an unknown artist is featured even on a modestly followed playlist, it can bring significant exposure measured in more listeners, interest from blogs and media outlets, and new opportunities. Unlike traditional radio, there’s no barrier keeping unestablished artists from gaining traction over major streaming platforms. There’s plenty of exceptions, but many playlist curators adopt a music-first policy when deciding what music to feature. This makes getting music in front of attentive listeners for small artists much easier than it used to be for artists making the sort of music playlist curators want to hear, that is. Yes, playlists are helping musicians find audiences, but they can also lead to diminishing creative potency. Usually, singles don’t give musicians the amount of sonic or artistic freedom to stand on as albums do. Playlists match the right song to the right listener Personalized music discovery tools like Spotify’s Discover Weekly and Apple Music’s For You are connecting new music with listeners in a powerful way that helps artists releasing music at every level. Often without promotion, these customized playlists benefit artists by putting their music in front of listeners who’ll most likely want to hear it. This sort of tech saves artists time and money by making it easy to connect with the sort of audiences who are most likely to resonate with their music. So, what’s the catch? Playlists are great at entertaining listeners, but are they a suitable replacement for albums? When taking a look at how much musicians are now earning and their artistic impact, some might not think so. Streaming revenue has yet to replace album sales For over half a century, musicians made their living largely off of album sales. A Recording Industry Association of America graph tracking music industry sales shows that in 2000, CD sales hit their peak with earnings reaching $13.2 billion dollars. That figure accounted for 92.3 percent of music industry revenue that year. In 2017, that number dropped to $1.1 billion dollars. And, subscription fees paid to major streaming platforms like Apple Music, Spotify, and Amazon made up the vast majority of music industry profits, totaling $3.5 billion dollars. Also in 2017, album downloads came in at a meager $632.7 million dollars. One-off singles on playlists give musicians less of a creative impact Then, there’s the diminishing artistic impact of singles to consider when it comes to the current playlist-driven listening culture. Where artists used to be largely defined by albums they’d often throw years of work into, playlists give musicians much less of a chance to make an impression on listeners. Yes, playlists are helping musicians find audiences, but they can also lead to diminishing creative potency. Usually, singles don’t give musicians the amount of sonic or artistic freedom to stand on as albums do. The creative loss we could experience when musicians stop focusing their efforts on making great albums is something our culture has yet to accept or confront. Peruse some Spotify or Youtube playlists and you’ll probably find some artists you’ve never heard of racking up plays, views, and listeners in the millions. This is because playlist culture is great at bringing listeners to the party, but not converting them into devoted fans. The way most streaming platforms are currently set up allows listeners to “like” or “follow” an artist, but this often results in individual songs being added to personal listening libraries and not much else. Coming out with a great song that’s featured on popular playlists is definitely a good thing for artists, but it’s by no means a guarantee that musicians who win over true fans in the process. And where the goal of most musicians used to be to create broad music statements through collections of songs found on albums, many are now tempted to play the short game and focus on singles instead. The creative loss we could experience when musicians stop focusing their efforts on making great albums is something our culture has yet to accept or confront. Music first but musicians last? The frustrating dichotomy is that playlists are ushering in an unprecedented era in music where music truly does come first, but in a way that often negatively impacts music creators. Like many things currently happening in our world, the real impact of playlists probably won’t be fully understood for some time, but the changes in music we’re already seeing are profound.

Become a Royalty Exchange member. Start Investing In the new music streaming economy, curated playlists have become a powerful medium for music discovery, promotion, and spins. We now live in an attention economy. Distribution is easy. Attention is scarce. With access to all the music in the world at the click of a button, how do listeners decide what to play? Now that the technology and business models behind music streaming have largely worked themselves, out, this tyranny of choice is the greatest challenge facing artists and music services alike. Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, and others don’t own the music they stream. They license it from the labels. So a handful of exclusives aside, they all pretty much have access to the same catalog. So how do they compete for users? Simply put… it’s their curation, or the way their large “rented” catalog is surfaced to users. The service that most accurately and easily presents each individual listener with the songs he or she wants at that moment is the one that will best attract and retain the largest user base. Some of this is powered by algorithms, complex mathematical equations that compare millions of song attributes against a user’s listening behavior to make guesses on what they might like to hear next. But more recently we’ve seen a growing trend of human curation… music experts paid to create custom playlists based on different moods, situations, activities, or genres. These playlists have become a powerful medium for music discovery and monetization. A recent study by MusicWatch found that eight in 10 of those paying for a music subscription use it daily, and of those half listen to a playlist every time that they use the service to stream music. Scoring a spot on a popular playlist has launched several new artists careers. Stories like this indicate that some of these playlists can be as impactful as radio airplay. In fact, labels now have staff dedicated to pitching the playlist creators at these services, similar to how their radio promotions department lobby for drive-time rotation slots. What’s more, labels have even started creating their own playlists and uploading them onto these services themselves to introduce new acts. And it’s not just new music that benefits. Back catalog music that might otherwise be left gathering digital dust on the infinite storage warehouse of the Internet can suddenly enjoy a new lease on life in included in the right playlist at the right time. “Playlists are the PERFECT mechanism for breathing new life into your back catalog. Playlists give you the opportunity to feature your songs in new contexts, shaped by the songs that precede or follow.” CD Baby’s DIY Musician blog To understand why playlists are so powerful, consider the following · Playlists are “lean back.” Like the radio, you just turn it on and enjoy. · Playlists focused on moods/activities are not restricted to any specific genre or timeframe. A current electronic hit can fit in between a classic reggae track and an obscure R&B song if programmed properly. · Because listeners are not choosing the song to play, they’re more open to accepting new music that they may have never chosen to play on their own. As Apple Music mastermind Jimmy Iovine said when he launched the curation-heave Beats Music service (which Apple later acquired to form the heart of Apple Music): “The most important song after the one playing now is the one that comes next.” ‍ Become a Royalty Exchange Member Sign Up Get An Instant Catalog Analysis & Valuation Sign Up Interested In Royalty Investing?

      "content": "Evolution of Streaming Radio vs. Terrestrial Radio Home » News » Evolution of Streaming Radio vs. Terrestrial Radio I was in my friend’s car when I complimented him on the music he was listening to. He responded that we were actually listening to Pandora. I was quite fascinated with the idea of listening to streaming music using the stereo or navigation system while driving. He then told me that new car radios have Bluetooth capability that allows listeners to stream music using their phones. I found out later that new Ford owners would be able to listen to Spotify using the Ford Sync AppLink. Pandora and iHeartRadio also made deals with carmakers to add their apps to the dashboard and iTunes Radio is set to launch this coming Fall. Music consumption has been constantly changing and this technology is definitely altering how people experience music. An April 2013 Nielsen analysis found that five of today’s arguably must-have music streaming apps found double and triple-digit growth in unique users over the past year. When we start analyzing the pros and cons of streaming versus terrestrial five main points keep on resurfacing. It’s all about accessibility, programming, music exploration, cost and music purchase. Let’s look at these in detail. Accessibility We have a desire to have access to music wherever we go and providers are meeting that demand. Terrestrial is still strong during AM and PM drives but that might change when Streaming services embed their apps in cars. On the other side of the coin, Terrestrial radio stations allow their listeners to stream through their website. Although it comes at a premium, we have seen an increase in advertising through streaming radio services especially for our music clients. It’s an environment that has proven to be effective and continues to have high CTRs. Programming Jim Rome and The Dan Patrick sports talk shows continue to deliver high ratings. Who has not heard about Ryan Seacrest’s Top 40? Howard Stern has avid fans. His audience will follow wherever he goes and he continues to do very well on Sirius XM. A lot of radio listeners enjoy quality programming. As they say, the proof is in the pudding. Syndicators continue to vie for these personalities and for good reason. Just like when Jim Rome moved to CBS Sports Radio leaving a seven-year run on ESPN. In contrast, streaming services allow more customization and control of their listening experience. In addition, on demand content has become more prevalent due to the fast paced nature of our society. Music Exploration Terrestrial radio dates back to the 19th century and has been a preferred medium for music exploration up until a few years ago when music streaming services such as Pandora and Spotify took off. Now there is an abundance of streaming services available at our fingertips. The Music Genome Project by Pandora allows listeners to create a personalized music experience when the listener rates the music they listen to. It presents opportunities for people to discover similar artists and can easily click on the album cover to learn more and possibly purchase the music. Cost Streaming and Terrestrial are both free of charge. Consumers could pay for the subscription fee on some streaming services to eliminate ads and have uninterrupted music experiences but only a small portion of the audience actually pay for it. One thing that is apparent is that the majority of music listeners do not mind advertising enough to spend for a subscription. Music Purchase Some people who pay for streaming services may think of it as a substitute to buying singles and albums, which results in a decline of music sales. Although streaming may be hurting the music industry it enables potential consumers to purchase effortlessly with just one click. Terrestrial radio conversion to sale cannot be tracked but it still plays a huge role in pushing consumers to purchase based on station spins. As you can see there are advantages and disadvantages for each and both have an attractive audience for marketers. Our listening experience will continue to evolve and providers will continue to adapt to the needs and wants of consumers. Clients are allocating their budgets differently versus three to four years ago. The upside is that with new platforms and technology we now have a couple of ways to purchase inventory on these streaming sites without breaking the bank while we still provide cost efficient solutions to hit the terrestrial market.
