Contact Will Gill now to ensure a memorable event! Contact DJ Will Gill Definition of a Curated Playlist A curated playlist, therefore, features a chosen set of songs designed to create a certain mood or feel. While regular playlists often randomly collect songs, curated playlists tell a story or inspire emotions. Purpose of a Curated Playlist The purpose of a curated playlist is, ultimately, to offer a continuous and, consequently, flowing music experience for listeners. Moreover, these playlists accompany your activities, such as energizing workouts, romantic meals, or relaxing evenings. Additionally, playlists often aim to bring new tunes and beloved classics together for a pleasant listening time. How Curated Playlists Differ from Regular Playlists Regular playlists, in general, are often a personal collection of tracks that one might compile for themselves. In contrast, these can include any songs that the listener enjoys, without much thought given to the theme or flow. On the other hand, those who deeply understand music and what people like to hear design curated playlists. Furthermore, the selection process considers the theme, tempo, and mood of each song to ensure a cohesive listening experience. 1. Finding New Music: Curated playlists help you find new artists and songs. Curators often have access to a wide range of music and can handpick hidden gems that might not be on your radar. 2. Time-saving: With a curated playlist, you don’t have to spend hours searching for the perfect songs. They have done the hard work for you, allowing you to simply press play and enjoy. 3. Better Listening: A curated playlist lines up songs that go well together, improving your listening experience. 4. Access to Expertise: Curated playlists are made by people who understand how well songs match each other. This expertise can provide a richer and more satisfying musical journey. Examples of Popular Curated Playlists Many music streaming platforms, such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music, offer curated playlists. Some popular examples include: Spotify’s Discover Weekly: This playlist is updated every week with fresh music picks just for you. It looks at the songs you love and suggests new tunes that match your taste. By doing this, it helps you discover exciting new artists and tracks you might not find on your own. Apple Music’s Chill Mix: carefully designs this playlist with soothing tracks that fit your personal music preferences. It features calming melodies and gentle rhythms, perfect for helping you unwind and relax. They pick the songs to fit your taste, creating a calm atmosphere for when you need to relax, meditate, or have quiet time. Amazon’s Acoustic Chill: This playlist is filled with acoustic songs that create a peaceful and relaxed atmosphere. It includes gentle guitar tunes, soothing vocals, and calming melodies that are perfect for unwinding after a long day. How They Create Curated Playlists Creating a curated playlist involves a mix of art and science. Here’s how it’s typically done: 1. Understanding the Audience: The curator starts by figuring out what the audience wants in a playlist. This includes considering factors like age, lifestyle, and music preferences. 2. Choosing a Theme or Mood: A clear theme or mood is set to guide the selection of songs. This could be anything from “Summer Road Trip” to “Sunday Morning Relaxation.” 3. Selecting Songs: With the theme in mind, the curator selects songs that fit the mood. This often involves listening to hundreds of tracks to find the perfect ones that align with the playlist’s concept. 4. Arranging the Playlist: Songs are then arranged in a specific order to ensure a smooth flow. The order can affect the energy and pace of the playlist, so this step is crucial. 5. Testing and Refining: Finally, the playlist is tested to see how it feels as a whole. They make adjustments as necessary to enhance the listening experience. Who Typically Curates Playlists? Playlists can be curated by a variety of people, including: Music Streaming Services: Spotify and Apple Music hire experts to create playlists for different events and moods. These curators are experts in music who carefully select songs that fit a certain theme or atmosphere. Artists and Celebrities: Many artists take the time to put together playlists specifically for their fans. These playlists let fans see what music artists like, helping listeners connect with them more personally. Music Enthusiasts: Many people who are passionate about music love to create playlists that reflect their tastes and feelings. They often share these playlists on popular platforms like YouTube or SoundCloud. Enhancing the Listening Experience Curated playlists add value to the way we consume music. They help us discover new music and artists we might not find by ourselves. Moreover, the thoughtful arrangement of tracks provides an immersive experience that can transform ordinary moments into memorable ones. By learning about curated playlists and their impact on our music experience, we can enjoy their creativity more. If you want to find new music or just need music for your day, curated playlists give everyone something special and fun. Home \\ Resources \\ What is a Curated Playlist and Why It Matters?

Branding goes far beyond mere logos and slogans. Everything you do with regards to your business is a reflection of the brand you’re cultivating. From the color of your store’s walls to the aroma customers notice when they walk through the doors, everything about your business should be carefully chosen and monitored to appeal to your target audience. The same principles of branding that govern your paint choices and store layout should also apply to the music you play in your shop. An algorithmic playlist might seem convenient at first, but opting instead for a human curated playlist can save you headaches in the long run. What’s the Difference? An algorithmic playlist is one put together by a computer, using input about your favorite songs, artists and genres, as well as by gathering and using data on your listening habits. Examples of algorithmic playlists include Pandora and Spotify. The more input and data the user gives, the more tailored the playlist becomes. A human curated playlist is one put together by a person that’s based on your input on artists, genres and songs. In the world of digital music providers, algorithmic playlists are like commercial radio – you get what you get, with little to no input – whereas human curated playlists are similar to having your very own DJ spinning tunes that flow seamlessly from one song to the next to create a specific mood or theme. The Benefits of Human Curated Playlists Despite their popularity, algorithmic playlists have very little variation. The services that offer these playlists pull from a limited catalog of music and will often play the same songs every few hours. If you tell the playlist provider that you want a playlist based on a popular old school country music song, for example, you’ll probably end up with the same handful of songs that are easily identified by the software as fitting in that genre. Because providers recognize that this becomes monotonous, they’ll often take it upon themselves to try to spice things up, with or without your input. Algorithmic music providers will ask for your input about songs you like or dislike. If you choose to engage, you can change the entire tone of the playlist, often unintentionally. Even without engaging in the software, algorithmic providers will, at times, throw you a curve ball to break up the monotony. You may want an old school country music playlist, but every so often the algorithmic playlist will try to sneak in a new country hit to test the waters and see if you like it. If you don’t offer your input and tell the software that the song it chose was inappropriate, the playlist may take on a very different tone over time. Human curated playlists leave little room for chance. When you tell a playlist creation service that you’d like a playlist of adult alternative music that creates a mellow mood, the expert charged with creating your playlist will scour their catalog to find all the songs that fit your criteria and arrange them in a way that’s inoffensive to the ear. There’s no jarring genre changes, no sudden shift from tempo or speed and nothing that could strike listeners as odd or out of place. Human curated playlists also allow you to screen for content. For example, if you’d like to broadcast rock or hip hop throughout your store, a human curated playlist can screen out songs with lyrics that would shock those sensitive to profanity, violence, sexually suggestive subject matter and other elements inappropriate for a public setting. The Cost of Algorithmic Playlists Vs. Human Curated Playlists You might be tempted to go with an algorithmic playlist simply on the basis that it seems less costly than having a custom playlist put together by a human. A subscription to an algorithmic playlist provider can cost as little as $10 a month. The upfront cost of a human created tracklist is slightly higher, but there are a few compelling reasons why spending a little more for a carefully curated list of songs is worth it: Only a couple algorithmic playlist providers offer commercial licenses. When you play music in your store, you need the proper licenses to play that music in a business setting. You might need as many as three licenses for each song or you could face fines up to several thousand dollars per song. Most algorithmic playlist providers intend their services for personal use only. Using them in your store could land you in hot water at best and bankrupt you at worst. A human curated playlist created by a professional service means you’ll be secure in the knowledge that every song you play has the correct licensure for commercial use. For example, at Retail Radio we work with a catalog of songs on which we’ve already obtained the proper licenses. Each song we add to your list is cleared for use in your store, eliminating the chance of costly lawsuits and court battles over song choices. The value of a human curated playlist is greater. A deal is not really a good deal if you aren’t getting exactly what you want. Since algorithmic tracklists rely on a limited catalog of songs and sometimes insert unexpected music choices into your playlist, you aren’t ever guaranteed exactly the mood you want for your store. A human curated playlist gives you exactly the mood you want and the songs you want, with carefully selected choices that reflect the ambiance you’re trying to create. You’ll get exactly the list of songs you need for your store – a better deal than crossing your fingers and hoping the software for an algorithmic playlist gets it right. Algorithmic playlists don’t always accurately reflect your brand. Because of their tendency to go off the rails in terms of music selection, you could start with an adult alternative playlist and end up with a track featuring more punk rock than anything else. When you purchase human curated tracklisting, you’re opting for a quality service that accurately reflects your brand. When you purchase a classic rock playlist, you’ll receive a classic rock playlist. Branding is an industry worth untold millions of dollars every year. Spending a little more upfront on a human curated playlist to reflect your particular brand can save you money by not having to re-evaluate your music selection on a periodic basis. Why Choose a Human Curated Playlist? Human curated playlists offer clear benefits over algorithmic playlists. Not only does it offer you protection against costly and time-consuming lawsuits, it also takes the guesswork out of selecting the right music. When you choose a human curated list, you’ll get exactly the music you want without surprise tempo or genre changes, any suggestive content or explicit lyrics will be filtered out and your song rotation will be suitable for customers of all ages and sensibilities. Opting for a human curated playlist may cost a little more upfront than a subscription to a commercial algorithmic playlist, but it’s worth it to protect your brand, protect your public image and create exactly the impression you want.

Listeners are constantly in search of the perfect soundtrack for their day, whether it’s for a workout session or a relaxed evening at home. Platforms like Spotify have revolutionized how we discover and enjoy music, offering both Spotify curated playlists and Spotify algorithmic playlists. This development raises a pertinent question: are human-curated selections more resonant and enriching than those created through Spotify artificial intelligence? Understanding the nuances between these two methods of musical curation and their impact on the user experience is crucial in today’s digital music landscape. This article aims to explore the depths of curated playlists and algorithmic ones, delving into how each is constructed and the distinct advantages they offer. It will compare the personalized touch of curated playlists, often put together by music enthusiasts and experts who understand the emotional and cultural contexts behind a song selection, against the efficiency and vast data analysis capabilities of Spotify’s artificial intelligence. Additionally, we will examine the challenges unique to both curated and algorithmic playlists, ponder over the balance between human touch and technological precision, and speculate on the future of playlist curation. By providing a roadmap through the types of Spotify playlists, from those handpicked by individuals to the complexities of algorithmic predictions, readers will gain insight into the sophisticated world of digital music curation and how it shapes our musical environment. Understanding Algorithm Playlists How They Work Spotify’s algorithmic playlists are crafted through a sophisticated blend of collaborative filtering, natural language processing, and raw audio analysis. Collaborative filtering involves the algorithm analyzing user interactions with songs, using a matrix-like structure to compare user stats against Spotify’s vast track archive, which includes data such as saves-to-listener ratio, skip rate, share rate, and the number of times a song was repeated 12. Natural language processing models extend their reach by crawling the web to analyze texts, helping the algorithm understand public sentiment about songs or artists 12. Additionally, raw audio track analysis allows the algorithm to ‘listen’ to the music itself, considering elements like liveness, danceability, loudness, and energy to determine a song’s suitability for a playlist 12. Metadata analysis also plays a crucial role, where each song’s metadata, such as genre, artist, and release date, is analyzed to identify patterns and similarities between songs 13. These techniques are supported by machine learning models that continually learn from user behavior to improve the accuracy of music recommendations, ensuring that listeners are presented with songs that truly resonate with their tastes 13. How Spotify’s AI-Driven Recommendations Work | WSJ Tech Behind Popular Examples Spotify features several types of algorithmic playlists that cater to various listening preferences and behaviors. Key examples include Discover Weekly, Release Radar, Daily Mix, On Repeat, Repeat Rewind, and Spotify Radio 12. Each playlist serves a unique purpose: Discover Weekly: Updated every Monday, this playlist introduces new music to the listener, tailored to their past listening habits 7. Release Radar: A weekly update every Friday that includes new releases from artists the user follows or listens to 7. Daily Mix: A daily updated playlist that groups songs by genre or mood based on what the listener frequently plays 7. On Repeat and Repeat Rewind: These playlists feature songs that a user has been listening to repeatedly over the past 30 days or even further back, respectively 7. Spotify Radio: Generated instantly based on any song, artist, album, or playlist a user selects, creating a personalized radio station with similar tracks 7. These playlists are dynamically tailored to individual users, ensuring that each listener’s experience is unique and personally relevant. This personalization is achieved through continuous data analysis and real-time adaptation, where the algorithm adjusts recommendations based on ongoing user interactions and feedback 13. Understanding Curated Playlists Role of Human Curators Human curators play a pivotal role in the creation of Spotify curated playlists, bringing a personal touch that algorithms cannot replicate. These curators have a deep understanding of music genres, styles, and trends, which they use to craft playlists that cater to specific audiences or themes 16. For instance, playlists like RapCaviar not only showcase popular tracks but also influence music trends and can propel artists to mainstream success 1617. Sulinna Ong, Spotify’s Global Head of Editorial, emphasizes the importance of human-curated playlists in supporting artists and fostering music discovery, highlighting the platform’s commitment to a diverse and rich user experience 2217. Music Supervisors, another group of human curators, are instrumental in defining a brand’s sound identity. They select music that resonates with the brand’s ethos, creating auditory experiences in physical and digital spaces that enhance consumer engagement 23. These curators work with a vast catalog of songs, each defined by distinct traits, allowing them to tailor music selections that align with specific marketing initiatives or brand standards 23. Popular Examples Spotify offers a variety of human-curated playlists that cater to different moods and occasions. For example, the playlist ‘Handpicked Music‘ focuses on house and techno genres and is curated to feature emerging artists and new tracks, providing a platform for discovery and exposure 20. Similarly, the ‘Rap Caviar’ playlist is not only a collection of the latest rap hits but also a cultural marker that has influenced music consumption and trends significantly 21. Moreover, playlists like ‘Are & Be‘ are updated weekly to feature new releases and hits from R&B artists, ensuring that the content remains fresh and relevant 21. These curated playlists are essential for setting the right mood for various occasions, from dinner parties to workout sessions, demonstrating the curators’ ability to enhance the listening experience through careful selection and arrangement of tracks 21. In summary, human curators on Spotify utilize their expert knowledge and cultural insights to create playlists that are not only enjoyable but also culturally relevant and influential. Their ability to connect with listeners on an emotional level distinguishes these playlists from those generated by algorithms.

Advantages of Algorithm Playlists Personalization Spotify’s algorithmic playlists excel in delivering a personalized music experience, uniquely tailoring playlists to individual tastes and preferences. The sophisticated use of machine learning algorithms allows Spotify to create detailed profiles of users’ musical tastes, akin to a unique musical fingerprint 33. These profiles are continuously refined, ensuring that playlists like Discover Weekly and Release Radar not only introduce users to new music but also align closely with their established preferences 2633. Additionally, the dynamic nature of these playlists means they adapt over time, reflecting changes in listening habits and new music trends, thus keeping the user experience fresh and engaging 26. Scalability Algorithmic playlists also offer an unparalleled advantage in scalability. Through the integration of advanced technologies such as machine learning and generative AI, Spotify can efficiently manage vast amounts of data and user preferences, enabling personalized experiences for millions of users simultaneously 32. This scalability extends to features like Spotify’s AI DJ, which uses AI to create a seamless blend of music curation and storytelling, providing a highly personalized listening experience at scale 32. The ability of algorithmic playlists to update and evolve in real-time with user interactions further enhances their scalability, allowing Spotify to cater to an ever-growing global audience without compromising on the personal touch that makes the platform so appealing 2629. Advantages of Curated Playlists Human Touch Curated playlists, especially those managed by independent tastemakers or music content creators, retain a unique human element that algorithms struggle to replicate. These curators bring their personal touch to playlist creation, often showcasing their deep musical knowledge and passion for unearthing lesser-known tracks 42. This human touch extends to the playlists’ ability to tell a story or convey a mood, which enriches the listening experience by providing context and meaning behind each selected track 42. For instance, the curator Earfeeder uses his playlists to delve into genre histories, creating a richer, more educational experience for listeners 42. Additionally, the intentional creation of playlists for specific individuals or moments reflects a deep personal connection and understanding, further highlighting the human element in music curation 42. Cultural Relevance Human-curated playlists also play a significant role in shaping cultural trends and supporting musical artists. Playlists like RapCaviar have not only influenced music consumption but have also been instrumental in launching the careers of numerous artists 4037. Spotify’s commitment to human curation, as emphasized by Sulinna Ong, underscores the importance of these playlists in fostering music discovery and supporting diverse musical tastes 4037. Moreover, the role of curated playlists in reflecting and even shaping cultural trends is profound. They offer a platform that can elevate genres, artists, and movements, making them accessible to a broader audience and ensuring that diverse voices and styles get the recognition they deserve 40. These advantages underscore the value of human curation in music playlists, which not only enhances the listening experience but also supports artists and influences music and cultural trends significantly. Challenges with Algorithm Playlists Potential Drawbacks Algorithmic playlists, while innovative, face criticism for their tendency to promote popular and mainstream music, often at the expense of diversity. This prioritization can hinder lesser-known or niche artists from gaining the exposure they need to reach a wider audience 44. Additionally, these algorithms may contribute to a homogenization of musical tastes by continuously suggesting similar songs, creating an echo chamber effect where listeners are less likely to encounter music outside their usual preferences 44. Inherent biases in these algorithms, including racial, cultural, and gender biases, might also lead to unequal opportunities and exposure for certain genres and demographics 44. Addressing these issues requires concerted efforts from streaming platforms, artists, and industry stakeholders to ensure a balance between personalized recommendations and fostering diversity 44. Moreover, algorithmic playlists are criticized for their limitations in adapting to the changing needs of brands and listeners. They often result in predictable outcomes and can lead to repetitive listening experiences similar to commercial radio 43. To combat this, intervention is sometimes necessary to refresh content and prevent the playlist from becoming stagnant, which contradicts the idea of a fully automated music experience 43. Listener Fatigue Listener fatigue is another significant challenge associated with algorithmic playlists. This phenomenon can occur due to various factors, including the psychological impact of listening to music and the physical aspects of sound quality 47. Factors such as loudness, audio compression, and the overall sound quality play crucial roles in how long a listener can comfortably engage with music 47. Compression of music, for instance, can exacerbate listening fatigue as it often involves losing details in the sound that, while not always consciously perceivable, affect the listening experience 47. Furthermore, the type of headphones used, the presence of background noises, and even the listener’s mood can contribute to fatigue 47. High sound levels are directly correlated with shorter periods before fatigue sets in, suggesting that even with high-quality audio, the volume at which music is played is a critical factor 47. Therefore, providing options for lower sound levels and ensuring high-quality audio playback are essential for mitigating listener fatigue and enhancing the overall listening experience 47. These challenges underscore the need for continuous improvement in algorithm design and the importance of maintaining a human element in music curation to ensure a rich and diverse listening experience. Challenges with Curated Playlists Subjective Bias One of the significant challenges with curated playlists is the potential for subjective bias. Human curators, despite their expertise and deep knowledge of music, may unconsciously infuse their personal preferences, cultural backgrounds, and experiences into the playlists they create. This can lead to a lack of diversity in music selection, where certain genres or artists are favored over others. The influence of a curator’s personal taste can also skew the representation of music, which might not accurately reflect the broader audience’s preferences or the diversity within a genre 59. Additionally, the perception and valuation of music can be significantly affected by the status or reputation of the performer, as indicated by studies showing differential brain activity when listeners are aware of the performer’s professional status 53. This bias not only impacts the listener’s experience but also the exposure given to emerging or lesser-known artists. Scalability Issues Scalability presents another challenge for curated playlists. Unlike algorithmic systems, which can handle vast amounts of data and adapt to user preferences on a large scale, human curation does not easily scale. The manual effort required to curate playlists that cater to diverse tastes and maintain freshness over time is substantial. As music catalogs and listener bases grow, the task of manually curating playlists becomes increasingly unmanageable without significant resources 56. Moreover, the economic aspect cannot be overlooked. The cost associated with employing skilled curators who can maintain the quality and relevance of playlists across a wide range of music styles and cultural contexts is considerably higher than using automated systems. This economic challenge is particularly pronounced in environments like radio stations or live DJ settings, where the cost of human labor does not always align with budget constraints, leading to a preference for more cost-effective automated solutions 60. In summary, while curated playlists offer a human touch that is highly valued, they face significant challenges in terms of subjective bias and scalability. These issues highlight the need for a balanced approach that leverages both human expertise and technological advancements to deliver a diverse and engaging music listening experience.

Balancing Algorithm and Curated Playlists Combining Both Approaches The integration of human expertise with automated recommender systems presents a promising approach to enhancing user engagement and content relevance. Studies have shown that while algorithms can efficiently handle large datasets and perform well under general conditions, they are significantly enhanced when combined with human insight, particularly in complex decision-making scenarios 61. For instance, in contexts where personalized data is scarce, human curators can provide the necessary intuition and understanding that algorithms lack, potentially increasing user engagement by up to 13% 61. Moreover, the synergy between human curators and AI technology can lead to mutual benefits. Human curators can ensure the accuracy, credibility, and ethical standards of content, which is especially crucial in maintaining user trust and compliance with legal standards 62. On the other hand, AI can assist human curators by analyzing vast amounts of data and providing insights that might not be immediately obvious, thus enhancing the depth and breadth of content curation 62. Case Studies Exploring specific instances of the combined approach offers valuable insights into its practical applications and benefits. For example, Spotify employs a Reinforced Learning with Human Feedback model, where the AI learns from user interactions to refine its recommendations continually. This model allows Spotify to adapt its recommendations based on real-time feedback, ensuring that the playlists remain relevant and engaging 66. Another case study involves Spotify’s new mobile interface, which integrates a vertical scroll similar to social media platforms, allowing users to discover new music and podcasts more intuitively. This feature represents a strategic blend of AI-driven recommendations and user interface design, enhancing discovery while maintaining a focus on user experience 66. These case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining human curation with algorithmic recommendations, highlighting the potential for enhanced personalization and user engagement in digital platforms. By leveraging both human insights and technological capabilities, platforms can create a more dynamic and responsive user experience that adapts to individual preferences and evolving content landscapes 66. Future of Playlist Curation Trends The music industry is witnessing a significant shift towards automation in playlist curation, with streaming services like Spotify leading the change. This move reflects broader trends in music consumption and technology, where automation is seen as an opportunity to democratize music discovery 7371. As technology continues to advance, streaming services are becoming more popular, potentially changing how artists release music, focusing more on singles and shorter EPs 74. This evolution in music delivery and consumption suggests that the balance between human curation and algorithmic recommendation will increasingly shape how we listen to and discover new music 7371. Additionally, the rise of micro-genres within playlists is a notable trend. As listeners’ tastes become more niche, playlists are evolving to cater specifically to these unique preferences, indicating a shift towards more personalized and targeted music experiences 70. Technological Advances Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing a crucial role in the transformation of playlist curation. AI’s capabilities in music composition, performance, and marketing are expanding, and its use in creating new music and analyzing listener data to personalize music recommendations is becoming more prevalent 74. AI-generated music is gaining popularity and could soon enter the mainstream, further altering the music landscape 74. Moreover, the integration of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) is enhancing how listeners experience music. These technologies could revolutionize live music experiences, with virtual concerts becoming more common, potentially creating new revenue streams for artists 74. In terms of content curation, AI tools are refining their ability to sift through vast amounts of data to deliver relevant content efficiently. The ongoing development of machine learning and natural language processing is making the curation process more efficient, yet it remains essential to maintain human oversight to ensure a balanced approach that combines the speed and scale of AI with human judgment and understanding 78. Furthermore, the traditional roles of creators are undergoing a transformation as AI becomes an increasingly adept creator in its own right. This shift might lead to new paradigms in intellectual property and artistic expression, emphasizing the art of selection and presentation over creation 76. Curators who can skillfully navigate the vast seas of AI-generated content to present coherent, engaging, and insightful collections will be highly valued 76. The future of playlist curation is poised to be an exciting blend of technological innovation and human creativity, shaping how we experience and interact with music in profound ways 7678.

These playlists are curated by professionals who select songs based on their quality, popularity, and relevance to the current trends.Definition of Editorial Playlists​Editorial playlists are curated collections of songs that are created and managed by professional curators. The curators select songs based on various criteria such as genre, mood, tempo, artist reputation, and audience appeal. These playlists are available on streaming services likeSpotifyorApple Music.The Importance of Editorial Playlists in the Music IndustryThe music industry is constantly evolving due to technological advances in streaming services like Spotify or Apple Music. In this new era of streaming services, editorial playlists have become one of the most critical factors for artists' success. One reason for this is that playlist placements can increase exposure for artists significantly.When a song is added to an editorial playlist with thousands or even millions of followers, it has the potential to reach a vast audience quickly. This exposure can help artists build momentum and gain new fans at a much faster rate than through traditional marketing efforts.Another reason why editorial playlists are essential is because they offer an opportunity for curators to promote new talent effectively. Curators have been seen as tastemakers in the industry; thus placement on these lists implies trust - listeners feel comfortable trying out something recommended by someone they trust over something uncertain which increases chances of being heard by potential fans who might’ve never given them a chance before.Furthermore, inclusion on populareditorial playlistscan lead to viral success overnight since if a song makes it to the top of many playlists, it is highly likely to be shared across social media platforms and might become an overnight sensation. This can bring unprecedented opportunities for artists who may otherwise have struggled to gain attention in a crowded market.Editorial playlists also generate income for labels and streaming services. Playlist placements are increasingly being used as a metric for measuring success in the industry, with streaming numbers becoming an essential factor in determining how much revenue an artist earns from their music.The more streams that a song or album receives, the more money the artist will make. Editorial playlists are crucial for artists' success in today's music industry.They offer exposure, promotion of new talent and can lead to significant viral success while providing crucial revenue streams for artists, labels and streaming services alike. Whether you're a fan or an artist - keep an eye on these playlists as they may be just what you need to succeed!​Editorial playlists are crucial for artists' success in today's music industry2. Benefits of Editorial PlaylistsIncreased Exposure for Artists​Editorial playlistsare a crucial tool for emerging artists seeking to gain exposure and increase their fan base. With more than 70 million songs available on platforms such as Spotify, it can be challenging for new artists to get noticed, and that's where editorial playlists come in. These carefully curated playlists offer a platform for new artists to showcase their music to a wider audience.The power of curators in promoting new artistsThe power of playlist curators should not be underestimated. They have an enormous influence on the music industry, as they are the ones who decide which songs get placed on popular playlists. By featuring an artist's song on a playlist with hundreds of thousands or even millions of followers, curators can help launch an artist's career and introduce them to fans who may have never heard their music before.The potential for viral success through playlist placementOne of the most significant benefits of being featured on an editorial playlist is the potential for viral success. When a song is placed in front of a huge audience, it can quickly gain traction and catch fire across social media platforms. This kind of exposure can launch an artist's career overnight and bring them fame beyond their wildest dreams.Increased Revenue for Labels and Streaming ServicesEditorial playlists don't just benefit artists; they also generate increased revenue for labels and streaming services. By featuring popular songs on curated playlists, streaming services like Spotify can attract more users to their platform and increase ad revenue or subscriptions.The impact of playlist placement on streaming numbersPlaylist placement has a significant impact on an artist's streaming numbers. The most popular editorial playlists have millions of followers who listen to them regularly, so when an artist's song is added to one of these lists, it can result in a significant increase in streams. This increase can lead to higher payouts for artists and labels, making playlist placement an essential part of the modern music industry.Editorial playlists offer numerous benefits for both artists and streaming services. They provide a platform for emerging artists to gain exposure and potentially go viral, while also generating increased revenue for labels and streaming platforms.The power of curators to promote new music should not be underestimated, as they play a crucial role in introducing listeners to new artists and shaping the direction of the music industry. By recognizing the importance of editorial playlists, we can support emerging artists while also enjoying great new music on our favorite streaming platforms.The Art of Playlist CurationPlaylist curators are the unsung heroes of the music industry. They are responsible for creating playlists that listeners will love and share with their friends.A great playlist can take a listener on a journey through different moods, genres, and tempos. Curators must have a deep understanding of the listener's needs and preferences to create a playlist that will resonate with them.Understanding the Listener's Needs and PreferencesThe first step in creating a successful playlist is understanding what your audience wants to hear. This involves analyzing data on what songs are popular among certain demographics and what types of songs are being added to playlists. Curators can use this data to create playlists that cater to specific audiences.How Curators Consider Mood, Genre, Tempo, and Other Factors When Creating a PlaylistA great playlist should take listeners on an emotional journey, from upbeat dance tracks to slow ballads. Curators must consider the mood they want the playlist to convey and choose songs accordingly. They also need to think about genre and tempo when selecting tracks for the list.How Data Analysis Informs Curation DecisionsData analysis plays an important role in editorial curation decisions. By analyzing which tracks are being added most frequently by users or how many times certain songs are streamed within different periods of time, curators can stay ahead of trends and keep their playlists fresh.Building a Brand Through Playlist CurationPlaylists have become an essential part of branding for streaming services such as Spotify or Apple Music. As such, curating high-quality playlists can help establish credibility as well as build brand loyalty among users who enjoy discovering new music through these services.The Role of Branding in Creating a Successful Playlist SeriesA successful playlist series needs more than just great curation. It also requires a strong brand identity that resonates with listeners. Curators must consider the messaging and tone of the playlist series, as well as how it fits into the larger branding strategy of the streaming service.The Importance of Consistent Quality and StyleOne of the biggest challenges for playlist series is maintaining consistent quality and style. A playlist series that lacks cohesion can turn listeners off, causing them to abandon the service altogether.Curators must strive to maintain a high level of quality in both song selection and overall presentation to keep users engaged. Playlist curation is an art form that requires skill, creativity, and data analysis.Curators must understand their audience's needs and preferences while also considering mood, genre, tempo, branding strategy, consistency of style and quality when creating playlists. By doing so, they can create playlists that not only resonate with listeners but also help build strong brands for streaming services.Checkout these other great articles:How To Get On Spotify Editorial Playlistsand ​​​​How To Pitch To Spotify Editorial Playlists3. The Future of Editorial PlaylistsAre Curators Becoming Obsolete?The world of music is ever-evolving, and the same can be said about editorial playlists. While these playlists have been an essential part of the music industry, we cannot ignore the impact technology is having on them.The rise of AI and machine learning has brought up the question - are curators becoming obsolete? AI-powered playlists are becoming increasingly popular due to their personalized nature.Listeners can get a selection tailored to their preferences without needing a human curator's input. However, these algorithms lack the ability to discover new talent and do not provide a sense of character or personality often found in human-curated playlists.Despite this, I believe that curation will never become obsolete in music streaming services. There will always be a need for humans to create context and emotions behind music curation that algorithms cannot replicate.​The Role of AI in Playlist Curation​AI has revolutionized many industries worldwide, including music streaming services. One way it does this is by creating personalized playlists based on user data analysis such as listening habits and preferences. While AI-generated playlists offer personalization, they don't provide user discovery opportunities for smaller artists who may not have gained popularity yet or do not fit within traditional genre labels.However, AI can help curators with discovering new talent by identifying patterns in listener behavior that indicate emerging artists' potential success. In short, AI can be used as an assistant for human curators rather than a replacement.4. The Challenges Facing Editorial PlaylistsUser-Generated vs Editorial Playlists: Who Wins?​User-generated playlists pose a significant threat to editorial ones because they generate from listener engagement rather than curation experience. In essence, users may create better-targeted lists because they have unique insights into what resonates with them.However, user-generated playlists lack the cohesive structure that an editorial one can offer, making them less engaging for a longer listening session. Additionally, the quality of user-generated playlists varies widely, and there is no guarantee of consistency or accuracy.Editorial playlists have their strengths in offering consistent quality and style with a dedicated curator knowledgeable about music trends and new talent discovery. User-generated content may be more relevant to personal tastes but cannot provide this dependable level of quality.Payola Scandals - Can Editorial Playlists Be Trusted?The music industry has been plagued by pay-for-play practices where record labels pay curators for playlist placement. This unethical practice goes against the idea of editorial playlists - where songs are selected based on their artistic value rather than their monetary value.While streaming services have tried to address this issue by implementing more rigorous standards for playlist promotion, it is hard to gauge how effective these measures are. The credibility of editorial playlists has taken a hit due to these scandals.​However, I still believe that editors can be trusted if they maintain transparency and integrity when selecting songs. Curators must prioritize artistic merit over financial gain to preserve editorial playlist credibility.5. ConclusionEditorial playlistscontinue to hold significant importance in music streaming services. However, with technology advancements such as machine learning and AI-powered personalized lists, we need not dismiss human curation's significance just yet.​There are challenges facing editorial playlists such as the rise of user-generated ones and pay-for-play practices affecting their credibility. But through transparency and prioritizing artistry over financial gain, curators can continue providing unique experiences that algorithms alone cannot replicate.Conclusion Editorial playlists are an essential aspect of the modern music industry.They offer a unique platform for artists to gain exposure and connect with new fans while providing streaming services with a reliable source of revenue. The power of curators in determining which songs and artists get featured on these playlists cannot be understated, and it is crucial that they continue to prioritize quality curation over commercial interests.It is inspiring to see how playlist curation has become an art form in itself, with curators using data analysis and their own personal taste to create seamless listening experiences for millions of people worldwide. However, the rise of user-generated playlists presents a challenge, as it puts even more pressure on editorial playlists to stand out from the crowd and stay relevant.Despite the challenges facing editorial playlists, I am optimistic about their future. Technology continues to advance rapidly, opening up new possibilities for curation and discovery.And while payola scandals have shaken public trust in some aspects of the music industry, I believe that there will always be a demand for authentic voices who can help listeners navigate the endless sea of music available online. As consumers increasingly turn to streaming services as their primary source of music consumption, editorial playlists will continue to play a central role in shaping musical tastes and introducing new talent.With careful curation and an unwavering commitment to quality, they have the potential not only to drive revenue but also to create lasting cultural impact. So let us celebrate these unsung heroes of the music industry – may they continue inspiring us all through their expertly crafted sonic journeys!Related ArticlesSubmit To PlaylistsOn SaleOn SaleSad loFi - LoFi Spotify Playlist Submission (No Vocals)$10.00$5.00This is for 1xSpotify Playlist SubmissionSubmit your Sad LoFi/Chillhop beat to be considered for this playlist.

      "content": "The Power of Curated Playlists and Organic Playlist Promotion Feb 24, 2025 By Sarah Jamieson Have you been searching for ways to give your songs the push they deserve? Organic playlist promotion could be the catalyst that you need. We'll dive into what playlisting is, explore the benefits of curated playlists, consider potential drawbacks to organic playlist promotion, and discover how artists, agencies, and labels can leverage this tool to enhance their strategies. And finally, we'll show strategies to help you along your playlist promotion journey. Navigating Spotify’s Playlist Ecosystem Before you invest in playlist promotion, it's important to understand the difference between Spotify playlists and how they can move through its ecosystem. Algorithmic Playlists Spotify's smart algorithms take a deep dive into how users interact with music and what makes each tune tick. They use this intel to populate playlists like Release Radar and Discover Weekly. The key to a track's cameo in these playlists? It's all about how it's performing and how well it fits the listener's vibe. Personalized Streams are custom-made for you, considering your unique taste profile and a bunch of cues, like the time of day, favourite genres, and even what other like-minded fans are grooving to. They're so influential that they're responsible for about a third of all new artist discoveries on Spotify. Playlists that fall under this category include Discover Weekly, Release Radar, and Blend. Each playlist is tailored to individual tastes. That means if your friend listens to the same playlists, they’ll probably have a different mix of songs than you. Editorial Playlists These curated gems are like the secret sauce of Spotify, crafted with care by the platform's music experts. Getting your music featured on these playlists isn't just about visibility—it's like getting a front-row seat to skyrocket your plays and reach more ears. A global team of avid music editors from Spotify, armed with finely-tuned ears, data insights, and a deep passion for music, work to bring new tracks to the spotlight. They’re the maestros behind playlists such as Rap Caviar, Fuego, and Planet Rave. These cater to a diverse range of genres, vibes, and moments to ensure your music finds its place among new and loyal fans. Editorial Playlists are your ticket to a broader audience, a chance to make your mark in the music world. By leveraging the expertise and dedication of Spotify's editors, your music gets the exposure it deserves, resonating with listeners in various contexts. And then there's Made By You, which involves everyday listeners saving your song to their library or personal mixes. These streams are the real deal – they're driven by active, music-loving fans who aren't just sitting around waiting for the next big thing. These folks are hands-on, hunting down tracks they love and saving them to their collections and playlists, whether through searching, from an artist's profile, or by diving into other users' playlists. Most active streams on Spotify come from this hyper-engaged crowd. That's some serious love for music! Understanding Playlist Promotion Now that we know the different types of playlists, let's get down to the main question: How does it work? Playlist promotion involves placement on playlists across popular streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Deezer. These are user-generated and cater to certain genres, moods, or themes. Why does that matter? The right playlist placement expands your music's visibility, attracting new listeners and strengthening your fanbase. Take Royel Otis' track \"Sofa King.\" When it hit 15K daily streams, there was a chance to take things up a notch with a Spotify playlist promotion. We pitched the song to playlists that fit the mode and the genre. The track got the attention it deserved because it was in the perfect place and people connected with it. As the weeks passed, the song's streams continued to scale until its daily streams soared past 100K. This was thanks to the strategic playlisting strategy. The Benefits of Strategic Playlist Promotion Many companies offer playlisting services, but they add music to any playlist they can. This hurts your song because it doesn’t get it in front of the right audience. These services may seem like a good deal initially, but they hurt your music in the long run. Tailored playlist promotion, however, can make a huge difference in getting your music noticed because it’s on a well-curated playlist that reaches audiences who are already into your type of music. There’s no point in being on a playlist if your audience isn’t there, right? Personalized playlist strategies give you heightened exposure that leads to increased streams, monthly listeners, and a steady climb in overall engagement with your music. It can also help build your credibility as an artist and raise your prospects of being discovered by industry professionals. This first step could snowball your career into many different paths, such as more concert bookings, new collaboration opportunities, or climbing the radio charts. For example, when we joined forces with lovelytheband, their song \"sail away\" was pulling in around 25K daily streams. The band wanted consistent growth to grab the attention of radio stations. We used the power of our playlisting service as a cost-effective way to make this happen. By meticulously selecting placements and timing our moves strategically, we gave the song an extra push. Before we knew it, \"sail away\" climbed to #3 on the alternative radio charts. In other words, a well-executed playlisting campaign will: Can Smaller Artists Make it on Bigger Playlists? Definitely! Independent playlist curators have their eyes on the pulse of culture and music trends, always on the lookout for the next big thing. That's why they pay special attention to emerging artists – they're like the heartbeat of the future of music consumption. Editors have a keen focus on understanding audiences above all else. While they're all about promoting great music, they also know the importance of catering to the unique tastes of listeners. It's all about getting the right music in front of the right people. Interestingly, many music fans stumble upon older tunes – songs from the past – as if they're brand-new discoveries (just look at all the Abba renaissances there have been in the last decade). So don’t count out the vintage options either. It's all part of the magic of music discovery and the evolving landscape of playlists. Smaller artists have a meaningful place in the playlist ecosystem, offering fresh sounds and exciting possibilities for music enthusiasts everywhere. Embracing the balance between new hits and timeless classics, playlists become a treasure trove of musical experiences waiting to be uncovered. It’s not Just about Location or Genre It's more than just where you're from or what type of music you make. When it comes to curating playlists, it's all about capturing the mood and vibe of the music. Before Spotify, listeners would pop on an album and listen to it, or maybe a mix they’d made themselves. But now, listeners are more likely to search for music based on mood rather than an artist name. That’s why it’s so important to know where your song belongs. You don’t want to box yourself into one category – diversity and strategy help to showcase a track on different playlists, maximizing its reach to potential audiences. When Dom Corleo reached out to us about their track 'Wake Up,' it was already making waves with around 20K daily streams. Their goal? Strategic playlisting that truly resonated. We handpicked playlists that matched the song’s essence and connected with its audience. Thanks to this approach, the song saw remarkable growth week after week in algorithmic streams, soaring past the 100K daily stream mark. Our thoughtful strategy not only boosted the song’s streaming figures but also paved the way for an even brighter future. Drawbacks to Consider While it offers numerous benefits, it's important to be aware of potential drawbacks to playlist engagement tactics. Securing placements on sought-after playlists, especially for emerging artists, can be competitive. Other cons include: Relying solely on playlist promotion may also limit your overall marketing strategy, which is why we recommend you diversify promotional efforts through TikTok promotion or Facebook and Instagram ads to help with long-term growth. Strategies for Artists, Agencies, and Labels Niche playlists that resonate with your music style and target audience are a great place to start. Engage with playlist curators, submit your music for consideration, and actively promote your playlist placements to maximize their impact. But if you’re too busy making music or it seems like too much, let us do it for you (with even better results). Take, for example, Billie Eilish's track 'Skinny.' Our playlisting campaign ensured her music reached as many people as possible while keeping them engaged. Over 25 days, 'Skinny' had a prime spot on high-visibility playlists, giving it the boost it needed to rack up 620,000 streams from our playlisting campaign alone. This shows how powerful niche playlist services can be in getting people to listen and extending a track's reach far and wide, no matter where an artist is at in their career. Even bigger artists can benefit from this strategy to support a song’s growth. Members Media and Playlisting Services When it comes to high streaming volumes and connecting with the right listeners, music playlist campaigns are the way to go. Spotify playlist promotion campaigns work wonders in driving traffic to your song and can help you unlock exciting opportunities such as Discovery Mode, Marquee, and Showcase. The best part? Running a playlisting campaign to garner tens of thousands of streams can be quite economical. This makes it a cost-effective choice compared to other campaign types aiming for similar stream volumes. But What About Fake Streams or Bots? Concerns about bots tampering with the authenticity of playlist growth services are valid. Unfortunately, the playlisting industry has its fair share of companies resorting to a fake playlist push. They often use bots, putting genuine musicians at risk of getting their music removed. There are a few ways to spot these scams. We started with a need for 100% organic solutions and have a strict no-bot policy, so you’ll experience only genuine engagement. Authenticity is important and we continue to have zero tolerance for misleading practices. We operate within Spotify’s guidelines by finding the best places for your music, instead of some companies who violate guidelines and place your song wherever they can (even if it doesn’t fit the vibe of your song). Get Started Unlike 25 years ago, when the music scene felt exclusive and you needed thousands of dollars to be heard, playlisting now levels the playing field. Whether you're producing tracks in your bedroom or have signed with a major label, playlists open doors for all musicians to share their music with the world. This is an exhilarating time for aspiring artists, where the music landscape is brimming with opportunities to showcase your talent. When artists want to expand their reach, Spotify playlisting promotion is often on their radar first because it’s relatively inexpensive and leads to tons of streams and listeners. We have a wide range of tools and networks to amplify your streams, engage with fresh audiences, and bolster your brand presence in the competitive music industry. You can promote your music while backed by a team committed to finding the curated playlists that best fit your style. If you're keen to explore our playlisting services or have any music-related inquiries, feel free to reach out to us to see how we can help you realize your music goals. Whether you're an emerging artist aiming to expand your fanbase or a label seeking heightened exposure, we can help you reach your musical ambitions.

      "content": "We use cookies Playlists or Traditional Marketing, What’s Best for You Feb 11, 2025 t’s no news that you can rake in massive streams, just by landing a spot on the right playlist. You’ve also seen artists running Instagram ads, teaming up with influencers, or even getting radio play. And that makes you wonder, which of these options is a more effective marketing strategy? Should you go all-in on playlists or double down on traditional marketing? In this article, we want to break it down for you, letting you know: How each of them works, and the benefits it offers you Then you can decide which option will give you the desired result for your next release. Shall we? First, let’s start with Playlist This is the dream of every passionate artist, because the benefits are incomparable. Why do playlists work? Let’s unpack it, one after the other. ✅Massive Exposure to the Right Listeners. This is because playlist listeners are already in “music discovery mode”. That’s a world of difference from social media ads, where you have to fight for attention. If you land on a curated playlist (like Spotify’s Fresh Finds), your song is in front of the exact audience looking for fresh tracks. ✅Boost Your Streams & Make the Algorithm Love You. The more people engage with your song, the better your chances of getting picked up by Spotify’s algorithmic playlists (Discover Weekly, Release Radar). This inevitably leads to even more organic growth. ✅ Zero Upfront. Getting on a playlist (especially organic, user-generated ones) won’t cost you a dime. Unlike ads, there’s no budget required. But what are the downsides of Playlists? Okay, you know pros come with cons. So, here are some that come with playlists: ❌No Guarantees. You see, just because you’re on a playlist doesn’t mean listeners will save your song or follow you. Some might even skip it entirely. ❌Short-lived success. Playlist placements aren’t forever. If engagement drops, your song can get removed, and so will the streams. ❌No Control. You don’t decide where your song is placed, how long it stays, or if it even gets noticed. It’s a bit of a gamble. Now the question on your mind (especially if you’ve been following our previous articles) is, does this mean the playlists aren’t worth the hype? No, this isn't the point. Playlists can do all the great things we’ve talked about. But there’s a difference between instant and momentary boost, and a presence that lasts. But before we go deeper into that, let’s talk about the other strategy: Traditional Marketing - the long game that builds your brand and keeps the fans asking for more from you. How does that work, you may ask. Let’s dig right into the fun stuff: ✅ Real Fan Connection. When people hear your song and like it, they get curious about the person behind it. This is where the engagement comes in. And those social media ads, influencer collabs, and radio play and exposure through interviews are what let you connect directly with potential fans. ✅ Brand Building That Lasts. This almost naturally follows the first benefit (fan connection). Ever wonder how artists like Russ and Chance the Rapper built such die-hard fanbases? It wasn’t just playlist luck. It was consistent marketing, storytelling, and branding. ✅ Targeted Growth. With social media ads, you can target exactly who hears your music. Want to reach indie-rock fans in LA? R&B lovers in London? No problem. The Challenges? ❌ Takes Money & Effort – Unlike playlist placements, social media ads and influencer campaigns require an upfront investment. If done wrong, they can drain your budget fast. ❌ Slower Stream Growth – Traditional marketing isn’t an overnight numbers boost. It’s about long-term fan-building rather than instant streams. ❌ Crowded Space – Every artist is pushing their music on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. Cutting through the noise takes a strong strategy. So What’s the Winning Formula? Simple answer: USE BOTH. Instead of choosing one over the other, smart artists combine playlists with traditional marketing for maximum impact. By smart artists, we mean those who aren’t just looking for one hit song with massive streams, but seeking ways to be around for long. So, how do you combine them? Let’s walk you through it 🎵 Let Playlists Spark Interest, Then Convert Listeners Into Fans – Land on a playlist? Follow it up with an Instagram ad or influencer shoutout to get those listeners following your page, saving your songs, and diving into your catalog. 🎵 Use Marketing to Get Streams While Growing Your Brand – Ads and influencer campaigns should drive people to your streaming profiles, not just your social pages. More engagement means a higher chance of landing on even more playlists. 🎵 Create a Growth Loop – The more listeners you gain through marketing, the better your odds of playlist placements. The more playlist traction you get, the stronger your paid promotions perform. So what are we saying in essence? Choosing just one, is limiting. Instead, balance both for success Playlists are great for exposure, but real career growth comes from building relationships with your audience. Get on playlists to put your music in front of new listeners, then use marketing to turn those listeners into true fans. Ready to level up your music promotion? Start submitting your tracks for playlist consideration while building a strong marketing strategy. Need help? We’ve got you covered. Let’s get your music heard by the right people today!

      "content": "Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Home Library Stories Stats Jae Hyun Follow -- 1 Listen Share How important is Spotify Playlist to you? How do you listen to music? A lot of people will respond, “Oh, I just click on one of the playlists based on my mood.” Yes, we all enjoy Spotify playlists. Some are self-created, others made by music nerd friends, or carefully curated by machines but I enjoy them all. Opening Spotify on my phone gives me more joy than most other applications, a kind of feeling that is very different from using Netflix, HBO, or Instagram. For me, that feeling is this excitement of listening to a long-time favorite tune, this expectation that I can find new artists or songs and instantly fall in love with, and this weird sense of accomplishment when saving that new track and knowing that I will be bombarded with other songs that are similar and that I’m expected to like, or at least according to Spotify’s freakishly accurate algorithm. As you probably figured, I’m a huge fan of Spotify and I wanted to dig into the reasons why I loved it so much. And the main reason for me was its Playlists — it was this distinguished capability that made Spotify stand out from others. In this post, I will describe Spotify playlists in more details— what they are, how they came to be on your home page, who creates them, and why they’re valuable to listeners, artists, and to Spotify. 1. What is a playlist? A music playlist is an assortment of songs and it’s always been around Spotify since its first launch in 2008. Users added their own favorite tunes into playlists and Spotify wasn’t yet involved in the business of curating one. Things changed in 2013 when Spotify, with the acquisitions of music discovery companies like Tunigo, started to generate playlists of its own to the users. Since then, playlists have become a competitive edge to the company, attracting new users and fending off competitors like Apple Music. Spotify classifies their playlists into the following 3 categories - (1) Personalized playlists are those generated by Spotify’s algorithm based on its understanding of your musical taste. Examples include Discover Weekly, Release Radar, and Daily Mix. They are personalized in that only you and no other users have that playlist of songs. Curious on how Spotify knows you that well? An awesome article on it here. (2) Curated playlists are produced by Spotify’s editorial teams (yes, human beings). They each have particular themes, whether it be genres, artists, musical era, mood, etc. Think RapCaviar or ¡Viva Latino!, which are two of the most popular playlists on Spotify. Now, not all curated playlists require a human touch — Peaceful Piano or USA Viral 50 chart probably don’t involve someone to pick and choose individual tracks to be added. The difference from personalized playlists is that curated playlists will appear in the exact same form and shape to you, to me, and every other listener out there. (3) User-generated playlists (UGC) refer to any playlists that are not published by Spotify or its algorithm, its employees, or its CEO Daniel Ek. That includes public playlists shared by artists, external curators, famous people in the music world, and everyday users like you and I. Top 100 Brasil playlist, boasting 223k followers by Hugo Gloss (he fits the famous people in music world description although I don’t know why) and Country Hits with 876k followers by Digster (account owned by Universal Music Group label) are some examples. Of the three, UGC playlists have the most share of the listeners’ time, at 36% of monthly content hours. Personalized playlists is at 17% and curated playlists are at 15% of monthly content hours. Considering the sheer number of user-generated playlists, this metric may not be telling much but certainly demonstrates how much we rely on playlists. 2. How do playlists end up on my home screen? You may be wondering then through what mechanism Spotify recommends these playlists to you. According to Spotify’s statement to the SEC submitted for its IPO, the company leverages user data such as demographics, past listening behavior, and situational factors like the time of day, geographic location, etc. Our musical preference is measured against 40+ different parameters which all serve as inputs to Spotify’s engine. At the time of writing this post, it’s 5:30 PM Tuesday in New York and not surprisingly, I see several driving-themed playlists under Tuesday Traffic Jams section on my Spotify home page. It also seems like playlists on my home screen are triggered by my activities on the app — which artists I recently added, what genre of music I liked, or what other playlists I followed. There is not much sophistication around the way playlists are recommended to me (especially because I don’t drive to work on Tuesdays or any other days in NYC) but that doesn’t mean that I won’t listen to the Evening Commute playlist which has Ariana Grande on its cover. 3. So why are they important? I love Spotify and choose to pay the monthly subscription fee because it is so easy to use. It is a simple, convenient and effective way to consume music and I accredit this to Spotify’s amazing playlist capabilities. Its playlists have evolved into a critical component of music streaming service to all the parties involved, adding different values to each. i) value to its USERS: First and foremost, playlists empower listeners to be able to navigate and consume music in the sea of some 35 million songs. Users can effortlessly discover new music, compile favorite songs and share their musical taste with your friends so that they can enjoy, too. “All the signs point to playlists being the dominant mode of discovery in the near future.” — Jay Frank, senior VP at Universal Music Group — Back when Itunes was the norm to music listening, I was somewhat limited to my own saved songs and finding new songs often required more time and effort than what we’re used to now. The vast number of songs available on Itunes was meaningless because I had no way of effectively navigating them. Today, playlists like New Music Friday or Rap Caviar updates weekly to inform me of new releases and helps me keep up to date with the hottest rap music. Finding and enjoying music that I love has never been easier with Spotify’s playlists. In a sense, playlists helped transform the act of music listening into a social, collective experience rather than an individualistic, passive, and offline experience. With Spotify, I can peek into my old friend’s public playlists, just as I would visit his Instagram account, to find out what music he’s into these days. I can talk about Avicii’s postmortem tracks to my colleagues at work tomorrow because his songs showed up on my Release Radar the other night. ii) value to ARTISTS: Artists create music and so that people listen to them, preferably as many as possible. Traditionally, radio played the role of distributing music to the wider audience — today, however, playlists have overtaken that role. The story of Lorde and her single becoming an overnight hit after Sean Parker added her song on his playlist demonstrates just how powerful Spotify playlists can be. The sheer number of followers in certain playlists (Today’s Top Hits has 23M followers out of the 140M monthly users on Spotify) makes them the most effective means of promotion to artists. Note how similar this is from the way Instagram works with influencers and advertisers. This begs the question then — how do artists get themselves on some of these famous playlists? The short answer is that you CAN’T by paying money. Spotify clearly states that no one can buy themselves a spot on one of its 4,300+ curated playlists. Those behind-the-scene editors select music for its playlists based on hard data and personal judgment. However, listing on one of user-generated playlists on Spotify whose owners are outside of Spotify is free game for artists and that has led to emergence of what is known as pitching companies. Artists or labels can pay these companies (e.g., Playlist push, Submit hub) to start a campaign, which simply means that they will pass along the tracks to a network of curators that own popular playlists on Spotify. If considered a good fit, curators will then place the song on one of their public playlists. This pitching business is a win-win for all three parties — artists have a shot at being exposed to a larger audience, pitching companies get paid by the artists, and independent curators also get paid by the pitching companies. There is, however, a lot of mixed reviews and controversy on such services— how effective they really are, whether music should be driven by monetary means, or would artists without the resources be at a disadvantage, etc. Regardless, one thing that’s certain is that playlists have become the modern day radio. They are the most important avenue of promoting music for artists and will continue to be so in the days to come. iii) value to SPOTIFY: In a market where every player offers pretty much the same goods, it’s critical that you are known for something special. For Spotify, it is their robust playlist selections and personalization engine. The company has been consistently investing money and time to develop sophisticated algorithms and curate the perfect playlists that are tailored to your ears. To get there, Spotify acquired multiple machine learning and music analytics startups like Niland and Sonalytic. Is it paying off? There is no hard data around how many users choose Spotify over other products due to its playlists. However, 31% of all listening time on Spotify were in its programmed (including both personalized and curated) playlists in 2018, compared to just 20% in 2016. The increased dependency of Spotify playlists by its users illustrate just how much important playlists are for user’s experience. There is no question that personalization and ease of use will lead to higher engagement, retention, and acquisition rates. 3. So are playlists only good news? No. Regardless of how great these playlists are for users, artists, and Spotify, there are some downsides. First, relying on playlists to consume music has anonymized artists. Listening to More Like Drake playlist, I am oblivious to all the great rappers and their names unless I manually seek the artist name or the title. Your Favorite Coffeehouse may have all chill sounds for my morning routine but there is not a single artist that I remember after my two months of use. Moreover, the emergence of popular UGC playlists owned by non-Spotify individuals has had adverse effect on music promotion. Artists with money have unwarranted advantage in promoting their music over those without much resource. Spending money to get more hits on one of their private playlists then increase the chance of being listed on Spotify’s curated playlists .This is surely an unfair business for artists and music lovers alike. 4. Where is it going? The importance of data and machine learning is only increasing and we rely on artificial intelligence to predict, respond, and execute things without any human intervention. For this reason, I believe that Spotify will continue to double down on its playlist capabilities with its ever-increasing amount of data collected from users. Here are some of my personal predictions: As a fan of Spotify and all its services, I am curious to know what’s to come. If you’ve enjoyed reading this post, great!
