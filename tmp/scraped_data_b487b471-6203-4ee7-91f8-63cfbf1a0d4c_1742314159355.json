Define the Purpose of Your Playlist First, determine the main purpose of your playlist. Is it for concentration, relaxation, or boosting energy during a workout? Knowing your goal will help guide your song choices: Workout Playlist: Choose high-energy, fast-paced tracks to keep your motivation up. Focus Playlist: Pick calming or instrumental tracks to maintain concentration. Relaxation Playlist: Opt for slow, soothing music to create a peaceful environment. 2. Choose a Genre or Theme After determining the purpose, focus on a genre or theme. For example: Morning Energy: Select uplifting and upbeat songs to start your day right. Nighttime Chill: Use downtempo or ambient tracks to wind down in the evening. This is where Melodista comes in handy. With Melodista, you can easily categorize your music by genre, mood, or any custom tags you prefer, simplifying playlist creation and management. 3. Mix Familiar and New Tracks A great playlist combines familiar favorites with fresh tracks. While adding your go-to songs, also experiment with new recommendations that fit your playlist’s mood.

Last week, for the Opinion section, I wrote an article in defense of playlist-making as a form of art. While writing this, I figured that if something is a skill or art— it ought to be able to be taught. So, this week, I take it upon myself to talk about the process of deciding what kinds of playlists you might need, conceptualizing said playlist, and creating the finished product. The initial question to ask before starting to curate is to consider the kinds of playlists you need. Everyone’s array will look a little different, and playlists can serve a myriad of purposes. Are you looking for a playlist to make you believe in love, wallow along with you, channel your rage, or place you into your imagined movie montage? Trying to pick a specific mood is something that I feel helps a lot, or for the fandom enthusiast, you might be trying to channel a particular show, movie, book, or character. Once you have decided on the basis for your playlist, it is time to think about sound. Making these decisions will help to create a more cohesive playlist overall. For example, if you are creating a main character playlist, you might want songs that have a very opened-up and atmospheric quality to the instrumentation to give it that big-movie-moment feel; or, if you are making a comfort playlist, you might fill it with singer-songwriter tracks. Having a specific vision for your playlist, especially mood playlists, helps refine each playlist and make it more distinct from others. The biggest piece of advice I could give to playlist endeavour-ers is this: do not be too sentimental. While picking your initial songs it makes sense to pull from songs you already know and love that fit the vibe, part of playlist curation is in the exploration. Your favorite songs, or the ones you cannot stop listening to, change pretty regularly, so just putting songs on a playlist because you like them will ultimately cause these playlists to date much faster, and you will get much less use out of them. Rather, a playlist with a mix of songs you already know and love, along with songs you find that fit the vibe you are looking for, will have a longer shelf life. To find new music that is similar, stay informed on budding artists that you know have similar sounds to artists you already like. If you are a Spotify user, take advantage of things like the “Recommended Songs” tab or the “Discover Weekly” playlist that Spotify curates for its users. Artists' pages will even have a “Fans Also Like” section where you can find similar sounds. This can help keep your music life open and curious, enriching your music lifestyle. Part of the joy of playlist-making is changing what you are listening to regularly and avoiding music slumps. Once you have your mood and a rough collection of songs you feel might be appropriate for the playlist, start listening to it! The first couple of times, ensure it is with a critical ear. This is the stage for refinement; really listening to each song can help you figure out what in your playlist is or is not working. Be ruthless and cut whatever you feel is not serving the atmosphere you aim to curate. With this, I leave you to some mighty playlisting, and I hope some of these tips can be helpful for you in your future endeavors!

I was a child of the ‘80s — a time before children were gratuitously given ribbons and trophies for simply showing up. I was also a child who dabbled in everything, never firmly landing in one area. I tried softball, choir, tap dancing, ballet, drama, photography — none of which felt like something I wanted to devote myself to (hence, no trophies). Fast forward thirty years, and there’s one trophy that sits proudly on my desk. Its plaque reads, “Moodboard Master,” recognizing my skill for creating detailed vision boards. And even though it was just a silly gift from an art director, it means a lot to me. Creating a mood, a vibe, a feeling — is what I do best. But it’s an elusive, ineffable kind of talent. It feels a bit mystical, like saying I can read minds. One of my favorite ways to capture a specific mood is with a playlist. An evocative playlist is a form of storytelling, and similar to writing a good story, you have to be delicate; you don’t want to give everything away. The first sentence should set the tone immediately in a compelling story, and the first song of a playlist should do the same. That’s one of the downsides of streaming playlists; listeners don’t often play the songs in order, resulting in a completely different experience than its curator planned. Would you read a novel out of order? No. So don’t do that with playlists. Treat them like mixtapes. When I was a teenager, we didn’t have cell phones or the internet. My friends and I had to find creative ways to express our feelings. We wrote each other handwritten notes, letters and poems, but my favorite medium was the mixtape. I could convey more through music than words, and it felt more honest. With a highly-curated arrangement of songs, I could express what I struggled to say or fully understand. The goal was to connect with my listener through lyrics, tempo, and mood. It’s like what the character, Rob Gordon, in the movie High Fidelity (2000) says, “A playlist is a delicate art...you get to say what you want to say without actually saying it.\" I purposely title many of my playlists as “mixtapes” because I want to give the listener a clue that this should be played like a cassette tape. A cassette mixtape requires active participation. The listener has to touch and engage with it. And when they flip from side A to side B, it’s an intermission. They’re entering the second act of the story. Even without the tangibility of a real tape, I curate my playlists with this experience in mind. Here are my tips for creating a “mixtape” playlist: Order Matters! Don’t just throw together a bunch of trendy songs or songs that sound the same. Sure, those general-pleaser playlists may be fun for parties, but a mixtape playlist is personal, even if anyone can listen to it! In your playlist’s description, state that it should be listened to from start to finish: NO SHUFFLING. Mix It Up. You don’t want your mixtape playlist to be too literal and samey. Give yourself a general idea of what you’re trying to convey and then search for music that fits that mood (but for different reasons). In a well-told story, the sentences and flow don’t always sound the same; they’re varied and create tension. Try to arrange something that feels cohesive but also abstract. This sounds complicated, but it’s not rocket science. Keep experimenting until you find something that feels right to you. Be Authentic. Even though you’re using other people’s art, a playlist is an extension of your style and sensibilities. If you’re unsure about your style, do some research. Don’t rely on “Top Hits” or one of Spotify’s curated lists. Take the time to discover new music and explore artists that you’ve never heard of. One of the benefits of sites like Spotify and Soundcloud is that it’s easier than ever to find cool music. I spend a lot of time exploring, and I save songs I like into their own section. That way, I can easily access them when I’m creating playlists. Don’t strive to make a playlist that’s for everyone. It’s impossible. You want your uniquely curated selection of songs to speak to a mood, occasion, or possibly, a specific person. If you keep that in mind, not only will it turn out better, but your connection to it will be stronger. If you think about it, this isn’t a bad way to approach most things in life. Maybe my mood-making skills will get me somewhere! Since we’re talking about “mixtape” playlists, here’s a new one for you. It’s called “Mystery Mixtape” for its enigmatic theme. You’ll have to listen closely to come up with your own interpretation. You can follow all of my playlists on Spotify.

Think about it; the best playlists are the ones that follow a theme you can feel from song to song. In the next few paragraphs, I’m sharing some of my favorite playlists on Spotify and tips to make your own masterpiece. Music has always been a passion of mine. I love to listen to it, I love to play it. I’m singing something every chance I get, and then I’m listening to Spotify every other minute. I play music when I sleep sometimes, when I wake up, while I get ready for the day, workout, in the car, at work, at home, always. I like having something in the background, but now it also helps me focus. I personally like softer music. I often describe my music taste as singer/songwriter, chill, indie folk, acoustic style. This type of music speaks to my soul and calms me. I feel so connected to songs that fit this genre, and I get really invested in the artists who create music of this style. GIF via Giphy.com I would say more than half of my Spotify collection is softer, relaxed, easy listening music. Two of my favorite playlists are appropriately titled “Chill” and “Wonderful Unknown.” They are what I play most of the da. No matter where I am or what I am doing, they just fit. “Chill” is my largest playlist at 480 songs. I know, great title, right? GIF via Giphy.com This playlist features artists and tunes that match the name, chill. The tone of music relaxes the listener and allows them to focus. This is a great study playlist for anyone looking for light songs that aren’t super loud or distracting. I also usually play it in a work environment for that same reason. What I like most about the curation is that it helps me stay focused, the songs are even encouraging sometimes, but it doesn’t overshadow or draw my attention away from what I’m doing. “Chill” helps me get my work done and get in the zone. On a side note, I think it’s kind of funny that the playlist cover image is of four Norah Jones albums because her music was what I was listening to when I first got the inspiration to create “Chill,” though the list now includes a more broad selection than just her smooth vocals. “Wonderful Unknown” is the first playlist I ever made and still today is my favorite. I think the title gives it some mystery, and I like that you don’t exactly know what you are going to get from it. The style of this playlist takes a more solace or serious tone, but is power packed with all the feels. GIF via Giphy.com I made this playlist after listening to its title track “Wonderful Unknown” by Ingrid Michaelson and being so moved by it that I wanted to make an entire list matching the mood of this one song. Ingrid is one of my favorite artists. I have seen her live twice and after the second concert, I got to meet and hug her. It was incredible! Besides the fun personal anecdotes, her music has always spoken to me as I know it does for many others, too. You can find a good chunk of her music throughout this collection along with other artists that have a soft, calming tone to them. This has been my go-to playlist for nearly everything and often times, it’s what I play when I sleep. Something about it, track to track, just relaxes me to the point of drifting off. This list has also doubled as a great work and study playlist, too, because the songs are the right backdrop for productivity. I have made over 15 playlists that I go back and forth to listen to between different times of the week. My Spotify experience, just like the two playlists above, is all about mood. How I feel will define what I listen to, so that’s exactly how I curate my playlists. Every single list is a collection of songs that work together based on how they make me feel. I know exactly what to listen to no matter what I’m feeling, and I’ve never failed to have the right list for the right moment. Making a good playlist is something anyone can do, you just need to be smart when crafting it. Think about the theme you want it to have. Where are you intending to listen to it? Do the songs make you think about anyone? How do they make you feel? Are you generally happier, pensive or sad after hearing it? All these factors and more, need to be considered when you put together a playlist. Make something you want to listen to. Have a personal connection to your playlists and your listening experience will change. You can also look me up on Spotify and see what the rest of my playlists are like. I am always building something new or adding to my existing collection. Happy listening!

We listen to music in the house, in the car, and on the phone. How can musicians connect with such a wide audience? Playlists are a big secret. These songs are created by users or listened to on music apps. The significance of music marketing playlists will be discussed in this blog. Notice how they facilitate communication between fans and performers. Whether an artist or a fan, learning about playlists may help you appreciate and use music better. Table of Contents The Power of Playlists in Music Streaming Modern mixtapes are playlists. They let people logically arrange their preferred tunes. Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music rely on playlists for music discovery and pleasure. When these apps debut, playlists are often included. The app, music industry professionals, and users create playlists together. You can check whether your music appears on popular playlists as a musician. It is much better than having your song played on the radio. You never know how many people may hear a song that makes it into a popular playlist. Both established, and up and coming musicians have a chance to gain visibility. Building Connections with Listeners Artists and fans are uniquely connected via playlists. Playlists are a way for artists to connect with fans. Their chosen music might uncover their preferences, influences, and emotional state. People would like to hear a country singer play a mix of their favourite rock tunes. This piece shows the artist’s darker side, bringing listeners closer to the artist and inspiring them to listen more often. Artists may create playlists based on mood or activities. For example, they may create a “workout playlist” or a “relaxing evening playlist.” This allows listeners to relate the artist’s music to many parts of their lives. Additionally, services like Jaynike, which provides followers service, can help artists grow their audience, ensuring their playlists reach even more fans. Reaching New Audiences Playlists can help artists find new listeners. A popular playlist may introduce an artist to those who have never heard of them before, which can be helpful for up and coming or solo artists trying to build an audience. Many people can hear a new pop singer’s song if it is on a popular “New Music Friday” playlist. Some may be enticed to follow the artist and check out more of their music after hearing the song. Artists may use playlists to reach out to similar music lovers. Listeners who prefer rock music are more likely to encounter and like songs performed by rock bands. Creating a Unique Brand Musicians can express themselves beyond the tunes in a playlist. Playlists provide a platform for artists to showcase their work, strengthening the brand in the music industry. An introspective jazz artist could compile a set list of timeless jazz standards. Jazz history is something they grasp and value. Pop singers could compile a playlist of upbeat dance tracks to show off their energy and excitement. Artists may advocate for issues using playlists. Some playlists serve as memorials or fundraisers. The artist’s admirers see them as human beings with values and hobbies. Increasing Streams and Revenue The right playlists have the potential to elevate a musician’s career. If more people hear a song, there will be more streaming, increasing an artist’s income. Nevertheless, the music is multi song. Discovering a new artist on a playlist usually leads to increased listening to that artist’s music. Fans can go to concerts or add the artist’s music to their playlists. With this snowball effect, artists’ careers might skyrocket. Having more streams might open up additional opportunities for artists in terms of fans, concert tickets, merchandise, and more. Tips for Effective Playlist Marketing Using playlists, artists may monetise their music: Make curated playlists to suit different occasions and emotions. Your typical “study session” or “party night” playlist, or even a “morning motivation” playlist. Keep your playlists up to date. This promotes listening again and again. Playlists for socialising. More individuals can find and listen to playlists because of this. Working along with others who curate playlists. They make playlists that people love. If they add a song to their playlist, it might bring in new listeners. Artwork for playlists must be eye catching. Clicks and listens might be enticed by good photographs. Add music from other artists to your playlists. This will strengthen your musical relationships and show that you support other musicians. Conclusion When it comes to sharing and listening to music, playlists are king. Such services allow artists to connect with listeners, share their music, and gain new followers. By making and sharing high quality playlists, artists have a better chance of boosting their careers and expanding their fan bases. Playlists are an excellent tool for freshly listening to music and finding new artists. The music listening experience is enhanced when one makes or listens to playlists with their favourite performers.
