By StudyFinds Staff • Reviewed by Sophia Naughton Research led by Joan Orpella (Georgetown University) and Daniel Liu Bowling (Stanford University) Feb 15, 2025 What kinds of music actually boost productivity? (Prostock-studio/Shutterstock) In a nutshell WASHINGTON — Anyone who’s ever put on headphones to concentrate at work knows that the right music can help you get in the zone. But with endless playlists promising to boost focus and productivity, which type of music actually delivers results? A new study cuts through the marketing hype, revealing that while certain types of background music can enhance both mood and task performance, not all focus-oriented music delivers on its promises. The relationship between music and productivity has long fascinated researchers and workers alike. As mobile devices and streaming services make music more accessible than ever during work hours, understanding these effects becomes increasingly important. Previous studies have shown mixed results—while some music appears to enhance memory and attention, other types can be distracting, especially when containing lyrics or complex musical elements that compete for our attention. This latest study, published in PLOS One found that specially composed “work flow” music helped people think faster and feel better while completing challenging mental tasks. This wasn’t true for other types of background audio, including minimalist “deep focus” tracks from a streaming platform, current hit songs, or simulated office noise (think distant conversations, gentle keyboard typing, and subtle ambient sounds you might hear in a calm office environment). The secret lies in the specific musical formula: moderate tempo, clear rhythm, and simple melodies without lyrics. Unlike “deep focus” tracks or attention-grabbing pop hits, work flow music strikes a careful balance, providing enough musical structure to maintain engagement without becoming distracting. Researchers from various American universities set out to test how different types of background audio affected people’s ability to concentrate and perform well on a task that requires a lot of attention. The study recruited 196 participants through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform, randomly assigning them to one of the four audio conditions. While listening to their assigned audio for 10 minutes, participants completed a classic psychology test called the flanker task, which measures selective attention and processing speed. The task required them to quickly respond to a central arrow while ignoring distracting elements on either side, sometimes identical arrows pointing the same way, sometimes opposing arrows, sometimes neutral squares, or sometimes crosses that signaled not to respond at all. What made the “work flow” music special? It featured several distinct characteristics that set it apart from typical background music. The tracks maintained a moderately fast tempo with clear, steady beats that didn’t overwhelm the listener. The melodies and harmonies were simple and predominantly used major keys, avoiding complex variations that might demand attention. The overall sound featured a balanced mix of frequencies below 6000 Hz, and the music included moderate dynamic changes rather than sudden shifts in volume or intensity. In contrast, the “deep focus” music was more minimalist, with slower tempos, less defined rhythms, and more restricted sound frequencies. While both types of music aimed to enhance concentration, their approaches differed significantly. The work flow music seemed to find an optimal balance, engaging enough to lift mood but not so complex that it competed for attention. Pop hits, on the other hand, introduced varying genres, lyrics, and musical complexity that could potentially pull focus. Only participants listening to work flow music showed significant improvements in both mood and task performance. These listeners reported feeling better after the task and got progressively faster at responding accurately as time went on. About 76% of participants in the work flow condition reported improved mood, while less than half of participants in other conditions experienced mood benefits. Notably, these benefits held true regardless of participants’ baseline anxiety levels—good news for anyone who struggles with stress affecting their work performance. Perhaps most intriguingly, bigger mood boosts correlated with bigger performance gains in the work flow group, suggesting that the music’s emotional and cognitive benefits went hand in hand. In simpler terms, the more the music improved someone’s mood, the more their performance improved over time, suggesting that feeling good and working well were closely connected in this context. The study also revealed interesting findings about musical preferences and familiarity. While the deep focus music was rated as pleasant to listen to, it didn’t yield the same performance benefits as work flow music. Surprisingly, participants found the work flow music less familiar than other conditions, suggesting that novelty wasn’t a barrier to its effectiveness. Pop hits, despite their popularity and ability to increase arousal, showed no significant benefits for either mood or performance. The office noise condition, which served as a realistic baseline, similarly showed no notable effects. These results align with an established theory called “arousal-mood theory,” which suggests that music can enhance cognitive performance by simultaneously elevating both energy level and positive emotions. The work flow music appeared to hit this sweet spot, while other audio conditions may have missed the mark in one way or another. The research team specifically investigated how these effects might vary based on individual differences. They found that people with higher sensitivity to musical rewards (those who generally experience stronger emotional responses to music) tended to respond faster overall during the task. This suggests that some individuals might be particularly well-suited to using music as a work enhancement tool. As streaming platforms continue expanding their focus-oriented playlist selection, this research provides a framework for understanding which types of music might actually enhance productivity. Rather than relying on playlist labels alone, workers might benefit from seeking out music that balances rhythmic engagement with simplicity—supporting mood and performance without demanding attention. Plugging Into Work Flow Music What Makes Music “Work Flow”? Work flow music combines specific musical elements designed to support focus and productivity: Finding Work Flow Music While the specific tracks used in this study came from a therapeutic music app called Spiritune, similar music can be found through: Commercial Sources: Look for tracks labeled as: Pro Tips: What to Avoid: The key is finding music that provides steady, predictable structure without commanding too much attention; something that can fill the background of your mental workspace without taking center stage. Paper Summary Methodology The study recruited 196 participants through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four audio conditions: work flow music, deep focus music, pop hits, or office noise. They completed a six-minute flanker task, a well-established test of selective attention and cognitive processing speed​. The study used a between-subjects design, meaning each participant only experienced one audio condition. Before the main task, participants completed questionnaires measuring musical sophistication, sensitivity to musical reward, and baseline psychological distress. They then underwent a headphone screening test and adjusted volume to comfortable levels. The flanker task presented arrows pointing left or right, with participants needing to quickly identify the central arrow’s direction while ignoring flanking arrows that could point in the same or opposite direction. The task lasted 6 minutes, with mood measured before and after using the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). Results Only the work flow music group showed significant improvements in overall mood and progressively faster response times while maintaining accuracy. About 76% of work flow listeners reported improved mood, compared to less than half in other conditions. The work flow group also rated their audio experience as moderately groovy and pleasurable, though interestingly they found it less familiar than other conditions. Statistical analyses showed these benefits were independent of participants’ baseline anxiety or depression levels. Limitations The researchers note several limitations: The online format meant less controlled conditions than a laboratory setting, the time scale was relatively short compared to real work tasks, and the flanker task, while standardized, is simpler than most real-world cognitive challenges. Additionally, most participants performed very accurately across conditions, potentially creating a ceiling effect that made it harder to detect differences in accuracy between groups. Takeaways and Discussion The study suggests that music can enhance cognitive performance through both emotional and arousal-related mechanisms, but only when it has specific characteristics – namely, strong rhythm, simple tonality, and moderate dynamism. The correlation between mood improvement and performance gains in the work flow group provides new evidence for how music might optimize cognitive function through emotional regulation. Funding and Disclosures The study was funded by a grant from the company that provided the work flow music tracks. Two of the authors served as advisors to this company. However, the researchers note that the funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, or manuscript preparation.

But is that actually a good idea? Evernote Follow Taking Note -- 4 Listen Share Sometimes it seems we’re surrounded by music. It’s hard to walk along the sidewalk, enter a building, or even sit at work or in a public place without being exposed to some type of music. A car drives down the block sharing the song of the moment. The coffee shop has something playing in the background. That jogger’s headphones allow us to hear the faintest hints of what they’re listening to. Music — and our access to the tunes we like — is so ever-present that it’s almost second nature to have it playing when we’re trying to do something else. But is that a good idea? The answer is that it is — and it isn’t. It all depends on what we’re doing and what the music we’re listening to is. It’s not even a matter of “the more complicated the task, the less we should listen.” A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that brain surgeons who listened to music while operating outperformed those who didn’t. Here are some research-backed tips to make sure music impacts your productivity in the right way: 1) Improve your mood with music Music releases dopamine and serotonin into our brains, which helps us feel pleasure, relax, and focus better. While there are times when we want to sulk and listen to something gloomy and self-pitying, in most cases, when we’re listening to music, it’s something that makes us happy. Music energizes us, so our moods naturally improve. A study by Dr. Teresa Lesiuk revealed “the value of music listening for positive mood change and enhanced perception … while working … provided … positive mood alteration.” In other words, people who listened to music while working were happier and more creative. Cognitive neuroscientist Dr. Daniel Levitin (who’s also a musician) suggests that there may be benefits to listening to music for 10–15 minutes before beginning a task that requires concentration or attention. Music releases dopamine and serotonin into our brains, which helps us feel pleasure, relax, and focus better. Interestingly, if a person is performing repetitive tasks — such as working on an assembly line — being distracted by music can help relieve some of the tedium. According to Dr. Lesiuk, people who listen to music complete their tasks more quickly and come up with better ideas than those who don’t. “When you’re stressed,” she wrote, “you might make a decision more hastily; you have a very narrow focus of attention. When you’re in a positive mood, you’re able to take in more options.” Pro Tip: On the iconic TV show American Bandstand, host Dick Clark used to ask people to rate a song they just heard. Become your own music critic. Use Evernote to jot down opinions about artists, albums, songs, and live performances. Rate them according to what’s important to you. That way, you’ll have a handy list of song suggestions for each mood. 2) Listen to what you know “With familiar music, you know what lies ahead. Paying attention requires less focus.” At work, the trend toward open offices presents new challenges for focus. If you’re working in a noisy and distracting place — with loud co-workers, outside noise, or anything that can pull your attention — one of the best solutions may be to put on a pair of headphones to help drown out the cacophony with pleasant or familiar music that will allow you to focus. The best kind of music here may be something you’re already familiar with. Content marketing strategist Gregory Ciotti points out that trying to take in new information can take you out of what you’re supposed to be doing: “With familiar music, you know what lies ahead. Paying attention requires less focus.” Let the happiness and relaxation of listening to something you like take you to a comfortable space that allows you to get work done. 3) Don’t get distracted by lyrics If your work involves working with words, and you love listening to music with lyrics while you work, Ciotti has bad news for you. He compares listening to music with lyrics while performing language-based tasks to “holding a conversation while another person talks over you … while also strumming a guitar.” You’re trying to make your brain do too many things at once, meaning that none of them will be done well. But if you’re a numbers person, you might be in luck. Dr. Lesiuk’s study showed that software designers, whose work didn’t deal strictly with words, had a greater output while listening to music with lyrics. The best solution here, according to Dr. Amit Sood of the Mayo Clinic, is to find classical, ambient, or other lyric-free music that sets an appropriate mood that is conducive to the task at hand. When college students attended lectures that were accompanied by classical music, their test results were much higher. The right music for your productivity Since everyone’s musical tastes differ, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer to what to listen to and when. But there seems to be little doubt that the right music played at the right time (familiar and comforting music before a task that requires concentration; old favorites when you need to be distracted from repetition) can give your productivity the right tempo.

As we move further into an era where flexibility, well-being, and innovation are paramount, harnessing the power of music can become a strategic advantage in shaping productive and fulfilling work environments. Whether through direct application in workspace design or encouraging a culture that celebrates musical engagement, recognizing and leveraging music’s potential can transform the modern workplace. The Role of Music in Boosting Team Morale In the contemporary workplace, fostering team morale is fundamental to creating an environment where employees feel valued, motivated, and engaged. One powerful yet often overlooked tool in this endeavor is music. Whether played in the background during work hours, used as part of team-building activities, or employed to celebrate achievements, music can enhance team spirit and boost morale in various ways. 1. Creating a Positive Atmosphere Music has an innate ability to influence emotions. Upbeat and energizing tunes can uplift spirits, fostering a vibrant atmosphere that encourages positivity. When played in communal spaces, music can help create a welcoming environment where team members feel energized and ready to collaborate. This positive atmosphere is essential for promoting open communication and creativity, two critical components of effective teamwork. 2. Encouraging Bonding and Connection Shared musical experiences can strengthen bonds among team members. Group activities centered around music—such as team karaoke sessions, music-themed parties, or collaborative playlists—provide employees with opportunities to connect personally. These experiences can break down barriers and facilitate relationships, helping to build trust among team members. When employees feel connected, they are more likely to support each other and work cohesively towards common goals. 3. Boosting Motivation and Productivity Many individuals find that music enhances their focus and productivity. Upbeat or instrumental music can serve as an effective backdrop for tasks, helping team members to maintain concentration while also elevating their mood. Studies show that certain types of music can increase productivity by fostering a rhythm that encourages employees to engage fully in their work. Employees' motivation and productivity improve their overall job satisfaction and team morale. 4. Providing a Stress Relief Mechanism The modern workplace can often be a source of stress. Music has been shown to reduce anxiety and create a calming effect, making it an excellent tool for stress relief. Whether playing soothing tracks during intense work periods or organizing music breaks, incorporating music as a stress reliever can enhance well-being. A less stressed team is happier, more resilient, and capable of overcoming challenges. 5. Celebrating Achievements Music is often an integral part of celebrations and incorporating it into team achievements can enhance the sense of accomplishment. Playing a team anthem or celebratory song after hitting a milestone can create a shared experience of success, reinforcing a team’s collective identity and pride.

Task Tracking Software: Project management software monitors task completion times, efficiency metrics, and individual contributions within varied musical settings. b). Quality Control Metrics: Implement quality assurance protocols that evaluate the final outputs, assessing any differences in quality between music-supported performance and traditional methods. 7. Longitudinal Studies Consider conducting longitudinal studies to evaluate the long-term effects of music on team dynamics: a). Ongoing Monitoring: Track performance trends over an extended period to determine if initial positive effects are sustained or adjustments are needed. b). Adaptability Assessments: Evaluate how well teams adapt to music integration over time. For instance, does performance continue to improve, stabilize, or decline with prolonged exposure to music as a tool? 8. Making Informed Adjustments Based on the findings from evaluations, make informed adjustments to your music strategy: a). Customizing Playlists: Create customized playlists based on team members' preferred genres and feedback, adjusting for task types and project phases. b). Flexible Implementation: Adopt a flexible approach, permitting teams to choose whether to work with music, particularly in tasks that require intense focus or analysis. c). Regular Review Meetings: Conduct periodic reviews to assess the ongoing effectiveness of the music strategy and make necessary tweaks based on team input and performance data. Future Trends: The Evolving Role of Music in the Workplace As the workplace continues to evolve in response to technological advancements, shifting employee expectations, and changing organizational cultures, the role of music is becoming increasingly significant. Various emerging trends suggest how music might be integrated into the future workplace, enhancing employee well-being, productivity, and collaboration. 1. Personalized Music Experiences The future workplace is likely to focus on personalization, including audio experiences. With technological advancements, companies may offer personalized music playlists tailored to individual preferences and work tasks. Algorithms could analyze employees’ productivity patterns and task types to suggest or create playlists that optimize focus or creativity. This shift towards a customized auditory environment could lead to higher engagement and satisfaction levels. 2. Music as a Wellness Tool With a growing emphasis on mental health and well-being, music is poised to play a critical role in workplace wellness programs. Organizations may implement music therapy sessions, mindfulness playlists, or ambient music zones to help employees manage stress, enhance relaxation, and promote emotional well-being. Regular access to music can be a powerful tool for employees to recharge and maintain mental wellness, improving overall productivity. 3. Integration of Music with Technology As remote work and hybrid models become more common, the integration of music with collaboration tools is likely to increase. Platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Slack might incorporate features that allow users to share music playlists during meetings or provide built-in background music options for virtual environments. Improved audio quality and technology could support immersive musical experiences during team collaborations, making virtual interactions more engaging and less isolating. 4. Focus on Collaborative Music Experiences Future workplaces may leverage music as a tool for team building and collaboration. Shared music experiences, such as collaborative playlists or group jam sessions, could enhance bonding among team members, fostering a sense of belonging and community. Organizations might host themed music events or encourage teams to create soundtrack playlists that reflect their personalities and projects, allowing for deeper connections beyond work-related interactions. 5. Increased Diversity of Music Genres As organizations become more global and culturally diverse, there will likely be a broader acceptance and celebration of varied music genres worldwide. This diversity can foster inclusivity and understanding in the workplace. Cross-cultural playlists may be created that reflect employees' diverse backgrounds, promoting cultural appreciation and enhancing team cohesion through shared musical experiences. 6. Data-Driven Insights on Music Impact With the growth of data analytics and employee feedback tools, organizations can gain deeper insights into how music affects productivity and job satisfaction. Companies can refine their music strategies based on empirical evidence by analyzing performance metrics in conjunction with music usage. This data-driven approach will allow decision-makers to identify which types of music yield the best results for different tasks, teams, and workplace environments, ensuring that music is utilized as effectively as possible. 7. Hybrid Workspaces Designed for Music Integration The design of future office spaces will likely incorporate areas specifically intended for musical engagement. These spaces may include dedicated zones for collaborative music-making, relaxation lounges featuring soundscapes to enhance concentration or even performance spaces for employees to showcase their musical talents. Such designs foster creativity and openness, encouraging employees to take breaks with music or even participate in team-building music activities. 8. Gamification of Music in Work Incorporating gamification elements into music experiences can enhance engagement and motivation among employees. For instance, organizations could introduce challenges or competitions that encourage teams to create playlists based on specific themes or project goals. By integrating rewards and recognition systems tied to these musical initiatives, companies can harness the competitive spirit while strengthening teamwork through shared goals. 9. Focus on Ambient Music and Sound Design As research reveals the positive effects of ambient sounds on focus and creativity, organizations may invest more in sound design to optimize the auditory environment of their workspaces. Collaborating with sound designers to create tailored soundscapes that support various work activities—such as brainstorming, focused work, and relaxation—will become increasingly common. This attention to sonic aesthetics enhances the overall workplace experience, improving employee satisfaction. 10. Fostering Connection Through Music for Remote Teams Music can be a powerful tool for remote and hybrid teams to bridge the gap between physical distances. Activities such as virtual music listening parties, shared playlists, or synchronized listening sessions can foster connection among team members. Companies are likely to develop structured programs that encourage employees to engage with one another musically, making virtual interactions feel more personal and collaborative. Conclusion In conclusion, the role of music in boosting team productivity in project management is multifaceted and profound. By harnessing the power of music, teams can create an environment that nurtures creativity, enhances focus, and promotes collaboration. The strategic use of music can help to reduce stress, improve mood, and foster a sense of belonging among team members, leading to higher engagement levels and a more cohesive team dynamic. As project managers increasingly seek innovative ways to optimize performance, incorporating music into the workplace emerges as a valuable tool. Ultimately, recognizing and leveraging music's psychological and emotional benefits can significantly enhance productivity, driving teams toward successful project outcomes. Therefore, it is essential for managers to thoughtfully integrate music into their workspaces and daily routines, ensuring it aligns with the team's goals and enhances overall performance.",

      "content": "Optimize Your Productivity With Focus Music Productivity Can you imagine a movie without a soundtrack? No matter what happened on the screen, something would be missing. The music carries the mood. It draws you into the scene and tells you how you are supposed to feel. Music can create tension or release it. Studios leverage this effect to enhance the experience of watching a film. Hollywood producers are not the only ones who recognize the power of music. There is a reason stores, hotels, and restaurants play music. Music influences our thoughts and moods. It can put you in the right frame of mind and emotional state for a specific purpose. The same is true for doing focused work. The right music can be one of your most important productivity assets. We have introduced this concept to more than 13,000 of our customers and most of them curate their own focus music as well. What is Focus Music? The idea of using music to enhance your focus is not new, but neuroscience has advanced the concept far beyond your favorite playlist on Apple Music or Spotify. Modern technology makes it possible to engineer a new musical genre called streamlined music (commonly known as focus music, brain music, concentration music, studying music, and relaxing sleeping music). According to Julia A. Mossbridge, Director of the Innovation Lab at Northwestern University, streamlined music can be defined as unfamiliar music to which one or more methods have been applied to reduce the activation of “exogenous attentional mechanisms” in the listener. In other words, it is music that is structured to enhance your focus and help you overcome distractions from external sources. The theory is that when there is focus music in the background while a listener is working, there will be a positive impact on cognition. It may also boost their mood. Common Use Cases: How Does Music Help You Focus? Focus is a competition for your attention – a battle between internal sources and external sources. Think about internal sources as your goals, your priorities, and your most important tasks. External sources are distractions. They steal your focus and limit your productivity. Some of those distractions happen because of all the sounds that surround you. Stop for a moment and think about your current surroundings on a typical day of work (whether in the home, the office, or favorite coffee shop). What do you hear? Do you have noisy co-workers? Do you hear the constant clatter of office machines being used? If you work near a street, you might be bombarded with traffic noise or the sounds of construction work. Even working from home creates a challenge. If you live with other people, it is impossible to control your conditions completely. Life happens, and it is noisy. Not long ago, I was listening to a professionally recorded podcast that included the sound of the presenter’s child crying in the background. We all face the challenge of how to find our focus in a noisy world. Quiet Quest: Study Music Focus music for studying works by replacing the sounds that distract you with sounds that enhance your brain’s ability to achieve and maintain focus. The music works as a protective shield. It has just enough of your attention so that you will not be distracted by ambient noises, but it still lives in the background allowing you to achieve and maintain proper focus. This makes it the perfect studying music. The combined effects of focus music for studying make it an easy choice for students who want to optimize their productivity. Sound is important to fall asleep faster Those who fall asleep faster want to know if listening to the right music helps. In other words, “Can music help you sleep?” Research suggests the answer is yes. For a good night sleep listen to music that either directly promotes sleep or reduces issues that interfere with sleep. It is a productivity multiplier. Improve your attention To be productive in your daily work, you need to find ways to achieve greater focus and overcome distractions. Your attention is a vital resource. According to the TEA framework, attention forms one of the three pillars of productivity. You have to protect it. One of the best ways you can protect your attention is to use music. Life does not have volume control. You cannot turn it down or change the channel. However, you can use the science-based technology of focus music to reduce distractions and increase focus. Concentration Music Can Maximize Your Cognitive Skills For most professionals, your work requires cognitive skills. Cognitive skills are mental processes that engage your brain in focusing and sustaining your attention, processing information, and using logic and reasoning. The more effective you are in each of these skills, the more productive you will be. According to an article published by the National Library of Medicine, “background music can have predictable effects on cognitive performance.” Three Benefits of Music For Studying on Cognitive Abilities 1. Increased Learning and Memory. Dr. Masha Godkin, a professor at Northcentral University, states, “Music activates both the left and right brain at the same time, and the activation of both hemispheres can maximize learning and improve memory.” 2. Sustained Attention. Researchers at the Stanford School of Medicine published a paper that showed that music engages the areas of the brain involved with paying attention. 3. Enhanced Reasoning. A study published in the Journal of Aesthetic Education (Vol.34, No.3/4) claims that music can improve spatial-temporal reasoning – a particular type of intelligence that involves visualizing and manipulating images in your brain. Although the study is not conclusive, there is compelling evidence about the music’s positive effects on how the brain works. The Science Behind Deep Focus Music Deep focus music is engineered to create an environment that is ideal for accomplishing your work. High and low decibels are eliminated from the music. Gaps, breaks, or sharp changes that are likely to cause distraction are not permitted. The type and number of instruments used are designed to achieve a balance between ignoring the music completely (called habituation) and the music capturing your attention. How Music for Studying is Designed If you are interested in a deeper dive into the science behind streamlined music, you can read white papers here and here. We wrote more about the science of focus music in this article. Playlist vs. Streamlined Music Services While streaming services like Apple Music and Spotify offer curated lists of studying music, they do not claim to support the science behind streamlined music. If you are just looking for some relaxing music, you can find it on a streaming service or a study music YouTube channel. However, relaxing ambient music is not the same as deep focus music that was created to help you focus. Fortunately, there are two great options: Brain.fm and Focus@Will. These companies are using the available science and technology (and doing their own research and development) to deliver a music-streaming service dedicated exclusively to the purpose of improving concentration and mood. Both services are available as a browser-based service or application on various platforms. Focus at Will: Brain.fm The Future of Focus Music The development of focus music is an emerging technology. Every discovery about how the brain responds to sounds gets tested and integrated over time to improve the music’s quality and effectiveness. Although it is relatively new, the popularity of services like Brain.fm and Focus@will validate the many people are already experiencing the benefits of focus music. Here are three reasons we think you should give it a try: Next Steps for Optimizing Your Productivity with Focus Music Whether you are searching for the perfect ambient music to fall asleep faster, relaxing music, studying music, or deep focus music, this new genre could be your answer.

Blog Home » Blog » Advice » How Listening to Music Makes You More Productive How Listening to Music Makes You More Productive Music is life. I play it everyday. For many people, music is a way of life. For me, it’s therapeutic escape from the harsh realities and the beautiful unknowns of modern-day living, an exercise in the expansion of consciousness and a million other things, depending upon how you think about it. It doesn’t necessarily take playing music to get the most out of it either, as listening can be just as powerful an experience. It’s not too far a stretch to believe that without music, many people would have a difficult time getting by. I would, anyway. Without music, my life would be a living hell. While the pleasurable effects of music are easily understandable, many people lose sight of the other benefits associated with playing and listening to music. Particularly viewed from a productivity standpoint, music can be a true asset to anyone who is looking to get things done faster, more efficiently, and with more focus. Given the way we consume media today, it’s also readily available at all times to anyone with an Internet connection. Table of Contents The 5 scientific benefits of listening to music. Listening to music can be an effective (not to mention enjoyable) way to boost productivity, but before delving into how and why you should start bringing headphones to work, let’s dive into some of the other benefits associated with having your favorite tunes playing on the speakers in the background. 1. It relieves you of anxiety. Life is crazy. You really never know what’s going to happen next, because it just happens. And for some people, this causes a great deal of anxiety. Many embrace a number of counteractive methods to keep anxiety at bay … like taking medication, exercising, medication, eating, medication, therapy, and even some more medication. If you’re not exercising, eating, meditating, or in therapy, and you dont’ want to go the medication rout, there’s another option. Music. Not everyone realizes that music is one of the most effective tools available for reducing anxiety. Close your eyes and focus on what you hear for even just a few minutes, and you’ll no doubt feel your body and mind begin to relax to the sounds around you. 2. Music helps you make stronger connections with groups and other people. If you’re already a music fan, I bet you’ll agree that bringing up your favorite artists or bands in a conversation can be a great way to find common ground when meeting someone new. Taking this idea further, listening to music in a group setting can help everyone in the room not only feel more connected with each other, but also put them all in the state of mind and on the same level. There’s something unexplainable that happens when a large group of strangers moves in sync at a concert, for example, and the same concept can be applied at a micro level. 3. It drastically improves your memory. It’s long been said that “music makes you smarter,” and there’s actually quite a bit of truth to this sentiment. Perhaps most important to realize is that music does indeed help to improve one’s memory. When you listen to and/or play music, your left and right brain work simultaneously, which serves to improve the ways in which memories are formed and retained. Singing is believed to improve the ways in which one processes information because of how it utilizes both the left and right brain at the same time, for example, but even a simple listening session can have beneficial effects. 4. Listening to music reduces your muscle tension. Along with anxiety comes muscle tension as one of the primary issues faced by business people, especially those who are stuck sitting at a desk for eight or more hours per day. Listening to music helps to reduce tension throughout the body, including the back and shoulders where it is so often felt by those who work office jobs. Even keeping something on in the background can be an effective way to destress and release tension. 5. You will get a higher quality of sleep. Sleep is one of the most essential elements of a productive day, yet it’s also more commonly neglected today than ever in the past. If you’re getting less than eight hours each night, chances are you’re feeling it. Research has shown that listening to classical music may be an effective way to improve the quality of one’s sleep, especially when done on a regular basis. The result is a more refreshed feeling each morning, and thus a more productive workday. Do you want to know how music effects your workplace performance? As one might expect, given the utility of music for improving one’s health, listening to music can also have beneficial effects on workplace performance. A notion such as this might seem loaded, but studies have shown it to be true. Teresa Lesiuk of the University of Windsor, Canada, published an important study in 2005, for example, which showed that listening to music helped to improve the efficiency in which one completes tasks and fosters the creation of better ideas. Much of this has to do with the release of a chemical called dopamine that typically occurs when one listens to music, which in turn makes them more happy than they might otherwise be. Think of it as being in-line with taking a bite out of a delicious sandwich, for example, or experiencing a first kiss with a new partner. Both of these scenarios result in an increased production of dopamine, which provides the individual with a sense of elation. While a number of different things occur within the brain as one listens to music during the workday, it’s important to focus on perhaps the most easily-felt of all — happiness. Most people can attest to feeling good during and after listening to their favorite music, even if the subject matter happens to be particularly dark or sad. The happiness that comes from turning on a favorite piece of music is quite noticeable when one pays close attention, and it can certainly help to make the day go more smoothly than it might otherwise. The benefits of incorporating music into the workday are many, with the following being just a few prime examples: If you get bored at work, music will ease your suffering. Boredom is a productivity-killer like no other, yet it’s difficult to avoid sometimes. When you’ve got music going in the background, however, the mind has something interesting to keep it occupied aside from what is being focused on work-wise. This helps to reduce boredom and increase one’s ability to properly tackle whatever task may be at hand. Increased identity marking. Your co-workers and where you work is it’s own little community not unlike any other, which means that the people who make up your team will no doubt crave the ability to mark their identity and inject a bit of personality into the workday. Many people decorate their offices or cubicles with personal artwork, (which is typically with pictures of the dogs or cats, family photos, or other rediculous stuff that gives them self-worth, allows them to relfect on what they love, and gives them purpose … which can be a great way to reach this goal, but music can be even more effective and fosters the sharing of ideas and interests. This helps to empower employees, which in turn has a positive effect on productivity. Music breeds and inspires effective creativity. Anyone who has ever found themselves stumped on the job knows just how frustrating such an experience can be. When you’re trying to come up with a solution to a difficult issue, having creativity on your side is an absolute must. Listening to music helps to open up different avenues of the creative mind and promotes abstract thinking in ways that are otherwise difficult to match, all the while improving the amount of focus and attention one has to give to coming up with effective solutions. Less stress. No matter what industry one is a part of, running into stress throughout the workday is always a possibility. Some let stress really get to them, which can interrupt even the most productive of days and come along with a host of other negative effects. Listening to music can be a great way to reduce stress and improve mental clarity, ensuring that even the most hectic days don’t get to you or your employees. Blocked-out distractions. Even in the most streamlined of workplaces, distractions can pop up from time to time. Getting things done can be easier said than done when things are in your periphery, which is just one more music to have background music going while you work. Music gives you something to focus heavily upon, letting distractions fade away and increasing your ability to get the job done. What is “productive” music? There are a lot of people who might scoff at the motion that music increases productivity based upon their own personal experiences. After all, there are certain types of music that don’t foster better productivity in many people, some of which can even create distractions that are difficult to pull away from. Singer-songwriter music, for example, relies so heavily on lyrics to get the point across that it demands an amount of attention that most people can’t give when trying to tackle a project or important task. This is especially true for those who actually find themselves gravitating towards lyrically-heavy styles of music, as it’s tempting to sing along in such a case and just forget about everything else that’s happening in the periphery. So what exactly is “productive” music, then? Unfortunately, there’s no universal answer that applies to everyone. Each individual has their own set of criteria for music that makes them productive rather than distracts them. The music that sets one person into “work mode,” for example, might be utterly distracting (or even hard to listen to) for another. Sometimes, finding a particular style of music or artist/band that increases your own productivity can be a time-consuming process, especially if it’s not the kind of thing you’ve thought about in the past. All this said, there are a few common characteristics of certain musical stylings that lend themselves well to the workday, including the following: Allegro tempo. Anyone who has ever studied or played classical music is likely well aware of how often the Latin language pops up in sheet music and documentation, often in the form of tempo markings. The term “allegro” may not get thrown around on a daily basis, but many people don’t realize that a good deal of the music they listen to falls into this tempo category. Tempo is typically measured in Beats Per Minute, or BPM, with allegro tempo settling in between 120 and 140 BPM. This is the perfect tempo for productive music, as it sets things into motion without being distractingly fast or slow. Here’s an example of Classical Allegro: Instrumental. Vocals can make or break a piece of music. Think of a well-known, classic 80’s rock ballad, for example, and try to imagine what it would sound like without the iconic vocals on top. Perhaps because vocals can be so effective, they can also get in the way of productivity when you’re working. Instrumental music tends to be far less distracting, as there’s something about allowing your mind to drift instead of having to pay attention to lyrics and vocal melodies. Here’s some instrumental I listen to regularly: Groove / drone. There are a number of reasons why so many people listen to ambient/drone music while working. Repetition. Repetition helps to synchronize the brain so that it follows certain patterns. When you zone out to ambient or groove-based music, you’re essentially allowing your brain to go on autopilot in ways that are impossible to match otherwise. It’s similar in many ways to meditation and can help to increase clarity and focus throughout the day. Here’s some music that I go to when I’m in that creative mindset, cranking out work: Electronic music. The resurgence of electronica in modern pop music is impossible to deny, and it’s popular for a reason. Electronic music typically follows a pulse that can last for minutes or even hours without shifting, which is perfect for locking-in and getting work done. It also tends to be peppered with “ear candy;” think synthesizers, airtight percussion and powerful drops and breaks. Because of this, electronic music provides the listener with plenty to focus on while not actively causing any real distractions. Long length and playlists. When you’re listening to music to increase productivity, it’s important that your mind doesn’t have to bounce back and forth too much, which can be truly distracting. Short songs simply aren’t built for the workplace, as you’ll get much better results out of listening to lengthy pieces of music that don’t shift in tempo or feel. Jazz can be great for this purpose, although certain styles of the genre may be too involving to simply toss on as you work. Getting the most out of music for productivity. For a lot of people, finding that perfect piece of music that opens up the mind and increases productivity is an “ah-ha” moment. Sometimes, it happens without even thinking about it, but there are certain things that you can do to work towards dialing-in your own personal brand of productive music. Consider the following tips, each of which will help you to weed-out music that gets in the way of your workday rather than streamlines it. Consider internet radio. If there’s one thing that the Internet age is known for, it’s that obtaining and listening to music is easier than ever in the past and can now be done in the blink of an eye. Streaming is perfect for work, as it allows you to listen to practically any type of music you’d like to without having to download any of it to your work computer. Internet radio sites like Spotify and Pandora even allow you to input the names of your favorite bands or artists to create custom stations that appeal to your preferences, personalizing the listening experience and ensuring that you don’t end up running into music that will get in the way of your productivity throughout the course of the day. Switch-up your listening habits. One of the biggest problems faced by those who listen to music regularly is getting into a funk. Indeed, it’s more than possible to fall in love with a piece of music and then ruin the experience by listening to it too often. Switching things up every once in a while is essential if you want to avoid musical burnout, and it doesn’t mean you need to reinvent the wheel. No matter what genre you find yourself most aligned with, there are surely countless artists that you have yet to discover, so give yourself the chance! Don’t overlook your mood. Put simply, music and mood can either go hand-in-hand or clash with one another, depending upon which route you end up taking. Putting on a piece of music that goes against your mood certainly won’t help when it comes to productivity and may even end up getting in the way. If you’re feeling good, go with something high-energy to keep you moving. Otherwise, you might want to throw on something more somber and introspective. Know when to take a break. A lot of people listen to music all throughout the day, which can be effective for some. For others, however, this can result in “musical overload.” Ear fatigue is a real thing, and it can even serve to reverse the benefits on productivity that come along with the listening experience. Fortunately, it’s easy to identify the issue and remedy it. If you start getting the feeling that you’ve had enough music for a while, put down the headphones and enjoy a little silence. Be respectful of your coworkers. When you’re caught-up in a piece of music, it can be easy to forget about the people around you. This is especially important to keep in mind if you’re using speakers rather than headphones to listen to music, as you don’t want to bother your coworkers or interrupt their own productivity. And please don’t sing along to your music in the office, nobody likes that. Check-in with yourself every once in a while to ensure that you’re being mindful of the people around you, and always keep volumes at a respectable level. Experiment with different types of music. Searching for musical styles and genres that help to increase productivity can sometimes be a frustrating experience, especially for those who tend to listen to vocal-heavy music. There are countless different tempos, time signatures, grooves and feels that can influence one’s mindset in a multitude of ways, and finding the perfect fit for you can take some time. Don’t hesitate to experiment with different options, even if you feel as if you’ve stumbled upon the perfect solution. Keep an open mind. In offices that are comprised of individuals of many different age groups, it’s not uncommon to experience a disconnect when it comes to music. Simply put, baby boomers and millennials surely have overlapping tastes, but they also each have specific styles of music that tend to call to them more than others; electronic music is popular among young professionals, for example. Don’t forget, too, that much of today’s music is actually a mash-up of classic genres that have been around for decades, if not centuries. If you hear someone else’s music and it doesn’t connect with you, always keep an open mind and respect their preferences. Making your business more music-friendly. Running a business can be a difficult, often stressful experience. With all the time and effort many business owners put towards creating effective products and services and focusing on customer support, it can sometimes be easy to lose sight of just how important it is to create a pleasant work environment. Music, as one might imagine, can be an excellent tool for this. In order to make a business more music-friendly, there are a few important things that need to be taken into consideration. Encourage your employees to listen to music. In many scenarios, employees may not feel comfortable breaking out music during the workday, even if they’re wearing headphones. Encouragement from the senior level can be necessary in order to break down this barrier, and it will no doubt be appreciated. Explain the benefits of listening to music and how it relates to productivity, and allow employees the opportunity to take part if they’d like to at any point throughout the day. Listen communally. It’s not uncommon for those who work together to sometimes have very similar interests, and music is no exception. If you find that you and your employees are all on the same page taste-wise, there’s no harm in playing music over the stereo so that everyone can listen at the same time. Always ask your staff if everyone is alright with this before doing so, however, as there will undoubtedly be times when certain employees will prefer to not have music going while they work. Start a “house band.” Those who work in a small office setting and have musicians on staff can have a great deal of fun starting an office “house band.” You can delegate a portion of every Friday, for example, to having a jam at the end of the work day. This is not only a great team-building exercise, but can be an excellent way to keep your staff refreshed and ready to take on the next big task at hand. Make music available. There’s nothing better than getting great music recommendations from other people, as it’s truly the best way to learn about an artist or band you may have overlooked. Making music available in the office for people to borrow and listen to can add a lot of personality and serve as a point of conversation. If you’ve got a CD collection, bring it in and keep it out in the open, encouraging your staff to dig through and take a listen to whatever might suit their interests. Over and out … Music is as vast a world as any other, encompassing just about every human emotion that could possibly be felt and experienced. It’s one of those rare things that can range from being a simple pleasure for the casual listener, to a calling or career to the professional musician, and everything in between can hold an equal amount of power depending upon the individual. When you get into a habit of allowing music into your workday, the benefits that can come along with doing so become clear. What music makes you more productive? Let me know in the comments below.

      "content": "Boost Your Efficiency: The Best Music for Productivity Finding the right music can make a big difference in how well you work. Some types of music can help you focus better and get more done. In this article, we'll look at the best kinds of music to listen to if you want to be more productive. Key Takeaways Classical Music Classical music is a fantastic choice when you need to boost your productivity. The absence of lyrics in classical pieces helps you focus better, as words can often be distracting. This genre is known for its calming and relaxing effects, making it easier to concentrate on your tasks. One of the most famous theories related to classical music and productivity is the \"Mozart Effect.\" This theory suggests that listening to Mozart can enhance brain activity and improve health and well-being. While the \"Mozart Effect\" has been debated, many studies support the idea that classical music can help with tasks that require concentration and focus. Here are some classical music selections that can help you stay productive: Instrumental Music Instrumental music is a fantastic choice for boosting productivity. Without lyrics, it allows you to focus on your tasks without the distraction of words. This type of music is broad and includes many current interpretations of popular songs. Why Instrumental Music? Instrumental music is thought to help with focus by filling the silence without being too distracting. It provides a steady background that can help you stay on track with your work. Creating Your Playlist To create your own instrumental playlist, search for instrumental versions of your favorite songs. You can look for specific categories like \"instrumental indie music\" or artists like \"instrumental Taylor Swift.\" Here are some playlist suggestions: Benefits of Instrumental Music Final Thoughts Experiment with different types of instrumental music to find what works best for you. Whether it's classical, jazz, or modern covers, there's an instrumental track out there that can make your productivity skyrocket. Lo-Fi Beats Lo-fi, short for \"low-fidelity,\" is a genre that embraces imperfections to create a unique and relaxing sound. This type of music often features steady beats and minimal lyrics, making it perfect for enhancing productivity. The repetitive nature of lo-fi tracks can help you stay focused and calm, reducing anxiety and boosting creativity. Why Lo-Fi Works Creating Your Lo-Fi Playlist To get started with lo-fi, search your favorite music platform for popular playlists like \"Lo-Fi Focus Beats 2023,\" \"LoFi Coffee Shop,\" or simply \"Lo-Fi Beats.\" Add the tracks you enjoy to a personal playlist and let the music guide you through your tasks. Tips for Maximizing Productivity with Lo-Fi By incorporating lo-fi beats into your work routine, you can create a distraction-free workspace that enhances your focus and productivity. Give it a try and see how it transforms your workday! Ambient Sounds When it comes to boosting productivity, ambient sounds can be a game-changer. These sounds create a soothing background that helps you focus without being distracting. Think of waves crashing, birds chirping, or streams trickling. These sounds can help you relax and concentrate better. Benefits of Ambient Sounds Popular Ambient Sound Options Ready to find your perfect ambient sound? Try experimenting with different options to see what works best for you. Whether it's the sound of a babbling brook or the gentle hum of a coffee shop, there's an ambient sound out there that can help you boost your efficiency. Nature Sounds Nature sounds can be a fantastic way to boost productivity and mood. Listening to recordings of birds chirping and leaves rustling can help soothe frayed nerves and allow you to dive into deep work. A 2015 study by the Acoustical Society of America found that the sound of a flowing mountain stream boosted mood and productivity in workers in an open-plan office. However, the sample size was small, with only 12 participants. Further, a 2017 study by the University of Sussex found that nature sounds can help you relax if you’re highly stressed. Interestingly, for participants who were already relaxed, listening to nature sounds actually increased their stress levels. So maybe skip these playlists if you already feel calm! Here are some nature sound playlists to try: Film Scores Film scores are a fantastic way to boost productivity. These soundtracks are designed to evoke emotions and keep you engaged, making even the most mundane tasks feel epic. Listening to a grandiose film score can make you feel like you're on an adventure, which can be incredibly motivating. Why Film Scores Work Film scores are composed to support the narrative of a movie, which means they are crafted to hold your attention and evoke specific emotions. This makes them perfect for maintaining focus and enhancing your mood while working. The absence of lyrics ensures that you won't be distracted by words, allowing you to concentrate better on your tasks. Recommended Film Scores Here are some film scores that I find particularly effective for boosting productivity: Creating Your Playlist To get started, create a playlist with some of these recommended scores. You can find them on various music streaming platforms. Mix and match different scores to see which ones resonate with you the most. Remember, the goal is to find music that helps you stay focused and motivated. Final Thoughts Experiment with different film scores to find what works best for you. Everyone's preferences are different, so take the time to discover the music that helps you concentrate and feel inspired. Happy listening! Jazz Jazz is a fantastic genre for boosting productivity. Its soothing melodies and improvised solos can create a perfect atmosphere for focused work. I often find myself tuning into jazz when I need to concentrate deeply. One of my favorite playlists is \"Jazz for Work.\" This elegant collection features the refined sound of jazz icons and contemporary talents. It helps me unleash my concentration and inspires creativity. Why Jazz Works Jazz music often features complex rhythms and harmonies that can stimulate the brain without being too distracting. The improvisational nature of jazz keeps it interesting, which can help maintain focus over longer periods. Recommended Jazz Pieces Here are some of my favorite jazz pieces to listen to while working: These tracks offer a mix of soothing and upbeat tunes that can help you stay engaged and productive. Electronic Music Electronic music is a fantastic choice for boosting productivity. Its steady beats and repetitive rhythms can help you stay focused and energized throughout your workday. Here are some reasons why electronic music might be the perfect addition to your productivity playlist: If you haven't tried electronic music while working, give it a shot. You might find it to be the perfect background music for your most productive days. Binaural Beats Binaural beats are a fascinating way to boost your brain power and enhance productivity. When you listen to these beats, your brain hears two slightly different frequencies in each ear, creating a third tone that helps you focus. How Binaural Beats Work Binaural beats work by sending two different frequencies to each ear. Your brain then processes these frequencies and creates a third tone, known as a binaural beat. This process can help improve cognitive function and enhance mood. Benefits of Binaural Beats Listening to binaural beats not only enhances mood but improves cognitive function. These are terrific sound therapy waves for relaxing your mind. Here are some key benefits: How to Use Binaural Beats To get the most out of binaural beats, follow these simple steps: Recommended Binaural Beats Playlists Here are some playlists to get you started: Focus Playlists When it comes to boosting productivity, focus playlists are a game-changer.

Insights Â Â âºÂ Â Â Music Psychologies How Music Affects the Mood Brain scans and psychological research are discovering the mechanisms that lead to mood changes or mood regulation that are associated with music. Table of Contents Heading 2 Related Reading Music can increase focus, help to manage stress, or improve mood during times of sadness. It has long been understood that music impacts our feelings and mood, but the reasons for that impact have not been studied until very recently. Now, brain scans and psychological research are discovering how the mechanisms that lead to mood changes or mood regulation are associated with music. Why Do We Listen to Music? In a psychological survey conducted in 2013 examining the reasons why people listen to music, the analysis found that people listen to music to: The first two reasons in this list were found to be more important than the third. Music was reported to be deeply personal, often used in the foreground as a way of improving motivation or focus, or used in the background as a means of regulating mood and easing stress. Using music as a method of relating to friends or family, identifying culturally, or expressing oneself to peers was less common. Most psychological studies involving music have been conducted on people in the westernized world, but some cross-cultural studies have found that unfamiliar music from other cultures can still be interpreted in similar ways. For example, Western listeners could tell whether a song was intended to be happy or sad even when it was from an unfamiliar culture like Navajo Native American or Hindustani. A survey conducted of people in a remote tribe living in Cameroon found that most listeners easily identified when Western music was happy or sad. For example, listeners agreed that when songs were soft or slow, they were supposed to reflect sadness; jaunty and fast-paced music at a moderate volume was interpreted as happy. It seems that, across cultures, certain features of music are common to all experiences, suggesting that they developed in similar ways to regulate or inspire similar emotional experiences. Â How the Reward System and Dopamine Relate to Music One of the first studies on the emotional association with music was conducted by Leonard Meyer in 1956. Meyer analyzed the fifth movement in Beethovenâs masterpiece, String Quartet in C-sharp major, Op. 131. After examining the tonal changes and measures, Meyer concluded that creating unfulfilled expectations caused suspense and tension in the listener, which leads to the emotional response to fulfilled expectations. Listening to music triggers physical changes that indicate emotional arousal. For example, listening to our favorite songs will make us happy, which is indicated by the following: The cerebellum is highly activated by our favorite songs, triggering increased blood flow to the legs. This may be part of why dance is so closely associated with nearly every genre of music. The region of the brain most impacted by almost every type of music in the world is also the area that makes us want to move, even if this is just tapping our feet or bobbing our heads. One study conducted by Montreal researchers closely examined the brains of 217 volunteers, looking for people who experienced âchillsâ when listening to music. They narrowed the group down to 10 study subjects and then watched that groupâs brains as they listened to playlists of their favorite songs. Though the group was small, the playlists stretched across dozens of genres, representing a wide range of music tastes. Images from the brains of these 10 participants found that favorite music releases dopamine in two places in the brain: the dorsal and ventral striatum. These areas typically light up from pleasurable stimuli, whether it is a hug or a drug; however, the team concluded that music could effectively trigger this release as well. The Montreal research team also found that listening to favorite music caused an âanticipatory effect,â similar to a Pavlovian response of excitement. This effect occurred during familiar, expected, but enjoyed swells or changes in the songs. This anticipation effect was also found in people who were unfamiliar with the song, but who expected certain patterns in the music that did not pay off until later or even at the end of the song. Emotional Perception When Listening to Music In 2012, a research team at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands found that music deeply impacted what the listeners perceived were their emotions. The two lead psychologists asked participants to rank their happiness or sadness using emoticons. They found that, while listening to music, participants rarely used the neutral facial expression response even when no smiling emoticon was shown as an option. They concluded that this represented a âtop-downprocessâin the brain, when the mind interprets something about the world that is not inherently there. The most common example of this is when you interpret something about your surroundings based on what you see. The 2012 research found that there was an emotional top-down process, similar to the visual top-down process, which occurred when examining oneâs own emotions. Another study compared songbirds experiencing bird songs to humans experiencing music. They found that both birds and humans experienced changes in their amygdala with some kinds of music. For birds, the songs were discordant, while for humans, the music was categorized as âmelancholyâ or about âunrequited love.â Songs that triggered a rush of limerence or new love tapped into the mesolimbic reward system in both humans and birds. Yet another 2012 study, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, reported that ambient noise at a moderate volume of about 70 decibels, which is about the volume of a vacuum cleaner, could improve creativity. Listening to louder noise than that, however, reduced creativity through distraction. Music without lyrics could be a form of ambient, soothing noise to improve not just mood, but also productivity and creativity. A study conducted in 2013 reported that people who listened to upbeat music improved their moods and happiness, in the long term, within two weeks. The first of two listed studies found that listening to 12 minutes of music associated with positive mood intentionally elevated mood compared to a group who listened to any music without focusing on improving their mood. In the second study, participants were instructed to listen to music with a happy valence. One group was told to intentionally improve their mood while listening, and the other group was not given other instructions. Those in the second study who were told to focus on being happier while listening to happy music reported greater elevation in mood compared to the other group. Music Reduces Stress Repeated studies have shown that music can reduce the experience of stress and improve overall well-being. Listening to music has been associated with direct effects on physiological aspects of stress. Study participants showed lower cortisol levels, heart rate, and blood pressure when they listened to music, helping to calm the body and promote relaxation. In addition, a meta-analysis of various studies on the connection between music and stress relief found that music had a psychological effect on stress in addition to a psychological effect. Study participants experienced improvements in worry, anxiety, and restlessness when they listened to music. It's widely accepted that listening to music is a good strategy to manage stress, emotions, and overall mood. Music as Therapy Music has many benefits in therapeutic settings, including the use of music in standard clinical settings as well as specialized music therapy. Music can calm anxiety, lessen the experience of pain, and distract patients from uncomfortable aspects of a clinical visit or procedure. It can also improve mood and increase empathy in caregivers. In these instances, music is a low-cost intervention that can improve experiences for patients, clinicians, and caregivers. Specialized music therapy involves using music â listening to it, creating it, or thinking about it â to improve well-being. Therapists may incorporate various aspects of music into sessions with clients in either individual or group settings. The incorporation of music into sessions may enable clients to express themselves more openly, find new areas of emotional release, and better process emotions. Music therapy can benefit a variety of mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Music Ignites Passion & Imagination Thereâs no question that listening to music is a universal experience with various benefits to both physical and mental health. It can be used in a variety of settings to ease stress, inspire confidence, and increase productivity. Music can have a deep impact on mood, and this can easily affect overall quality of life.
