Salud y Belleza Minoristas Hospitalidad Comunidad Blog 5 Rockbot Alternatives for the Perfect Music Atmosphere To take your business to the next level, start by rethinking your approach to background music. Research shows that playing the right soundtrack won’t just improve your business’s atmosphere—it can actively boost sales and elevate your customer experience. For consumers, streaming music is easy. However, playing music in a business setting requires special licenses, and compliant platforms can be surprisingly limited in their song selection and available features. According to Music Business Worldwide, 78% of small to midsize businesses in the U.S. are misusing music, but that doesn’t mean your company should follow suit. If your business plays music without the right licenses, it could run into serious legal consequences. The best option for business owners looking to play music in their establishments is to sign up for a commercial music streaming platform. Rockbot is a popular option in this category, but it may not be the right choice for your business needs. Before committing to this service, take some time to explore a few alternatives. We’ve compiled a list of some of the strongest competitors to help you choose the right Rockbot alternative for your business. Let’s dive in. Posted on 14 de mayo de 2024 Why Is Music Important to My Business? For restaurants, bars, grocery stores, hotels, gyms, and many other businesses, taking background music seriously can lead to all sorts of advantages. The benefits start with a more pleasant experience for customers—one CNN article stated that 83% of all U.S. shoppers enjoy in-store music. A pleasant music experience is especially appreciated by shoppers in the 18-24 age range, with 91% reporting they enjoy it. Along with that, our own research suggests that restaurants can see sales increase by 4.8% when they play a soundtrack that fits their brand, compared to stores that play no music. However, merely playing music isn’t enough—you’ll also need to approach song selection from an analytical perspective. For example, while playing random hits may seem like a winning strategy, a study published in the Journal of Business Research found that customers are less likely to focus on what stores have for sale while listening to popular songs. To avoid pitfalls like these, businesses need a music solution that offers a data-driven approach to background music. What Is Rockbot? Rockbot has been a popular name in the world of enterprise media since 2009. In addition to its commercial music, Rockbot offers audio messaging and professional video solutions such as digital signage and TV programming. Pros and Cons of Rockbot Rockbot’s music streaming service is a popular choice for businesses, and it delivers some advantages. For example, this service includes real-time music control through an iOS/Android app, an optional plug-and-play media player, and Rockbot Request, which allows customers to request songs. That said, Rockbot has some key limitations. In comparison to many of its competitors Rockbot boasts a catalog of only 16 million songs, a fraction of the songs available from some of the leading competing services. Its request feature allows a user to have only five songs in the queue at a time, and the service charges an extra charge of $25 per month for the feature. Along with that, Rockbot does not offer on-demand music streaming, provides a limited selection of ready-made playlists, and handles business licensing only in the U.S. and Canada. 5 Rockbot Alternatives Since Rockbot has some shortcomings, it’s wise to explore a few Rockbot competitors before choosing a streaming service. This is a competitive field, and you want to find a commercial streaming service that can give you all the flexibility, licensing, and playlist support you need with all the music you want on demand. 1. Soundtrack Soundtrack has one of the most extensive music catalogs in the industry, offering users access to more than 100 million songs. Additionally, it’s the only commercial streaming service to offer on-demand streaming, allowing you to play what you want, when you want. The service also offers worldwide licensing, including crucial licenses for businesses in 74 countries. Helpful features include the ability to schedule playlists, filter explicit tracks, block songs, import playlists directly from Spotify, and seamlessly weave in-store messaging into the soundtrack. In addition to giving users the freedom to hand-craft playlists from scratch, it’s the first service to offer an AI Playlist Generator, allowing you to create hours-long playlists that match your brand needs from a simple text prompt. 2. SiriusXM for Business As its brand name suggests, SiriusXM for Business includes satellite radio stations and artist stations from SiriusXM subsidiary Pandora, as well as over 200 playlists. On the other hand, this service is only available in the USA and does not offer on-demand streaming. However, it does offer in-store messaging functionality. 3. Pandora for Business Unlike SiriusXM for Business, Pandora for Business (also known as Pandora CloudCover) primarily focuses on offering Pandora’s internet radio channels to businesses. Unfortunately, Pandora for Business offers relatively limited songs and playlists, lacks on-demand streaming, and does not provide music licensing outside of the U.S. and Canada. 4. Mood Media Like Rockbot, Mood Media (alternatively, “Mood:Media”) offers both commercial music streaming and services such as in-store signage. However, Mood Media offers only 1 million licensed songs (while other services offer roughly 10 times that number) and doesn’t allow businesses to play music on demand or import playlists from Spotify. 5. TouchTunes TouchTunes focuses on digital jukeboxes rather than a catalog of ready-made playlists music streaming for business solutions. Because of that, this is not a fit for many businesses interested in taking control of their soundtracks and enjoying a full range of music control functionalities. Choosing the Right Rockbot Alternative for Your Business By now, you’ve had a chance to look at the various Rockbot competitor options available to your business. To pick one of these services for your music streaming needs, consider factors like: Choice of Music Today, businesses commonly use playlists for their soundtracks—but there’s no reason you shouldn’t have the power to play whatever songs you want. For that, you’ll need a service that offers a sufficiently large catalog and on-demand music selection. Curated Playlists and Stations Since playlists serve a crucial role in enterprise music streaming, you’ll want to have a wide selection of music curation options at your disposal. Premium commercial streaming services deliver thousands of playlists and custom station features, which may vary depending on the pricing tier. Licensing If your business wants to play music in a public setting, it needs licenses from performing rights organizations (PROs) like ASCAP, BMI and GMR. Your streaming service should include these licenses so you don’t have to spend the time, effort, and increased expense of procuring them independently. AI Music Playlist Generator When your streaming service offers an AI-driven playlist generator, you can generate as many playlists as you want for scheduling, dayparts, unique experiences, and special events. Using this feature is as easy as typing in a description of the playlist you want, and in a few seconds you’ll have your results. Spotify Playlist Importing Although it’s not legal to use Spotify music streaming for business needs, you may want to import a playlist from their service. If your streaming service supports Spotify playlist importing, you may be able to add your curated music playlists, extend them, and create “similar music” stations, depending on the service. Additional Features Along with the perks listed above, your business’s streaming service should come with a robust service lineup. Services you might need include explicit lyrics filtering and playlist scheduling. Business Music Streaming FAQs Can I use Spotify to stream music in my business? Many people use Spotify for personal music streaming, but this service isn’t intended for commercial use. If you’re looking for a Spotify-like service that has been made with businesses in mind, give Soundtrack a try. The company was originally named “Spotify for Business,” and we still offer Spotify playlist importing today. Can I use Apple Music in my business? A few years ago, this might have been an option, but that’s not how it works today. Apple tested an offering called “Apple Music for Business\" with PlayNetwork to provide a commercial music streaming service in 2019. However, in 2021 Apple ceased offering the service with PlayWork. Apple’s terms of service specifically state that you cannot use Apple Music for business or commercial use. Start Streaming (Legally) Today After you’ve taken all of these factors into consideration, Soundtrack stands out as the best Rockbot alternative on the market.

      "content": "AI Music Platforms: Revolutionizing Music Discovery and Curation Understanding the Concept of AI Music Platforms What are AI Music Platforms? AI Music Platforms utilise Artificial Intelligence to fundamentally alter how music is explored, created and curated. These platforms can generate music autonomously or collaboratively with human intervention. They use machine learning algorithms that are trained on large datasets of music. This allows the AI to understand the patterns and structures within various music genres and styles, enabling it to create new compositions or suggest music as per user preferences. The Pillars of AI in Music The integration of AI in music rests upon three primary pillars. Firstly, exploration refers to the use of AI technology to discover new tunes according to the listener’s taste and mood. The second pillar, composition, involves utilising AI for the creation of original soundtracks, melodies, and beats. The final pillar, curation, involves AI’s ability to create automated playlists based on trends, personal preferences, or specific themes. AI Music Platform Capabilities AI Music Platforms have several incredible capabilities. They can generate original compositions, assist in music production by creating unique beats and soundscapes, and help users discover new music according to their tastes and moods. Some AI platforms can even dynamically modify music based on user feedback in real-time. They can effectively learn and adapt to consumer behavior and preferences, enhancing the user experience. This is typically achieved through the use of deep learning neural networks, which mimic the neuron structure of the human brain, enabling the AI to “learn” from patterns and experiences. The Intersection of AI and Music Discovery AI’s Role in Recognizing Musical Patterns Artificial intelligence (AI) has a unique ability to process large datasets, discovering patterns and correlations far more efficiently than humans. When we apply this to the realm of music, AI can analyze millions of songs from various genres, time periods, and geographies to identify common elements. These patterns could range from chord progressions and melodic structures to lyrical themes and beat patterns. This analysis provides an enormous dataset for AI to predict and recommend what listeners might like next, based on their previous choices. Machine Learning in Music Recommendation Algorithms One key way that AI intersects with musical discovery is through machine learning music recommendation algorithms. Platforms such as Spotify and Pandora utilize these complex technologies to enhance their users’ musical experience. These algorithms learn from each user’s listening habits, including the songs they play repeatedly, the artists they favor, and even the music they skip, providing personalized recommendations. Additionally, they consider factors such as tempo, rhythm, key, and instruments used to recommend similar sounding music, thereby automating the discovery process. User Interaction and AI-driven Music Curation The confluence of AI and music discovery takes its form not just in suggesting new songs or artists, but also in curating personalized playlists based on mood, activity, and preference—far beyond the capabilities of human curation. Furthermore, AI advances have led to music platforms becoming more interactive. Chatbots, powered by AI, allow users to explain in natural language the kind of music they’re in the mood for. The AI then processes this input and delivers a curated selection of tracks, marking a new era in music discovery. How AI is Reinventing Music Curation AI-Powered Music Recommendation Systems Artificial Intelligence is playing an increasingly significant role in reshaping the way music is curated for listeners. AI-powered recommendation systems, such as those used by Spotify, YouTube Music, and Apple Music, provide personalized suggestions based on users’ listening history and preferences. These sophisticated algorithms analyze millions of data points, including genre, artist similarity, and even song elements like tempo, rhythm, and key, offering a highly tailored playlist to each individual user. Through machine learning, these systems can adapt over time. They learn from every interaction, creating an ongoing cycle of refinement. The more a user engages with the system, the better the recommendations become, resulting in a truly personalized listening experience. Neural Networks and Music Classification AI technology has also paved the way for advanced music classification. Neural networks, a form of machine learning, are being used to categorize music into specific genres, moods, or thematic playlists. This technology can analyze a song’s characteristics, break down its sounds and beats, and categorize it accordingly. For example, Moodagent and Musimap are two AI-powered platforms that sort music based on mood and emotion, allowing users to find the perfect track for their current sentiment. This innovative approach provides a new level of depth to music curation, making it possible to curate playlists based on emotions or situations. AI in Music Discovery and Exploration Lastly, AI is revolutionizing music discovery and exploration. Traditional music search engines often require explicit inputs like artist name, song title, or lyrics. In contrast, AI-powered platforms can suggest new songs or artists based on abstract inputs, such as mood, situation, or personal preference. Services like SoundHound allow users to hum or sing a melody, which AI then matches to a song in its database. Elsewhere, platforms like Jukin’ are employing AI to detect and suggest similar artists or tracks based not only on musical style but also on nuanced characteristics like lyrical theme or instrumentation. This sophisticated approach not only enhances the music discovery process but also facilitates the exploration of new genres and artists, creating a virtually limitless landscape for listeners to traverse at their own pace. Case Studies: Popular AI Music Platforms in Action Exploring the Domains of AI Music: Amper Music Amper Music, an AI-driven music platform, has revolutionized content creation by empowering businesses, content creators, and individuals to produce bespoke soundtracks in minutes. The platform uses AI capabilities to understand the user’s needs and generate customized soundtracks, thus eliminating licensing hurdles. In a case study with a media firm, Amper Music enabled them to create a distinct audio brand identity, whilst also saving substantial money and time usually spent on music licensing. Jukin Media and Jukin: Pioneering AI Music Platforms Curation Another standout example of AI Music Platforms is Jukin Media, that leverages its proprietary technology, Jukin, for intelligent music curation. This AI platform identifies audience preferences, tailors playlists accordingly, and improves music discovery. For instance, a popular restaurant chain used Jukin’s services to curate background music. The AI analyzed the chain’s customer demographics and designed a unique, crowd-pleasing playlist, which led to increased customer engagement and better in-store ambiance. The Power of AI in Songwriting: OpenAI’s MuseNet OpenAI’s MuseNet highlights the promising interplay of AI and music in crafting compositions. MuseNet can generate original songs in as many as 15 different styles, seamlessly blending genres like rock, pop, and classical. One case study demonstrated its creative prowess when MuseNet was prompted to generate a melody in the style of a Mozart-meets-The Beatles piece. The resulting composition not only captured the unique nuances of both musical styles but also underscored the infinite possibilities offered by AI in music creation. The Impact of AI on the Music Industry AI and Music Creation Artificial Intelligence (AI) has completely redefined the concept of music creation and production. With AI algorithms capable of generating unique melodies, rhythms, and harmonies, artists can now leverage these technologies to spark creativity or even compose entire tracks. Notable examples include AI tools such as Amper Music, AIVA, and OpenAI’s MuseNet that create original compositions across various styles and genres. But it’s not all about replacing human creativity. AI also facilitates co-creation where musicians interact with intelligent machines to tap into new realms of creativity. This combination allows for the generation of novel sounds and musical structures, pushing the boundaries of conventional music creation. AI in Music Discovery and Curation In the realm of music discovery, AI-powered platforms like Spotify and Pandora have revolutionized the way users find and engage with music. These platforms employ complex algorithms that analyze user preferences, behaviors, and social networks to recommend songs and curate personalized playlists. AI does not only streamline music discovery process for listeners, but also provides independent artists with a platform to reach new audiences. Additionally, AI aids in creating dynamic radio stations, where the song selection is optimized to a listener’s taste in real time. Hence, AI plays a vital role in improving the music discovery experience, making it more tailored and immersive. AI in Music Marketing and Monetization AI is also paving the way for innovative marketing strategies in music industry. It can analyze vast amounts of listener data to predict trends, helping artists and record labels to better understand their audience and devise effective marketing campaigns. Moreover, AI is being used to drive monetization in the music industry. Platforms such as LANDR are democratizing music production by offering AI-powered mastering services at affordable prices. On the other hand, blockchain-based AI platforms, like Utopia Music, are working to streamline royalty payments and rights management, ensuring artists get paid fairly for their work. From generating new music to redefining discovery and marketing, AI is making waves in the music industry. It is not only transforming how music is created, consumed, and commercialized but also opening up exciting new possibilities for artists and listeners alike. Challenges and Opportunities of AI in Music Difficulties in Emulating Human Creativity AI, despite its numerous capabilities, still faces challenges when it comes to emulating human creativity. Unlike humans, AI is not inherently capable of understanding the emotional complexity and cultural nuances embedded in music. Creating music is an intrinsic human activity correlated with emotions, experiences, and the social context of the creator. AI lacks these personal experiences and emotional intelligence, making it difficult to create compositions that can resonate on the same level as human-created music. The Technological Learning Curve Adopting AI in the music industry implies a significant learning curve for many individuals involved in the creation and distribution process. Artists, producers, and other professionals need to familiarize themselves with the technology and the ways it can be used to augment their work. This poses a challenge as it requires time, resources, and willingness to adapt to newer methods of doing things. Machine Learning and Copyright Infringement Another challenge arises in the form of copyright infringement. The current models of AI in music work primarily through machine learning, studying patterns in existing pieces of music to generate new compositions. This raises the question of whether an AI-generated piece composed from previously copyrighted works infringes upon those copyrights. There is a legitimate concern about fair use and the protection of original works, and legal policies must evolve to accommodate and regulate this new era of music creation powered by AI. The Potential of AI in Personalized Music Curation Despite these challenges, AI also presents significant opportunities for the music industry. One such opportunity lies in personalized music curation. AI, through its advanced algorithms, can analyze a listener’s preferences and behavior to curate a personalized playlist. This not only enhances the listening experience for the user but also provides artists with valuable insights into their audience’s preferences, enabling them to create more targeted and engaging content. Improving Accessibility and Democratizing Music Creation Additionally, AI has the potential to democratize music creation by making it accessible to a broader audience. With AI-based tools and platforms, anyone can create music without having a formal background in music or access to expensive production equipment. This can revolutionize how music is produced and who gets to participate in the creation process. Revolutionizing the A&R Process AI could transform the Artist and Repertoire (A&R) process. The task of discovering and nurturing new talent is time-consuming and relies heavily on human intuition. AI could streamline this process by using data-driven approaches to identify potential stars based on their music, lyrics, and social media interactions. This has the potential to reduce bias and give opportunities to diverse and unconventional talents. Despite the challenges, the future of AI in music looks promising. With the right approach, these challenges can morph into exciting opportunities for innovation and growth in the music industry. The Future Outlook: AI and the Evolution of Music Platforms Revolutionizing Music Discovery with AI Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to drastically change the way we discover and consume music. Through machine learning algorithms, AI can analyze a user’s listening habits, offering increasingly personalized suggestions based on the listener’s unique preferences. More than solely suggesting individual songs, AI has the potential to curate playlists that mirror a user’s mood, activity, or even time of day. Furthermore, new tools are being developed that harness AI’s enormous computational power to analyze entire music libraries in seconds, revealing patterns and connections that would be otherwise impossible to spot. This could open up entirely new ways of discovering music, as users can explore their favorite genres in unprecedented depth or navigate unfamiliar musical landscapes with ease. The Rise of AI-Generated Music The boundary between human creativity and artificial intelligence becomes ever more blurred as AI starts composing music. Using complex algorithms, these AI technologies can compose original pieces in a wide variety of styles, from classical symphonies to catchy pop tunes. This doesn’t mean that human composers will become obsolete – far from it. Instead, AI could serve as a powerful tool for musicians, providing fresh inspiration and helping them generate new ideas quickly. Furthermore, AI-generated music could fill niches where traditional composition is impractical, such as creating bespoke background scores for video games or films. Streamlining Music Curation and Distribution AI has the potential to revolutionize not just the discovery and creation of music, but also its curation and distribution. AI-driven platforms can allow artists to distribute their music directly to fans, eliminating the need for middlemen and providing a much-needed boost to the struggling artist economy. Additionally, AI could automate the process of curating music for different platforms, making the task less subjective and more reliable. This technology could, for example, recognize the characteristics that make a song suitable for a workout playlist, a relaxing evening mix, or a high-energy party soundtrack. The potential is vast and only beginning to be tapped into as AI continues to evolve in the music industry. Looking for a trusted and knowledgeable agency to help market your music career?

Yet, rising subscription costs, limited Hi-Res audio options, and increased competition have prompted many to explore alternatives that better suit their needs. For those seeking features like lossless audio, curated indie music, or cost-effective plans, several compelling options are gaining popularity. In this article, we’ll explore the 9 best Spotify alternatives in 2025, highlighting their unique offerings, pricing, and key advantages. Let’s dive in and find the perfect platform for your listening preferences! Why Look for a Spotify Alternative? Spotify is undoubtedly a leader among music streaming platforms, but it’s not without its drawbacks. As user needs evolve, many are considering competitors that better align with their preferences for affordability, audio quality, and unique features. Whether you're looking to discover new music, enjoy uninterrupted playlists, or explore podcasts and audiobooks, there are plenty of reasons to consider alternatives to Spotify Premium. Here’s a closer look: Subscription Costs Spotify Premium has seen subscription price increases, prompting budget-conscious users to explore more affordable options. Platforms like Amazon Music and Pandora often provide competitive pricing and bundled deals with services like Amazon Prime, making them attractive choices for listeners looking to save. High-Quality Audio Options Audiophiles seeking superior sound quality often find Spotify lacking in formats like FLAC or spatial audio options like Dolby Atmos. Competing platforms cater to this demand, offering lossless audio and immersive listening experiences that elevate their library of songs and playlists. Ads on Free Plans The frequent ads on Spotify’s free tier disrupt the listening experience, leading users to seek ad-free alternatives. Services with fewer or no ads allow for uninterrupted playlists, podcasts, and even radio stations, providing a smoother way to listen. Exclusive Content Some music streaming platforms prioritize exclusive tracks, music videos, or features like synced lyrics that cater to an artist-first approach. These unique offerings make exploring new music and recommendations feel more personalized and rewarding. User Interface and Features Not all users find Spotify's interface intuitive. Competitors often provide simplicity, curated playlists, and additional features like personalized skips, song lyrics, or integrated audiobooks, offering an overall more satisfying experience. By exploring alternative streaming platforms, users can discover a service tailored to their individual needs—whether it’s better subscription pricing, richer sound quality, exclusive content, or simply a fresh way to engage with their favorite songs and artists. Key Features to Look for in a Spotify Alternative Choosing the right music streaming platform involves evaluating features that align with your listening preferences and lifestyle. Here are the essential elements to consider when exploring Spotify alternatives: Audio Quality: If sound quality is a priority, look for platforms that offer options like HiFi, lossless audio, or high-resolution formats. Features like HD or Ultra HD sound can provide an immersive experience far superior to standard streaming quality. Offline Listening Capabilities: The ability to download playlists, albums, or individual tracks is essential for uninterrupted listening without relying on data. This feature is particularly useful for frequent travelers or users in areas with limited connectivity. Platform Compatibility: Ensure the service is compatible with the devices you use most frequently, such as smartphones, tablets, computers, smart TVs, or voice-controlled assistants. Broad compatibility enhances accessibility and allows seamless transitions across devices. Music Discovery and Personalization: Advanced music discovery tools are a key feature, enabling you to explore new artists and genres effortlessly. Look for services with curated playlists, mood-based recommendations, or algorithms that adapt to your listening habits to deliver a tailored experience. Pricing and Subscription Options: Review the pricing tiers available, including free, ad-supported versions and premium subscriptions. Consider features included at each level, such as family or student plans, and assess how they fit within your budget. Additional Features: Beyond basic music streaming, explore options like access to podcasts, artist interviews, and editorial content. Features like playlist creation and sharing or song lyrics can enhance your overall experience. 9 Best Spotify Alternatives in 2025 1.

      "content": "THE REAL GUIDE ABOUT SUBMISSION PLATFORMS: MAY 24th, 2023 - WRITTEN BY JORDI ESQUERRA This is not another fancy and superficial article about the coolest submission platforms to send your music. This is a serious guide, written word by word by a real person, to offer a broader perspective about the playlists/submission platforms subworld, whether you have used them before or not. For those unfamiliar with Vibey Curator, I’m a Barcelona-based music blogger, curator and artist/producer. I’m 100% independent and have no interest in promoting any particular service. The following text does include some personal preferences but I did my best to be as objective as possible. I wrote this guide to help artists to get familiar with it, avoid frustration, wasting money and bust some myths about it. I’ve experienced most platforms from both sides, as an artist and curator, so I think it will provide some valuable insights. From talking with artists and from my own experience, I realized that often bad experiences come from having wrong expectations, using the wrong submission platform for your interests, or not properly filtering curators and influencers. I’ll start by clarifying that I wrote the following tips assuming that the sound quality of your track is up to industry standards, which is a key factor for success 99% of the time. Also, I’m assuming that your goal as an artist is not simply to get a lot of streams, but high-quality streams. So I will simply ignore any kind of “hundreds of thousands of streams guaranteed” model, as it is directly against Spotify terms of service. Also results are usually obtained by fraudulent/artificial streams that might lead to your track being removed from the streaming platform itself. It has happened before. You can skip the following paragraphs if you are already familiar with streaming platforms’ algorithms and what high-quality streams are, otherwise here you have a brief explanation: The ultimate goal of any streaming platform’s algorithm, like any social network, is to find the perfect content (songs) to suggest to each particular user to keep them engaged and hooked to the platform. So algorithms are constantly tracking behaviour, how users interact with each particular song and the actions that the song triggers in the listener to evaluate how well a track works in different scenarios and who its potential audience is. It determines that a song works well when: it has a low skip ratio, it often leads to people saving the song, adding it to personal playlists, listening again, visiting your artist profile and, more importantly, clicking the follow button on your artist profile. While its potential audience is generally determined by the environment where your music is consumed, the place where listeners discover your track and which other artists are featured there, the interests/artists that the people who liked the song have in common, etc. If the algorithm decides that your track works really well and has good engagement, it will determine that it is worthwhile to suggest it to a larger portion of its potential audience by adding it to algorithmic playlists. Additionally, it will improve your reputation as an artist with the algorithm for future releases. The people behind editorial playlists see all this kind of data, so it's easy for them to see which songs are standing out. Therefore, it is really important to put your music in front of the right audience. These are high-quality streams: streams from fans of the artists that influenced your music who will be more likely to engage better with your track and your artist profile and teach the algorithm that your music is really good while associating you with those artists. Getting featured in playlists that have nothing to do with your music will highly increase the chances of low-quality streams: listeners not actively interacting with your song, or worse, directly skipping your track, or associating you with the wrong artists or low-quality artists. Ok, back to submission platforms. There are mainly two models to submit for playlist consideration through submission platforms. I call them the “Drop by drop” model and the “Full campaign” model. Generally each platform is focused on one particular model, although some are offering both (or sort of). “DROP BY DROP” MODEL: The artist/representative manually picks each curator and spends a very small budget for each one. The most popular platforms are SubmitHub, Groover,... Pros: Full control over your budget and the capacity to manually filter which curators / playlists are relevant to your music. Cheaper. Lower price per submission and freedom to spend only a few bucks. Some even allow you to send your music for free. Add a human touch to your submissions, customize messages and create human relationships. Higher presence of curators/playlists representing indie and not-much-popular music styles, so more relevant curators for that kind of artists. Therefore, better chances of high-quality streams. Cons: It requires a little more time from your side. As the artist gets more involved in the task, it may generate more frustration when rejected. Lower approval rate. Despite it isn’t necessarily a bad thing. More on that. “FULL CAMPAIGN” MODEL: The artists/representatives buy a campaign package and get their music sent to a bunch of curators chosen by the platform. The most popular ones would probably be PlaylistPush, SoundCampaign,... Pros: It requires a minimal amount of time. Usually leads to a larger amount of streams. Higher approval rate. Better results for lower-quality songs. Often platforms filter the most negative feedback so artists don’t read it. Good results for some highly popular genres, sometimes even excellent results. Some huge playlists are only present here, as income per song for curators may be substantially higher in contrast with drop by drop platforms. Cons: They usually require a bigger initial investment as the minimum campaign cost may range between $100 to $300. No control over where your budget goes and how properly it is used. More expensive, as they tend to pay more to curators per review. It may lead to wrong targeting and low-quality streams, as curator filtering is often unrefined and, in some platforms, curators are rewarded for approving songs regardless of the quality / genre match of the track. Lower presence of curators/playlists representing indie or not-very-popular music styles. So usually lower quality streams for those kinds of artists. MY ADVICE / RECOMMENDATION: This might get me kicked from some platforms but the truth is that the “drop by drop” model is the only one I feel comfortable recommending under any circumstances. Especially for the genres I’m focusing on in my blog and playlists. While it can’t be ignored that the “full campaign model” is delivering good results, and sometimes even amazing, for some artists, in my opinion the overall model is not trustworthy enough. Platforms are constantly evolving though, so this might change over time. The drop by drop model is more transparent and you can get excellent results with a very small budget if you have a good “product”. Given that, no better way to send \"drop by drop\" than submitting directly to a curator if they have a dedicated submission page on their website. Here you have mine in case you are curious. This method has some advantages over using a submission platform: If you submit a track to me using a submission platform it would cost you typically $4. SubmitHub for example would keep $2 and pay $2 to the curator, the one who actually does the job. DailyPlaylist is more generous, they would keep $1.5 and pay $2.5 to the curator. But if you use my direct submission page, instead of $4, it would cost you 3.25€ and 100% goes to the curator. It's a win-win situation for both artist and curator. So, once you have already interacted with a curator, if you resonate with his/her editorial line, I’d totally recommend submitting directly without middle-man. The curator will always appreciate a direct interaction like this and that can also affect positively their mood and sometimes even the chances to get approved. Submission platforms also have some advantages. They help you discover curators and keep track of the results of your campaign and can be really helpful to get familiar with curators, but once you have interacted with a curator and once you are familiar 's editorial line. Of those “drop by drop” platforms, at this moment, my favorite one is SubmitHub. Why? Because it is the only one that constantly audits its curators and that shows pretty accurate numbers of their real engagement, allowing artists to make informed decisions. That’s really important. Also, it is the most efficient one as it has the most powerful tools to determine how well your song matches a particular curator. Compared with its competitors, it offers some extra tools to filter by “Similar artists”, curator’s engagement, quality, etc. Its interface is rather “technical” than “cool”, way more professional. So, before submitting to a particular playlist, you can set some kind of expectation of the outcome: How good your track fits stylistically, an approximation of how many streams you will get (if accepted on a particular playlist), and how valuable is each curator’s feedback, according to how users rate/define it. On the other hand, from the curator’s perspective, SubmitHub has some disadvantages. Despite being the platform whose philosophy I resonate the most with and being (by far) my favorite in terms of usability, interface, accessibility, amount/quality of submissions, etc. The maximum income per song a curator can get is still too low to take this task too seriously and rarely enough to venture into making it a part-time job, even if your playlists have thousands of monthly listeners. Also, the platform’s cut is 50%, which is too much in my opinion, especially considering they are in the range of 400k - 750k songs submissions per month. Other platforms, especially on the campaign model side, offer substantially better income per song, from $1 to $15. More on the not-minor consequences of this matter in the “How to cope with feedback” section, later in this guide. Also, having only 72 hours to review each song in SubmitHub demands a level of dedication way too high in contrast with the earnings per song. If, using their own words, “most curators are doing this as a hobby”, I think that it’s not fair to require them to do their job on such a tight schedule. When would I recommend artists to use the campaign model? I do recommend the campaign model in some cases. Artists might get interesting results if: They make music amongst very popular genres, for example electro pop, techno, EDM, rock, commercial R&B,... Their tracks are mainly consumed as background music: solo piano, study beats,... Those genres are well represented too in the platforms, so there are lower chances to get low-quality streams. They have the urge to quickly increase the number of streams even at the expense of getting a nice amount of low-quality streams and hurting their artist profile. Those who prefer quantity over quality. If you still want to use one of those platforms, I would recommend PlaylistPush, instead of SoundCampaign. Free Submission platforms: If your budget is literally 0 or pretty close to that, SubmitHub's free submissions are still your best option, but there's also DailyPlaylists and Soundplate, which allow you to submit for free to curators in exchange for following the curator's playlist and sometimes a few additional actions from your Spotify account. The requirements to become a standard curator on those platforms are minimal, feedback is not required and you can’t know for sure if curators actually listened to your song, accepted or not. You might get your song added to some playlists with thousands of followers but results might be poor, especially algorithmic-wise, and it is not rare to notice suspicious and artificial streams. In any case, there are some honest curators there, usually making their first steps, that might lead to more relevant opportunities in the future. HOW TO COPE WITH FEEDBACK : This subject is so relevant that I decided it is better to put some light here before talking about platform usage / strategies. Feedback is a delicate matter as artists are obviously sensitive about their work. It is responsible for most of the anger, rejection and frustration that cause some artists to refuse to use submission platforms or to criticize it bitterly. If you’ve used submission platforms in the past, you’ve probably received all kinds of feedback: detailed, vague and generic, helpful, not relevant at all, technical, purely subjective, polite, rude, honest, contradictory,... Some feedback will hurt you and might ruin your day, some will be encouraging and will brighten up your day. You will find curators that will be really thoughtful and point out some critical aspects that will help you grow as an artist. That diversity has different explanations but there are two important things here to keep in mind: Curators need to find a balance between the time they spend listening and writing feedback and the income they receive per song. I cannot highlight this enough. This is a message for the platforms too. Let’s make some numbers. If we think of curating as a typical job with a salary. What would be a decent wage per hour, in your opinion? If we set an approximate average income for curators of $1 per song: The average hourly wage in the US is around $29.8, the equivalent of $4768 per month. That means spending 2:01 minutes maximum listening and writing feedback per song. The minimum federal hourly wage in the US is $7.25, the equivalent of $1160 per month. Way under the cost of living in many “developed” countries. That is equivalent to spending 8:20 minutes maximum listening and writing feedback per song. That might seem reasonable enough. You can even make the exercise of timing yourself listening to a song and writing feedback about it. But curators have fixed costs, which ones? Typically from $5 to $25 every day to maintain the engagement of their playlists + website/blog maintenance + extra streaming platform subscriptions, to name a few. In summary, curators usually need to spend only a limited amount of time per song, not just to be profitable / worthwhile but to not lose money, and curators having to do their job fast translates into lower quality feedback. It is sort of a vicious circle. It's one of the reasons why artists at times get contradictory feedback or seem to be rejected for one reason and the opposite. Sometimes it's easier for a curator to say that it doesn't quite fit the mood/subgenres/vibe instead of making an in-depth analysis about why the song didn't spark their interest. Especially for \"correct\" songs: they are not bad but there's nothing special there, nothing standing out. It's not easy to say that without hurting somehow, and being completely honest, even in a polite way, is riskier as it's much easier to get bad ratings from artists. Spending a nice amount of time per song and writing thoughtful feedback isn’t barely incentivized, or incentivized at all, by submission platforms. At most, the curator will receive a fancy badge or a little bump on their quality rate but nothing valuable enough to compensate for their time. Anyway, should it be incentivised if many artists are not much interested in feedback? Often the return from the artists is really poor or non-existent too. I have sent very passionate acceptance messages on some songs I really enjoyed, posted extra Instagram stories about songs, made blog entries for free and written very detailed feedback pointing out key aspects to improve that took me more than one hour for only $1 and the artists' return was a simple “Thanks!” or no reply at all. Curator’s job is often ungrateful too and our position is more vulnerable than it might look like, as in a matter of minutes a curation profile might totally collapse. It is not rare that playlists get taken down by Spotify without any prior explanation, and some submission platforms behave like bullies, and can arbitrarily remove a curator's profile from their platform, also without any explanation and in some cases even keeping that curator last months earnings. It's not easy to speak up to a submission platform when you think the working conditions or something they do is abusive. By the way, did I mention that submission platforms fee is typically 50%, so curators only get half of what an artist pays? Our fragility in front of third-parties and the lack of community awareness are one of the reasons why me and some fellow curators decided to create the United Curators Association. If you are a curator and you are reading this, I totally recommend you to check out the association's Instagram profile, you'll find its manifesto and the form to join it. So, (back to feedback) if you are an artist and it is really important to you to get in-depth and thoughtful feedback, submission platforms might not be the best place and budget to get that. There are other platforms for that. Despite the fact that some platforms say curators must write feedback because artists are paying for that, in my opinion platforms mainly require feedback from curators to prove to the artist that they listened to the song, offer a reasonable explanation of their decision and put more distance between their model and payola. Not all curators have a strong musical background and they don’t have to. As I said earlier, I'm an artist and producer, so I'm able to provide in-depth feedback, at least about the genres of my expertise. But some curators are not good at analyzing a track and struggle to provide useful, relevant or technical feedback. Sometimes it might be pure laziness or they would need more time than the available. You can make the exercise of asking a few of your non-musician friends, or even better, random people, to write feedback on your track in a few minutes and compare it with reviews you get from submission platforms. In any case, the ability/will to write quality feedback has nothing to do with the relevance and engagement of a playlist. They don’t need to be professional reviewers. When curators apply to any platform, they don’t have to prove the quality of their feedback, ever. Platforms are making efforts to improve the quality of feedback and provide some useful tips to curators. Still, they are only asked to prove the relevance of their playlists. So if your primary goal for submitting a song is to get featured in hot playlists, you must learn to handle this and relativize feedback. To filter when it’s valuable from when it’s not. Some platforms like SubmitHub allow you to choose what kind of feedback you want: “Specific and honest”, “Be Gentle” or “No feedback at all”. My advice is to always choose “Specific and honest”, even if you are not going to read it. Why? Besides being able to have different perspectives and opinions about your music, which is often interesting, most of the time family, friends and other musicians tend to save things that might hurt you and usually only tell you how much they liked it. You would also be losing opportunities to make new human relationships, learn which curators are relevant, which ones to save as favorites and which to discard on your next release. That is even valuable for professional musicians. Also, statistics say that submissions that ask for “No feedback” have a much lesser approval rate. FINDING THE RIGHT CURATORS/PLAYLISTS : This section covers “drop by drop” platforms in a broader way. It does not cover the “full campaign” model, as genre tags are usually the only real choice. I thought it didn’t make sense to explain in detail each platform usage as they all have some sort of strategy guide or articles on their websites. In any case, a track might be a good match not only if it matches the genres of a particular playlist but also its mood and overall vibe. Some playlists are pretty broad, but some of them have a very specific focus. For example, within a genre, they might be only looking for chill songs, some might prefer electronic elements over acoustic instruments, some might be more inclined to not-commercial songs, only cover songs, only songs with lyrics, with a length below 3 minutes,... Also, the curator's personal taste has to be accounted for as a factor. Too often, rejection is due to the song not fitting the curator’s playlist catalog, so the artist itself has room to avoid it by doing a good filtering job. You can spend as much or as little as you want by being more or less strict on your filters and, if desired, by adding an optional extra manual research to filter even more to avoid spending some money on playlists that can be easily identified as not relevant for your track. That additional research may consist of checking out some potential playlists in Spotify, reading its description and taking a quick look at the artists featured to have a better idea of their mood and vibe and how much of a good fit it is. Maybe even listening to a few songs. Some platforms ease this process by providing tools to check out playlist content within the platform itself. If you have some free time, this research might be interesting, especially if you have a very low budget. Getting familiar with a playlist's content and editorial line will also allow you to write more customized messages to curators that you resonate with and try to establish a closer and more personal kind of relationship. Like “Hey ! I love your playlist “Nu-Funk | Alt R&B | Indie Soul Picks”. I’m a big fan of Vulfpeck and Allen Stone, actually they were big influences on this new track I’m releasing next week, so I think it might be a perfect fit!”. Curators usually appreciate this and your chances for success and approval ratio will increase. But not everybody has the time or the patience to do that, and that's ok. So the necessity and extent of that additional research is usually determined by your available time, budget, curiosity and the number of curators matching your previous filters,... The easiest way to waste your money here is to choose the wrong genres or to choose the wrong platform. As I mentioned earlier, it is really important to note that some platforms provide more powerful tools than others, so choosing the right platform saves you money. Some only offer you to filter by genre and playlist followers (which might have nothing to do with its actual real monthly listeners). Others (read SubmitHub) allow you to filter by similar artists, curator's quality, see the playlists’ real engagement, how consistent is their genre focus, etc. So what in one platform filtering may result in a list of 200 relevant curators matching your track, in another one with more powerful tools, it might be only 50. A few final tips: Keep a level head while using submission platforms. Getting too anxious to promote your music often leads to ending up too angry or frustrated even by the inevitable percent of rejection. Get familiar with how platforms work and have realistic expectations. Expect guaranteed results and hundreds of thousands of streams by only spending a few dollars. Sometimes it does happen, but it’s not what you should expect. That’s why platforms with a monthly listener estimation for each playlist are helpful in setting realistic expectations for every playlist addition. Approval rate: Something around 10-20% is commonly considered pretty good, sometimes even for established musicians. A few days ago, I felt awful for rejecting one track. It was a collaboration between two artists I love and have followed for years. The song was really good and matched the genres of my playlist, but it was too chill and atmospheric for its vibe. Songs not 100% up to industry standards. It’s okay to promote songs that are not 100% up to industry standards, you might get some valuable feedback at a very low price but rejection will be much higher and you might even get 0 approvals. Remember that you are “competing” with songs that had experienced professionals on each of its different stages: songwriters, performers, producers, mixing and mastering engineers,etc. I’ve made this mistake in the past. I’ve tried to promote some songs that were not good enough in the past. The musical ideas were awesome, at least in my opinion, but there was room for improvement on the recording quality. The mix was made by a friend with very limited experience and we were still in a very early stage in our career as musicians. My first campaigns were pretty bad but results improved as the quality of my songs improved too. If it's not up to the industry standard, that material is still valid for many things. It is often necessary for the artist's own process and development and it might be good enough to send as a demo to a label, sign a recording deal, to post on your socials and to engage with people and increase your fanbase. But probably it won't be good enough to be featured in a playlist amongst professional tracks from established artists, as curators do care about the quality of their content. Unless there's something really really unique and special about your music or sound. Wrong balance between recording quality and promotion: I’m not saying you can’t get professional quality tracks unless you spend thousands of dollars. I’m saying that it makes no sense to hire a cheap and inexperienced engineer to mix and master your song for $50 and then spend $500 in promotion for that track. You will get much better results by doing the opposite. The best investment is to invest in having a good “product”. If the quality of your track is technically and artistically good, results usually follow. Many times with a little promotion effort. Music lovers (including curators) are hungry for hot new music. Even the Spotify algorithm needs new \"products\" to offer to its clients. Nothing makes a curator happier than to be sent a hot song that matches one of their playlists. Nobody wants to have a curator profile showing <1% acceptance rate. Curators are willing to accept music and have a more attractive profile. Relying only upon submission platforms to promote your track: You can do that but playlisting is usually only one leg of an artist’s efforts on promotion, often including word of mouth, socials, press, other media coverage, marketing, sync, etc. Each service has its particularities. It is not rare to fail on one side and to be really successful on the other. Using more than one submission platform: It’s okay but I wouldn’t recommend using more than one platform from the same model/type unless you write down which curators you have submitted to, as they tend to be populated by the same curators. If you want to promote on two different platforms, it might be a good option to simply choose the best drop by drop platform and the best full campaign platform. Different genres, different moods, different results: An important thing to be aware of is that different music styles work very differently on submission platforms. Not only approval ratio differ between genres, also the number of curators/playlists available (opportunities) and the average results each approval provides are often proportional to the genre popularity or how music of a certain mood is consumed. For example, Solo Piano or Study Beats have a pretty good acceptance rate, many curators are focusing on those styles and results are often counted in thousands of streams. There are huge user-generated playlists with dozens of thousands of listeners consuming that kind of music for many hours a day on repeat while studying, relaxing or doing other things without even caring about who is the artist behind, so curators are less picky because the listener is not paying the same amount of attention to the quality of the track. They often have a worse save ratio but they may be pretty good to “stimulate” the algorithm. Some interesting data about how friendly are the different music genres on this link. Final Message I think that I'm not missing any important point. So if you found it helpful and plan to use submission platforms, you can find interesting discounts through the following link.

Martín Giraldo’s Post Martín Giraldo reposted this Music-tech researcher, founder, and educator This week's Water & Music Starter Pack, sponsored by Downtown Music Holdings, is about all things digital music curation — exploring questions like: - What does curation mean, anyway? - What makes music curation brands stand out? - What market trends are changing music curation? - Does genre still matter? - What does it mean to decentralize curation? Curation in the music business is as vital as it is controversial. It can take many forms, from playlists and DJ sets to festival lineups and well-placed TV syncs (looking at you, Kate Bush). For some, music curation as an activity is a personal form of journaling and self-expression; for others, it’s a serious, multimillion-dollar business that can make or break artists’ careers. Effectively curating the noise of the modern digital music landscape is table stakes for today’s music streaming companies. In fact, several streaming feature updates so far in 2023 (e.g. Bandcamp's radio station on Fortnite, Spotify's \"AI DJ,\" Apple Music's new classical streaming app, and Crunchyroll's new section for J-pop concerts) illustrate how music-tech companies are constantly experimenting with new curation formats, in line with changing audience behaviors and tech innovation at large. On the flip side, several controversies in the music business can boil down to challenges with curation. One often hears the words “curation” and “gatekeeping” in the same breath — lamenting how mainstream players have outsized control over which artists get exposure, and how exclusivity often comes with corrupt incentives and power imbalances. Seemingly every year, new investigations pop up about the opaque influence of playlist curators, the persistent accusations of payola at terrestrial radio stations, and the prospects of “fake artists” and avatar rappers swallowing up artist placement opportunities. At Water & Music, we’ve covered challenges and opportunities around modern music curation in depth — analyzing how they manifest themselves across technologies both old (with mainstream tech platforms) and new (including the impact of emerging tech across Web3, AI, and the metaverse). In this Starter Pack, we will highlight key tips for artists to best prepare their catalogs for what today’s curators are looking for, and for curators and founders to build memorable, community-driven music brands that elevate fans’ listening experiences and withstand the test of time. #musicbusiness #music #streaming #artist #curation #musicindustry #musictech Starter Packs: Digital music curation https://www.waterandmusic.com To view or add a comment, sign in 2,584 followers Explore topics Sign in to view more content Create your free account or sign in to continue your search Welcome back or By clicking Continue to join or sign in, you agree to LinkedIn’s User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy.
