Listeners may orientate their engagement with music around its ability to facilitate particular emotional responses and to subsequently regulate mood. Existing scales have aimed to gauge both individual coping orientations in response to stress, as well as individual use of music for the purposes of mood regulation. This study utilised pre-validated scales through an online survey (N = 233) in order to measure whether music’s use in mood regulation is influenced by coping orientations and/or demographic variables in response to the lockdown measures imposed in the United Kingdom, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst factor analyses show that the existing theoretical structure of the COPE model has indicated a poor fit for clustered coping orientations, a subsequent five-factor structure was determined for coping orientations in response to lockdown. Analyses include observations that positive reframing and active coping (Positive Outlook) were strong predictors of music use in mood regulation amongst listener’s coping strategies, as was Substance Use. Higher Age indicated having a negative effect on music’s use in mood regulation, whilst factors such as gender were not seen to be significant in relation to the use of music in mood regulation within this context. These results provide insight into how individuals have engaged with music orientated coping strategies in response to a unique stressor.",

The Impact of Music on Mood Regulation Dr. Atika Tewari1* ABSTRACT Our society, way of life, and behaviour are all influenced by music, and its significance appears to be closely related to its emotional impact. The researcher was curious to study how music's impact on mood regulation influences college students' lives. Objective This study aims to examine the influence of how music affects students’ capacity to regulate their moods among college students. Hypothesis Data were collected on a total sample of 50 students. It was collected from Dehradun. The age range of students was 18 to 23 years. Out of 50, 19 Males and 19 females were selected in the final sample that fell within the criteria, according to the B-MMR manual guidelines. Tool Used the Music in Mood Regulation (B-MMR) scale, created by Saarikallio (2008) Method This study used a quantitative methodology to examine the usage of music for regulating one's mood. In order to develop a theoretical framework, an analysis assessment of the literature is initially carried out, highlighting the importance of mood-related meanings in students' interactions with music. Following this, 50 university students were given access to a Google Form survey. A total of 38 replies were gathered, with 50% of the participants being female and 50% being male. Result showed that both male and female use music for mood regulation. The use of music for mood regulation was also related to musical background, musical preferences, and general mood regulation abilities. Keywords: Music, Mood Regulation, Emotions ur society, way of life, and behaviour are all influenced by music, and its significance appears to be closely related to its emotional impact. The majority of people have different subjective opinions about how music may uplift, calm, and even heal them. The current study was inspired by age-old queries such as \"Why is music important to humans?\" and \"Why does music touch us emotionally?\" Its fundamental goal was to deepen our understanding of the emotional significance of music. A unique and profound position for music in the human experience, it is a powerful instrument for communication, emotional expression, and emotional control. Music is a tool that can influence the emotion; it can change the mood and also leaves it effects on human emotions. And this effect can be shown in some ways. Like it can be shown visually, through facial expressions and also audibly through vocal expressions. It has been proved by many research too. As emotions are influenced by music in the same way activities are also influenced by music. A huge difference in one performance and task can be seen after and 1Assistant Professor Uttaranchal University, Dehradun *Corresponding Author Received: June 23, 2024; Revision Received: June 27, 2024; Accepted: June 30, 2024 O The Impact of Music on Mood Regulation © The International Journal of Indian Psychology, ISSN 2348-5396 (e)| ISSN: 2349-3429 (p) | 4386 before listening to music. It is said that people work much better after listening to music than those who sit in silence or with no music. LITERATURE REVIEW Zentner, Grandjean, and Scherer (2008) explored various theoretical models have been proposed to elucidate how music influences mood regulation. The Mood Regulation Theory (MRT) is among these models, proposing that individuals use music to achieve specific mood regulatory objectives, such as mood regulation or enhancement. According to MRT, adolescents select from a diverse range of musical genres and styles based on their perceived ability to help them achieve desired emotional outcomes. Van den Tol and Edwards's (2015) study discovered that students utilize music to control their emotions by either listening to music that elevates or detracts from their unpleasant feelings. Thoma et al. (2012) explored that music, especially in stressful circumstances, can be a useful tool for raising happy feelings and lowering negative ones. There was a link between having a musical background and using music to control your mood. Results have shown that higher daily listening, a history of playing or singing, songwriting, having music played in the house, and the subjective assessment of music's significance in one's life were all positively correlated with higher usage of music in mood regulation. Also, Hearing in particular proved to be important; 62% of respondents said that \"listening alone\" is the most important musical activity for mood control. For students who actively engage with music, it seems to be a more effective mood stabilizer than for their peers. The importance of listening, however, also suggests that children who just use music to control their mood can benefit much from it. Schafer et al. (2013) explored studies have consistently demonstrated that students' usage of music to regulate their moods is significantly influenced by their gender. Compared to boys, girls often use music more frequently and successfully for emotional expression and management. There are several possible explanations for this gender disparity in music consumption, including biological variations, socialization processes, and cultural standards. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Independent Variables • Gender • Age Dependent Variable • Use of Music for Mood Regulation Hypothesis On the basis of reviewed literature and experts’ opinions, following hypotheses were formulated for factorial test. • Hypothesis 1: There will be no significant relationship between gender and the use of music for mood regulation among students. • Hypothesis 2: There will be no relationship between age and the use of music for mood regulation among students. The Impact of Music on Mood Regulation © The International Journal of Indian Psychology, ISSN 2348-5396 (e)| ISSN: 2349-3429 (p) | 4387 • Hypothesis 3: There will be no relationship between musical background and the use of music for mood regulation among students. Sample Data were collected on a total sample of 50 students. It was collected from Dehradun. The age range of students was 18 to 23 years. Out of 50, 19 Males and 19 females were selected in the final sample that fell within the criteria, according to the B-MMR manual guidelines, the stratified random sampling techniques was used to assign male and female college students. Tools Used Music in Mood Regulation scale (Brief version – B-MMR) by Saarikallio, S: The B-MMR consists of 21 items, divided into seven three-item subscales assessing. Entertainment (e.g., I usually put music on to make the atmosphere more pleasant), Revival (e.g., When I'm, I listen to music to perk up), Strong sensation (e.g., I feel fantastic putting my soul fully into the music), Diversion (e.g., For me, music is a way to forget about my worries), Discharge (e.g. When I'm really angry, I feel like listening to some aggressive music), Mental work (e.g., Music helps me to recognize different feelings in myself) and Solace (e.g., When everything feels bad, music understands and comforts me). All participants rated all items on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Research Design An exploratory study was conducted to examine the impact of music on mood regulation. Confirmatory factor analysis is used to validate the scale, and differences in how people utilize music to control their moods. Data were analysed and interpreted with the help of mean. Mean was also applied to meet out the objective and test the hypotheses of the study. DISCUSSION The results from data analysis in the present study showed that there was no significant relationship between music and mood regulation in young adults who were enrolled in the university. The hypothesis made earlier was not supported by the obtained result. The findings showed that student’s attitude regarding music and its ability to regulate mood were generally favourable. The results are in line with earlier studies that suggested music is a useful tool for emotional self-regulation. Mood-regulatory strategies are typically divided into behavioural and cognitive strategies, and listening to music has often been considered as a behavioural strategy. The results of the present work, however, suggest that music-related mood regulation has features of both behavioural and cognitive strategies. Various musical activities are indeed behavioural actions, and mood regulation is realized through various behaviours like listening, playing, singing or dancing. However, music may also be considered as a framework which promotes the cognitive processing of emotional experiences. These processes are reflected, for example, in the strategy of mental work, which is about the use of music as a symbolic space for working through conflicting issues and reappraising emotional experiences. CONCLUSION In Conclusion, this research has investigated how music affects mood regulation in college students, with an emphasis on participant attitudes and views of music as an emotional self-regulation tool. The study's findings provide significant insight into the role that music plays in daily life and the significance of music for the emotional well- being of young adults. The results show that most college students think well of music and its ability to regulate mood. The Impact of Music on Mood Regulation © The International Journal of Indian Psychology, ISSN 2348-5396 (e)| ISSN: 2349-3429 (p) | 4388 According to some previous studies that suggested gender may influence music preferences and emotional responses to music, the study showed no significant gender differences in the use of music for mood control. This result suggests that, in this sample, there is a consistent association between music and mood control for both genders. Emotion and music studies are becoming more and more prominent in related professions. Gaining expertise in the psychological processes linked to the affective application of music is crucial for any field that explores the relationship between human needs and music. The current research provides two theoretical frameworks and an innovative measurement tool to further the discussion regarding the increasing need for shared theories, paradigms, and metrics that facilitate collaboration between disciplines. The results may open new avenues for research in the fields of music education, music sociology, music psychology, and music therapy. They might also shed new light on how people's goal-oriented psychological functioning, emotional experiences, coping strategies, and self-regulation are investigated in general psychology. Limitations of the Study • Research suggested that students who listen to music with lyrics while completing reading or writing tasks tend to be less efficient and come away having absorbed information. • Loud or agitated music can have adverse effects on reading comprehension and on mood making focus more difficult. • Music can also induce harmful effects, particularly when it comes to rumination. • When a person dwells on negative thinking or feelings, it can contribute to the development of depression and anxiety or worsen existing conditions. Suggestions for Further Research • Further study can also be undertaken on a large sample size. • The study may also be conducted over a larger geographical domain as well. • Other variables like higher age, personality, music genre may be also included. • The study focuses on the young generations (college students) but on the adults.

This innovative approach harnesses the universal language of music to foster relaxation, enhance emotional regulation, and improve cognitive function. By integrating carefully selected melodies, rhythms, and musical activities into therapeutic sessions, our music therapists in Vaughan help individuals navigate complex emotional landscapes and develop essential social skills. The benefits of music therapy extend far beyond mere entertainment, offering a holistic approach to tackle behavioral disorders and enhance emotional expression. This article explores the techniques used in music therapy to manage behavioral issues, examining how it influences mood improvement and supports overall mental health. We'll delve into the role of a music therapist, discuss the impact of creative expression on emotional awareness, and highlight how music therapy can strengthen interpersonal relationships. By understanding these key aspects, readers will gain insight into the transformative potential of music therapy in mental health treatment. Understanding Music Therapy for Mental Health Music therapy is a powerful tool for promoting mental health and well-being. It involves the clinical use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship. This approach harnesses the universal language of music to foster relaxation, enhance emotional regulation, and improve cognitive function. Definition of music therapy Music therapy is defined as an interpersonal process in which a therapist uses music and its various elements to help patients improve, restore, or maintain their mental health. It's a systematic intervention that promotes health through musical experiences and the relationships that develop through them. This form of therapy can address a wide range of healthcare and educational goals, including stress management, pain alleviation, and improved communication. History and development The roots of music therapy can be traced back to ancient times, with references found in the Jewish Bible. However, it emerged as a formal profession in the 20th century, particularly after World Wars I and II. The impact of music on veterans' physical and emotional responses led to the establishment of music therapy education programs. The American Music Therapy Association, founded in 1998, traces the formal beginnings of music therapy to 1789. Types of music therapy Music therapy encompasses various approaches, including receptive and active methods. Receptive methods involve listening to music, while active methods engage patients in playing musical instruments. Specific techniques include the Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music, Dalcroze Eurythmics, and Neurologic Music Therapy. These approaches cater to different needs and can be tailored to address various mental health conditions, making music therapy a versatile tool in mental health treatment. Benefits of Music Therapy for Behavioral Issues Music therapy has emerged as a powerful tool to tackle behavioral issues and enhance mental health. Its effectiveness stems from its ability to address various aspects of emotional and cognitive functioning. Emotional regulation Music therapy plays a crucial role in improving emotional regulation, a key predictor of mental well-being. Research shows that individuals who practice emotional regulation tend to cope better with life's stressors and are more resilient. Through carefully structured sessions, music therapists help participants vent negative emotions, establish interpersonal links, and express themselves in safe, nonverbal activities. This process allows individuals to better accept and talk about their emotional experiences, whether positive or negative. Stress reduction One of the most significant benefits of music therapy is its ability to reduce stress. Studies have shown that music listening can decrease physiological arousal, as indicated by reduced cortisol levels, lowered heart rate, and decreases in mean arterial pressure. Music therapy interventions have been found to have a medium-to-large effect on stress-related outcomes (d = .723, [.51–.94]). This stress-reducing effect is attributed not only to the music itself but also to the continuous attunement of music by the therapist to the individual needs of a patient. Improved social skills Music therapy has shown remarkable success in enhancing social skills, particularly for individuals with autism. Group improvisational music therapy (GIMT) has been found to improve social skills significantly. Through activities like passing instruments, sharing, and engaging in movement games, participants learn to observe social cues, cooperate with group boundaries, and transition between activities. These musical interactions provide a context for reciprocal interaction and development, ameliorating the lack of sharing and turn-taking often observed in individuals with autism. Enhanced cognitive function Music therapy has also demonstrated positive effects on cognitive function. Studies have shown that music listening can improve cognitive performance, albeit in the short term. Music activates brain regions responsible for attention, memory, and IQ, leading to increased neural efficiency in the prefrontal lobe, a site consistently linked to different types of functioning intelligence. This enhancement in cognitive abilities occurs directly by increasing local neural efficiency and indirectly by enhancing sustained attention. Techniques in Music Therapy for Behavioral Management Music therapy offers a variety of techniques to address behavioral issues and promote mental health. These approaches harness the power of music to foster emotional regulation, enhance cognitive function, and improve social skills. Active music making Active music making involves clients participating in creating music. This technique has been shown to improve motor function, emotional well-being, and cognitive abilities. For instance, playing musical instruments can help individuals with Parkinson's disease enhance their motor symptoms and quality of life. Group music-making activities also promote teamwork and problem-solving skills, making them particularly beneficial for those with behavioral disorders. Receptive music listening Receptive music therapy involves clients listening to music and responding to the experience. This method can be used to relax or stimulate particular emotional and physical responses. Music relaxation techniques, for example, can help reduce stress and anxiety, while song lyric discussions can serve as a springboard for exploring life issues and experiences. Improvisation Improvisation in music therapy allows clients to create spontaneous music, fostering self-expression and communication. This technique can help develop social skills, increase independence, and facilitate problem-solving. Clinical improvisation, where clients and therapists interact through music, can be particularly effective in addressing behavioral issues and improving interpersonal relationships. Songwriting Songwriting in music therapy serves as a powerful tool for self-expression and emotional regulation. This technique can help clients process difficult experiences, increase self-esteem, and develop insight into their feelings and needs. Songwriting activities can be adapted to suit various populations and can be particularly effective in group settings, fostering cohesion and teamwork. Implementing Music Therapy in Mental Health Treatment Music therapy for mental health is a versatile approach that can be integrated with other therapies to enhance treatment outcomes. When customizing therapy plans, music therapists collaborate with other healthcare professionals to address individual needs. This integration allows for a holistic approach to mental health care, combining the benefits of music therapy with traditional treatments. Customizing therapy plans involves tailoring music-based interventions to suit each client's unique requirements. Music therapists assess the client's musical background, emotional responses to music, and preferred genres to create personalized treatment strategies. This individualized approach helps to maximize the effectiveness of music therapy in addressing specific mental health concerns. Measuring progress is crucial in evaluating the impact of music therapy on mental health. The Music Therapy Rating Scale (MTRS) is a tool used to monitor changes during clinical sessions. It assesses the non-verbal relationship and sonorous-musical relationship between the therapist and client. By tracking these relationships, therapists can gage the effectiveness of interventions and make necessary adjustments to the treatment plan. Research indicates that music therapy can significantly improve language, social interaction, cognition, and behavior in individuals with mental health challenges. These improvements contribute to enhanced emotional regulation, cognitive function, and interpersonal relationships. Integration with other therapies Music therapy can be seamlessly integrated with other mental health treatments to create a comprehensive care plan. By collaborating with cognitive behavioral therapists, physicians, and other healthcare professionals, music therapists can develop programs that address a wide range of mental health needs. This interdisciplinary approach ensures that clients receive well-rounded care that targets multiple aspects of their mental health. Customizing therapy plans When customizing therapy plans, music therapists consider the unique needs and preferences of each client. They may incorporate various techniques such as active music-making, receptive music listening, and songwriting to address specific mental health goals. For example, playing musical instruments can help improve motor function and emotional well-being, while song lyric analysis can facilitate emotional processing and communication skills. Measuring progress To measure progress in music therapy, therapists use various assessment tools and techniques. The MTRS, for instance, allows therapists to quantify the intensity of the therapeutic relationship and track trends over time. Additionally, therapists may use standardized assessments to evaluate changes in specific areas such as emotional regulation, cognitive function, and social skills. Regular progress evaluations help therapists adjust interventions as needed and ensure that clients are making meaningful strides towards their mental health goals. Conclusion Music therapy has proven to be a powerful tool to tackle behavioral issues and boost mental health. Its ability to improve emotional regulation, reduce stress, enhance social skills, and boost cognitive function makes it a valuable addition to mental health treatment plans. By harnessing the universal language of music, therapists can help individuals navigate complex emotional landscapes and develop essential life skills. The versatility of music therapy techniques, from active music-making to songwriting, allows for customized approaches that cater to each person's unique needs. As we've seen, the integration of music therapy with other mental health treatments can lead to more comprehensive care. Its effectiveness in addressing various aspects of mental well-being highlights its potential to transform lives.

FAQs What does the behavioral approach entail in music therapy?The behavioural approach in music therapy is about using music to help change behaviour by teaching through rewards and consequences. It works by creating specific programs that influence how people behave in their environment. For example, a music therapist might use certain songs or activities to encourage positive actions and reinforce them with rewards, helping the person learn new, more helpful behaviours. This method is based on the idea that behaviour can be shaped by how we respond to different situations, with a focus on learning from those responses. How does music therapy contribute to behavioral improvement?Music therapy aids in the development of positive emotional behaviors by providing a secure environment where individuals can learn to identify and articulate their emotions, enhancing their ability to communicate with others. It includes fostering emotional awareness and promoting nonverbal expression. What role does music therapy play in treating mental disorders?Music therapy is shown to be effective in several ways for mental health: it can induce relaxation, provide a medium to explore emotions, and help in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Can you describe the four main types of music therapy?The four primary types of music therapy include receptive, re-creational, compositional, and improvisational. Each type offers different ways for clients to engage with music, whether it’s listening, recreating, composing, or improvising music. References Zoppi, L. (2020, November 4).

Table of Contents Heading 2 Related Reading Music can increase focus, help to manage stress, or improve mood during times of sadness. It has long been understood that music impacts our feelings and mood, but the reasons for that impact have not been studied until very recently. Now, brain scans and psychological research are discovering how the mechanisms that lead to mood changes or mood regulation are associated with music. Why Do We Listen to Music? In a psychological survey conducted in 2013 examining the reasons why people listen to music, the analysis found that people listen to music to: The first two reasons in this list were found to be more important than the third. Music was reported to be deeply personal, often used in the foreground as a way of improving motivation or focus, or used in the background as a means of regulating mood and easing stress. Using music as a method of relating to friends or family, identifying culturally, or expressing oneself to peers was less common. Most psychological studies involving music have been conducted on people in the westernized world, but some cross-cultural studies have found that unfamiliar music from other cultures can still be interpreted in similar ways. For example, Western listeners could tell whether a song was intended to be happy or sad even when it was from an unfamiliar culture like Navajo Native American or Hindustani. A survey conducted of people in a remote tribe living in Cameroon found that most listeners easily identified when Western music was happy or sad. For example, listeners agreed that when songs were soft or slow, they were supposed to reflect sadness; jaunty and fast-paced music at a moderate volume was interpreted as happy. It seems that, across cultures, certain features of music are common to all experiences, suggesting that they developed in similar ways to regulate or inspire similar emotional experiences. Â How the Reward System and Dopamine Relate to Music One of the first studies on the emotional association with music was conducted by Leonard Meyer in 1956. Meyer analyzed the fifth movement in Beethovenâs masterpiece, String Quartet in C-sharp major, Op. 131. After examining the tonal changes and measures, Meyer concluded that creating unfulfilled expectations caused suspense and tension in the listener, which leads to the emotional response to fulfilled expectations. Listening to music triggers physical changes that indicate emotional arousal. For example, listening to our favorite songs will make us happy, which is indicated by the following: The cerebellum is highly activated by our favorite songs, triggering increased blood flow to the legs. This may be part of why dance is so closely associated with nearly every genre of music. The region of the brain most impacted by almost every type of music in the world is also the area that makes us want to move, even if this is just tapping our feet or bobbing our heads. One study conducted by Montreal researchers closely examined the brains of 217 volunteers, looking for people who experienced âchillsâ when listening to music. They narrowed the group down to 10 study subjects and then watched that groupâs brains as they listened to playlists of their favorite songs. Though the group was small, the playlists stretched across dozens of genres, representing a wide range of music tastes. Images from the brains of these 10 participants found that favorite music releases dopamine in two places in the brain: the dorsal and ventral striatum. These areas typically light up from pleasurable stimuli, whether it is a hug or a drug; however, the team concluded that music could effectively trigger this release as well. The Montreal research team also found that listening to favorite music caused an âanticipatory effect,â similar to a Pavlovian response of excitement. This effect occurred during familiar, expected, but enjoyed swells or changes in the songs. This anticipation effect was also found in people who were unfamiliar with the song, but who expected certain patterns in the music that did not pay off until later or even at the end of the song. Emotional Perception When Listening to Music In 2012, a research team at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands found that music deeply impacted what the listeners perceived were their emotions. The two lead psychologists asked participants to rank their happiness or sadness using emoticons. They found that, while listening to music, participants rarely used the neutral facial expression response even when no smiling emoticon was shown as an option. They concluded that this represented a âtop-downprocessâin the brain, when the mind interprets something about the world that is not inherently there. The most common example of this is when you interpret something about your surroundings based on what you see. The 2012 research found that there was an emotional top-down process, similar to the visual top-down process, which occurred when examining oneâs own emotions. Another study compared songbirds experiencing bird songs to humans experiencing music. They found that both birds and humans experienced changes in their amygdala with some kinds of music. For birds, the songs were discordant, while for humans, the music was categorized as âmelancholyâ or about âunrequited love.â Songs that triggered a rush of limerence or new love tapped into the mesolimbic reward system in both humans and birds. Yet another 2012 study, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, reported that ambient noise at a moderate volume of about 70 decibels, which is about the volume of a vacuum cleaner, could improve creativity. Listening to louder noise than that, however, reduced creativity through distraction. Music without lyrics could be a form of ambient, soothing noise to improve not just mood, but also productivity and creativity. A study conducted in 2013 reported that people who listened to upbeat music improved their moods and happiness, in the long term, within two weeks. The first of two listed studies found that listening to 12 minutes of music associated with positive mood intentionally elevated mood compared to a group who listened to any music without focusing on improving their mood. In the second study, participants were instructed to listen to music with a happy valence. One group was told to intentionally improve their mood while listening, and the other group was not given other instructions. Those in the second study who were told to focus on being happier while listening to happy music reported greater elevation in mood compared to the other group. Music Reduces Stress Repeated studies have shown that music can reduce the experience of stress and improve overall well-being. Listening to music has been associated with direct effects on physiological aspects of stress. Study participants showed lower cortisol levels, heart rate, and blood pressure when they listened to music, helping to calm the body and promote relaxation. In addition, a meta-analysis of various studies on the connection between music and stress relief found that music had a psychological effect on stress in addition to a psychological effect. Study participants experienced improvements in worry, anxiety, and restlessness when they listened to music. It's widely accepted that listening to music is a good strategy to manage stress, emotions, and overall mood. Music as Therapy Music has many benefits in therapeutic settings, including the use of music in standard clinical settings as well as specialized music therapy. Music can calm anxiety, lessen the experience of pain, and distract patients from uncomfortable aspects of a clinical visit or procedure. It can also improve mood and increase empathy in caregivers. In these instances, music is a low-cost intervention that can improve experiences for patients, clinicians, and caregivers. Specialized music therapy involves using music â listening to it, creating it, or thinking about it â to improve well-being. Therapists may incorporate various aspects of music into sessions with clients in either individual or group settings. The incorporation of music into sessions may enable clients to express themselves more openly, find new areas of emotional release, and better process emotions. Music therapy can benefit a variety of mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Music Ignites Passion & Imagination Thereâs no question that listening to music is a universal experience with various benefits to both physical and mental health. It can be used in a variety of settings to ease stress, inspire confidence, and increase productivity. Music can have a deep impact on mood, and this can easily affect overall quality of life.

Expressive art is a tool to explore, develop and practice creativity as a means to wellness.” ~ Wellarts Association The Starry Night- Vincent van Gogh Personal Preferences • Personality – Some things about me – What makes me happy? – What makes me unhappy? – What helps me cope? • Independence – Best time of Day – I feel strongly about being able to – A recent major event that affects – I prefer physical activity by – Personal Hygiene preferences – Healthcare team • Future Concerns A Study to make you think? • In May, 2011, Robert Mendick, reporter for The Telegraph, wrote an article about an experiment conducted by Professor Semir Zeki, chair in neuroaesthetics at University College London. Zeki explained, “We wanted to see what happens in the brain when you look at beautiful paintings.” The experiment concluded when you look at art “whether it is a landscape, a still life, an abstract or a portrait – there is strong activity in that part of the brain related to pleasure.” The participants underwent brain scans while being shown a series of 30 paintings by major artists. When viewing art they considered most beautiful their blood flow increased in a certain part of the brain by as much as 10%, which is the equivalent to gazing at a loved one. Paintings such as those by artists Constable, Ingres, and Monet produce the most powerful ‘pleasure’ response. Impact of Art • Psychologist Shilagh Mirgain, PhD was quoted as saying, “Awe has many important implications for our well-being.” • Mirgain explained, “Experiencing awe can give us a sense of hope and provide a feeling of fulfillment.” • Jeremy Nobel, MD, “Engagement with creative activities has the potential to contribute toward reducing stress and depression and can serve as a vehicle for alleviating the burden of chronic disease.” – Art decoration within home – Painting, drawing – Coloring – Making Crafts – Books of famous Art works – Name that piece of Art – Art education – Bingo with famous Art pieces • University of Wisconsin Health website • U.S. National Institute of Health’s (NIH) Impact of Music • Music offers a resource for emotion regulation. • Lyrics that resonate with the listener’s personal experience can give voice to feelings or experiences that one might not be able to express oneself. • Listening to soft and slow music, such as classical music, is better for managing negative emotions compared to hard or heavy music. • Listening to happy music can influence the way one perceives the world in a stressful situation. • Listening to a piece of music that was played a lot during a significant life event (e.g., a family celebration) many years ago can trigger a deeply nostalgic emotional experience. The feeling is not in the music, but in what it reminds us. • Music is a powerful emotional stimulus that changes our relationship with time. Time does indeed seem to fly when listening to pleasant music. Hearing pleasant music seems to divert attention away from time processing. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-choice/202211/how-listening-music-affects-your-mood Shahram Heshmat, Ph.D Music can alter our moods, emotions, and motivation. We can use music to validate or challenge our moods. •It’s heart healthy. Research has shown that blood flows more easily when music is played. It can also reduce heart rate, lower blood pressure, decrease cortisol (stress hormone) levels and increase serotonin and endorphin levels in the blood. •It elevates mood. Music can boost the brain’s production of the hormone dopamine. This increased dopamine production helps relieve feelings of anxiety and depression. Music is processed directly by the amygdala, which is the part of the brain involved in mood and emotions. •It reduces stress. Research has found that listening to music can relieve stress by triggering biochemical stress reducers. •It relieves symptoms of depression. When you’re feeling down in the dumps, music can help pick you up - much like exercise. •It stimulates memories. There is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease or dementia but music therapy has been shown to relieve some of its symptoms. Music therapy can relax an agitated patient, improve the mood and open communication in patients. •It manages pain. By reducing stress levels and providing a strong competing stimulus to the pain signals that enter the brain, music therapy can assist in pain management. https://www.northshore.org/healthy-you/9-health-benefits-of-music/ • Lyric Analysis • Improvisation Music Playing • Active Music Listening • Songwriting • Karaoke • Musicians • Choirs • Name that Tune- Singo How is music therapy utilized in nursing homes? • Music is used with elderly persons to increase or maintain their level of physical, mental, and social/emotional functioning.

The objective of this literature review is to see how musical induction, the process of using mood induction through music, can change affect. Affect is the emotional reactive response to stimuli. With time, affect can influence mood, becoming an emotional state that stays stagnant for a prolonged period of time. Positive affect and mood benefit cognitive performance in 4 domains: attention and processing speed, working memory, declarative memory, and executive function. Results from scientific journals, blogs, and journal articles were reviewed to [paraphrased + shortened research question]. Studies suggest that musical induction can induce positive affect, enhancing cognitive performance in memory, processing speed, and attention. Since music is prevalent in daily lives, understanding how brain functions benefit positively from musical induction is extremely important; these tools and knowledge will be beneficial in solving mental health issues and other crises.

If you’re feeling down, there’s nothing like a good tune to lift up your mood. Music is an art that has been around for centuries, and it has a profound impact on our mental well-being. People have long understood the power of music to connect with emotions we may not have been aware of, to soothe the mind’s chaotic turbulence, and to make us feel more energized. Research has shown that music might improve emotional intelligence, reduce anxiety, and even boost our decision-making abilities. In this blog post, we’ll explore how music helps regulate emotions and its effects on decision-making, particularly for those of us with executive functioning issues. Click here to jump to the TL;DR summary. How Does Music Help Regulate Emotions? At its core, music is an art form that can evoke powerful emotions. However, studies have shown that music can also help regulate our emotional states. In fact, research has found that listening to music can significantly reduce stress and anxiety levels. Studies have shown that the use of music therapy can be particularly effective for individuals dealing with depression, PTSD, and other mental health conditions. So, how does music actually work to help regulate our emotions? The answer lies in our brains. When we listen to music, it activates areas of the brain associated with pleasure, reward, and emotional regulation. Specifically, music can stimulate the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in regulating mood and emotion. Music has also been shown to be an effective tool for managing pain. This is due in part to the fact that listening to music can reduce the perception of pain in the brain. Not only that but music has been shown to enhance the release of endorphins, which are natural painkillers our bodies produce. Aside from its ability to regulate emotions and manage physical pain, music can also help improve cognitive function. Listening to music can improve memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility. In fact, some studies have found that playing music while studying or working can actually help individuals retain information more effectively. How Does Music Affect Decision-Making? Music is the ultimate emotional trigger. It can bring up memories that make us feel happy, sad, or even nostalgic. And when we’re emotional, research shows that our decision-making abilities can be altered. When we’re in a positive mood, we tend to make more optimistic choices, while negative emotions can lead us to more pessimistic decisions. Music also has a beat or a rhythm, which can impact our decision-making abilities. In fact, studies have shown that people tend to make faster decisions when the music they’re listening to has a fast tempo. It can also help improve your focus. On the other hand, slower music can lead to more deliberate and thoughtful decision-making. So, if you’ve got an important decision to make, consider the tempo of the music you’re listening to and how it might impact your thought process. Tips for Using Music to Regulate Emotions and Improve Decision-Making Skills Music can reduce stress and anxiety, boost your mood, and even improve your decision-making skills. So, how can you use it to enhance your decision-making skills and learn how to better regulate your emotions? Here are some tips. Try Different Genres of Music for Different Moods Music can affect our emotions in many ways. When we’re feeling low, listening to sad songs can be comforting and cathartic. On the other hand, when we’re feeling stressed or anxious, listening to upbeat and energetic music can help us feel more optimistic and motivated. It’s essential to try different genres of music for different moods and find what works best for you. For example, classical music can reduce stress and anxiety, while rock music can increase energy levels and improve focus. Listen to Music Throughout the Day One of the best ways to use music to regulate your emotions and enhance your decision-making skills is to listen to music regularly throughout the day. You can create playlists that suit different activities, like one for working out, one for relaxing, and one for work. Listening to music while working, for example, can help increase productivity, improve focus, and enhance memory retention. It can also be helpful to mix in music as part of a planned break.

Enhance Your Creativity Listening to music can enhance creativity and help improve cognitive function. That’s because music activates different areas of the brain, including those responsible for memory, attention, and emotion recognition. So, if you need to brainstorm ideas or come up with creative solutions to a problem, try listening to some music that inspires you. You might be surprised by how much it can help! Harness the Power of Music to Increase Productivity Music can help us focus and get into “the zone” when performing tasks. Many people find that they work more efficiently when they listen to music with headphones. When you’re listening to music, it’s easier to block out distractions from your environment, which can help you concentrate better. In addition, music can also energize you and help you push through difficult or tedious tasks. Experiment with Music Therapy The use of music as a therapeutic tool is well-established. Music therapy involves using music to improve mental, emotional, and physical health. It’s a discipline that’s been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD, among others. You don’t need to be an expert to implement music therapy in your life – you can start by identifying your current emotional and mental state and selecting music that will correspondingly match it. It’s as simple as that (though working with a professional never hurts, either!). Use Music as a Tool to Help You Reach Your Goals A key step in using music to regulate emotions and improve decision-making skills is to identify your goals. Once you know what you want to achieve, you can use music as a tool to help you get there. For example, if you’re trying to stay focused and productive, listen to instrumental music or a playlist that’s designed to help you concentrate. Or, if you’re trying to relax and de-stress, listen to calming songs or nature sounds. Aim for Balance in Your Playlist When creating your playlist for emotional regulation and decision-making, it’s important to aim for balance. Don’t just include songs that make you happy or sad, but also songs that evoke a range of emotions. This will help you stay in touch with your emotions and develop more emotional intelligence and regulation skills. Use Music to Help You Channel Your Frustrations If you’re feeling frustrated or angry, listening to aggressive music might help you release those emotions in a healthy way. However, it’s important to note that this method isn’t for everyone and can backfire. For some people, aggressive music might make them more agitated. Instead, try listening to music that’s high energy, upbeat, or transformative to help you channel your frustrations in a positive way. Get Up and Move to the Beat Music can be a powerful motivator when it comes to physical activity. If you’re feeling sluggish or unmotivated, listen to some upbeat music and get up and move. Dancing, going for a walk, or doing some other physical activity while listening to music can help boost your mood and improve your decision-making skills. Plus, it’s a fun way to integrate music into your daily routine. Consider Your Listening Environment Your surroundings can have a significant impact on how you experience music. For instance, listening to soothing music in a peaceful environment can help you relax and reduce anxiety. At the same time, playing upbeat music in a high-energy setting can boost your motivation and productivity. Before selecting a playlist or tuning into your favorite radio station, consider the situational context and your desired response. Leverage the Benefits of Evaluative Conditioning Evaluative conditioning is a cognitive strategy that involves pairing a particular stimulus (in this case, music) with a specific response to create an association and influence your behavior. By exposing yourself to music that aligns with a particular mood or state of mind, you can condition your mind to link the two together. For example, when you need to focus and concentrate, playing background music that helps you tune out distractions can train your mind to recognize these cues and gear into productivity mode. Listen to the Lyrics (or Write Some of Your Own) Music is not just the melody, beats, and rhythm- it’s also about the lyrics. The words in a song can convey a powerful message and shape your perspective. Listening to lyrical music that aligns with your emotions or writing your songs can be a form of catharsis and an excellent way to express yourself. Moreover, it can help you process challenging emotions and give you a sense of control. Consider Executive Function Skills Coaching to Unlock More Benefits and Strategies Executive function skills, such as decision-making, planning, and problem-solving, can be enhanced through music. Executive function skills coaching can equip you with valuable tools to leverage music as a way of regulating emotions and enhancing decision-making skills. A coach can help you identify triggers and create unique music playlists based on your personality, needs, and cognitive strengths. TL;DR – (Too Long, Didn’t Read) Music has always been a significant part of human society, and it has many positive effects on our mental well-being. It helps us regulate our emotions, enhances our decision-making abilities, increases our concentration, and boosts our motivation. As a result, incorporating music into our daily routine can dramatically improve our mental health. So the next time you’re feeling down, need motivation, or want to focus on a task – put on some good music and let its magic work wonders for you.
