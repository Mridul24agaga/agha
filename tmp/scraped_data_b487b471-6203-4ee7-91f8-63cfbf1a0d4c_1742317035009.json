When crafting your pitch, remember to be concise, compelling, and respectful of the curator's time. Start by researching their preferences and the type of music they feature to make sure your track is a good fit for their playlist. After you've found contact details for your preferred sites, personalise your message by addressing curators by name and expressing your appreciation of their work. Highlight the key aspects of your music - think genre, style, and your personal music story. The more effort you put into this before pitching, the better chance you stand of gaining more Spotify playlist followers. ‍ ‍ You should also be providing clear links to your music and include a well-crafted press kit or EPK (electronic press kit) with all relevant info about your background, career achievements, and any notable magazine reviews or features. Tip: Try searching '@hotmail.com' or 'gmail.com' in your Spotify search bar and check Playlists results to find independent playlist owner contact details. Keep your message professional and always follow the curator's submission guidelines. A well-thought through and tailored submission pitch can massively increase your chances of securing a spot on their playlist. Only work with legit playlist curators and sites Although there are many independent playlist curators out there that do have your music's best interest at heart, you should also be wary of fraudulent playlist accounts.

Streaming platforms like Spotify have specific teams in place to fight fraudulent playlists, with accounts and artists associated with these facing hefty penalties - including full removal from the platform. Basically, it's just not worth the risk. ‍ ‍ Now you know what you should be putting together and the accounts that you should be looking out for, it's time to start sending off your pitches.

      "content": "Blog › Spotify Promotion Spotify Playlist Pitch: Guide, Tips, Examples and Best Practices Table of Contents Spotify can be your golden ticket if you’re an artist looking to climb the ranks and make it big in the music industry. With its vast collection of popular playlists, Spotify gives all artists an equal opportunity to get playlist placements and reach a global audience. However, in addition to knowing how to make the most of your Spotify artist profile, you must understand how to write a perfect Spotify playlist pitch to get featured by independent Spotify playlist curators. This article will provide key strategies for preparing a winning pitch and increasing your visibility, listener engagement, and music career. You’ll also learn more about SoundCampaign, a Spotify promotion service that allows you to pitch your songs to playlist curators, boost your reach, increase your streams, and grow your fanbase. So, let’s dive in! The Role of Spotify Playlists in Music Discovery Image source: Unsplash Spotify is a crucial platform for music lovers to discover artists who cater to their preferences. However, with millions of tracks available, the vast catalog can be overwhelming. Thankfully, Spotify has a team of experienced playlist curators whose musical tastes align with their followers. This allows Spotify users to find music tailored to their mood, activity or preferred listening style faster. Types of Spotify Playlists There are three types of playlists on Spotify. Editorial playlists Spotify editorial playlists are hand-picked selections of songs curated by Spotify’s in-house team of music experts rather than individual users. An editorial playlist caters to various genres, moods, activities, and themes prioritizing new music. They generally have a wider reach and higher listener engagement. Algorithmic playlists Spotify’s system generates lists such as Discover Weekly, Daily Mixes or Release Radar based on the songs users listen to, the playlists they create or use, and the artists they interact with. Compared to editorial playlists, algorithmic playlists offer a more personalized and dynamic listening experience. User-created playlists User-created playlists, also known as listener playlists, are the heart and soul of the music discovery experience on platforms like Spotify. Unlike pre-curated editorial playlists or data-driven algorithmic options, user-created playlists are based on individual users’ personal tastes, moods, or even specific themes. Creating Your Spotify Playlist Pitch Image source: Unsplash Preparing your music When trying to get on Spotify playlists, it’s crucial to make your track stand out and appeal to both Spotify playlist curators and their followers. Ensure high-quality production To achieve high-quality production, you can invest in a professionally recorded music album or set up a home studio. Pay close attention to all aspects of your own music, including carefully selecting sounds and effects and ensuring that each instrument has the right depth and clarity. Select the right song to pitch Listen to and evaluate the playlists you’re targeting. You can identify the tracks’ common characteristics and determine if your songs fit. To choose the best track, consider which of your songs has performed well in live settings, achieved financial success, or received positive feedback on social media. Ensure the track is professionally mixed and mastered A high-quality mix is essential to produce a great song. It involves balancing the levels of different instruments, panning them in the stereo field, applying EQ to adjust the tonal balance, and using compression to control dynamics. Once the mix is complete, the final step is mastering. It makes the song sound consistent and polished across various playback systems and media formats. Opt for clean versions to avoid limiting playlist placement Create a clean version of your song, removing or muting explicit lyrics and replacing them with alternative phrases or words to maintain the song’s flow. It will help you promote your track effectively on Spotify and reach a wider audience. Writing your pitch Image source: Sky News Even if you have created a high-quality track, your presentation can significantly affect the outcome. Here’s how to do it right. Grab attention with a compelling opening line To create a perfect hook, start with a persuasive fact. You could mention the significant number of plays your track has received in a short time or an intriguing story about the creation of your music. A perfect example of a compelling opening line could be: “I am excited to announce the release of my follow-up single after my debut track reached [X] streams within the first month.” Define your genre and sound succinctly When discussing the sound of your music, it is essential to use precise descriptions instead of vague ones. It can be difficult when mixing genres, but it allows you to showcase your music’s originality. Example: “The track blends indie rock and electronic pop, evoking 80s nostalgia with modern flair.” Personalize pitches for each specific playlist You must explain to the curators how your track can add value to their playlists and help them grow Spotify followers. Show that you understand the genre of the playlist and explain how your track fits. Example: “After enjoying the energetic and uplifting vibe of [Playlist Name], I feel that my track, with its catchy lyrics and lively rhythm, would be a perfect addition.” Employ storytelling to make your pitch stand out Consider describing the story behind your song to add a personal touch. It can include the source of your inspiration, the related challenges you faced during the creative process, or the message you want to convey through your music. Example: “I poured my heart into this song. It’s inspired by a deep love for someone special in my life. The creative process was challenging, but I worked through the challenges and created something extraordinary. The message I want to convey through this music is that love is powerful and can conquer all obstacles.” What to include in your pitch Image source: Unsplash To write Spotify playlist pitch, you must demonstrate your talent, professionalism, and industry knowledge. Add a concise artist bio with relevant background If you are writing a factual bio, include essential information about your musical journey – from your early beginnings to your career milestones, including your upcoming releases, tours, or new musical direction you are exploring. When describing your musical style, go beyond the basics. Share a unique aspect of your music, such as a distinct songwriting approach or a defining moment that influenced your sound. It will help your fans and playlist curators understand what sets you apart. Provide easy access to your music with direct links When pitching your music to curators of popular Spotify playlists, make it easy for them to review your track. Avoid overwhelming a playlist curator with too much information. Include a link to your song and another to your Spotify for artists profile. When sharing the links, present them professionally. Instead of just pasting them, include them under descriptive text. Also, organize the links neatly at the end of your pitch after a summary and a clear call to action. Mention any press, radio play, or notable achievements Having your music recognized in a well-known blog or magazine or featured on a popular radio station or music charts can significantly impact your career. Such recognition is a strong endorsement of your music and can help you gain credibility in the music industry. Press quotes can also add value to your pitch. Additionally, notable performances showcasing your talent can authenticate your song-crafting and performing worth. It is also worth considering how to get verified on Spotify, as this can make you more legitimate in the eyes of curators. Highlight ongoing marketing efforts to support playlist promotion Curators tend to be more interested in artists who actively promote their music. To increase your chances of being noticed, plan and execute marketing campaigns that include social media, music videos, and fan engagement efforts. Collaborating with other artists, brands, or influencers can add unique angles to your story. If you are pitching an unreleased song, include the planned release date. It is essential for proper planning and scheduling. Spotify Playlist Pitch Examples and Best Practices Image source: Unsplash Here are some real-world examples of successful Spotify pitches you can find online and use for inspiration: These pitches share a common trait – they follow the best practices mentioned earlier and incorporate effective storytelling to convey their unique sound. These independent artists use an interesting genre approach to pique the reader’s interest and vivid phrasing to bring the song to life in their imagination. As a result, the curators found them attractive for their playlists.

In recent years, many of us have naturally become reliant on the well-designed algorithms of Spotify, Apple Music, SoundCloud, YouTube, etc. for music discovery. While these are all certainly powerful and can lead to great finds, algorithms alone don’t capture your nuanced taste and curiosity. And even if you keep up with new releases and charts, the albums with the biggest marketing budgets bubble to the top. It can be not only highly satisfying but also incredibly fun to venture beyond these go-to sources, dig deeper, and feel like a true curator. Circa 2013 – 2014, there was a golden age of music discovery tools and sites. That’s before streaming platforms added curated and personalized playlists. Although most of those have shut down, some great ones still exist. In this article, we share 11 online tools that you can use to supplement your music discovery process. If you love crate-digging and reading liner notes, you’ll dig these. 11 music discovery tools and websites 1. Radiooooo.com I’m obsessed with Radiooooo. The site is an interactive map for exploring the music of any region in the world through any decade, from ~1900 to now. I just listened to a stellar Tanzanian jazz song from the 1960s. You can filter options by ‘fast,’ ‘slow,’ and ‘weird.’ If you want to broaden your options, select shuffle mode. Taxi mode lets you select multiple countries and decades. Other interesting places to look are their curated playlists and community picks. And while you don’t have to, you can create an account to save songs, add songs to the database, and follow other curators. 2. Lost World Radio Musician Monk Parker created Lost World Radio for us to get lost in vinyl cuts spanning genres and generations. There are fewer options to refine your search than Radiooooo, but that’s a part of its charm. I suggest hitting play on a category of music you’ve never explored before—it’s a joyous experience. 3. Every Noise at Once Every Noise at Once presents thousands of musical genres plotted across the page in a seemingly random arrangement. However, these genres aren’t so random. The scatter plot of the musical genre space is based on data tracked and analyzed for 4,322 genre-shaped distinctions from Spotify, updated daily. The site says, “The calibration is fuzzy but in general, down is more organic, up is more mechanical and electric; left is denser and more atmospheric, right is spikier and bouncier.” It was created by Glenn McDonald of The Echo Nest, a music data company acquired by Spotify. The site also provides three playlists for each country: current, emerging, and underground. 4. Bandcamp Bandcamp is a place to buy songs and records with an excellent tagging system designed for music discovery. Try exploring unfamiliar genre tags, or check out artist recommendations at the bottom of their profile pages—a feature that’s reminiscent of Myspace’s glory days. Hand-select your own curators by following other users. I follow radio show DJs, record label people, music supervisors, etc. Subscribing to Bandcamp’s expertly-curated blog is another option. Music publicist Seth Werkheiser launched a fun YouTube series where he plays ‘Bandcamp Roulette’ with recently purchased albums from the Bandcamp homepage. If falling down tag rabbit holes isn’t working for you, give it a try. A small bonus resource to check out is Buy Music Club, which is a place for creating and browsing lists of independent music purchasable on Bandcamp. Anyone can make a list, but the site curates and shares their favorites on the homepage. 5. Hype Machine I’m so happy Hype Machine still exists. Founded in 2005, the website indexes hundreds of music sites and collects their latest posts for easy streaming and discovery. Users can favorite tracks, and those with the most votes chart on the site’s Popular page. The team also collates the most-posted artists of the week and popular music videos. I highly suggest subscribing to their weekly Stack newsletter where they share hand-picked tracks curated by the team. 6. Last.fm Last.fm is a huge community of music lovers. The site takes note of what you’re listening to and makes recommendations. You can create unique libraries of your favorite discoveries, which can get lost in the shuffle on other platforms. It’s also a lot of fun to see what music is trending among the community, explore charts and new releases, and more. 7. cmd.to/fm Despite its intimidating look for the non-programmers out there, cmd.to/fm is such a fun tool for music discovery. Use a play command to enter a genre or artist, and a track is randomly generated. For example, if you typed “play disco,” a random disco track will play. You can also explore the site’s categories, distinguished by instrument and genre and organized alphabetically. 8. Indie Shuffle Indie Shuffle is another music discovery website that’s been around for many years. The site generates user-submitted tracks for discovering music from enthusiasts around the world. They also staff a team of writers to provide thoughtful context around each track. 9. Discogs Vinyl lovers have been enjoying Discogs, a music discovery and marketplace platform, since 2000. The site says, “Imagine a site with discographies of all labels, all artists, all cross-referenced, and an international marketplace built off of that database. It’s for the love of music, and we’re getting closer every day.” It’s truly a collector’s paradise. 10. Boomkat Boomkat is an independent online record store. The beautifully designed website offers a diverse collection of records with clear genre tags and album descriptions that offer writers’ unique points of view. It’s like talking to a record store clerk—without all the pretension. 11. Bleep Bleep is similar to Boomkat and Discogs. It’s an online record store with a knack for catering to music discovery. Their sister company is Warp Records, which represents Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, Battles, Flying Lotus, and many other heavy-hitters. I was on the site for three minutes and discovered Caleb Landry Jones’ The Mother Stone, which is exactly what I felt like listening to at that moment. For a limited time, access the world’s best sample library and connected creator tools for only $0.99. Other resources: Online magazines, radio, podcasts and more Beyond specifically-designed tools, there are so many places available for finding your next favorite album. The additional resources below might already be a part of your daily routine; it’s a matter of looking at them through a different lens. Journals, blogs, and magazines The big music publications still alive and kicking today include Pitchfork, Fader, Rolling Stone, Stereogum, EDM.com, Complex, NPR, Brooklyn Vegan, etc. Music journalism has changed over the years, but there will always be music lovers providing sincere journalism. Here are some more potentially lesser-known examples of those leading the charge: Gold Flake Paint: Gold Flake Paint is a curious music journal and online blog founded in 2010 showcasing writers from across the globe. They offer a heartfelt and in-depth look into their favorite new music. They feature indie music with a lean toward singer-songwriter, folk, garage, and psych (think: a lot of slide guitar), while covering a lot of ground. Bandcamp Daily: Bandcamp’s daily blog features some of the most diverse and well-written music journalism out there. It’s a music nerd’s paradise. DUMMY Magazine: DUMMY is an online platform highlighting visionary artists across rap, grime, R&B, electronic, pop, Afrobeat, and beyond. Listen to This by Jen Monroe: Submitted by René Kladzyk (who perms as Ziemba) as her favorite blog for discovering older treasures, Monroe’s write-ups are more like personal essays and are so fun to read. Aquarium Drunkard: Founded in 2005, Aquarium Drunkard features daily reviews, interviews, features, podcasts, and sessions. Digging globally, AD bridges contemporary sounds with psych, jazz, avant-garde, folk, garage, funk, and beyond. It’s for heads, by heads. The Grey Estates: Indie rock’s favorite blog shines a spotlight on the demographic diversity within the genre. You’ll find all things post-rock, punk, bedroom pop, garage rock, singer-songwriter, and beyond. The Alternative: The Alternative provide intentional interviews, reviews, premiers, and more with a focus on—you guessed it—alternative music. Various Small Flames: This team is dedicated to sharing music from independent artists, especially home recordings and DIY releases. Dancing Astronaut: Dancing Astronaut might be considered ‘mainstream’ to some, as it’s a massive resource for all types of dance and electronic music. Internet and community radio Erin Rioux recently published an excellent write-up on the value of internet radio on our own blog with a list of his favorite stations. I’m adding BFF.fm for consideration. Community radio is my personal favorite music discovery resource. The ultimate curator is the passionate DJ who knows everything about the musical niche they dedicate hours to every week. Some of my top stations include KOOP in Austin, TX, WFMU in NYC, and WMNF in Tampa Bay, FL. Of course, public and college radio are excellent resources as well. Music podcasts There are so many great podcasts highlighting new and old music available today. Check out some of our favorites here. Record / sample labels Keep up with the latest releases from your favorite record and sample labels by subscribing to their newsletters and following them on social media. Films and TV The art of pairing music to moving image is a precious one. Music supervisors and directors are a unique and special type of curator. As you’re binging your new favorite show or spending time with a film, pay close attention to the music and Shazam the songs that pique your interest. Record stores (websites) Discogs, Boomkat, and Bleep are all online record stores, but physical record stores are the OGs of music curation. And while there’s nothing that can replace the experience of browsing through their catalog in person, you can always check out their websites and sign up for their newsletters to see what their staff is excited about today.
