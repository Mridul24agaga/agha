Make a Video Updated: 12/10/24 Published: 06/16/23 Videos are integral to any marketing campaign; however, they can be tedious and difficult to create if you aren’t savvy with editing or are short on time. Fortunately, you can leverage many AI video generators to streamline your production and create content that engages your audience. But what’s the best AI video generator for your tasks? This article will explore 12 different AI video generators, their features, and how you can best use them in your next video marketing campaign. Time to press play on easier video creation. Table of Contents Can AI make videos? How to Make AI Videos Transforming Text to Video With AI What makes a great AI video generator? Best AI Video Generators Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video Can AI make videos? Yes, AI can make videos. AI video generators can instantly produce basic presentation slides with text, B-roll, and background music, all the way up to advanced videos of lifelike AI avatars “speaking” to you. AI’s impressive — but it’s not perfect. What works well with AI video generators: Video scripts. Being able to generate video scripts in a few seconds is incredible and saves so much time. Stock imagery, B-roll, and background music. Even though it still requires editing, having multimedia pulled automatically for you by the video generator makes it feel like you have an assistant. Video editing. The video editing capabilities are incredible and often beginner-friendly, which is a huge leap in the video editing world. What isn’t working (yet): Believability. The realistic AI avatars are incredibly advanced, but the mannerisms and articulation make it obvious that they're, well, AI. Pacing. Much research has been done on how quickly a video moves from scene to scene to hold viewers’ attention, and I found that not all generators factored this into their algorithms. Decision overload. The number of video templates, AI avatars, and effects available can overwhelm the editing process. AI is rapidly advancing, and some of these quirks will soon be passé. How to Make AI Videos The process for making an AI video will vary depending on the tool or platform you're using. Some generators work by analyzing and creating a video based on the script you uploaded, while others will follow a prompt typed in by the user. The key is to find a tool or generator with the features you need to create the kind of content you want. Transforming Text to Video With AI When ChatGPT catapulted to popularity in 2022, I don’t think the average marketers knew just how quickly AI video would follow. It needs to be used ethically to be useful to society, but when leveraged correctly, it’s an incredible tool. The most sought-after AI video feature is the text-to-video generator. This allows you to type in a sentence and, in a few seconds, be presented with an editable AI-generated video. I tested this feature using two different prompts: A vague prompt: “I’d like to educate viewers about AI-generated video.” A specific prompt: “I’d like to inspire beginner marketers to try AI video generation. The video should explain the benefits of AI video generators and should inspire viewers to try this new video tool.” I used HubSpot’s free AI video generator Clip Creator, and here’s what I saw. They were both high-quality videos. Both videos had appropriate stock images and music tailored to human behavior. The content was very similar for both videos. After testing many AI generators, I’ve found that a marketer’s time is better spent editing rather than making their prompt more specific. No matter how perfect your prompt feels, the end result will still require edits.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now What makes a great AI video generator? So, how does one evaluate all of the different software on the market? The best AI video tools all have a mix of these different features. Intuitive User Interface While most platforms list a long list of fancy AI features, users need an easy-to-use AI studio first and foremost. This enables a quick editing process. AI Scripts Automatically-generated video scripts save an incredible amount of time when producing video content. They turn written content (such as a blog post, email, etc.) or a prompt into spoken language. Sometimes, they even use an AI narrator to read it out loud for you. Not all software can generate video scripts, but it’s an enormous time saver. To be fair to the software that doesn’t offer this, it’s replaceable with a few clicks in ChatGPT. After trying more than a dozen AI video generators, I found the AI scripts were one of the features that made the greatest difference, along with the next feature. Factoring in Human Behavior Some software have tailored their AI to match user behavior, and some haven’t. For example, most people prefer videos with a brisk pace and visuals that don’t stay on the screen too long. In the video world, this is referred to as “pacing.” Not all software is tailored for this, and as a result, it will produce slow, lengthy slides that feel like a bad PowerPoint presentation. This isn’t a detail that software companies list on their “features” page, but it’s something that’s apparent based on the first draft of the video that the software gives you. Template Library Start from scratch? What is it, 2018? There’s no need to start from scratch with video anymore, as most platforms have built-in template libraries. Bonus points if these libraries include variation in: Intended audience. Aspect ratio. Project type. Editing Capabilities It’s normal for different software to offer different editing options, but most AI studios will cover the basics, such as: Text. Fonts. Music. Colors. Timing. Transitions. Animations. Stock footage. Different video styles. Pricing Tiers (or Free Plan) An AI video generator costs $0 to $50 a month (paid annually). All paid software includes a discount when purchasing an annual package, and the cost of month-to-month service is always higher. I know you’re on a budget — all of the suggested AI tools below are either free or include a free trial/demo. Multilingual Look for software that supports multiple languages if your business requires it. A chart comparing 11 AI Video Generators Chart comparing AI video generators Best AI Video Generators AI video generators have come extremely far in a short time. You can now make professional videos with the numerous text-to-video generation tools on the market. I’ve tried all the most popular AI video generators, so you don’t have to. Here’s what I found. 1. Clip Creator Source Clip Creator is the best AI video generator for beginners. It can be used by someone with no video experience and walks you through the video creation process painlessly. You start by answering a few basic questions (like video type), then provide a brief overview of the video you’d like to create. You can choose from video templates, which are oriented for both landscape videos and vertical videos. Then, Clip Creator uses AI to generate the text on your slides, plus the background imagery. You’re instantly given a video with editable text, stock images, background music, etc. The video creation workflow is very intuitive. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video My experience: I love how streamlined this AI video creator is. Instead of bombarding you with endless features, options, and pop-ups, Clip Creator starts simple and allows you to make any edits you need after it generates the video. Source Pros: Incredibly intuitive user interface, great customization options, and makes for a very fast and efficient AI video creator. Cons: Smaller template library than paid AI video generators, and no advanced features like realistic AI avatars. Best for: Video creation beginners and marketers on a budget. Most user-friendly interface and best free AI video generator. 2. Pictory Source Pictory is an excellent AI video generator for creators and marketers who don’t have experience creating videos. All you have to do is provide a script or article to guide your video content. For example, you can submit a blog post to the AI video creator, and Pictory will create a video based on the post that can be used for social media or your website. Furthermore, you can edit videos in minutes by using text. Pictory also includes a feature that creates shareable video highlight reels that can be used as a trailer or a short-form video for social media such as a Reel. Even better, Pictory can automatically caption and summarize your videos.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: I provided the same prompt for Pictory as I did for the Clip Creator video, and it initially generated much less content (only 1 slide). I went back and instead provided a URL of a blog post and tested the blog-to-video generator. This feature automatically creates video scripts based on a blog post, and using their realistic AI voices, I could have it automatically narrated too. The writing on every slide needed to be edited significantly to be useful, but I was impressed with the options. Pictory supports multiple languages (currently English, Spanish, French, and German) and has a huge library of AI voices. Source Prices for Pictory start at $19 per month, and users can try a 2-week free trial. Pros: Users have a lot of options for how to begin their AI-generated videos, and they can thoroughly customize the video output. Cons: The first draft of the automatically-generated videos needs heavy editing. It may be faster to let ChatGPT write a script for you and use that. Best for: Marketers and creators with limited video editing experience who want to convert content like blog posts or webinars into shareable video content. 3. Simplified Source The Simplified AI video generator transforms a long-form video into multiple AI-enhanced clips with just one click. This allows users to create videos from text and make an entirely new video using its accessible editing interface. Simplified simplifies the way we produce content by providing users with easy access to an expansive in-app library that hosts thousands of templates, all available for free. I like that it guarantees exceptional video quality and pairs this with an intuitive, user-friendly interface, ensuring that users can craft high-quality videos without sacrificing ease of use. Its comprehensive suite of features goes beyond basic editing options to include animation enhancements and multilingual translation capabilities, making it a versatile all-in-one tool for video creation. Users can save their brand settings in Simplified’s “brand book” is a great time-saving feature. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just starting, this platform equips you with everything you need to bring your vision to life. Brands like Bloomberg, DuckDuckGo, and Cashify use Simplified for their marketing needs. My experience: I prompted Simplified the same way I prompted the other video generators, and I was immediately asked to describe my target audience and provide my video topic. This was a nice step toward more personalized videos, but it required more user-generated input than Clip Creator, which had a multiple-choice intake process. If you stick to the free plan, it’s time-consuming to sift through all the features to see what’s free to use. Source Prices for Simplified include a forever-free plan. Paid plans start from $15.20 a month and are billed annually. Pros: If you pay for this AI video creator, you have many creation options at your disposal that not all other platforms offer (AI meme creation, AI image generation, AI carousel maker, etc.). Cons: Not the best free AI video generator; other platforms are more generous with their features. You’re not able to test the text-to-video generator without joining a paid plan, as you’re about to do with other features. Best for: Creators who want to create, edit, and schedule videos for all social media platforms. 4. Movavi Video Editor Source Rather than generating AI videos from scratch, the Movavi Video Editor uses AI to make video editing easier. Video editing can be a time-consuming chore; for many, it’s the less enjoyable side of content creation. However, with Movavi Video Editor’s nonlinear AI technique, you’re not just replicating traditional tool functions but also enhancing your videos through advanced AI video editing. With AI background removal, you can cut out and replace backgrounds, adding a new dimension to your visuals. Plus, the AI noise removal feature enhances audio quality by automatically eliminating unwanted sounds, ensuring your videos are of the highest standard. Source The app also offers a host of advanced options like PiP, chroma-key, titles, keyframing, motion tracking, and more. Following the free 7-day trial, paid plans start at $49.95 per year. Pros: The presence of built-in training rapidly familiarizes you with the software, and it has features that many other AI video editors don’t. Cons: This AI video editor brings high-level tools (like color correction) to marketers, but total video newbies may be overwhelmed with some of the more advanced features. Best for: Creators and marketers who already have video footage and want help editing videos to be more engaging (or who just need to speed up the editing process). 5. Fotor AI Video Generator Source Fotor is an image and video editing platform that integrates various AI features, known for its creativity, intelligence, flexibility, and convenience. Its AI video generator fully utilizes advancements in AI technology, making video creation more efficient and enjoyable.

Inspiration is important for video creators. Fotor AI video generator provides preset prompts and images, helping creators find more inspiration for their videos. My experience: Fotor’s interface is very user-friendly and simple. you can quickly find the features you need without any distracting ads or clutter. It also provides detailed step-by-step instructions, making it easy for new creators to get started. While creating videos, its preset text descriptions and high-quality images inspired me creatively. They also saved me time and greatly boosted my production efficiency. Source What I found most convenient was that after generating a video, I could perform basic edits directly in Fotor and I could also use their rich AI video tools, like one-click enhancement and beautification, background removal, and object elimination. Pros: The AI video generator supports creating videos in various styles, including Photography, Cinematic, Digital Art, Anime, Neopunk, Game Art, Illustration Art, and more. Catering to various creative ideas and needs. Cons: AI may not always fully understand textual descriptions or emotions and feelings, so some videos may not appear as realistic.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now My experience: New users can input a 300-character script, and an AI avatar will read your script using the AI text-to-video generator. I found the AI models to be less convincing than others; the mouths sometimes moved between sentences, and I think all viewers could identify these as AI. However, since the advent of TikTok’s text-to-speech narration feature, the public has become more accustomed to artificial narration, and there are many situations where this type of AI would work well. Source Prices for AI Studio start at $30 per month. Pros: The platform’s intuitive features make it excellent for beginners with limited or no video creation experience. Cons: The AI Studio avatars are identifiable as being artificial. Best for: Marketing videos that need text-to-speech narration and have visuals for B-roll. 7. Veed.io Source With Veed.io, you can use custom text, colors, font, and music to create a unique video for your brand. One of its standout features is Auto Transcribe. You can upload your video, hit the Auto Transcribe button, and immediately download the script. Even better, there is no software to download, and the platform is easy to use for those without video editing experience. My experience: I entered my “Pinterest marketing for beginners” prompt, and Veed.io quickly generated a short vertical video. The AI video generator automatically provided the script, AI narration, background music, stock videos, and close captioning. The on-screen captions were really engaging, using color-changing text and emojis — perfect for social media. Source Veed.io is free to use for videos under 10 minutes. To access more features, prices start at $18 per month (when billed annually) and go all the way up to enterprise custom pricing. Pros: The pacing, on-screen captions, slang, and approach were very engaging. Cons: The stock video that was automatically inserted into the video was off-topic at times but can be easily edited. Best for: Short-form videos designed to hold attention on social media. 8. Synthesia Source Synthesia's AI video generator enables users to create professional videos without requiring cameras, actors, or studios. Users can generate videos featuring realistic AI avatars that deliver content in over 140 languages by simply inputting text. This makes it an ideal tool for efficiently and at scale creating training materials, sales and marketing content, and internal communications. My experience: Synthesia's intuitive interface and extensive customization options make video creation straightforward. The platform's diverse range of avatars and multilingual support allowed me to produce engaging content tailored to a global audience. The quality of the AI-generated avatars is impressive, closely mimicking human expressions and speech patterns. Synthesia offers a free plan that includes 3 minutes of video per month, 9 AI avatars, and access to AI voices in 140+ languages. Paid plans are available for users requiring more features. Pros: Synthesia simplifies video creation with its intuitive interface and realistic AI avatars. Its support for over 140 languages makes it an excellent tool for creating global content. Cons: The free plan has limited features and is suitable only for basic use. Best for: Businesses and individuals seeking to create professional training videos, marketing content, or internal communications featuring AI avatars, especially when targeting a multilingual audience. 9. Elai.io Source Elai is simple and requires no video editing skills. To use Elai, copy and paste a blog post URL or HTML text, choose a template from its library, and let the generator do the rest. This AI video maker is specialized in corporate learning. Once the video is complete, review it to make any changes before rendering and downloading it. My experience: I found that Elai's format is unique. Even though the AI avatar doesn’t pass as a real human, its small display size makes it feel less distracting. The avatar compliments these videos instead of dominating them. I also really like the audio options: you can upload an audio file of you speaking, and Elai will generate a realistic AI avatar to narrate the text. Source Elai has over 60 languages and 25 avatars to choose from. You can use Elai for free with a 1-minute credit. For more features, Elai’s plans start at $23 per month (billed annually). Pros: As a specialized AI video generator, this tool allows you to quickly create training videos for new hires or product onboarding videos. Cons: Being a platform specialized for educational videos, it would be more time-consuming to create general marketing videos. Best for: Generating videos at scale and creating training videos and product videos. 10. Colossyan Source Colossyan provides a diverse range of avatars who can recite your script in various languages. You can also customize your avatar’s outfit. Colossyan’s key features are auto translations, subtitles, and the ability to enhance messages via screen recording. My experience: The AI avatar options from Colossyan are advanced. You can add multiple AI avatars to a single video screen in the video creation workflow, starting a “conversation.” You can even customize the pauses between speakers. Source There’s a free trial, and the prices start at $19 per month (when billed annually). Pros: The advanced avatar options make this a highly customizable AI video generator. Cons: The sound of the AI narrators isn’t the most natural-sounding. Best for: Creating training videos and explainers for workplace learning. 11. FlexClip Source This AI video generator features hundreds of video templates, AI-generated subtitles, background remover, and a text-to-speech engine. And its intuitive interface makes it simple for creators at any skill level. My experience: I created my video by inputting a URL and letting FlexClip automatically pull content from my website. The AI generator took an enormous amount of work out of the video creation process, but still required editing. The pacing of the video was slower than other AI tools, but I was able to easily customize all elements of the video. Source After the free plan, pricing starts at $9.99 per month (when billed annually, which saves 50%). Pros: The basic plan's price point makes this a very budget-friendly AI video generator. It is also a great, straightforward option for beginners who don’t want to feel overwhelmed. Cons: The AI-generated first draft requires more editing than some of the other platforms. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. Best for: Creating videos for internal communication and product promos. 12. Wave Video Source Wave Video is a popular choice among content creators thanks to its many tools, which include image and video assets, text overlay effects, audio, and captions. The platform also provides a variety of video formats for Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and website-based applications. Other key features are: Text-to-video AI. Video hosting. Voiceovers. Text-to-speech. Millions of stock assets. My experience: I tested Wave Video by inserting a blog post URL and letting the AI video generator populate text and graphics based on the content. The video background graphics, pacing, and text populated on the slides needed significant editing to be ready for viewers. I like how easy it is to change the video format and edit any of the content. Wave Video also has many live-stream video tools. Source Wave Video is free, with monthly plans starting at $16 (paid annually). Pros: The features of this software are very beginner-friendly, and the user interface doesn’t feel overwhelming. Cons: The stock images it pulled were lower quality than the other AI tools. The images were blurry and stayed on screen much too long before switching slides (video pacing needed editing). Best for: Livestream videos. Making the Most of AI Video How will AI-generated video help your brand? With just a few clicks, you can create amazing videos, which was unimaginable a few years ago.

Pictory 2. Synthesys 3. Synthesia 4. Deepbrain 5. Invideo 6. HeyGen 7. Veed 8. Fliki 9. Colossyan 10. Elai 11. Runway 12. Visla 13. Hour one The 4 best AI video generators Final thoughts Last updated on 6th June 2024 AI tools are popping up everywhere these days. In fact, according to our AI in Marketing Statistics 2024, 80% of marketers have used – or currently use – AI tools to help them create marketing content. But, of course, not every AI tool is worth your time. We tested 13 AI video generators – looking at things like quality, load time, cost, and more – to really separate the best from the rest. Sure, all of these AI tools have their own impressive marketing videos. But we dug beyond that, really testing out the features for ourselves, in order to find out what the final product really looks like. So, if you’re looking to explore AI video generation in 2024, read on to find out which is the best platform to invest your time and money into. Why use AI video generators anyway? The best AI video generators are going to help you save time and money while increasing your video content output. Note that we said ‘increasing’ – an AI video generator should not be your sole way of making video content. The technology just simply isn’t good enough yet. And consumers are EXPERTS on video content these days. They sure watch enough of it! Statistic People on average watch 17 hours of online video content per week. Source: Wyzowl Video Marketing Statistics 2023 Viewers will 100% know the difference between AI generated videos and videos created by experts. It’s hard enough getting people to watch a professionally made video all the way through so don’t waste your time trying to get people to watch a bunch of AI content. Our Insight By all means use AI video generators to convert your blog articles into videos or for fun short-lived social content, but NOT to create the explainer video that introduces your brand to the world. The 13 AI video generators we tested 1. Pictory Pictory is an AI tool that makes it easy for you to turn other forms of content into highly shareable videos. Pictory has a lot of useful guides that really do make it easy to get started with AI video. And the platform holds your hand while you’re making your first video – but not in a way that’s annoying or overbearing. The finished video project was…okay. But the reliance on stock footage and simple transitions means that videos made on Pictory won’t really stand out among the crowd. Plus, the closing watermark is unnecessarily long. Pros: – Easy to use – It’s fast – The voiceovers sound real Cons: – A lot of the video assets are for paying users only, which makes it difficult to get a true experience on the free trial Pictory Pricing Starter – $23/month Professional – $47/month Teams – $119/month Our rating 2. Synthesys Synthesys is a platform for creating AI content at scale. Using only text, you can create voiceovers, videos, and AI generated images. There’s a large array of templates that make it really easy to get started. However, this could also make it harder to differentiate your videos from ones that other users have created. For the purposes of this article, we created a vertical video that would be perfect for social media. The platform is easy enough to use but does feel slow and kind of clunky in places. Unfortunately, the AI voiceover got the platform’s own brand name incorrect. Pros: – Easy to use – Nice templates – There’s a free plan Cons: – It’s slow and kind of clunky Synthesys Pricing Free Creator – $59/month Business – $99/month Our rating 3. Synthesia Synthesia is a text to video AI platform. You just enter your script and select from over 160 diverse avatars. You can also pick a realistic voiceover (in one of 130+ languages) and even add cool little micro details like gestures, pauses and diction. You can personalise the video background, add media, use your own brands and fonts, plus add music and transitions. All in all, you can end up with a really slick looking video here in a very short amount of time. Pros: – Micro gestures elevate the quality – It’s fast – Huge selection Cons: – The lip syncing could be better Synthesia Pricing Free Starter – £23/month Creator – £69/month Enterprise – Enquiries only Our rating 4. Deepbrain Deepbrain is another AI video generator that specialises in text to video and realistic-looking avatars. You just enter your script, select an avatar, add any finishing touches, et voila – you have a video! There’s a lot of choice when it comes to the avatars and voices, plus you can convert text to speech in over 80 different languages right within their script editor. The script editor is also integrated with ChatGPT so you can even use it to generate ideas for your videos. Overall, the tool is quick, easy to use, and quite intuitive when creating your video. However, processing time can be slow and we were honestly disappointed with the end result after testing others on the list: Pros: – Integrated with ChatGPT – Large selection of languages, voices, and avatars – Easy to use Cons: – The resulting video looked quite unnatural Deepbrain Pricing Starter – $30/month Pro – $225/month Enterprise – Enquiries only Our rating 5. Invideo Invideo is an online video editor that allows users to create videos with text prompts. The platform uses AI to generate visuals and a voiceover to match your script. Alternatively, if you don’t have a script then the AI can help you create one from a single prompt. However, we asked for a 10 second script and were given a 35 second one so it’s necessary to edit your script to fit your specific requirements. We found this AI video generator difficult to use, to be honest. The templates are very specific to certain industries and topics, and even if you do start from scratch you have to let Invideo present you with visuals first before you can start tweaking and changing them. Plus, the suggestions given were pretty random. Take this scene with the racecar, for example. The audio paired with this also sounded like a babbling brook – interesting choice! You might be asking why we aren’t sharing a video for this one and that’s because you can’t export your files without upgrading to a paid plan. You can share via a link, but the link expires quickly. We definitely weren’t wow-ed by this one. Pros: – AI helps give you a head start – There’s the option to make vertical videos Cons: – No free plan – Feels clunky and hard to use Invideo Pricing Business – $30/month Unlimited – $60/month Our rating 6. HeyGen HeyGen is an AI video generator that makes it easy and fun to produce studio-quality videos with AI-generated avatars and voices. This platform is so slick and intuitive. It’s a joy to use, you can go for landscape or portrait videos, and you can even use the CEO as an avatar for your video – which is what we did! You can get started from scratch or use a template. The video editor is user-friendly and the only gripe we had was that it wasn’t obvious how to find stock assets. However, once we found those (under Elements > Video/Image > See all) we didn’t have any complaints. There’s no option to preview the lip sync functionality (although that seems standard for the industry) before you’ve rendered your video. But when you do – wow. We think HeyGen might have the best AI lip syncing out of every platform on the list. The avatar looks super natural while not giving off that ‘uncanny valley’ feeling that some others do. Pros: – You can play around for free – Impressive avatars and AI voices – Super intuitive Cons: – It’s one of the more expensive platforms on the list HeyGen Pricing Free Creator – $59/month Business – $179/month Enterprise – Enquiries only Our rating 7. Veed Veed is a popular online video editing tool with tons of amazing features, but for the purposes of this article we’re going to focus solely on their AI offering. As you’d expect from Veed, the AI video generator is intuitive and easy to use. You can create basic videos pretty quickly either using your own voice and stock footage or with an AI avatar. The AI voiceovers are realistic and so are the avatars, with the lip syncing standing out as particularly impressive. Pros: – You can get started for free – Super easy to use – Transcription and subtitles are completely auto-generated Cons: – Limited customisation options Veed Pricing Free Basic – £10/month Pro – £18/month Business – £49/month Our rating 8. Fliki Fliki is an AI video generator that can create complete videos from just simple ideas. All you need to do is enter some text that describes what you’d like your video to be about, select the length and aspect ratio, and you’re good to go. Of course, as with any AI video generator, you’ll want to personalise your video a little. But the fact that Fliki gives you the bare bones to get started with can be a real time saver. The software itself can create professional-looking videos that have awesome subtitles and AI-generated voiceovers. However, when you’re looking to add your own personal touch to the video you may struggle on the limited free plan. Pros: – So quick and intuitive – Realistic voiceovers – Great automatic subtitling Cons: – You need a paid account to benefit from a more extensive stock footage library and AI avatars Fliki Pricing Free Standard – $21/month Premium – $66/month Our rating 9. Colossyan Colossyan is an AI video platform aimed at companies that want to create workplace learning and training videos. There are lots of templates to choose from or you can create your video from scratch. The editor is simple and easy to use, giving users the option to select different avatars, add background elements, text, music, and more. Like other AI platforms, you can’t see what the lip sync of the AI avatar is going to look like until the video is rendered. Speaking of rendering, we found Colossyan somewhat slower than other tools in this area. Pros: – User-friendly platform – AI avatars look great and natural – Generous stock assets library Cons: – Slow to render and it’s unfortunate that the pronunciation of AI is incorrect in the video we made – No free version Colossyan Pricing Starter – $27/month Pro – $87/month Enterprise – Enquiries only Our rating 10. Elai Elai is everything you could want in an AI video generator, and then some. The site is clean and easy to use. You can create your video from a template, from an AI storyboard, or using an AI avatar. We decided to start with the AI storyboard because we hadn’t seen that offered on other platforms. All you need to do to get started is enter a topic: Elai then generates a video outline that you can adjust as needed. Once you have your storyboard, you can of course make further edits. You can make wholesale changes or use AI to make quick and easy adjustments, like ‘make it shorter’ and ‘sound happier’. When you’re happy with your video, you can render the finished product in 4K. Overall, we found Elai to be a really intuitive and impressive AI video generator. Pros: – Easy to use – Quick and intuitive – Impressive range of features Cons: – The free package does have limitations Elai Pricing Free Basic – $23/month Advanced – $100/month Enterprise – Enquiries only Our rating 11. Runway Runway is kind of different to the other video generators on this list. To create a video you need to upload an image and then add a text prompt, like so: Now, you’re probably thinking: ‘Hmm, it doesn’t sound that different?’ But it’s what comes next that’s different. Other video tools on this list seem to use AI to create fresh ideas using prompts as inspiration, whereas Runway adds animation to the actual image itself, like this: You can use a motion brush to control different areas of the video, but this still gives very limited movement options. You may think the video with the puppies doesn’t look too bad. But we found that using humans makes things a whole lot creepier: The prompt for this one was ‘the writer drinks her coffee’ Now, is it better when just using a text prompt (no images)? …no. Pros: – You can play around for free – It generates new content quickly Cons: – There’s much better technology out there – It’s way too creepy – Very limited customisation Runway Pricing Free Standard – $15/month Pro – $35/month Unlimited – $95/month Enterprise – Enquiries only Our rating 12. Visla Visla is an AI video creation and editing service that allows users to generate videos using high quality stock footage. You can generate videos from blog articles, scripts, or simply a written or spoken idea. The platform works quickly and it’s easy enough to edit videos. The biggest difficulty we found as users on the Free plan is that Visla highlights the premium features and assets first, so it can be difficult to find one suitable to use on the free plan. Unfortunately, this platform has no AI avatars on offer and the watermark at the end adds almost 5 seconds to your video. Pros: – It’s free to get started – It’s fast – Different languages (including German, Italian, Spanish, and more) are supported Cons: – Animated watermark adds length to the video – It can be difficult to find free features and assets Visla Pricing Free Premium – $24/month Our rating 13. Hour one Hour One claims to help users ‘create, manage, and streamline cinematic AI avatar videos.’ And the platform really is slick. It’s quick and easy to get started for free, and you can even clone your own voice for the voiceover. One of the downsides of the platform is that it can be slow to render videos, but it does keep you updated on progress. The lip syncing is impressive but lacking in emotion. Unfortunately, you can’t download without paying for premium so we have no example to show for Hour One. Pros: – Get started for free – Impressive lip syncing – Slick, easy-to-use platform Cons: – You can’t download videos on the free plan Hour One Pricing Free Lite – $30/month Business – $112/month Enterprise – Enquiries only Our rating The 4 best AI video generators 1. Elai – It’s really user-friendly and intuitive, plus you can get started for free. 2. HeyGen – Super impressive AI avatars and voices. It’s easy to get started with templates. 3. Veed – It’s free, quick, and easy to make professional-looking videos. 4. Synthesia – So easy to use and tons of realistic AI avatars to choose from. Final thoughts All of these AI video generators have pros and cons, and we’re sure that the best choice will be completely different for everyone. It all depends on your budget and requirements.

An AI video tool is software that uses artificial intelligence to assist in creating, editing, or refining video content. These tools use advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to automate complex tasks, improve efficiency, and improve the overall quality of video production. AI video generator capabilities often include automatic editing, scene detection, video summarization, special effects, and personalized content recommendations, making video production more accessible for users with varying levels of expertise. Benefits of using an AI Video tool for content creation According to a recent report, about 92% of video marketers think video content results in increased return on investment (ROI). AI video tools transform video production by facilitating faster turnaround times, reducing production costs, and increasing experimentation and innovation. Let’s explore the key benefits of AI video generators for content creators. 1. Increased efficiency AI automates repetitive tasks like editing out pauses and applying effects, reducing production time. Videos that once took days can be completed in hours or even minutes, allowing for faster content creation. 2. Effortless personalization AI can analyze data to tailor videos to individual viewers. Imagine educational content that adjusts difficulty based on a student’s progress or marketing campaigns with product recommendations specific to a customer’s browsing habits. Personalization allows deeper engagement and increases the impact of your message. 3. Accessibility for all AI video generators with user-friendly interfaces empower non-technical creators to produce high-quality videos. Pre-built templates and drag-and-drop functionality make video creation intuitive and accessible, democratizing the content creation process. 4. Global reach with localization AI can translate scripts and generate captions, breaking down language barriers and expanding your video’s reach to a worldwide audience. This allows you to cater to international markets and maximize the potential of your content. 5. Content experimentation at scale AI facilitates A/B testing of different video elements, enabling data-driven decisions about what resonates best with your audience. This allows you to experiment with various video parts, like introductions or calls to action, to optimize your content marketing for maximum engagement. Potential challenges of using AI video tools for content creation While AI video tools offer compelling benefits, it’s essential to understand the potential challenges of this evolving technology. Let’s discuss some key considerations when using AI video generators for content creation. 1. Ethical considerations and bias AI algorithms are trained on existing data, which can perpetuate societal biases. Be aware of potential biases in the AI’s output, such as gender or racial stereotypes, and actively mitigate them to ensure fair and inclusive content creation. 2. Copyright concerns AI tools that generate content based on existing data can raise copyright issues. Understand the legalities of using copyrighted material within your AI-generated videos and ensure proper attribution where necessary. Also, consider AI privacy and consider the ethical implications of using AI in your creations to avoid stepping into legal gray areas. 3. Creative control and nuance While AI excels at automation, capturing the human touch of storytelling and emotional resonance can be challenging. Nuances in humor, sarcasm, or cultural references may be missed by AI, requiring creators to carefully curate the creative direction and emotional tone of their videos. 4. Quality concerns AI-generated videos often struggle with maintaining consistency and realism, particularly in complex scenes or with nuanced human expressions. Additionally, AI systems are susceptible to hallucinations, fabricating details or producing false information. Key factors to consider when choosing an AI video tool A recent study shows that as many as 91% of consumers want to see more online video content from brands, To harness the full potential of AI for your video creation needs, here are some key factors to consider as you choose the right AI video tool for your business: 1. Functionality and your business goals AI has made it possible to generate professional-looking videos from scratch. Here are some key functionalities to consider: Text-to-video: This feature allows you to create videos based on a written script or storyboard. The AI engine analyzes the text and generates visuals, music, and even narration, saving you significant time and resources. Consider the level of detail and creative control offered by the text-to-video functionality. Multimodal AI: Does the tool leverage multiple forms of generative AI, such as speech recognition and natural language processing, to improve your video creation process? Multimodal AI can automate tasks like generating captions, translating languages, and optimizing audio for different platforms. Hyper-personalization: This feature allows you to tailor your video content to specific audiences. Can the AI tool personalize visuals, narration, or music based on viewer demographics or preferences? 2. User interface and ease of use Even with powerful AI capabilities, a complex user interface can hinder productivity. Evaluate the tool’s ease of use. Consider factors like: Learning curve: How quickly can you become comfortable using the tool’s core functionalities? Intuitive interface: Is the interface clear, well-organized, and easy to navigate? Drag-and-drop functionality: Does the tool allow intuitive video editing through drag-and-drop actions? Template options: Does the tool offer pre-built templates to jumpstart the creation process, especially for beginners? Collaboration features: Can you easily collaborate with team members on video projects within the tool? 3. Output quality and control The quality of the final video is crucial. Assess the tool’s ability to generate: High-resolution visuals: Does the AI produce crisp, clear video outputs that meet your professional standards? Natural-sounding audio: For narrated videos, is the AI-generated narration clear, and engaging? Or is it artificial and robotic-sounding? Customization options: Does the tool allow you to refine the AI-generated content to your liking? Can you adjust video styles, music choices, or voiceovers? 4. Pricing and scalability AI video generators come with a variety of pricing models. Consider: Subscription plans: Do they offer tiered plans catering to different needs and budgets? Pay-per-use options: Are there options for occasional users who only need the tool for specific projects? Scalability: Can the tool handle your current and future video production needs as your business grows? 10 AI video tools to elevate your content creation AI video generators can significantly elevate your video production game from automating tedious tasks to crafting personalized content.
