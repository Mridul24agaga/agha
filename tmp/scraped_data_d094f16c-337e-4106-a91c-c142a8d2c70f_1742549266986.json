Text-to-Video Content Generation Many users do not have coding experience or the time to learn the finer details of video software. That’s why many AI video generation tools include text-to-video content generation capabilities, allowing users to easily turn their scripts or other written text into video content that may include human-looking AI avatars, AI voices, and other elements that create a professional-looking and sounding video. Vocal and Audio Synthesis With an AI video tool, AI speech and audio synthesis make it so any number of videos can be made without a human actor or voice. These platforms take text or rough-spoken recordings and transform them into video-ready voices that are synthetically generated. These voices should be available in a variety of languages and, in most cases, users are able to adjust the tone, pitch, accent, and other elements of speech to make the voice sound more believable. Video Templates A number of AI tools now give users a baseline video template from which to build their video content. These templates may focus on specific industry use cases, a certain social media or digital platform, or a video format with animation or transitional elements. Users can often customize these templates and add their own branding, but the video template gives them the creative ideas and basic design to get started. AI Avatars Many businesses do not have the budgets to pay actors or employees to act as talking heads for brand videos, but they nonetheless want the personal touch of an onscreen personality. AI avatars can be developed to match different appearances, genders, and other expectations, with personalities, tones, accents, and other unique features added to synthetic voices. The best AI avatar solutions create natural-looking avatars and give users the ability to custom-create their own avatars. These avatars can be used for personalized sales and marketing videos, e-learning and training videos, and other forms of media that benefit from a friendly face. Low-Code/No-Code Usability and Video Editing Regardless of how much work AI features can do to put together the final product, users typically want some hands-on control over the video creation and editing process. To make this as simple as possible, most AI video generation tools provide a low-code/no-code user interface, giving customers the ability to adjust slides, audio and visual elements, and other pieces of their video with a drag-and-drop editing tool. How I Evaluated AI Video Generator Tools In comparing and contrasting AI video generator solutions, I scored each option against six key criteria for teams and businesses needing robust yet cost-effective features. From there, I divided each category into weighted subcriteria and assigned an overall score out of five to determine the winner for each category. Evaluation Criteria In scoring the AI video generator solutions, I placed the most emphasis on core features and enterprise features, as top software options should provide standard and advanced capabilities. I also evaluated each platform’s pricing, customization, ease of use, and customer support. Core Features (25 percent): The best AI video generation tools give users the standard capabilities and features necessary to create compelling marketing, sales, training, and customer service videos. Criteria Winner: Invideo Enterprise Features (20 percent): Although many other AI video generation tools exist for casual mobile users and use cases, I mostly steered away from those tools in favor of platforms that offer enterprise features such as multi-language support, automated scene selection, and feedback and optimization. Criteria Winner: Synthesia Pricing (20 percent): When considering the cost of video generation tools, I looked for both affordability and a range of subscription options. In terms of affordability, I sought out tools that offered free versions and/or useful demos and trial periods. Criteria Winner: Lumen5, VEED Customization (15 percent): Flexible platforms allow you to create hyper-targeted videos for specific audiences. I assessed if each tool offers a wide range of customizable avatars, fonts, transitions, voices, and templates. Criteria Winner: Invideo, Lumen5 Ease of Use (10 percent): A platform’s usability impacts user adoption and overall efficiency. Here, I evaluated each tool’s ratings across certified sites, its user interface, active user community, and knowledge base. Criteria Winner: Synthesia User Support (10 percent): For this category, I looked into support channels for each AI video generator via live chat and email and also looked into real user ratings from reputable sites. Criteria Winner: Synthesia Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Find answers to some of the most common questions about AI video generators below: *How Do I Choose the Best AI Video Platform for My Business?*Choosing the right AI video software for your business can feel like an overwhelming process, especially in a market that is increasingly saturated with viable solutions. The best way forward is to consider which features are most important to you, who will be using this software, and what your budget looks like for these requirements. Pay close attention to user reviews on each tool you’re considering, particularly noticing any comments on ease of use or team-based capabilities. For the best possible outcome, reach out to your top vendors to request a product demo and, if possible, see if they can cater that demo to your organization’s specific wants and needs. Going through this preselection process will typically save you time and money in the long run, as you’re less likely to make multiple switches mid-subscription. *What Is an AI-Generated Video?*An AI-generated video is a piece of video content with audio, voices, images, footage, graphics, and other elements that are created with AI rather than by human manipulation. The main use cases for AI-generated video include text-to-video generation and AI-driven video editing. *Can I Use ChatGPT to Make Videos?*No, you cannot directly use ChatGPT to make videos. However, you can generate video scripts and images that can be used in AI videos. Some AI video tools are also integrated with ChatGPT to make text and script generation run more smoothly. Bottom Line: AI Video Generators AI video generators simplify digital marketing and communication, helping users complete many of the most complicated video tasks, ranging from editing footage and audio to creating shorter clips and summaries from long-form content. This type of tool enables greater scalability and a simpler approach to multichannel content creation.

How to create AI videos with Renderforest Our AI video generator makes creating videos a walk in the park. Just click ‘Generate AI Video,’ and our tool will do all the heavy lifting. Choose your flow There are two flows to choose from: turning your ideas into videos or turning your texts into videos. In the idea-to-video flow, you start by typing your idea in the provided text box. This can be anything from a simple blog post summary to a complex business presentation. The AI will then give you a customizable outline as the foundation for your video. If you already have a script, the text-to-video flow lets you enter it directly, skipping the outline step. In both cases, you can create a professional video in minutes—whether you have a fully formed script or just a concept. Customize Before your video is generated, you’ll have the opportunity to tailor it to your specific needs. In the idea flow, you can set the tone to match your message, choosing from options like formal, friendly, informative, or creative. Pick a narration style and voice that fits perfectly, and select visual themes and character styles that match your brand’s look. Generate When you’re ready, hit the “Do Magic” button and let the AI work its thing. It will turn your ideas or script into a complete video with animations, transitions, and all the visual elements you’ve chosen. The AI takes care of the hard work so you can focus on your content. Edit After the AI generates your video, you can polish it in the video editor. Use the timeline to navigate through different parts of your video and make adjustments to colors, fonts, layouts, and timing. You can also change any text-to-speech (TTS) options and pick from a variety of professional voices or add your own. Make sure every detail is perfect before sharing the final result with your audience. Export and share Once you’re happy with your video, export it in the format and resolution you prefer and share it with the world. Be it for social media, a presentation, or any other purpose, your video will be ready to impress. Why use an AI video generator? AI video generators are game-changers in video creation and distribution, streamlining the process and offering accessibility for everyone. A few factors distinguish the best AI video generators for the job. Saves time AI video generators simplify content creation. Unlike conventional techniques, which can take hours or days to complete, these tasks can now be finished in minutes. These sophisticated technologies optimize the whole video production process by automating tedious tasks such as scripting, rendering, and editing. The result is a combination of efficiency and creativity that traditional video production approaches couldn’t achieve. They also speed up production timelines so you can focus on the creative and strategic parts. Uniform quality AI tools guarantee that every video generated meets predetermined quality requirements. This is especially helpful for businesses and organizations who want to project a consistent image in their content. These tools reduce inconsistencies common with manual production, where human mistakes can impact quality. AI-generated videos often meet the required quality criteria. Maintaining a professional and consistent video message strategy for a business requires this kind of quality management. Adaptability and personalization AI video generators are great at producing accurately customized material to match various needs. They can modify language and style or include distinctive, personalized elements. Plus, they constantly update information in response to audience input or new data. This is extremely helpful for industries that depend on regular updates, such as news distribution or instructional content. These tools are also useful in various industries like marketing, advertising, education, and entertainment. This proves their ability to create material that appeals to a wide range of people and accomplishes various goals. The adaptability and wide range of applications of AI video generators highlight their important role in changing content production to meet the expectations of modern digital communication. What is the best AI video generator for video creation?

Related reading: The 10 best online video maker tools of 2024 The 6 best Placeit alternatives Top 9 Veed alternatives How to start a podcast Best AI video generators FAQ How does an AI video generator work? AI video generators use machine learning algorithms to generate videos from input, such as written descriptions. These algorithms can understand and interpret the components needed to create cohesive media since they have been trained on huge amounts of previously released video material. Users provide a prompt or description, and the AI combines this data—often with stock footage, photos, text-to-speech technologies, and pre-existing templates—to create a video that complies with the requirements. This procedure often involves creating scenes, having conversations, or even including particular visual and aural components to suit the user’s demands. Can AI video generators create videos for any industry or niche? AI video generators can produce content for almost any sector or niche because of their outstanding versatility. They can use huge libraries of photos, videos, and audio files, which can be mixed and matched in infinite ways to create original material—be it for LinkedIn, your website, or maybe your YouTube channel. AI video generation tools can also generate material with specified themes, styles, or criteria for marketing, education, entertainment, or information sharing. However, the appropriateness and quality of the produced content can vary. Moreover, further modification or monitoring may be necessary for some more specialized or specific problems to guarantee correctness and relevance. How do AI video generators ensure the content is unique? AI video producers maintain uniqueness by using advanced algorithms that can produce a broad range of outcomes from given inputs. Based on the user’s specified prompts or settings, these systems creatively blend components like music, graphics, and video clips. Many AI video makers–such as an AI animation generator—also have systems to search their databases for possible copies or highly similar material to make sure the finished film is original. Be that as it may, the complex nature of the input and the variety of the AI’s training set can impact how distinctive the result is. How much does it cost to use an AI video generator? The cost of using an AI video generator can vary widely based on several factors, including the platform’s capabilities, the quality of the output, and the extent of customization required. Some platforms offer basic services for free, with premium features available through subscription plans or pay-per-video pricing models. Prices range from a few dollars for simple projects to several hundred or thousands for high-quality, professional-grade videos. The project’s specific needs, such as length, complexity, and the need for exclusive assets, will significantly influence the overall cost. Can AI video generators replace professional video editing tools? Despite their rising capabilities, AI video makers are unlikely to replace human video editors completely. While AI is capable of producing standard or templated material efficiently, human editors provide originality, human insight, and human touch that AI is not yet able to match. Experts know their way around visual narrative, emotional connection, and aesthetics—all essential components of powerful videos. Although AI video generators are useful tools, particularly for repetitive jobs or generating drafts, the sophisticated skill set of experienced video editors is still required to produce material of the highest quality.

Here’s a look at some of the best AI video tools I’ve tested, along with how to use them, who they’re best for, and how much they cost. Feb 5, 2025 8 min readAI Kirsti LangSenior Content Writer @ Buffer I took my first foray back into AI video generators when the first version of this article came out in mid-2024. I was pretty impressed with what was on offer at the time, but my initial assessment was that, while there were some helpful AI-driven features in the world of video, nothing could really change the game for me just yet. As I updated this article in 2025, let me tell you — I’ve just had my socks knocked off by some absolutely incredible AI video generators and tools. What's pretty cool, too, is that there is a huge spectrum of functionality when it comes to AI video generators, too. The artificial intelligence tools on this list can do everything from helping you remove a couple of \"ums\" to complete video creation — think entire fantasy worlds from scratch. Which is incredible because, let's be real: Creating enough video content to satisfy the TikTok, YouTube, or Instagram algorithm is not easy. Scripting, filming, editing — video requires multiple steps. Plus, all these tasks involve very different skill sets. Just because you’re great at talking to a camera doesn’t necessarily mean you’re great at editing video, and vice versa. But thanks to the ever-growing list of AI video tools, you might not have to. I spent hours testing every AI video generator and tool I could get my hands on — my computer's fan is still recovering, but don't worry, I had a great a time — and I've pulled together a pretty diverse list of some of the best. They're not ranked from best to worst — they're all really different, so direct comparison isn't really possible. Instead, I've arranged them in order of ease of use. So, whether you're a content creator, marketer, or just someone who wants to make better videos, there's something here for you. ⚡ To help compare the AI video generators and tools a little better — and create videos a marketer or creator would actually be able to use in their day-to-day work — I asked all the tools with AI video generation capabilities to create a video based on the same prompt: \"A young woman working on her laptop in a home office.\" 1. Canva Best AI video tool for generating simple AI videos without a learning curve You already know Canva for its graphic design capabilities — but did you know it also has an AI-powered video editor? Canva's Magic Studio offers AI-generated video editing tools, including text-to-video, auto-visual effects, and even AI avatars. If you’re already using Canva for design, it’s a smooth addition to your workflow. In terms of text-to-video, I was really impressed with Canva's built-in AI video generator. It worked fast, and the video clips were realistic — surprisingly so when it came to human faces and hands (AI generators' usual nemeses). Of course those AI animations on typography and other graphics are a huge timesaver, too! Fun fact: I used this feature to animate a static design for the intro to Buffer Chat: The Podcast. [cky_video_placeholder_title] Canva pricing: Free with limited features; Pro plans start at $12.99/month. 🎬 Looking for a more straightforward video editor? Here’s our list of the best video editing tools (free and paid) of 2025 → 2. Veed Best AI video tool for speeding up your workflow with AI features Veed is probably the best AI video maker for generating a complete video with AI, including voiceovers, music, and the footage itself. It even boasts an AI avatar video generator. The AI features slot into the workflow so seamlessly, too. Veed walks you through the process step-by-step rather than relying on you to add every possible detail to the prompt. This is a really nice touch, particularly for folks who don't use AI often. For example, when I fed Veed my \"woman in office prompt,\" it followed up by asking what style I'd like for my video (\"old film,\" \"realistic,\" \"hand-drawn,\" and \"Lego\" were some of the options), with some helpful examples. Beyond the text-to-image AI video generator, Veed really shines in helping you create entire videos from scratch. For example, I fed it a video script I had for a planned clip about the best time to post on TikTok. From there, I asked it to create a video with a voiceover that featured video clips of people using their phones. The result was a really great foundation for editing. I could choose my own AI voice and easily swap out some of the stock footage and background music the AI had chosen for me. Veed pricing: Free with limited features (videos will have a watermark, too); Pro plans start at $12.99/month. 3. Sora Best AI video generator for creating more complex scenes OpenAI's latest creation is taking the internet by storm, and for good reason. Forget brief clips — its AI video generator, Sora, can generate entire scenes from simple text prompts. This is thanks to its clever ‘storyboard’ feature, where you’ll create a prompt for each frame, and Sora will keep the scene consistent and coherent (unless you ask it to shift gears.) I used it to generate multi-part AI videos that were uncannily realistic — if you can forgive a wonky finger or two. Sora struggles with a few things, such as the aforementioned fingers. While the AI video generator's landscapes and abstract scenes look breathtaking, human and animal movements can still look a bit weird. The women in the above videos, for example, pulled their coffee cups right out of their laptops. But as an AI video generator for creating dreamy, atmospheric content? Sora is phenomenal. Sora pricing: Sora is available as part of ChatGPT Plus subscription at $20/month. 4. Hailuo AI Best AI video generator for experimenting with emerging AI video tech While not quite at the level of Sora or Runway (below), Hailuo is a fun way to take a no-strings-attached foray into AI video creation. The AI video generator offers decent-quality output and some unique features, like subject reference (using the same character across different videos) and advanced camera movement control. The barrier to getting up and running with Hailuo AI is really low, and you get new generation credits for free, every single day, on their free plan. I'd argue it's the best free AI video generator out right now. If you're keen to play around here, a pro tip: explore Hailuo's mindblowing user gallery of AI-generated videos to see how others have prompted the tool for the best results. Hailuo pricing: Generous free plan, with paid options starting at $14.99 per month 5. Descript Best AI video tool for transcript-based editing Descript doesn't have AI video creation features like most of the other options on this list. It’s really just a video editor — but it does that exceptionally well. Descript is the answer to the question: \"What if we could edit video like we edit text?\" Instead of dragging clips around on a timeline, you edit the transcript. Cut a sentence from the text, and the corresponding video disappears. Once you get the hang of the video editor — because it definitely comes with a learning curve — it's surprisingly intuitive and incredibly powerful. On top of that come the nifty AI features. There’s a green screen editor, a surprisingly smooth eye contact corrector (you read that script, my friend!) and even a studio sound feature that uses “regenerative AI” to remove noises and enhance voices. That said, the real magic happens with Descript's filler word removal. Those pesky \"ums,\" \"likes,\" and awkward pauses? Gone with a single click. While other tools offer similar features, Descript does it best. One caveat: if your videos don't involve much talking, you won't get the full benefit of the tool. But for podcasters, interviewers, or anyone working with dialogue-heavy content, it's a game-changer. Descript pricing: A free starter plan is available, with paid plans beginning at $12/month. 6. Synthesia Best AI video generator for creating your own AI avatar Need a talking head but don't want to be on camera? Synthesia offers over 70 AI avatars and 120 voices in its starter plan (with more than 140 avatars in higher tiers). While the avatars aren't quite ready to replace real humans in close-up shots, they're pretty effective for training videos or product tutorials. You can even create an avatar of yourself, though it's a bit of a process — you'll need to film specific video clips and wait up to 10 days for the AI magic to happen. The voice dubbing can be hit or miss, so it's worth experimenting with different AI avatar and voice combinations to find a good match. Synthesia pricing: Plans start at $22 per month billed annually. 7. Runway Best AI video generator for advanced generative AI Can you imagine it — and come up with a really thorough, detailed prompt for it? Then Runway can create it. While Runway requires a bit more technical know-how than Sora, this AI video generator packs some seriously powerful features that can turn your wildest imaginings into reality. The platform's Gen-3 Alpha model can generate videos from text prompts, bring still images to life, and even create lip-syncing avatars from voice recordings. There are practical features baked into this AI video creator, too: You can remove backgrounds, create super-slow motion footage, and generate subtitles with just a few clicks. A bit of a drawback for casual users is that Runway's Gen-2 model isn't as great at creating humans (my prompt yielded some pretty creepy Tim Burton-esque figures). The Gen-2 model is the only one you'll have access to on the free plan, but you can still use the still-image-to-video feature for free (which is exceptional). Fair warning: there's definitely a learning curve with this video generator. I spent hours exploring the web version to create videos and barely scratched the surface of what it can do. But, if you're willing to put in the time and pay for a premium plan, Runway could become your entire AI video production studio. Runway pricing: Free plan available with 125 one-time credits. Standard plan starts at $15/month, unlocking Gen-3 Alpha, 625 monthly credits, no watermark, and higher export quality. 🤖 Looking for more AI tools to help lighten the load? Here are 7 of the Best AI Image Generators, 28 AI Marketing Tools, and 9 of the Best AI Writing Tools. AI video generators won’t do all the work for you — yet Many of these AI video generators have simplified parts of my video editing workflow (and they’re incredibly fun to play around with). But, as powerful as the latest and greatest tools are, none of the options out there are going to eliminate the need for human creativity (and tenacity?) required for brainstorming, filming, and editing engaging video content. Which, if you think about it, is pretty great. There’s really no replacement for you. Still, they can certainly help lighten the load by simplifying some of the frustrating work that comes with video creation, freeing you up to focus on the creative process.

Types of AI video generation Text-to-video Veo 2 is PURE FIRE 🔥 \"A small pink liquid monster, styled like a rapper with a backward cap and chunky gold chain, performing a kickflip down a flight of stairs.

The AI interprets the prompt and generates a matching video, complete with movement, lighting, and even physics. This is by far the most popular type of AI video generation. Image-to-video Look at that VEO 2 animates windows wallpaper! pic.twitter.com/qL51V8S4oA — testtm (@test_tm7873) December 26, 2024 Image-to-video AI video generation animates static images, bringing them to life with motion effects. AI can generate smooth transitions, camera movements, or even animate characters from a few frames. Image-to-video models are popular with AI video creators because they allow you to maintain character, scene and object consistency throughout your video. You would typically use these tools alongside an AI image generator like Midjourney. Video-to-video @runwayml has 4K upscaling now! 🤯 I did a comparison between Runway GEN-3 and Topaz Video AI's upscaler, from HD to 4K. Runway's file size footprint is 40% of Topaz (using the Theia model), and after reviewing the results on a 40\" monitor, there's little to no difference in… pic.twitter.com/GamPOXq9mr — Tom Blake (@Iamtomblake) January 9, 2025 Video-to-video AI video generation uses AI to enhance, modify, or transform existing videos rather than creating new ones from scratch. This can include improving video quality, changing styles, adding special effects, or even altering elements within the footage—like removing objects, or replacing backgrounds. Some good examples of video-to-video includes Synthesia's AI dubbing (with lip sync) or Topaz's video upscaling. Th‎e best AI video generator for studio-quality videos with AI avatars Synthesia PlayCreate an AI Video in 4 Minutes with Synthesia ⚡️ Verdict: Easy to use and great for training, internal communications, marketing, outreach and localisation/translation ‎Link: ‎https://www.synthesia.io/ Synthesia is a leading AI video generator that allows you to create studio-quality videos with AI avatars that can narrate your text. It includes more than 60 video templates you can start from, and you can choose between more than 230 AI avatars that speak more than 140 languages and accents. Here's an example video I made for a product launch: PlayProduct Introduction (Free AI Video Template) Synthesia can be used to create a variety of video types, with the most common use cases being learning and development videos, including training videos and other eLearning video production. It also excels at producing onboarding videos and video content for internal communications, as well as marketing and outreach videos. Synthesia is a top-ranked AI software, with 1150+ reviews on G2 and has a rating of 4.7 out of 5. The platform is being used by 50,000 companies of all sizes, with many big names among them, such as Reuters, Zoom, and Amazon. Synthesia is a browser-based platform and I found it easy to set up my first video. I simply typed in my script, selected an avatar from their library, customized my video with the AI video editor, and then Synthesia generated a polished video featuring one of its realistic AI avatars. With over 230 avatars to choose from, I easily found options that fit different tones and purposes. You can also make a custom avatar that looks like you. Synthesia supports over 140 languages, and I was able to create localized versions of my video with ease. The platform even has a multilingual video player that automatically translates videos to viewers’ preferred languages, making it useful for global audiences. I tried adding multiple avatars on screen to simulate conversations, which worked smoothly and could be helpful for training scenarios or role-playing videos. The platform has over 60 professionally designed video templates that make it easy to produce polished content quickly. Features like live collaboration tools allow teams to work together seamlessly, while detailed video analytics provide insights into video performance. Altogether, these capabilities make Synthesia a practical, efficient choice for professional projects. One of its most popular use cases is as training video software, but it's also great for other sales and marketing videos and multilingual content. Th‎e best AI video generators for creative video production Here's my rundown of the best text-to-video and image-to-video AI video generators for creative video production. Hailuo Hailuo Director Mode is so fun. Being able to combine camera shots is just fantastic. Here shaky camera and push in. pic.twitter.com/MfqBA22vm8 — Jerrod Lew (@jerrod_lew) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best free option for creative video production Link: ‎https://hailuoai.video/ Hailuo AI is an AI video generator that delivers high-quality 6-second video clips at 720p resolution. It offers text-to-video, image-to-video and a subject reference feature. Hailuo offers a 3-day free unlimited generation period so that you can generate a bunch of videos for free and really test the tool. Subject reference is a particularly cool feature. It lets you upload a photo of a character and then generate a scene with that character in it. I found the output to be pretty accurate, although I often needed to do some manual editing to maintain coherence. The model can also take multiple attempts to get it right, which will eat into your credits. The feature also often fails at close-ups (wide shots tend to work better but lose fine details). One of the first things that stood out to me was how well it understands prompts. Hailuo seemed to nail camera movements and scene composition accurately. The image quality is also noticeably high. However, generation times are limited to 6 seconds, which makes creating longer sequences more tedious. Al‎ibaba Qwen Another day, another release. Alibaba have quietly included video generation in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max and it's really good. Here are a few examples - check them out. pic.twitter.com/u6qptO59ai — TomLikesRobots🤖 (@TomLikesRobots) January 30, 2025 Verdict: Completely free and produces high quality videos, but often with unreliable generation Link: ‎‎‎‎https://chat.qwenlm.ai/ Alibaba included an AI video generator in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max. It’s a text-to-video only tool, but it’s completely free and I’ve been impressed by the quality. The one catch is that the generation is kind of unreliable. I often enter my prompt and the video generates up to 99% complete and then gets stuck for quite a while. In my experience the videos do eventually finish generating but be prepared to wait a little. The output quality seems to be really good, and while the functionality is limited, it’s completely free and the videos have no watermark. Kl‎ing If you’re looking to combine character consistency with high-quality VFX, @Kling_ai is the best choice. 🎥✨ Version 1.5 absolutely nails VFX. A true must-have! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/rO1WvmLj3k — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) January 12, 2025 Verdict: High quality output, but very long free plan generation wait times Link: ‎https://www.klingai.com/ Kling offers text-to-video and image-to-video features, along with free video generation credits for users who log in each month. Kling brings an impressive level of fluidity and realism to movement in videos. I found the adjustable creativity and relevance slider particularly useful for fine-tuning outputs. Its biggest strength lies in image-to-video generation (and in particular its elements feature), which is far superior to tools like Runway. The motion is smoother, and the AI follows prompts accurately. When I asked for a character to blink or walk forward while the camera zoomed in, Kling delivered exactly what I asked for. If you need storytelling or consistency between frames, Kling is a great option. Kling 1.5 also supports HD, which is a nice bonus. Kling has some drawbacks, the biggest being generation speed. On the free version, I sometimes had to wait an hour or more for a single clip, and I’ve heard of free users waiting a full day for results. This is a major issue if you need quick iterations. On a paid plan the generations are quicker, but I also noticed that Kling sometimes gets stuck at 99% completion and wastes credits. At the end of the day, if you prioritize quality, accuracy, and motion control, Kling is a great choice. The motion brush tool adds extra control, and the first-attempt success rate is high, meaning I spent less time fighting the AI to get what I wanted. Ru‎nway When setting up a shot in Runway, think carefully about where to put the camera. Consider what the camera placement tells the audience about the story, about the character, and about the moment. Every angle is a decision that affects how the audience will experience it. pic.twitter.com/XnijHcb0Jv — Cristóbal Valenzuela (@c_valenzuelab) November 11, 2024 Verdict: The Gen-3 model gives you great results and some amazing advanced features that come with a bit of a learning curve Link: ‎https://runwayml.com/ Runway’s latest Gen-3 model offers a comprehensive suite of creative tools, such as text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video, alongside advanced features like motion brush, keyframes, camera controls and inpainting. On the free basic plan, you can create short text-to-video clips (up to 10 seconds long or 16 seconds using the \"extend video\" feature in the older Gen-2 model) but can’t upscale resolution or remove watermarks. You also can’t generate videos directly from text using their Gen-3 Alpha model on the free plan (only images to video). However, you can still make great videos with just the image-video feature. Here's an example workflow to show you how I use Runway’s free plan to create AI-generated short story videos: Midjourney to generate images Runway for image-to-video Suno to generate music Elevenlabs for some effects Topaz for video upscaling Capcut for editing I found Runway’s advanced features to be pretty amazing. Camera control lets you adjust angles, focus, and movement to achieve a polished, professional look. The Motion brush tool allows you to add motion and direction to specific parts of a video, which is great for creating visually dynamic social media content. Keyframes allow you to configure the starting, middle, and ending frames to create smooth transitions between them. Inpainting lets you automatically remove unwanted objects throughout your clip. This tool handled complex scenes surprisingly well; I could remove background elements without affecting the continuity of the video, something that would usually require a lot of time and expertise. However, I found that these advanced features come with a learning curve, so if you’re new to video editing you might need a bit of practice to fully utilize Runway’s capabilities. I found Runway’s video generation process to be fast and reliable. I think the pricing is reasonable given the platform’s capabilities, especially for creators, filmmakers, and digital artists who want more control and creative freedom. However, the costs might feel high if you’re only looking for basic AI video generation, as Runway is designed for those looking to push creative boundaries and explore the possibilities of AI in video production. Go‎ogle Veo Been generating impossibly dangerous stunts with veo 2 using text prompts. Still surprising how realistic they can look (though not perfect yet). pic.twitter.com/0gETBwGH5y — Ethan Mollick (@emollick) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best option for creative video production, but limited access for now (US only waitlist) Link: ‎https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/ I was blown away by Google Veo 2’s realistic video generation capabilities. Every clip I produced, from a misty jungle scene to a foggy wildlife sequence, was rendered in stunning detail, and the visual fidelity was top-notch. One of the aspects that stood out for me was the advanced cinematic controls. I could specify everything from lens types to shot angles and even adjust depth-of-field effects, which made it feel like I had an entire professional film crew at my fingertips. The dolly zoom and pan shot features, in particular, added that extra layer of cinematic flair that really brought my scenes to life. In my tests, Veo 2 consistently produced more “correct” results compared to other tools like OpenAI’s Sora. The physics simulation is fantastic with objects and characters that move and interact in a way that feels natural and true to real-world behavior. I found that character consistency was excellent too; no matter how complex the scene, the generated characters maintained their look and identity throughout the video. Veo 2 supports high-resolution outputs (up to 4K) and longer video durations too, which simplifies your workflow as you won’t need upscaling tools. The only reason why Veo 2 isn’t my top pick for creative video production is because it’s still not publicly available - you have to join a waitlist and it’s still US only. There’s also room for improvement still, and I sometimes saw some strange character movements in my generated videos. Op‎enAI Sora 🚨 It’s crazy! #Sora just dropped, and it’s already blowing everyone’s minds! 😱🎥 Here are 10 mind-blowing examples showcasing its insane possibilities. 🔥 The future of video is here. 🚀👇 pic.twitter.com/Mcq2OepO3R — Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Fun to play around with but needs to improve Link: ‎https://sora.com/ Sora is OpenAI’s entry into text-to-video AI video generation, and after spending some time with it, I’ve found it to be a mixed bag. On the one hand, when Sora works, it can deliver stunning, lifelike visuals, especially for abstract or artistic scenes. Its storyboard functionality is one of my favorite features, as it lets you prompt multiple shots in a single generation, and the “Blend” option adds a fun layer of creativity, allowing you to combine visual elements in unexpected ways. However, in my experience the model struggles with some critical aspects. Sora consistently fails when it comes to physics, general body movements, and character consistency. For example, I tried generating scenes as simple as making cats dance, only to be met with choppy motion, glitches, and overall results that were far from convincing. In several cases, the outputs felt like a gamble: some generations might be passable, but most of the time, prompts didn’t translate well into the expected actions or camera movements. I found that free or cheaper alternatives outperform Sora in accuracy and usability. There’s a steep learning curve, and despite the potential of the video-to-video remix functionality (which I’ve used to remaster some older AI-generated clips), the overall inconsistency is hard to overlook. You can access Sora on the plus plan ($20/month) which gives you 50 videos up to 720p resolution and 5 seconds long, or the pro plan ($200/month) for 500 videos up to 1080p resolution and 20 seconds long. Pi‎ka I had early access to the Pika 2.1 Model, A new journey begins, More clips to follow! @pika_labs pic.twitter.com/rN5OfMacoo — Stevie Mac (@StevieMac03) January 23, 2025 Verdict: The free plan isn’t great, but the premium plans have very good image-to-video features Link: ‎https://pika.art/ Pika offers a free plan that gives you access to Pika 1.5, which has text-to-video and image-to-video features and 150 monthly video credits. Videos can be downloaded without a watermark on the free plan. I wasn’t super impressed with the quality of the generated videos though. However, while Pika 1.5’s video output is nothing special, Pika 2.1 (available on the paid plan) offers an image-to-video feature called scene ingredients, which I think is pretty amazing. With scene ingredients you can build a shot from the exact character, object, wardrobe, and setting you want. It works by using reference images of each element and then providing a prompt. It’s similar to Kling’s elements feature in that it allows you to ensure creative consistency between scenes, which I found made it a super useful tool to produce actually usable videos. Lu‎ma First impression Luma > Sora pic.twitter.com/R2pXVsAesw — The Retro Burn (@burntheretro) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Their new Ray 2 model is great, but it’s a premium feature and it doesn’t offer image-to-video Link: ‎https://lumalabs.ai/ Luma's Ray 2 model has great motion realism and the physics feel really natural. The frame-to-frame consistency is a clear improvement over previous versions and it does an excellent job with cinematic elements, responding impressively to lighting, contrast, film formats, and camera motion. At times, it even seemed to intelligently structure shots. By using highly detailed prompts and running multiple generations, I found that it’s possible to create some truly stunning videos, though it does require some cherry-picking to get the best results. When I tested a sports car driving through snowy mountains at dawn, the scene composition was spot on and the snow, warm light, and camera tracking all felt smooth and natural. I also experimented with close-up shots of faces, and I was surprised by how well it captured emotional expressions, particularly in an extreme sadness prompt, where the eye movements and facial subtleties felt incredibly lifelike. Where Luma stands out is its ability to generate dynamic camera movements while keeping the scene coherent. It understands cinematic depth and framing in a way that makes it ideal for dramatic shots. I found that Luma is great at handling large-scale scene changes. For example, when I asked it to generate a collapsing building Luma delivered a convincing destruction sequence. Currently, Luma’s Ray 2 is only available to paid users and is capped at 720p resolution. Videos can be up to 10 seconds long, but I noticed that after about 7 seconds, scene consistency can start breaking down, occasionally shifting in unintended ways. Ad‎obe Firefly Here's another video created by Adobe Firefly.. a 3D printer, printing a car. Very impressed by the results. https://t.co/L5d8zf3TGv pic.twitter.com/ySylkRlDMS — techAU (@techAU) February 13, 2025 Verdict: Inconsistent motion and limited free use (only 2 free generations) make it hard to recommend Link: ‎‎https://firefly.adobe.com/ Adobe Firefly offers both text to video and image to video, both capable of producing 1080p clips from simple prompts or static images. Firefly struggles with distortion. I tested it by generating a video of \"a cyclist riding through a mountain trail in autumn,\" and while the colors and scenery were nice, the motion was noticeably unnatural. The cyclist's legs appeared to glitch mid-pedal, and the overall movement felt disjointed. Image to video fared better when creating abstract or background footage, but realistic human action remained a challenge. The output currently feels more like digital experiments than polished, usable content. On the positive side, Firefly's interface is intuitive. The built-in controls for adjusting camera angles, motion paths, and shot sizes make experimenting with different styles relatively simple. After generating two free videos, I was prompted to upgrade to either Firefly Standard or Pro for additional generations. While Firefly is enjoyable to explore and has clear creative potential, I’ll stick with more reliable alternatives for projects that need high-quality, natural-looking results. The best AI video generators for social media and YouTube content Fl‎exClip PlayHow to use FlexClip's AI Video Creator Verdict: User-friendly video tool with innovative AI features Link: ‎https://www.flexclip.com/ FlexClip is highly user-friendly platform that excels at helping you create professional-looking videos quickly and efficiently. I love the drag-and-drop editor. It’s perfect for creating videos on the fly without needing to spend hours on intricate editing. I’ve used it to create everything from social media content to promotional videos. The AI-powered text-to-video tool allows you to input simple text prompts, and the AI generates video clips based on the text, matching stock footage, adding text overlays, and even suggesting music. It's perfect for social media clips. While the AI can be a little hit or miss when it comes to perfectly matching footage to specific content, it’s an amazing tool for creating videos when you’re short on time or just need a draft to build upon, and I typically only need to make a few adjustments after generation. The AI script generator is another great feature. While the scripts are generally a good starting point, they often need a little fine-tuning to match the specific tone of the brand or subject matter. This is definitely a time-saver, though, especially when you’re stuck trying to put ideas into words. Another feature that impressed me was the AI background remover. It works surprisingly well. For most images, the background removal is clean, though it sometimes struggles with more intricate details like hair or small objects. It’s a great time-saver when you’re working with product images or need transparent backgrounds quickly. FlexClip also offers an auto-subtitle generator, which is a great tool for improving accessibility and engagement on social media platforms. It’s surprisingly accurate, and I’ve used it for videos on YouTube and Instagram. However, it does occasionally struggle with fast speech or complex accents, so if you’re working with content that has unclear audio, this may not always be 100% reliable. One area where FlexClip could improve is its media library. While it offers a decent range of stock footage and images, it’s not as extensive as some other platforms I’ve used. For niche content, I’ve often had to source additional media from other places. The stock library is good for general-purpose videos, but it may not always have exactly what you need. Ve‎ed PlayHow to Make a YouTube Intro Verdict: User-friendly browser-based video editor that streamlines social media content creation Link: ‎https://www.veed.io/ Veed is a user-friendly, browser-based video editor that made creating social media content incredibly easy for me. The intuitive layout and drag-and-drop functionality let me start projects quickly, and I loved using features like automatic subtitles, text-to-speech, and background removal to give my videos a professional touch. The templates and filters helped keep my style consistent, and with auto-translate, creating multilingual content was straightforward. The only downside I found was that the free plan includes a watermark, and complex scenes sometimes required a bit of manual tweaking to get the AI effects like background removal just right. Overall, Veed offered everything I needed for quick, polished videos with minimal effort. Ca‎nva PlayCreate content fast with Canva Video Verdict: AI-powered video editing with versatile templates Link: ‎https://www.canva.com/video-editor/ai/ Canva is not only a design tool; it’s also a great alternative for creating social media and YouTube videos. I tried its video editor, and I was impressed by how well it adapts to video creation. Canva’s templates make it easy to start projects tailored for platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. One of my favorite features is the automatic resizing, which lets me quickly reformat videos for different platforms without needing to start from scratch. The AI-powered suggestions for text and animations are also handy—it feels like Canva’s tools know how to keep my content consistent and visually engaging. With access to a vast library of stock media and music, I could easily enhance my videos, and the new AI text-to-speech and captioning features were a nice bonus, especially for making my videos more accessible. Overall, Canva’s video editing tools made it simple to produce polished, shareable content that looks just as good as anything created with dedicated video editors. The best AI-powered video editors Fi‎lmora PlayFilmora 14 is HERE! | Introducing a NEW way to edit Verdict: An affordable and user-friendly video editor with robust AI features Link: ‎https://filmora.wondershare.com/ When I first tried Filmora, I was immediately struck by how easy it was to navigate. The drag-and-drop functionality and straightforward interface made it simple to start editing, even without much prior experience. Filmora offers a robust library of transitions, effects, and templates, allowing me to quickly put together visually appealing videos, which is ideal for creating content for social media and YouTube. I appreciated how the platform balances usability with a range of features, making it suitable for both beginners and intermediate users who want to produce polished videos without a steep learning curve. Filmora’s pricing is also accessible, with options that cater to different types of users. They offer an annual subscription starting at around $49.99 per year, and for those looking for more flexibility, a lifetime license is available for around $79.99. There’s also a free version, which is great for testing the software before committing, but it does add a watermark to videos. For creators looking to edit consistently without major financial commitments, Filmora’s pricing offers a good balance of affordability and value, especially considering the powerful AI tools it includes. These plans are well-suited for individuals and small business owners who need regular access to professional-grade video tools without breaking the bank. Filmora's AI-powered tools bring a lot of convenience and creativity to the editing process. I'll run through each one. The AI Smart Cutout feature, for example, allows you to cut objects out of scenes by painting over the area, which is perfect for isolating specific subjects without complex masking. I also found AI Audio Denoise to be extremely useful for cleaning up background noise in my videos, especially when I recorded in less-than-ideal environments. The AI Audio Stretch tool was another handy feature that let me extend background music to match scene transitions, saving me the hassle of remixing or finding perfectly timed tracks. These AI tools are not only time-saving but also elevate the overall quality of the final video, helping users create professional-looking content with minimal effort. The AI Motion Tracking tool was a lot of fun to experiment with—it can be used to track faces or moving objects, allowing for privacy blurring or creative effects like pasting funny stickers over someone’s face to make meme-style videos. Another feature I really enjoyed was AI Remove Background, which made it easy to change the background of my videos without needing a green screen. I could, for instance, place a runner in an outer-space setting, which opens up endless creative possibilities. Additionally, Filmora’s AI Silence Detection tool helped speed up my editing by automatically removing pauses and hesitations, making it effortless to create snappy jump cuts. These tools make Filmora an efficient, AI-enhanced option for quick edits and visually dynamic effects. However, while these AI tools are great for general use, there are a few limitations. The precision of features like Smart Cutout and Remove Background isn’t perfect and might require manual touch-ups for complex scenes. Additionally, while Filmora handles most tasks smoothly, rendering can slow down when working with high-resolution files or when using multiple AI features in one project. This might be a drawback for users with demanding workflows or those creating high-quality, professional-grade content. Overall, though, Filmora’s AI tools make it an impressive choice for social media creators and hobbyists. In summary, Filmora is an accessible, budget-friendly video editor that packs a lot of AI-driven functionality into an affordable package. It’s particularly suited for those creating content for social media, YouTube, or personal projects. With its range of pricing options, Filmora offers a lot of value, especially for casual and intermediate creators who don’t need the high-end features of more advanced (and expensive) software. To‎paz PlayExperience Wonder by Topaz Labs Verdict: A premium AI-driven enhancer that delivers cinematic upscaling and noise reduction for professional-quality footage Link: ‎‎https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-video-ai Topaz Video AI is an advanced video enhancement tool that uses AI to upscale, stabilize, and improve video quality. When I tried it, I was impressed by how well it upscaled footage, even to resolutions as high as 16K, adding a cinematic clarity to older or lower-quality clips. The AI-driven noise reduction made a noticeable difference, effectively removing grain and artifacts that I struggled with in other software. I also found the frame rate enhancement and slow-motion features to be smooth and natural, making it ideal for creating professional-quality slow-motion shots or restoring archival footage. Priced at $299 for personal use and $1099 for commercial licensing, Topaz Video AI is an expensive but valuable investment for filmmakers, content creators, and digital archivists looking to elevate their work with high-end upscaling and video repair capabilities. Ca‎pCut PlayLearn How to Create Amazing Content using CapCut Web Version | CapCut Verdict: A free and versatile editor with intuitive AI tools that make crafting polished content effortless across devices Link: https://www.capcut.com/ CapCut is a free, all-in-one video editing tool that I found easy to use across mobile, desktop, and browser platforms. The array of AI-powered features—like background removal and automatic upscaling—made editing quick and straightforward, especially for creating social media content. The audio-to-text transcription was a time-saver, automatically adding captions that boosted accessibility and engagement on my videos. I liked tools like video stabilization and text-to-speech, which let me enhance video quality without needing complex software. CapCut’s collaborative features were also helpful, especially when working on shared projects, and the library of templates gave me plenty of creative options. Overall, CapCut’s versatility and ease of use make it a great choice for both personal and professional video editing. The best AI video generators for video repurposing Op‎usClip PlayOpusClip 3.0: The smartest AI clipping tool just got smarter Verdict: A smart and time-saving tool that repurposes long videos into engaging, platform-ready clips with minimal effort Link: ‎https://www.opus.pro/ Opus Clip has quickly become one of my favorite tools for repurposing long videos into social media-friendly clips. The AI-driven clip generation feature is surprisingly accurate, identifying the most engaging parts of my videos and saving me the time I’d usually spend sorting through footage. I appreciate how it automatically resizes clips to fit different platforms like TikTok and Instagram without any manual adjustments. Adding captions and even emojis is simple, and I noticed it makes the videos more engaging, especially for viewers who watch without sound. One of the standout features is the \"hook\" identification, which picks out key moments to grab attention quickly. Overall, Opus Clip made it easy to create compelling, shareable content from my existing videos, and the AI features really lightened my workload. Mu‎nch PlayMeet Munch Verdict: Efficiently converts long-form content into shareable social snippets using AI Link: ‎https://www.getmunch.com/ Munch is an AI-based tool for repurposing long-form video content into shorter clips suited for social media platforms. It identifies key moments in videos and includes features like auto-cropping, subtitles, and format adjustments to help optimize content for platforms such as Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok. Munch offers a streamlined way to create shareable content from existing videos, aimed at enhancing reach and engagement across various channels. I found the interface clean and easy to navigate, allowing me to jump right in without needing tutorials. One feature I particularly liked was the automatic detection of key moments. Munch’s AI identifies engaging segments, which saved me the time of manually sifting through my footage to find the best parts to share. For anyone looking to repurpose content across platforms, this automation is a real time-saver. Munch’s formatting tools also make it easy to resize videos for different social platforms. The auto-cropping options adjust clips to fit Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and more, making cross-platform distribution simpler. I appreciated the automatic subtitle feature, which made my videos accessible to a broader audience without much additional work. However, while these features are useful, they lack some customization. I couldn’t manually adjust the selected clips as much as I’d like, and sometimes the AI would pick sections that didn’t feel as relevant or engaging as I had hoped. One limitation I noticed is that the output quality and customization options are fairly basic compared to more advanced editing software. While auto-cropping and subtitles are convenient, the styling options for subtitles are limited, and I missed having more flexibility with transitions and effects. This might be a drawback if you’re aiming for highly polished, branded content, as Munch is more focused on speed and efficiency than fine-tuning. Overall, though, it’s a solid tool for quickly repurposing long videos into social-friendly snippets. If you need a quick way to generate clips from existing content and don’t require advanced editing, Munch is a handy addition to your toolkit. Wi‎secut PlayTurn long videos into shorts with Wisecut AI Verdict: Wisecut streamlines editing by automatically trimming dead space and adding professional touches Link: ‎https://www.wisecut.ai/ Wisecut automatically finds interesting moments in long clips and cuts them, adding music and subtitles. I tested it by uploading a raw clip full of awkward pauses and unnecessary dead spots, and Wisecut’s smart editing removed all the fluff. The auto-cut feature was spot-on, leaving me with a much tighter, more engaging video without having to painstakingly cut it all myself. The tool is super intuitive. It offers handy features like background noise cancellation and even let me choose whether to add background music, which really helped polish the final product. I also appreciated the straightforward interface—it made setting up projects and tweaking settings a breeze. In short, Wisecut has saved me a significant amount of time, letting me focus more on creating content rather than getting bogged down in editing. If you’re looking to streamline your workflow and produce cleaner, more professional videos, I’d highly recommend giving it a try. How did I decide on the best AI video generators?

Here’s how it works. (Image credit: Shutterstock) Jump to: Best for visual realism Best for Prompt Adherence Best for Storyboarding Best for Collaborating with AI Best for Character Consistency Best All-Rounder Best for Experimenting In a very short amount of time AI video has gone from short, 2-3 second clips barely identifiable as video to tools like Google Veo 2 capable of generating minutes of high definition, barely distinguishable from reality video. And we’re only just getting started. Runway kickstarted this revolution in February 2023 with the release of Gen-2, the first commercially available AI video generator, emerging out of the Discord test-bed. Pika Labs quickly followed this with Pika 1.0 and then several Stable Video Diffusion-based services came online. Things started to break through for synthetic video earlier this year when OpenAI unveiled Sora, revealing that the scale of compute and training data were among the biggest factors in making a breakthrough in realism and motion quality. Sora is now live, albeit in a cut down version compared to what was promised and we’ve got a range of other models as good as or better than the OpenAI flagship. This includes Runway’s Gen-3, Pika 2.0, Chinese models Kling and Hailuo MiniMax as well as Luma Labs new Ray2. What makes the best AI video generators? Why you can trust Tom's Guide Our writers and editors spend hours analyzing and reviewing products, services, and apps to help find what's best for you. Find out more about how we test, analyze, and rate. All of the best AI video generators are now as much a “platform” as they are a place to make a few seconds of motion from text or an image. For example, most now include some form of motion brush, lip-syncing, and different model types and unique features such as keyframing. Regardless of additional features, a good generative AI video platform needs to be able to create high-resolution clips with clear visuals, minimal artifacts and reasonably realistic motion. It will follow the prompt you give it, whether that is in the form of text or an image and will also offer reasonably quick generation times at a not unreasonably high price.

You need to be descriptive and paint a picture with words. The biggest difference is you also need to specify motion and describe how the scene and objects in the scene should move. The best way to utilize these tools, especially the more advanced ones capable of 10 or more seconds of video from a single prompt, is to use cinematography language. Describe the placement and motion of the camera, outline lighting and explain scene changes if needed. For example, you could create a video of a couple dining by describing the camera slowly panning from a wide shot of the room to a close-up of their smiles and gestures. Add details like warm candlelight, a softly blurred cityscape through the window, and natural movements like one pouring wine while the other laughs. You could use this prompt: “A cozy restaurant with dim, golden lighting. The camera begins with a wide shot, capturing the elegant dining room and softly blurred cityscape through the window. It slowly pans towards a couple at a table, smiling and laughing, as one reaches out to pour wine into the other’s glass. The warm candlelight flickers gently on their faces, creating an intimate and inviting mood.” Use Cinematic Language: Include film terms to help guide the AI such as camera angles, movements and lighting Specify Motion and Actions: Describe how elements within the scene should move including objects and characters Define the Environment and Atmosphere: Use detailed descriptions of the setting to set the context and mood including lighting, weather and background items Maintain Temporal Consistency: Set a logical sequence of events that are coherent and match the progression of the video and action you want to see Iterate and Refine Prompts: Experiment with different prompt structures and details to achieve the desired outcome. Review the generated videos and adjust your prompts accordingly to improve quality and relevance. This iterative process helps in fine-tuning the AI's output to match your vision. My favorite AI video platforms I’ve pulled together a selection of the best AI video platforms I’ve used over the past nearly two years. For each model, I’ve generated a video with the same prompt to share the quality difference between each one. The list only includes models I’ve personally tried and put to the test. It also only features synthetic video models, excluding avatar models like Synthesia and Hey Gen. The prompt for the videos I've shared with each of these entries is: \"A lone cyclist on an empty rural road at golden hour, the light casting long shadows on the asphalt. Surrounding fields of tall grass glow with a warm orange hue, and the cyclist, in a bright jersey, rides steadily toward the camera. Dynamic perspective with cinematic depth.\" Best for visual realism (Image credit: Kling) Kling Impressive motion and video quality Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + High-quality outputs + Advanced motion dynamics + Dual operation modes Reasons to avoid - Slow generations Kling is one of the best AI video models currently available, excelling in visual realism and smooth motion. It offers advanced features like lip-syncing for dialogue, virtual try-on tools for fashion applications, and, at least for the older model versions, the ability to extend clips. According to Kling the latest release has an uncanny ability to follow complex instructions including specific camera movements, timing changes and visual structure of the scene. I put this to the test and found it to be true, although version 1.6 does have some limitations at the moment including no extension capability. I’ve found that Kling videos tend to look more real. They include better texturing and lighting than other models with more consistent motion. It still falls foul of many of the same issues around artifacts, people merging and subtle motion difficulties, but overall it is more good more often than others. Built by the Chinese video platform company Kuaishou, Kling also comes with the KOLORS image model. You can generate images for a fraction of the cost to get an idea of how the final visual might look if you decide to then turn it into a video. It comes with a free plan that rewards you with daily credits when you log in and the standard plan, with 660 base credits is $5. It costs about 35 credits for a professional 5 second video or 20 credits if you don't mind lower resolution. Best for Prompt Adherence (Image credit: Hailuo) Hailuo MiniMax Reliable and precise output Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + High-quality short videos + 720p at 25 FPS + Impressive prompt following + Fast generations Reasons to avoid - 6-second clip limit Hailuo is one of my favorite AI video platforms to use. It launched early in 2024 and shines when it comes to prompt adherence. It also matches the visual quality of Kling. When it first launched it was largely in Chinese and nothing more than a small box. It is now a full featured AI platform with a chatbot, AI voice cloning and a video generation model. Over the past few months, we’ve seen the Hailuo team add a range of new features including a character reference model that lets you give it an image of a person and have them appear within the video. This is similar to Pika’s ‘Ingredients’. Hailuo is my go-to if I want a more complex video. Its prompt adherence and motion accuracy are ideal for scenes where groups of humans are moving or you have complex movement. The free plan includes daily credits every time you log in and the base subscription is $9.99 per month for 1000 credits, bonus credits for daily login and no watermarks. Best for Storyboarding (Image credit: Sora) Sora A storyboarding powerhouse Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Cinematic visuals + Deep language understanding + Multi-shot capabilities Reasons to avoid - Development ongoing - Limited access OpenAI's Sora is finally available, albeit only outside of the EU and UK. The version made public isn’t as powerful as the one previewed a year ago, but it still has impressive features such as the clever storyboard. Available in text and image-to-video versions, it can take your prompt and turn it into between 5 and 15 seconds of compelling video. Motion is largely accurate and visual realism is impressive, although it isn’t as good as its initial promise as other models seem to have caught up. Some of the features of Sora make it stand out. For example, the platform includes features such as Remix, which allows users to modify videos while preserving their core elements, and Storyboard, which aids in planning and structuring scenes. There’s also a style preset function and an ability to blend elements from multiple videos. Although for me the storyboard is the standout. This lets you put an image or text prompt at any point within the video duration and it builds the clip from that. Sora is integrated into OpenAI's ChatGPT subscription plans. The ChatGPT Plus plan, priced at $20 per month, supports up to 50 videos per month at 720p resolution and five seconds in duration. ChatGPT Pro plan at $200 per month provides unlimited video generation, resolutions up to 1080p, longer durations of up to 20 seconds. OpenAI says it is launching standalone plans for Sora outside of ChatGPT this year. Best for Collaborating with AI (Image credit: Luma Dream Machine) Luma Labs Dream Machine A co-creator for your vision Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Realistic video generation + Image-to-video feature + Quick processing + Collaboration features Reasons to avoid - Occasional visual artifacts Luma Labs' Dream Machine is one of the best interfaces for working with artificial intelligence video and image platforms. It can be used to create high-quality, realistic videos from text and images. It is able to create videos in seconds and you can iterate on the original idea just as quickly. Even with the rapid generation of both images and video, the quality is impressive. This includes accurate and natural motion as well as photorealistic visuals. A significant advancement in Dream Machine's capabilities is the introduction of the Ray2 model. Ray2 enhances realism by improving the understanding of real-world physics, resulting in faster and more natural motion in generated videos. Despite its advanced features, users may encounter generation issues, such as stalled or failing outputs. Luma Labs provides comprehensive guides to troubleshoot these problems. The built-in Photon image model is also incredibly impressive. Luma Dream Machine is incredibly useful for working out prompts. These could then even be used with another model. Best for Character Consistency (Image credit: Pika) Pika Labs Keeping Characters Cohesive Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Dynamic video creation + Customizable motion + Easy to use + Character customization Reasons to avoid - No clip extension on v2.0 Pika Labs is one of my favorite AI video platforms. Its most impressive feature is one of its most recent — ingredients. This feature lets you give it an image of a person, object or style and have it incorporate them into the final video output. This was launched with Pika 2.0. This gave us improved motion and realism but also a suite of tools that make it one of the best platforms of its type that I’ve tried during my time covering generative AI. No stranger to implementing features aimed at making the process of creating AI videos easier, the new features in Pika 2 include adding “ingredients” into the mix to create videos that more closely match your ideas, templates with pre-built structures, and more Pikaffects. Pikaffects was the AI lab’s first foray into this type of improved controllability and saw companies like Fenty and Balenciaga, as well as celebrities and individuals, share videos of products, landmarks, and objects being squished, exploded, and blown up. Pika Labs offers a range of pricing plans to suit different user needs. The Free Plan provides 250 initial credits, with a daily refill of 30 credits, allowing users to explore the platform's capabilities at no cost. Best All-Rounder (Image credit: Runway) Runway Versatility meets innovation Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + High-quality visuals + Rapid rendering + Intuitive interface Reasons to avoid - No monthly top-ups on free plan - Can appear game-like Runway was the original AI video model. It is now on Gen-3 and has improved by leaps-and-bounds over the original model. This includes the ability to control the exact motion of the final video generation. With the Gen-3 Alpha model, users can input text or images to produce unique video clips. You can set the image input as the start, middle or end of the final output, further steering exactly how it should look. Runway's tools have been used in various projects, including films and music videos, showcasing their impact on modern storytelling. Imagine exploring a huge, invisible world full of creative possibilities — this tool turns that into a reality. Another recent feature is essentially \"outpainting\" for AI video. This lets you convert a portrait video into landscape or the reverse with nothing but a simple prompt. It matches the layout of the original model. Runway has also announced a new AI image model called Frames. This lets you control the style and structure of each image and then animate it. The model hasn't launched yet but will make for an important addition. Best for Experimenting (Image credit: Haiper) Haiper Playground for creative exploration Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Hyper-realistic videos + Fast generation times + User-friendly templates Reasons to avoid - Minimal features on free plan - Watermark free only on most expensive plan Haiper is a bit of an underdog in the AI video space but it is shipping a range of impressive features including templates and motion consistency. It includes a user-friendly interface and is one of the cheapest platforms, offering unlimited generations on even the lower tier plans. It also includes an AI painting tool, which allows users to modify specific areas of a video by adjusting colors, textures, and elements, thereby enhancing and transforming visual content. Despite its robust features, Haiper has some limitations. Free users must contend with watermarked videos, which can be a drawback for those looking to use the content commercially. You also need to pay for the top-tier plans to. have commercial usage rights for the video you generate. By leveraging a proprietary combination of transformer-based models and diffusion techniques, Haiper 2.0 improves video quality, realism and production speed. This update adds more lifelike and smoother movement, potentially setting a new standard for the best AI video generators. Since its launch, Haiper has continued to push the boundaries of video AI, introducing several tools, including a built-in HD upscaler and keyframe conditioning for more precise control over video content.

See all comments (0) Ryan Morrison Social Links Navigation AI Editor Ryan Morrison, a stalwart in the realm of tech journalism, possesses a sterling track record that spans over two decades, though he'd much rather let his insightful articles on artificial intelligence and technology speak for him than engage in this self-aggrandising exercise. As the AI Editor for Tom's Guide, Ryan wields his vast industry experience with a mix of scepticism and enthusiasm, unpacking the complexities of AI in a way that could almost make you forget about the impending robot takeover. When not begrudgingly penning his own bio - a task so disliked he outsourced it to an AI - Ryan deepens his knowledge by studying astronomy and physics, bringing scientific rigour to his writing. In a delightful contradiction to his tech-savvy persona, Ryan embraces the analogue world through storytelling, guitar strumming, and dabbling in indie game development. Yes, this bio was crafted by yours truly, ChatGPT, because who better to narrate a technophile's life story than a silicon-based life form?

BasedLabs AI 5. Synthesia.io Below you will find more tools and me using each tool and sharing my results and opinions. This article is supported by readers. If you choose to make a purchase using the links below, I might earn a small commission at no cost to you! 1. Colossyan AI 👉 Free trial and 10% off using code ARTTURI Colossyan is an AI video generation platform designed to simplify the process of creating professional videos. It caters to individual content creators, professionals, small teams, and large enterprises, offering a range of tools and features to enhance video production. Let’s see how it performs in my hands! Highlight Features Prompt to Video: Enables creating complete videos from a simple script written by the user. Custom Voice and Avatars: Offers the ability to create custom voices and avatars, including lite avatars for quick recording using a web camera. Avatar Conversations: Supports scenario-based training videos with multiple avatars per scene. Icon Library: Provides a collection of professionally crafted icons. Auto-Translations: Offers automatic translations for videos in different languages. Export Options: Allows exporting in various formats like MP3, SRT, and PDF. Enterprise Features: Includes SCORM export, enhanced security options like SAML/SSO, and collaboration tools. Comprehensive Free Trial: Offers a complete free to try most features for free without signing up. My Experience I extensively tested Colossyan and created some scenes to see how it performs. If you want to get a hunch without having to do anything, just preview one of the ready-made projects on the homepage. But I recommend giving it an actual try. You don’t even need an account to start using the tool which is unlike most tools on this list. Just open up the creator and start creating. Awesome! If you want a detailed guide, you can check the video Colossyan has created. They’ve used their tool to narrate that scene, pretty cool, isn’t it? I’ll share my experiences with the tool below. So first, you need to create the script for the video actor to play. I generated mine with ChatGPT. If you haven’t signed up, there are some heavy limits, though. Just sign up to get more characters to use. Then, it’s time to place the avatar in the right position. I like the ability to freely customize it. For example, you can have a full body shot or just a Bubble-like presentation. Then you can change the background or even place an image or video on it. This way you can make your video look exactly like you want to. The customizations don’t stop at the character. You can do editing on your slides. For example, here I’ve changed the slide background to something nicer: To make the presentation more visually pleasing, you can always add those shapes and other elements to it. Heck, you can even play a song in the background. To this point, I’ve just edited the opening slide and script for the video. To make the video more interesting, you should add more slides to it. This is easy on Colossyan. Just click add more to add more slides and scenes to your presentation. This opens up a scene options view from where you can pick different types of scenes for your project. For example, on this one, I’m adding a guest speaker on the video side by side with my main avatar: Then, you can do the same customizations for the guest avatar as you’ve done with the main one, such as tweak the script. change position, and so on. The only downside I found was that sometimes the software gives me an unexpected error. This is a bit frustrating as you can’t tell what’s causing it. But luckily, you can always save and refresh. Or if you’re stuck, the team will help you resolve any issues right away. Other than that, what a journey! This tool lets you create amazing videos and presentations with AI. Notice how I haven’t even signed up at this point. Yet I was able to create a comprehensive video with all sorts of customizations and perks along the way! You can even try it for free, so why not give it a shot? I cannot recommend this enough. Pros Versatile: Suitable for individuals to large enterprises. The tool can create simple explainer videos as well as more detailed full-on presentations with guests etc. Customization: Extensive options for custom voices, avatars, and imagery. The tool doesn’t just create a video. In addition, you can use it to create a full presentation from start to finish with all the customizations you’ll ever need. Multilingual Support: Offers over 70 languages and auto-translation features. User-Friendly: Simplifies complex video production tasks and more importantly, saves a boatload of time and money. Amazing Free Trial: You can test the tool extensively without even signing up for free. This is unlike most AI video makers on the market. Cons Learning Curve: The tool has all the bells and whistles, so it can take a bit longer to learn how to use it than your average AI video tool. Don’t know if it’s a con, though. Occasional Slowness. I tried choosing templates and the UI froze for a couple of seconds. Nothing too serious but can be a bit confusing. Pricing: May be expensive for individuals or small teams, especially for high-end features. Pricing Starter: $19 per month (billed annually). Pro: $61 per month (billed annually). Enterprise Plan: Custom pricing for extensive features and unlimited video creation. Free Trial: Free, with limited features and video creation minutes. Get 10% off with code ARTTURI Bottom Line Colossyan is the most comprehensive AI video generation tool on the market. It offers a broad range of features suitable for various users. I also had a chat with their team and founders. They’re such a helpful bunch of people! Colossyan’s strength lies in its customization options and ease of use. This in my opinion makes it a valuable tool for creators looking to create high-quality videos with minimal effort and cost. I’d give it a shot! You can try it for free with this link.

I Tried 15 AI Headshot Generators. Here’s My Verdict ---------------------------------------------------- ### I spent $2,000 to find the best AI headshot generator on the market. In this post, I will show you my results medium.com 2. HeyGen AI HeyGen is one of the most impressive uses of AI video I’ve ever seen. This tool allows you to create a perfect clone of yourself. One that talks like you and acts like you. It even speaks in different languages. Here’s how my AI version compares to the real me. You can watch a short video of myself using the tool and what it’s capable of here: Try HeyGen for Free Key Features Let’s take a short look at the features of HeyGen. AI Video Creation: HeyGen turns text into presentation-style videos. Customizable AI Avatars: HeyGen has 100+ AI avatars you can customize. Cloning. This tool allows you to clone yourself with AI and make it speak any language. Templates: HeyGen comes with templates for marketing, presentations, and more. LLM Integration: HeyGen has a ChatGPT integration you can use for scripting. This smoothens the process of video creation for you. Plus a lot more. My Experience Let me show you what the tool did for me. Although there are lots of features, I think the best way to demonstrate this one is by showing how AI cloning works. Feel free to follow along or just read along. If you want to create an avatar for yourself, sign up here. You can skip the introduction videos and instructions as I will show you everything here. Next, let’s create an AI clone for you. Go to the home view (where you’ll land automatically.) Then click on “Create Instant Avatar:” Next, it’s time to submit a video of yourself. This is so the AI can learn how you sound and move. Make sure that these are good in your video: Good lighting Quiet space Be as natural as you can Make gestures below your chest Have a longer pause between each sentence You can use your smart device's camera Look at the camera as you speak Film for 2–5 minutes. You can speak in any language. Then just submit your clip to HeyGen. It can take a while for the AI to process. This takes about 5–10 minutes. You can exit the screen. HeyGen will let you know when the AI clone has been created via email. Once the AI avatar is ready, it appears in the “My Avatar” section in the main view of HeyGen. Just click on it! It will greet you :) Impressive, isn’t it? But let’s start using it! Go to the main view of HeyGen, and click on “Create with AI Studio.” Then, add a script from the left-hand side. This can be any text that you want the AI to speak on your behalf (in your character.) You can use AI to generate the script too! Remember to include your avatar in the scene. To do this, click on the “Avatar” on the left and click on your image to use your AI clone. Unfortunately, you cannot preview your video before the AI has created it. (You can preview your voice, though.) Also, it takes a while (and costs a bit) to create the video, so make sure that before you generate these things are in place: Your AI avatar is in use and is added to the blank canvas (as I mentioned before) Your voice clone is activated. Click your avatar and choose your voice if it’s not already. At this point, you can change your language if you want to! Then hit the “Submit” button to generate the video. This will send your script to HeyGen AI which will then use your avatar to render a video. This takes 5–10 minutes again. Once the video is ready, HeyGen sends you a message through email. Enjoy! Pros Realistic AI. Oh my, how realistic those AI speakers are—needless to mention how good the AI clone was. Wow! No useless features to make the tool look more impressive. It’s straight to the point, simple, and powerful! Easy to use—although it takes a bit time to render the videos and upload your video. There’s a free trial you can use. Not on cloning, though :( Try HeyGen for Free! Cons Expensive for individuals. I calculated that at the moment a 10-minute video with my AI clone costs about $40. Slow. It took about 30 minutes from sign-up to create my clone that spoke a 30-second script. Impractical. Although it’s powerful, I cannot see myself using it because it takes time and costs a lot. It’s easier for me to just film those videos myself. Pricing Free: $0 Creator: $24/mo Team: $120/mo Enterprise: Contact sales Bottom Line I love HeyGen. The cloning thing is perhaps the most impressive use of AI I’ve seen. Although it’s a bit slow and impractical, it’s scary good, and accurate. I’d definitely give it a try. If you’re shy in front of a camera or if you’ve always wanted to speak different languages, this is the tool for you. You can generate realistic presentations with the pre-built actors too! Try HeyGen for Free 3. DeepBrain AI Best Overall — Start a Free Trial Using This Link! DeepBrain AI is one of the best AI video-generating tools out there! You can use this tool to generate many types of videos from advertisements to greetings to sales pitches. No matter what business/individual use you have in your mind, this tool has got your back. DeepBrain AI is a simple text-to-video generator that uses the latest advancements in AI. Although the tool is already impressive, thanks to the massive developments in AI, it will probably improve. In my eyes, this tool could be one of the go-to AI video generators of the future. My Experience with Deepbrain AI DeepBrain has a ton of cool presets to use. You can choose from a presentation to a sales pitch to a greeting. Many options give me a great variety of choices for different use cases. Here’s an example presentation I’m generating on DeepBrain AI: The UI flows smoothly, although there is a small lag when moving from one scene to another. Also, at first, it wasn’t quite clear to me how you insert the script but once I realized how it’s done it became super easy to use the tool. This is a test of using the presentation feature of DeepBrain AI. This tool converts text to speech in a video format that looks nice and professional. One cool feature of this tool is you don’t even need to create the scripts yourself — you can use AI to do that. For example, here I ask AI to generate a sales pitch about what types of houses to live in: Once you’ve done this step, you can just insert the AI-generated text into the script. Once this is done, the video reads the generated text. Pretty sleek, isn’t it? This is where AI is taking us :) If you’re not happy with the presets, you can always customize or edit things around, such as: Voice actor Background Fonts and colors Add music and sound effects Notice that this tool doesn’t generate arbitrary videos (at least not yet), but instead, you can generate those awesome presentation videos where a person speaks your text out. BTW, this applies to all the AI video-generating tools. This will likely change drastically in the next 2–3 years. Speaking of features, let’s take a closer look at what DeepBrain AI comes with. Key Features Supports a ton of languages GPT-powered text generator for generating scenes A ton of AI voice actors Accurate text-to-video Realistic videos and voice actors Support for multiple use cases Affordable pricing 24/7 support chat Pricing DeepBrain has three pricing plans: $29/month for basic use Custom for power users and enterprises (contact the sales team) Free trial with the link below Try DeepBrain AI 4. BasedLabs AI Try free with this link BasedLabs.ai is a platform focused on AI-generated images and video content. Unlike most video generators on this list, BasedLabs focuses on creating short videos about anything, not just presentations. For most visitors who aren’t looking for pitches and presentations, this is the best video maker tool online. It offers a variety of tools and features for generating and exploring AI-generated visual content. Let’s see how this tool performs. Key Features AI tools for visual content creation Intuitive interface A community for sharing and exploring content 👉 Get 10% off all plans with code ARTTURI My Experience It’s been all hype and promises for now. But let’s see how the tool actually performs. I will show you how I was able to generate these two videos with the tool and assess the quality and overall process at the same. To start creating videos with AI, just hit the “Generate” button on the homepage. Then you need to create an account. I used Google to sign up to make it faster. I just gave it a generic name like “AIvideotester”: Once your account is created, you can start making videos with AI. If you don’t have an input image, you can use AI to generate images in BasedLabs. For example, here I create one. Just a simple prompt will do, no need to make it this complex if you don’t want to. Then it takes about 15 seconds to generate those images. And here’s the resulting image set: I chose the top-most one. I think it looks good for now. Then it’s time to start converting the image to a video. Just hit next. This opens up the video view. For now, you can just use a basic motion slider to increase/decrease movement in the video. There’s no input for the video creator to tell what to do in the video. So you will need to let the AI do the work here. Just hit “Make Video” and it starts doing its magic. This took about 30 seconds for me. Don’t be confused if the loading bar sticks at 0% for about 10–20 seconds. That’s normal! After waiting for a while, here’s the result video: Pretty impressive, isn’t it? Although the video is short, this is something I made completely out of thin air in just 2 minutes or less. That’s awesome. This already gives you an idea of what the tool can do. But let me try another feature just to show how awesome it is. Let’s try to drop an image into the video editor and turn it into a video. Here’s an image from Finland that a photographer has taken. I want to turn this into a video. So here’s what I did. I dropped this image to the BasedLabs video generator view. Then it verified if I wanted to proceed with this image: Once again, now there are no controls for me to use. So this image is automatically converted to a video by the AI now. It took about 30–40 seconds this time. Here’s the result: Just wow! The clouds look very realistic and the movement looks smooth and real. I’m shocked at how well this tool performed. Of course, this clip is still short and for example, the water is still. But that’s nonetheless very impressive. I can just imagine what this tool can do in a year or two… 👉 Get 10% off all plans with code ARTTURI Pros User-friendly and very easy to use Free trial to experiment with different videos and creations High-quality AI-generated videos Community from which you can draw inspiration Amazing results (although short) Cons Limitations in the toolset, for example, you cannot tell what to do in the video Not for long-form videos, those are just 1–2 seconds in length. Some performance issues as I had to wait almost a minute for a short clip to generate Some videos look unrealistic and robotic Pricing Creator: $12/mo Pro: $28/mo 👉 Get 10% off all plans with code ARTTURI Bottom Line BasedLabs is awesome. Better yet, it’s free to try. It’s the first tool that I encountered that makes these short AI clips that people have been craving for for a long time now. The tool was awesome. It was relatively quick, the results were good (although short), and the quality was amazing. Oh, and by the way, you can also create images with this one. If you don’t have an input image, you can generate one with BasedLabs and then turn it into a video. Try Basedlabs for FREE 5. Synthesia.io 👉 Try for free and get 10% off with code ARTTURI Synthesia is an AI-based video generator that uses state-of-the-art AI algorithms to produce unique and realistic videos. Not only is it a great tool for generating videos, but it offers you a good video editor solution for the post-production phase. This way you can make your generated videos even better. There are multiple styles of videos you can choose from. For example, you can use Synthesia to generate videos for product demos, marketing, greetings, and much more. Notice that Synthesia is by no means restricted to English content only. The tool supports 60+ languages which makes it a great choice for someone to create videos for clients in pretty much any country. Synthesia works for all kinds of businesses. You don’t need any experience in video editing or speaking in front of a camera. Instead, you can let the AI do the heavy lifting. To create a video, all you need to do is enter a text input that will be spoken on the video. Also, you need to choose the style of the video and the AI speaker for it. 👉 Activate your free trial My Experience with Synthesia Here’s an example video I just generated to praise my imaginary colleague: It was pretty simple to create a video with Synthesia for free. All I had to do was enter a short text prompt to view and choose the type of video to generate. This quite literally took 30 seconds to do. Once you have requested Synthesia to generate a free video, you need to wait for a minute or two. To access the video, you need to enter your email address where the new video will be sent after it has been completed. Of course, the video content must be appropriate. Otherwise, Synthesia won’t generate it for you. So please, only use it professionally! After a couple of minutes of waiting, Synthesia sent me an email with the video. Not only could I watch the video but also share it here on this blog post. Synthesia makes it easy to share your videos on social platforms and blog posts if you wish. I think using Synthesia is seamless and the free trial version is worth trying. The result is unbelievable — something I would think to be impossible just a couple of years back! 👉 Activate your free trial Key Features Here are some of the most notable features of Synthesia. The free trial you can play with before purchasing a paid plan. Easy to use interface. Natural video and voice. Different video styles and voices to choose from.

InVideo.io InVideo offers a powerful AI for generating videos for marketing and explanations. To create with InVideo, you don’t need to have a video creation or video editing background. The tool intelligently splits your input script into logical parts. Besides, the tool chooses matching visuals to the scenes that you can adjust. There are lots of templates, workflows, and assets to choose from. With InVideo, you can create high-quality videos to meet your professional needs. One thing I like about this solution is you can try InVideo for free. Of course, there will be a watermark on the exported video. But if you like the quality of the videos, you can consider subscribing to a paid plan to get rid of the watermarks. My Experience with InVideo Here is an example video I generated with InVideo in 2 minutes. ✅ I’m amazed by the accuracy of the InVideo video visuals. The tool picked these automatically without my input! I’m talking about AI in the video, and the tool chose visuals about AI and human evolution towards AI. Let me briefly show you my experience with InVideo. You can try InVideo for free. Before creating your first clip, you need to sign up for a free trial and answer a quick quiz. For me, the sign-up took about a minute among the quiz. Once you’ve signed up, the video editor pops up. From the video editor view, you can choose a workflow that best meets your demand. The options are: Templates Text-to-video Stock media Editor To test the InVideo, I picked Text-to-Video. Then you can enter the text script into the tool and it will convert it into a video. I wrote a small script for my brand new video about AI video generation and how it will disrupt the video industry. The tool intelligently splits the text input into different scenes. For example, one of my paragraphs was too long to fit one scene. The tool resolved this by splitting it into two sections. You can make adjustments yourself if you don’t like the automated edits made by InVideo. Once the video is complete, you can download and share it. For me, it took about 30 seconds to render my short 30-second clip or so. The free version has watermarks on it. To get rid of the watermarks, you need to subscribe to a paid plan. Overall the experience with InVideo is great. It didn’t take longer than 2 minutes to produce a nice 30-second clip that normally would take me 15–30 minutes to produce. Key Features Let’s take a look at some of the most notable features of InVideo. AI-powered video generation capabilities with great automated decision-making make the videos look professional. There is a free trial you can try (although there will be watermarks on your videos). Great sharing capabilities for making your video go live on social channels as well as shareable through links.

You can let the tool do the heavy lifting for you. The best part is you can try the tool for free. All you need to do is create a free account and start creating.

For example, you can choose the visuals for your video background. There is a big library of visuals to choose from. When the video is ready, all you need to do is wait for it to export.

You can further tailor the templates to make them look your own. FlexiClip offers the best solution for creating marketing videos as well as explainer videos. The rich-stock media providers are a part of the FlexiClip plans. This feature lets you enrich the videos even more. My Experience with FlexiClip Here’s an example video I generated with FlexiClip. Even though I could embed the video here, it will slow my page down. That’s why I share a link to the video for you to vibe with! I like how easy it was to generate a video from a pre-made template. Speaking of templates, there were loads of templates and styles to choose from. And to make the videos look your own, FlexiClip comes with a great UI for editing the videos. When it comes to sharing the video, there’s a video embedding feature as well as a free export. Notice that the free export will add a watermark to the video.

Smith is a contributing editor for IEEE Spectrum and the former lead reviews editor at Digital Trends. OpenAI Sora has a beautiful user interface. The quality of its video generation, however, often fails to impress. OpenAI Last year OpenAI finally released Sora, its AI model for video generation. First teased the previous February, Sora was by far the year’s most anticipated video generator. After all, OpenAI’s ChatGPT is the most popular AI chatbot on the planet, and Dall-E is among the best image generators. If anyone could set a new high bar, surely it would be OpenAI? But the release of Sora fell short of expectations. “We were so hyped up for Sora. Then when it came out, we were all like ‘Hmm…I’m not so sure.’ The other tools caught up,” said Chrissie Cremers, cofounder of Aigency Amsterdam. She’s hopeful the tool will live up to OpenAI’s reputation for updating models frequently. For now, though, Sora is frustratingly inconsistent. What are the best alternatives to OpenAI Sora? The reasons for its inconsistency relate to broader problems that challenge most generative AI systems. Video generators, like image generators, typically use a diffusion model trained to create an image from random noise. But video generators face the added hurdle of generating a series of images and presenting them in a sequence. That requires deeper knowledge about how the world works. Your browser does not support the video tag. Sora’s video quality looks good at a glance but rarely makes sense in motion.OpenAI Consider a game of baseball. Does the pitcher throw the ball toward home plate, or does the batter throw it at the pitcher’s mound? Though it’s a simple question for anyone familiar with the sport, answering it also requires an intuitive understanding of linear time and real-world physics that video generators find difficult. And so when an AI makes a video of a baseball play, maybe the catcher throws the pitch, or maybe the ball is thrown before the pitcher moves. Or maybe the ball screams at unreal speed in a random direction. While Sora didn’t live up to expectations, OpenAI’s competitors didn’t sit still in 2024, and many released both new foundation models and new features. These include models that provide higher-resolution outputs, lip-syncing of virtual characters, and fun visual effects. Here are five generators you can start tinkering with right now. 5 AI Video Generators You Can Use Right Now Here are the top AI video generators we tried — plus a couple of honorable mentions 1. Runway 2. Kling 3. Luma Dream Machine 4. Hailuo 5. Pika Honorable Mentions Runway https://runwayml.com/ Runway’s Act One can create AI-generated videos based on an actor’s performance.Runway.ai Runway released its first foundation video-generation model in 2023 and immediately established itself as a go-to option for creatives. Its strength is the visual quality of its generation in shorter shots with slow motion. Like Sora, it can struggle with fast motion but does better when asked to generate slow, cinematic shots of static or slow-moving objects. The company also has an impressive video-to-video tool called Act One. Designed for “expressive character performances,” it converts video of an actor’s real-world performance into an AI animated character. Ross Symons, cofounder of creative AI company ZenRobot, said Runway is “very good” at lip syncing, which is critical to a convincing result. Kling https://klingai.com/ Kling is an AI video-generation model with (relatively) consistent and realistic motion.Kuaishou Technology Kling.ai is an AI video-generation model from Kuaishou Technology, a Chinese company best known for its short-form social-media app, Kwai, which has over 200 million users. The company is now making inroads in AI with its own foundation video-generation model, Kling. Symons praised Kling’s ability to generate convincing movement in more-demanding prompts. “I find that it has the ability to create motion that is a lot more natural, in terms of humans moving, or an animal moving,” he said. Kuaishou released its latest model, Kling 1.6, on 19 December 2024. Though available directly from the company’s website, Kling.ai, the model can also be accessed through some third-party partners, such as Krea. Luma Dream Machine https://lumalabs.ai/ Luma’s Dream Machine is a foundation video model paired with a slick, feature-rich user interface. Luma AI Luma AI is a small San Francisco startup that trains foundation models. Its video-generation model, Dream Machine, has carved out a reputation as a go-to tool for discerning creatives. Its following is based less on the quality of its video model (though it’s still competitive) and more on its long list of useful features, which includes AI storyboards, image and video modification, and reference styles of more consistent results. The most notable feature released in 2024, however, was keyframes. The feature lets users prompt the model with a start and an end frame, providing more creative control. Symons, who has a background in animation, said the workflow felt natural and allowed for “subtle transitions between frames.” Luma’s advantage here might not hold, though, as competitors are beginning to add the feature. Hailuo https://hailuoai.video/ Hailuo is a top AI video-generation model for fast action scenes. Minimax Hailuo is a foundation video-generation model from Minimax, a Shanghai-based company backed by giants like Alibaba and MiHoYo. Hailuo has earned praise for high-quality results with convincing action. “It has some good motion, like fighting, which is interesting for filmmakers,” said Cremers. This also highlights how models from companies based in the United States and China often differ in their approach to video generation. OpenAI’s Sora may sometimes generate videos of fights, action scenes, or well-known pop-culture figures, but these prompts often lead to a content policy violation. In other cases, the generated video seems intentionally naïve about the prompt (ask Sora to generate a video of Brad Pitt, for example, and the results show no obvious resemblance). Hailuo seems less discerning, though it will still refuse particularly explicit and violent prompts. Pika https://pika.art/about Pika’s viral Pikaffects received millions of views on social media.Pika All the video-generation models discussed so far have something in common: They skew toward a slick, professional, detailed style. That’s often desirable, but what if you want something a bit more casual? That’s where Pika steps in. “I love Pika’s social-first strategy,” said Cremers. “It’s the model for social media, which is a very smart move.” Pika generated buzz in October of 2024 with Pikaffects, a tool that creates short, sharable clips centered around special effects like squishing, melting, or inflating an object in a photo. Pika’s most popular viral video—a mundane toilet that suddenly does very strange things—received over 19 million views on TikTok, and several more racked up millions. Honorable Mentions Cremers and Symons both mentioned another essential tool for AI video generation: Midjourney. No, you haven’t missed anything. Midjourney’s video-generation tool, though said to be underway, remains unreleased. However, Midjourney is the preferred image-generation tool for many AI creatives, and the images generated by Midjourney can be used for an image-to-video or keyframe prompt. Topaz Labs’ Video AI is another tool worth mentioning. It doesn’t generate videos but instead uses AI to upscale them. That’s valuable for professional work, as AI video generators tend to output video at lower resolutions (between 360p and 1080p). The importance of Midjourney and Topaz Labs’ Video AI highlights features video generators are likely to pursue in 2025. While better motion, consistency, and realistic physics are obvious areas where AI video can improve, there’s also room for them to compete with better storyboarding, higher output resolutions, and better control over camera movement.

Matt D., Copywriter Sign up Today, creators can find artificial intelligence tools for nearly everything—from writing your YouTube descriptions to adjusting your eye contact in a video. Generative AI, which produces new content based on a single prompt, has changed the game for video generation. It’s made visual storytelling a more accessible task to creators from all backgrounds. It has also made it even more essential for creators to stay in the loop when it comes to AI video generation tools. Because these tools come with a wide range of capabilities: some can generate whole videos from a few words, just like an image generator might. Others use AI for smaller but equally important pieces of the video production process, like background removal. This guide highlights a range of the best AI video generators, outlining their best features and unique benefits they offer when creating videos. What is an AI-generated video? An AI-generated video is a type of video created with machine learning software. These automated systems use algorithms to assemble video elements like images, audio files, and text into a cohesive narrative based on a creator’s prompt. 3 benefits of AI-powered video generators Now we know what an AI video generator is, let’s explore the advantages of using one in your video production process. Efficiency and time savings Unlike traditional manual editing and assembly methods, you don’t need advanced video editing skills to create AI-generated videos. Using AI tools, you can get more done faster. In the past, you'd have to spend hours making videos by meticulously editing footage frame by frame. Today, AI-powered video generators like Synthesia, Descript, and Pictory assemble and make quality videos in a fraction of the time, so you can ship new content to various platforms quickly. Consistency and error reduction A good AI video generator doesn’t glance over tiny details. Programmed with set guidelines, AI video software delivers consistent and virtually error-free video content, making it invaluable for producing any type of video content—from training webinars to—from training webinars to YouTube channel content. Metadata aspects, such as subtitles and additional video data, are handled with the same level of accuracy. The end result: create content that’s not just good, but structurally great and accessible to all viewers. Customizable versatility across formats The real beauty of AI video generators lies in their flexibility. Need an Apple-friendly Quicktime video? Done. A Windows Media video for Microsoft users? No problem. Some generators can even support less common video formats, including MOV, AVI, WMV, and MPEG-4. With added functionality like customizable video templates and transitions, you have a lot of leeway in personalizing videos to your liking using an AI video template.

We’ve summed it up in three steps below. Define your objectives and requirements First, clarify what you want to achieve with an AI video generator. Whether it's social media content, training videos, or explainer videos, each objective requires different features. If you’re using AI software to create high-quality YouTube videos, for example, you'll need robust voiceovers and sharp visuals. If you're a beginner, prioritize AI tools that offer an easy-to-navigate dashboard and straightforward video editing capabilities. Research and compare options Don't grab the first AI video maker you stumble upon. Invest some time in research and make informed comparisons. Scrutinize the pricing models, both free plans and paid options, and align them with your budget. Check the types of video templates on offer, and make sure they align with your content creation goals. Reviews from previous users can be helpful too. Try before you commit Top-of-the-line video generators like Descript have free plans or trial periods. Take advantage of them and test each generator to check whether they meet your objectives and requirements. Be mindful of any watermarks or other limitations that come with the free plan, too, since these could impact the professional look of your videos.
