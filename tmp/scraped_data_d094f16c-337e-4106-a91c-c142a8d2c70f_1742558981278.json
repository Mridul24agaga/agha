Source: Medium.com The Process of Video Generation Using AI Video generation using AI involves a complex process that combines data analysis, machine learning, and creative content creation. The process begins with collecting and preprocessing a vast amount of data, including images, videos, and scripts.

This training process allows the algorithms to learn the visual elements, storytelling techniques, and other creative aspects of video production. After the training process, the AI algorithms are capable of generating new video content based on the learned patterns and preferences. This AI-generated video content can be customized to suit specific business requirements and can be used for a range of purposes, including marketing campaigns, product demonstrations, training videos, and more. The use of AI in video generation offers several advantages for businesses. It allows for faster and more cost-effective video production, as AI algorithms can generate content at a much faster pace than human editors. Additionally, AI-generated videos can be easily customized to target specific audiences and can incorporate personalized elements, such as logos, branding, and messages. Furthermore, AI-generated videos can be optimized for different platforms and devices, ensuring that the content is displayed correctly and effectively across various channels, including websites, social media platforms, and mobile devices. The Role of AI in Video Production AI technology plays a significant role in video production by enhancing video quality and speeding up the production process. But what exactly does this mean for businesses and content creators? Enhancing Video Quality with AI AI algorithms can analyze and enhance video content by automatically adjusting lighting, color, and other elements to create visually appealing videos. This ensures that businesses can produce high-quality videos that captivate and engage their target audience. Imagine a scenario where a company wants to create a promotional video for their new product. With AI technology, they can ensure that the video is visually stunning and attention-grabbing. The AI algorithms analyze the footage and make precise adjustments to the lighting, ensuring that the product is showcased in the best possible way. Colors are enhanced to make the video more vibrant and appealing, creating a visual experience that leaves a lasting impression on viewers. Furthermore, AI can also assist in optimizing video resolution. By analyzing the content, AI algorithms can upscale the video to higher resolutions, enhancing the overall viewing experience. This is particularly useful for businesses that want to create videos for large screens or high-resolution displays. Speeding Up the Video Production Process Traditionally, video production involves time-consuming tasks such as filming, editing, and post-production. However, with the advent of AI-generated video content, this process has been revolutionized, saving businesses valuable time and resources. While we're focused on the benefits and positive aspects of the technology here, it's important to note there is also a lot of controversy around ethical usage, jobs being replaced, and widespread adoption without oversight. We'll leave it at that for this article. Ok, let's take a closer look at how AI speeds up the video production process. Imagine a content creator who wants to produce a series of tutorial videos for their online platform. In the past, they would have to spend hours editing each video, cutting out mistakes, and adding visual effects. With AI, this process becomes much more efficient. AI algorithms can automatically edit videos, removing unnecessary footage, and even adding transitions and effects to enhance the overall production value. This not only saves time but also ensures a consistent and professional look across all videos in the series. Content creators can focus on the creative aspects of video production, while AI takes care of the technical details. Moreover, AI can assist in automating other aspects of video production, such as voiceover generation and captioning. By analyzing the video content, AI algorithms can generate realistic and natural-sounding voiceovers, eliminating the need for hiring voice actors. Additionally, AI can automatically generate captions for videos, making them more accessible to a wider audience. In conclusion, AI technology has revolutionized the world of video production. It enhances video quality by automatically adjusting various elements, creating visually stunning videos that captivate viewers. Moreover, it speeds up the production process by automating tasks such as video editing, saving businesses valuable time and resources. As AI continues to advance, we can expect even more exciting developments in the field of video production. Benefits of Using AI Generated Video for Business The use of AI generated video offers several benefits for businesses of all sizes. In addition to the advantages mentioned, there are other compelling reasons why companies should consider incorporating AI-generated videos into their marketing strategies. Cost-Effective Video Production AI-generated video content reduces the need for extensive manual labor and expensive resources, making it a cost-effective solution for businesses. By leveraging AI technology, companies can streamline their video production process and save both time and money. Traditional video production methods often require a team of professionals, including scriptwriters, actors, directors, and editors, which can be costly. With AI, companies can create high-quality videos at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional methods. AI can also automate various aspects of video production, such as video editing, which can significantly reduce the time and effort required to produce a polished final product. This allows businesses to allocate their resources more efficiently and focus on other critical areas of their operations. Creating Personalized Video Content Personalization is key to effective marketing, and AI-generated videos can be customized to cater to individual customer preferences. By analyzing customer data and behavior, businesses can create personalized video content that resonates with their target audience, resulting in higher engagement and better conversion rates. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data, such as browsing history, purchase patterns, and social media interactions, to understand each customer's unique preferences and interests. With this information, businesses can tailor their video content to deliver personalized messages, product recommendations, and offers that are more likely to capture the attention of their customers. Additionally, AI can dynamically adapt video content in real-time based on user interactions. For example, an AI-generated video advertisement can adjust its narrative or showcase different product features based on the viewer's responses or actions. This level of personalization enhances the viewer's experience and increases the chances of conversion.

With the ever-evolving landscape of digital marketing, staying ahead of the curve is crucial for businesses to maintain a competitive edge. One of the latest advancements in email marketing is the integration of AI-generated videos.

Boosting Click-Through Rates with AI Video Adding AI-generated videos to email marketing campaigns can significantly boost click-through rates. Gone are the days of plain text emails that often get overlooked in crowded inboxes. Now, marketers have the power to captivate their subscribers with visually appealing and personalized videos. Imagine receiving an email that not only addresses you by name but also includes a video tailored to your specific interests and needs. This level of personalization creates a compelling and immersive experience that is hard to resist. As a result, recipients are more likely to click on the video, leading to increased engagement and higher click-through rates. Moreover, AI video technology enables marketers to analyze user behavior and preferences, allowing them to deliver relevant and timely content. By leveraging data-driven insights, marketers can create videos that resonate with their audience, increasing the chances of conversion and driving revenue growth.

Furthermore, AI video technology can dynamically update content in real-time. This means that marketers can deliver videos that are always up-to-date, ensuring that their message remains relevant and impactful. Whether it's showcasing the latest product features or announcing limited-time offers, AI video keeps the content fresh and engaging. AI Video in SEO Strategy Search engine optimization (SEO) plays a crucial role in driving organic traffic to websites, and AI video can be a game-changer in improving search engine rankings. When it comes to SEO, content is king. And in today's digital landscape, videos have become an integral part of content marketing strategies. However, simply uploading a video to your website is not enough to ensure it gets noticed by search engines. That's where AI video technology can help. Improving Search Engine Rankings with AI Video AI video technology leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze video content and generate relevant metadata. By optimizing videos with keywords, captions, and transcripts, marketers can enhance their website's SEO and improve its visibility in search engine results. Pro Tip: Great tools like Speak's AI video-to-text converter not only allow you to generate high-quality accurate transcripts but also use large language models to help marketers instantly repurpose content. But how exactly does AI video technology help in improving search engine rankings? Well, search engines like Google use complex algorithms to determine the relevance and quality of web pages.

By integrating AI tools into existing workflows, digital marketing agencies can streamline the process of creating and distributing video content while also personalising it for your target audience. According to a report by Wyzowl, 86% of businesses use video as a marketing tool, and 91% of those believe it's a crucial part of their strategy. However, creating compelling and engaging video content can take time and effort. That's where AI comes in - it can help automate many tasks involved in creating video content, such as generating ideas, writing scripts, and even making the final video: What is AI-powered video marketing Benefits of using artificial intelligence in video marketing strategy The 3-step process of using ChatGPT to create video content A list of trending AI video creation tools What is AI-powered video marketing AI-powered video marketing uses artificial intelligence to optimise and streamline the video marketing process. This approach differs from the traditional one because it uses AI technology to create, analyse, and distribute video content. The role of artificial intelligence in the video marketing process is to automate many of the tasks involved in creating video content, making the process more efficient and cost-effective. For example, AI-powered tools can generate ideas for video content based on data analysis or existing content, automatically write scripts, and even create the final video using pre-existing footage, animation, or written content. In addition to content creation, you can use artificial intelligence tools to analyse and optimise videos for maximum impact. With machine learning algorithms, AI can track viewer engagement and use that data to inform future video content creation. AI can also analyse user behaviour and demographic data to personalise videos for specific audiences, increasing engagement and conversion rates. Overall, using AI in video marketing allows for a more data-driven, efficient, and effective approach to video content creation and distribution. How To Leverage AI for Social Media Posts: Take Your Content To the Next Level Learn how Benefits of using artificial intelligence in video marketing strategy There are numerous benefits to using AI-powered social media videos in your digital marketing strategy. Here are some of the most notable advantages. Increased efficiency One of the main benefits of using AI in video marketing is the ability to streamline the content creation process. AI can generate ideas, write scripts, and even create the final video, freeing up time and resources for other tasks. You can then use Sendible's bulk import feature to make sure everything is ready to go for when the time comes. This increased efficiency allows more video content to be made and distributed in less time, leading to better engagement and, ultimately, more conversions. Personalised content With AI-powered video marketing, it's possible to create personalised social media videos that have content tailored to specific audiences. AI can create content that resonates with individual viewers by analysing user data, such as browsing history and demographic information. This personalised approach leads to increased engagement and a more positive user experience. Better audience targeting AI can also analyse audience data and optimise video content for maximum impact. AI-powered analytics tools can track viewer engagement and use that data to inform future content creation. For example, at Sendible we use social media analytics to better understand what posts are bringing in engagement and what the optimal time is to post content on different platforms. This audience data allows marketers to make better decisions. With this data-driven approach, marketers can create video content that resonates with the correct target audience, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates. The 3-step process of using ChatGPT to create video content If you're ready to implement AI-powered video marketing into your digital marketing strategy, here's a step-by-step guide on how to ideate and create video content using ChatGPT prompts: Step 1: Come up with an idea by using AI video generator prompts Step 2: Create the video script Step 3: Prepare title, description, and promotional copy Step 1: Come up with an idea by using AI video generator prompts Feel free to skip this step if you already have a list of topics you'd like to cover. If not, try this tactic. Before heading to ChatGPT, remember the first rule of using artificial intelligence tools - they are not perfect, and they are always learning. You need to lead a conversation with it to get what you need. Now that we've covered that, it's time to open the chat. At this stage, you're just looking for ideas. But your prompt will have to be as specific as possible and include this information: Who is creating the video? What's your target audience? What is their most significant pain point? How many ideas do you want? Here's an example of a prompt: Imagine you're a social media manager in an agency looking to create up to 10-minute-long YouTube videos. Your target audience is fashion brands looking to improve their social media presence and boost eCommerce sales. I want you to create 10 video ideas in a table, addressing the pain points they must be experiencing, then lead towards the actual reason they are experiencing this and give a solution. In a matter of seconds, you'll be provided with this: You can then ask it to add additional columns, such as viral hooks. You can keep tweaking these ideas until you're pleased with the list and they align with your goals. And once this is done, all you have to do is run a quick keyword research, depending on the platform where you wish to publish the video. You want to ensure you'll include trending and relevant phrases that will target the right audience. Step 2: Create the video script You can choose whichever AI tool you like, but we'll continue using ChatGPT to demonstrate the process. This step consists of three stages: Outline Script Tweaks How to create a video outline? Your ideas are ready, and now's the time to write the outline for the first one. Use a prompt similar to this one to get started: Create an outline of an up to 10-minute-long YouTube video based on the second video idea you provided: 2. Common Social Media Mistakes Made by Fashion Brands Description: We'll explore the common mistakes that fashion brands make on social media, why these mistakes can harm their eCommerce sales, and how to avoid them. Viral Hook/Emotional Factor: Viral Hook: \"The cringe-worthy social media fails that will make you laugh (and cry)\" Emotional Factor: Humor The outline you receive should include the names of the chapters and the outline of each of them. In this case, the result included seven chapters and bullet-point lists for each one of them. If you're not 100% happy with the outline, now's the time to rewrite it or adjust particular sections. How to write a video script? Great! Your outline is ready; it's time to create the script. We found that it's best not to overwhelm the chat with too much information at once. So take it easy and start with a simple request: Please write the video script for YouTube based on the outline you provided. Use trendy tone and language typical for the fashion industry. Make it very engaging, action-focused, and witty. Ensure that each chapter can be repurposed as a standalone, short-form video on other social media platforms. You might get lucky and get a perfectly crafted script, but typically you'll get decent content without timestamps and calls to action. But don't worry. That's why we have the tweaking stage. Bonus tip: If a creator uses a particular tone you fell in love with, and you'd like your video to sound just like that, instruct ChatGPT to use the language tone of [insert video link]. Unfortunately, this will only work if the video was published before 2022. For now. How to tweak the video script? Your video script is good, but it's not perfect yet. It could be too short or missing time stamps, names of chapters, or calls to action. Nothing to worry about! Just continue the chat with a prompt similar to this one: The video should be at least 5 minutes long. Please adjust the length of content, add timestamps for each paragraph (normal speed of speech), add names of chapters, promote agencies services for fashion brands in the intro and outro, and invite them to learn more about these services in the link in the description of the video. Step 3: Prepare title, description, and promotional copy The choice is yours - you can either record and edit the video first or wrap up your chat with the AI tools first. I personally prefer the latter. Here are the prompts you can use to get the title, description, and social media copy for the promotion posts. Title: Suggest a few attention-grabbing titles for the video on the topic: Common Social Media Mistakes Made by Fashion Brands. Video description: Great! Please write the video description that includes these sections and use emojis: About the video Timecodes Additional resources Call to action to learn more about the services Copy for social media posts: Write a few social media posts that I could use to promote this video. Include emojis and relevant hashtags. Email content: Now I need content for the email that will promote this video. Please write: A few email subject line options (no more than 9 words and 60 characters each) A few email snippets (up to 50 characters each) T__itle (engaging and attention-grabbing) Copy that includes a call to action to watch the full video A list of trending AI video creation tools The choice is yours - you can record and edit the videos the traditional way, or you can experiment with artificial intelligence.

Load More Results Home Marketing Disruptive AI Video Trends that are Transforming Marketing in 2024 Disruptive AI Video Trends that are Transforming Marketing in 2024 Written by: Kipp Bodnar and Kieran Flanagan THE STATE OF AI IN 2024 New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing with AI. Download the Free Report Updated: 08/01/24 Published: 07/23/24 AI-generated video content is turning the marketing world on its head. But what trends should marketers be focusing on to stay ahead of the competition? If you've been following the latest buzz in AI marketing trends — and you should be — you know that AI video tools are at the forefront of this change. Whether it’s trained ad avatars or hyper-personalized video scripts, these technologies are irreversibly changing how we create content and engage with our audiences. But with such rapid innovation, what’s actually worth the hype? Kieran and I experimented with some of these new developments in a recent episode of Marketing Against the Grain, including a viral AI video on Twitter and an AI-generated ad created in less than 15 minutes. Among the many AI video options available, these four trends have been particularly notable — and are worth paying close attention to. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video 1. Avatar actors and likeness licensing are the new norm. Instead of hiring an actor to read a script or act in an ad, businesses can now license an actor’s likeness, use it to train an AI model, and then use that model to create ads and avatars. This enables marketers to quickly generate a variety of content, testing, and refining different approaches and messages without the logistical constraints of traditional video shoots. For example, this viral video ad features a woman casually talking about a product while seated inside her car. What’s so significant about it, however, is that while she’s a real actress hired off of Fiverr, the video itself is generated by AI video, using tools like Arcads. \"This produces video content that is human-trained but AI-agent delivered,\" Kieran explains. \"That’s quite an unbelievable concept to think through.\" 2. Low-quality but authentic content is driving engagement. Polished, high-budget video ads are quickly becoming a thing of the past — or at least, less favored by audiences. Instead, low-production, personable videos are taking the lead, outperforming traditional ads on platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels. Take, for example, the viral video I mentioned above: it’s not polished or high-budget. Instead, it’s set in a poorly-lit car, with an unflattering angle. Yet people are more likely to engage with it. Why? \"Because it feels authentic, relatable, and personable,\" Kieran explains. \"It’s how a real person would talk about a product.\" For marketers, this shift means experimenting with AI tools like HeyGen and InfinityAI, which quickly create videos that drive engagement, despite — or even because of — their imperfections. 3. Video personalization and customization are must-haves. Hyper-personalized videos that cater to customers’ accessibility needs, languages, and preferences are essential for successful marketing campaigns. During the episode, we highlighted how AI tools can use customer data from your CRM platform — like call logs, support tickets, and emails — to craft personalized video scripts. This enables marketing teams to deliver tailored content that feels uniquely targeted and relevant to each individual viewer. We also experimented with HeyGen’s groundbreaking Avatar in Motion, which creates customized avatars based on your own likeness. Move your hands, make gestures, or use unique tones of voice, and HeyGen will flawlessly track, translate, and lip-sync your video with any customizable input text. 4. Accelerated iteration is driving innovation. AI tools significantly speed up the iteration cycle for creative video content and limit lengthy and expensive production cycles. For example, during the episode, I showed Kieran how I designed and launched a video ad in less than 15 minutes. To stay ahead, marketers need to quickly and constantly innovate, as the ease of copying and templatizing creative work will lead to a rapid commoditization of content. Standard approaches to AI-powered video content may outperform current methods in the short term because they’re new and different. But effectiveness is likely to peak within the first six to twelve months. Then, it will taper off as audiences get used to it and become aware of its widespread use. \"Your best-performing content will now be ‘best-performing’ for a much shorter period of time,\" says Kieran. In other words: your iteration of ‘creative’ as a marketer will have to increase exponentially. Differentiation will rely heavily on the unique 10-20% of creative input, putting increased pressure on marketers to continually produce new and distinctive ideas. Three Tips for Integrating AI into Your Video Marketing Strategy Learn how to incorporate AI into your video workflow by downloading our AI Guide for Marketers and following the tips below. 1. Experiment. Experiment. Experiment. Test different AI video tools to understand their benefits and limitations, helping you find the best fit for your campaign needs and goals. This keeps your team ahead of the competition, identifying new opportunities to capture the attention of your customers. 2. Enhance the Tools You Already Use Not sure where to start? Try using AI video features that already exist in your current marketing tech stack. For example, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Mailchimp offer AI-powered capabilities that boost your marketing effectiveness by automating production processes and offering more detailed performance insights for iteration. 3. Monitor Legal and Ethical Considerations As AI video production becomes more prevalent, legal considerations around likeness licensing and content use will become increasingly important. Invest in the proper training and resources now to ensure you are using AI effectively and ethically in the future.

Additionally, 89% of marketers claim that video gives them a good return on investment. Creating high-quality marketing videos, however, has traditionally been very costly and time consuming. AI video generators solve this problem by allowing businesses and content creators to generate industry-standard videos with ease. This innovation grants these users the ability to craft high-quality videos without needing a studio or a professional production team, which allows for instant content production. AI Video Generators: Revolutionizing Content Creation With AI video generators, businesses and content creators can now make amazing videos directly on their computers without the use of a professional video studio. These tools utilize AI automation to create awesome content with transitions, animations, and other engaging visuals. Content creators across platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook are particularly benefiting from AI-powered video creation. Many use AI-generated videos combined with AI voice generators to produce professional voiceovers, ensuring clear and engaging narration. This is helping content creators push out high-quality promotional videos efficiently while maintaining a consistent style and branding. The Role of AI Video Generators with Human Avatars One of the most thrilling AI advances in video production is the development of AI video generators with human avatars. These solutions enable companies to generate well-designed marketing videos with realistic digital presenters. Companies are using AI avatars to communicate targeted messages, do product demos, and create explainer videos without the need to engage actors or schedule filming sessions. To further enhance realism, scripted voices used in AI-generated videos can be refined using AI humanizers. These tools transform scripts into more natural sounding dialogue, making AI-generated speech more human-like. This results in audience interactions that feel less robotic and more engaging. As a result, messages are delivered to users by AI avatars in a more realistic and relatable manner. For instance, e-commerce brands are integrating AI avatars into their marketing strategies to present products in a more engaging manner. AI avatars can be customized to match a brand’s personality, offering a more humanized and interactive experience. This enhances customer engagement and improves conversion rates. How AI Video Tools Boost Marketing Strategies Cost-Effective Production Traditional video production requires expensive equipment, studio rentals, and professional actors. AI-generated videos eliminate these costs, allowing even small businesses to produce high-quality content affordably. Faster Content Creation AI tools enable marketers to create videos in minutes rather than weeks. This is particularly useful for brands that need to release promotional content frequently, keeping up with trends and consumer demands. Scalability and Personalization AI-generated videos can be tailored for different audiences, languages, and demographics. AI avatars and voice generators allow brands to personalize videos at scale, making them more relevant to specific customer segments. Improved Engagement AI-powered videos with human avatars and realistic voiceovers enhance viewer engagement. Studies show that video content increases retention rates by 95% compared to text-based content. This makes AI-generated videos a powerful tool for capturing and retaining audience attention. The Future of AI in Video Marketing The rapid advancements in AI-powered video creation indicate that this technology is here to stay. As AI becomes more sophisticated, we can expect even more realistic human avatars, improved voice synthesis, and better automation tools for marketers. AI video generation is not just a trend; it’s a revolution in digital marketing that is empowering businesses and content creators to produce professional, engaging, and cost-effective videos effortlessly. Whether you are a YouTube creator, a small business owner, or a large corporation, leveraging AI-driven video tools can significantly enhance your marketing strategy and brand presence. By embracing AI video generators, AI video generators with human avatars, AI humanizers and AI voice generators, businesses can streamline content production, increase audience engagement, and boost their overall marketing efforts in the digital age.
