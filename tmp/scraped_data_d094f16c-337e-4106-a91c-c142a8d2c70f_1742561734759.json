Load More Results Home Marketing Disruptive AI Video Trends that are Transforming Marketing in 2024 Disruptive AI Video Trends that are Transforming Marketing in 2024 Written by: Kipp Bodnar and Kieran Flanagan THE STATE OF AI IN 2024 New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing with AI. Download the Free Report Updated: 08/01/24 Published: 07/23/24 AI-generated video content is turning the marketing world on its head. But what trends should marketers be focusing on to stay ahead of the competition? If you've been following the latest buzz in AI marketing trends — and you should be — you know that AI video tools are at the forefront of this change. Whether it’s trained ad avatars or hyper-personalized video scripts, these technologies are irreversibly changing how we create content and engage with our audiences. But with such rapid innovation, what’s actually worth the hype? Kieran and I experimented with some of these new developments in a recent episode of Marketing Against the Grain, including a viral AI video on Twitter and an AI-generated ad created in less than 15 minutes. Among the many AI video options available, these four trends have been particularly notable — and are worth paying close attention to. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video 1. Avatar actors and likeness licensing are the new norm. Instead of hiring an actor to read a script or act in an ad, businesses can now license an actor’s likeness, use it to train an AI model, and then use that model to create ads and avatars. This enables marketers to quickly generate a variety of content, testing, and refining different approaches and messages without the logistical constraints of traditional video shoots. For example, this viral video ad features a woman casually talking about a product while seated inside her car. What’s so significant about it, however, is that while she’s a real actress hired off of Fiverr, the video itself is generated by AI video, using tools like Arcads. \"This produces video content that is human-trained but AI-agent delivered,\" Kieran explains. \"That’s quite an unbelievable concept to think through.\" 2. Low-quality but authentic content is driving engagement. Polished, high-budget video ads are quickly becoming a thing of the past — or at least, less favored by audiences. Instead, low-production, personable videos are taking the lead, outperforming traditional ads on platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels. Take, for example, the viral video I mentioned above: it’s not polished or high-budget. Instead, it’s set in a poorly-lit car, with an unflattering angle. Yet people are more likely to engage with it. Why? \"Because it feels authentic, relatable, and personable,\" Kieran explains. \"It’s how a real person would talk about a product.\" For marketers, this shift means experimenting with AI tools like HeyGen and InfinityAI, which quickly create videos that drive engagement, despite — or even because of — their imperfections. 3. Video personalization and customization are must-haves. Hyper-personalized videos that cater to customers’ accessibility needs, languages, and preferences are essential for successful marketing campaigns. During the episode, we highlighted how AI tools can use customer data from your CRM platform — like call logs, support tickets, and emails — to craft personalized video scripts. This enables marketing teams to deliver tailored content that feels uniquely targeted and relevant to each individual viewer. We also experimented with HeyGen’s groundbreaking Avatar in Motion, which creates customized avatars based on your own likeness. Move your hands, make gestures, or use unique tones of voice, and HeyGen will flawlessly track, translate, and lip-sync your video with any customizable input text. 4. Accelerated iteration is driving innovation. AI tools significantly speed up the iteration cycle for creative video content and limit lengthy and expensive production cycles. For example, during the episode, I showed Kieran how I designed and launched a video ad in less than 15 minutes. To stay ahead, marketers need to quickly and constantly innovate, as the ease of copying and templatizing creative work will lead to a rapid commoditization of content. Standard approaches to AI-powered video content may outperform current methods in the short term because they’re new and different. But effectiveness is likely to peak within the first six to twelve months. Then, it will taper off as audiences get used to it and become aware of its widespread use. \"Your best-performing content will now be ‘best-performing’ for a much shorter period of time,\" says Kieran. In other words: your iteration of ‘creative’ as a marketer will have to increase exponentially. Differentiation will rely heavily on the unique 10-20% of creative input, putting increased pressure on marketers to continually produce new and distinctive ideas. Three Tips for Integrating AI into Your Video Marketing Strategy Learn how to incorporate AI into your video workflow by downloading our AI Guide for Marketers and following the tips below. 1. Experiment. Experiment. Experiment. Test different AI video tools to understand their benefits and limitations, helping you find the best fit for your campaign needs and goals. This keeps your team ahead of the competition, identifying new opportunities to capture the attention of your customers. 2. Enhance the Tools You Already Use Not sure where to start? Try using AI video features that already exist in your current marketing tech stack. For example, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Mailchimp offer AI-powered capabilities that boost your marketing effectiveness by automating production processes and offering more detailed performance insights for iteration. 3. Monitor Legal and Ethical Considerations As AI video production becomes more prevalent, legal considerations around likeness licensing and content use will become increasingly important. Invest in the proper training and resources now to ensure you are using AI effectively and ethically in the future.

Let's paste the YouTube video URL. Enter What is YouTube Data Viewer? YouTube metadata viewer grabs singular details about a YouTube video and the channel that uploaded it. It finds video statistics, video category, number of Video 'Likes' and Dislikes, regions where the video is restricted and channel information. It also finds the exact upload time and date of the video and automatically converts it to your country's time zone (the time zone of the country you are in). Find out exactly when the YouTube video was uploaded, and The Exact Day, month, and time when the was uploaded. You may come across a video from YouTube in an investigation or court case. Or you may have wondered exactly when a channel you follow on youtube uploads videos. In this tool, we explain how you can find out the exact date, day, and time a video was published on YouTube. We call this YouTube video upload time. The upload date format of the video is as follows: Year - Month - Day Hour : Minute : Second. (24 Hour Format - ISO 8601) Month / Day / Year Hour : Minute : Second. (American Date and Time Format) To get statistics and information about a YouTube video, simply paste the video URL into the box. What does the video's last modified time mean? The video last modified time is typically the moment when the Upload button is clicked. It shows how long the video was kept before being published. However, if the video is edited after its publication date, the last modified time will be updated accordingly. For instance, in the image above, the video was actually uploaded to YouTube at 15:11:26 in the afternoon (the moment the Upload button was clicked!), but it was kept as a draft for some time and eventually published in the evening at 18:30:03. 9 minutes, 13 seconds represents the time from the moment the video was uploaded to YouTube until the video was processed and became fully watchable. In this sense, the video last modified time reflects when the video was originally uploaded to YouTube, providing insights into the uploader's strategy.

The best generative AI video tools at a glance | Product | Best for | Modalities | Platforms | Free plan | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Kling | High quality, realistic output | Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video | Web, API | Yes, with daily credits and watermark | | Sora | Realistic, fast, wide-ranging output | Text-to-Video | Web | No | | Hailuo Minimax | Complex and long videos | Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video | Web, API | Yes, with daily credits and watermark | | Runway | Cinematic output and editing | Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video, Video-to-Video, AI editing tools | Web, iOS, API | Yes, with one-time credits and watermark | | Pika | Experimental multi-input videos | Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video, Video-to-Video | Web, iOS, API | Yes, with monthly credits and watermark | | Magic Hour | Video manipulation, animation, and free tools | Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video, Video-to-Video, AI editing tools | Web, API | Yes, with free tools, daily credits, and watermark | | Hunyuan | Open-source, local generation | Text-to-Video, Video-to-Video | Open Source | Yes, if you run it locally or are in China | | Luma Labs | Long image-to-video generations | Image-to-Video | Web, iOS, API | Yes, with monthly credits and watermark | | Domo | Anime video-to-video | Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video, Video-to-Video | Web | No | Best Generative AI Video Platform Overall Kling (Web, API) Kling pros: Consistent high-quality, realistic text-to-video and image-to-video generation Generous daily usage with up to 6 free daily videos (5 seconds each) Advanced features such as motion control and start and end frame options Kling cons: Training data skews towards Asian subjects Restrictive content moderation on both prompts and output API pricing is prohibitively expensive If you’re looking for a generative AI video platform that delivers consistent, high-quality results, Kling is hard to beat. With up to 6 free videos a day and advanced features like motion control and start/end frames, it’s designed for users who want professional-grade videos without the hassle. That said, it’s not without its quirks. The training data leans heavily toward Asian subjects, which can limit diversity in output, and their strict content moderation can feel restrictive. Plus, the API pricing isn’t cheap—so if you’re on a tight budget, it might not be the best fit. But if quality and reliability are your top priorities, Kling’s capabilities make it worth considering. Price: Free for limited previews. Paid plans unlock advanced features and higher limits. Best Generative AI Video Platform for Quality Sora (Web) Sora pros: Free with ChatGPT Plus (50 videos per month) Unlimited videos with ChatGPT Pro ($200 per month) Extremely fast, realistic, and diverse generations Sora cons: ChatGPT Pro is expensive at $200 per month Restrictive when generating videos featuring people Web app is unintuitive, and no API is available If you’re all about speed and quality, Sora is in a league of its own. The platform generates stunningly realistic and diverse videos at an impressive speed, making it ideal for anyone who values fast results without compromising on output quality. However, it’s not for everyone. The $200 monthly cost for unlimited videos with ChatGPT Pro might be a stretch for casual users, and its strict limitations on videos with people can feel limiting. Plus, the web app isn’t exactly user-friendly, and the lack of an API means you’re stuck working within their interface. But for those who need high-quality videos quickly—whether you’re prototyping, storytelling, or creating polished content—Sora delivers exceptional results. Sora price: Free with ChatGPT Plus. Pro plan unlock unlimited videos upon GPU availability. Best Generative AI Video Platform for Long Complex Scenes Hailuo Minimax (Web, API) Hailuo Minimax pros: Excellent at handling long, complex prompts Smoothly transitions between multiple scenes within a single prompt Produces cinematic, visually stunning output Hailuo Minimax cons: Limited feature set compared to other platforms Minimal control options outside of prompt adjustments Motion blur issues during fast movements If you’re working on a project that requires intricate storytelling or seamless transitions between multiple scenes, Hailuo Minimax is the platform to beat. Its ability to interpret long, detailed prompts and generate cinematic-quality videos makes it a standout for creators with ambitious ideas. However, it’s not without its challenges. While the cinematic output is impressive, the feature set is barebones, meaning most adjustments have to be made through prompt refinement. Motion blur during fast movements can also be a drawback for action-heavy sequences. Hailuo Minimax is ideal for creators who prioritize narrative complexity and visual storytelling over granular control. It’s perfect for drafting and executing intricate ideas, offering a unique edge for those aiming to push the boundaries of generative AI video. Hailuo Minimax price: Trial output free. Paid plans unlock longer videos and more render credits. Best Generative AI Video Platform for Filmmakers Runway (Web, iOS, API) Runway pros: Advanced AI models for text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video Comprehensive toolkit for editing, background removal, and more Outputs are often cinematic and visually polished Runway cons: Credits go quickly if you experiment extensively Requires significant testing to get desired results User interface and credit/feature system can be unintuitive If you’re a filmmaker looking for a versatile platform to explore AI-generated video, Runway is a strong contender.

Best Generative AI Video Platform for Developers Hunyuan (Open Source) Hunyuan Pros: Completely free Highest-quality open-source text-to-video model available Active community of developers contributing to continuous improvements Hunyuan Cons: Requires developer knowledge and access to sufficient compute resources May lose its edge as the best open-source model as new competitors emerge Not beginner-friendly for those without technical experience For developers and enthusiasts who value open-source flexibility, Hunyuan is the leading option for text-to-video generation. With its active developer community and support for loras, it’s a platform designed for customization and innovation. If you’re looking to tweak, train, or integrate video generation into your own applications, Hunyuan provides the tools and freedom to make it happen. However, it’s not for the faint of heart. Getting the most out of Hunyuan requires a solid technical background and access to adequate compute resources. While its quality is impressive, its position as the top open-source model may be challenged as the space evolves. For those willing to put in the work, Hunyuan is a powerful tool for creating personalized, high-quality video outputs with open-source flexibility. Hunyuan Price: Free to use with open-source access. Paid cloud-based options may vary by provider for enhanced rendering capabilities. Best Generative AI Video Platform for Cinematic Mood and Lighting Luma Labs (Web, iOS, API) Luma Labs Pros: Exceptional handling of atmospheric lighting and mood Capable of creating emotional, cinematic scenes Useful for mood boards and evocative storytelling Luma Labs Cons: Limited to image-to-video functionality Quality and consistency can be unpredictable, often resulting in flat outputs Video features are hard to access, overshadowed by image-generation tools Luma Labs stands out for its ability to craft visually rich, emotionally evocative scenes, making it a strong choice for projects that demand cinematic mood and lighting. Its focus on atmosphere allows creators to bring dramatic storytelling to life, even within the constraints of its image-to-video feature set. However, it requires patience and experimentation due to its inconsistent output and buried video tools. If your primary goal is creating visually striking, atmospheric videos, Luma Labs offers a unique set of strengths. Luma Labs Price: Limited free renders. Paid plans unlock more exports and higher resolution. Best Generative AI Video Platform for Anime Style Video-to-Video Domo (Web) Domo Pros: Consistent and stable video-to-video transformations User-friendly interface makes it accessible for all skill levels Large Discord community with active product integration Domo Cons: Performance is limited outside of video-to-video functionality Quality may not meet the standards of professional production needs Offers limited customization beyond basic style transformations Domo is the go-to platform for anime-style video-to-video editing, delivering reliable transformations that stay true to the original content while applying a distinct anime aesthetic. With a user-friendly interface and a supportive community, it’s an ideal choice for creators looking to explore this niche style without a steep learning curve. While Domo excels at video-to-video work, it falls short when it comes to broader applications like text-to-video or complex customizations. The quality, while consistent, might not meet the demands of high-end professional projects, but it’s more than sufficient for social media, fan content, or creative experimentation. Domo Price: Trial credits available. Paid plans unlock extended features and higher-quality outputs. Best Generative AI Video Platform for Open Source Experimentation Genmo (Web, Open Source) Genmo Pros: Mochi 1 is open-source, enabling local running and full customizability Web app available for quick testing and experimentation Mochi Edit is a strong open-source model for video editing Genmo Cons: Output quality is lower compared to competitors Limited stylistic controls compared to more polished platforms Struggles with prompt adherence, especially for pop culture-related requests Genmo strikes a balance between open-source flexibility and web-based convenience. Whether you’re looking to run models locally for full control or prefer the ease of testing ideas on a web app, Genmo has you covered. Its Mochi Edit tool is particularly noteworthy for video editing, offering a robust option for creators who value open-source tools. However, Genmo’s quality doesn’t quite match that of more advanced competitors, and its stylistic control options are limited. Prompt adherence, especially for pop culture themes, can be hit or miss, making it less reliable for highly specific creative needs. For developers and creators who prioritize customization and accessibility, Genmo provides a unique platform that bridges the gap between open-source flexibility and user-friendly web-based tools. Genmo Price: Limited free credits. Paid plans vary based on usage and features.

Generate Al videos with just text Create AI-Generated Videos Using Simple Prompts Try for free 1. Invideo AI Ready to make pro-level videos without the pro-level stress? Things are about to get easier with invideo AI by your side (even if you’re an absolute beginner). Forget the hefty investment in cameras and gear. With invideo AI, all you need to do is “imagine” what kind of video you want to produce and give a prompt based on that (e.g. create a video on “5 productivity tips and use American male accent”, and voilà – it’ll transform your ideas into stunning videos within minutes! So whether you're a budding entrepreneur, a content creator, or a marketer aiming to build your online presence, invideo AI will be your go-to tool. Best For: Pretty much everything! With invideo AI you can make professional-quality videos for YouTube channel, Instagram reels, TikTok, and other purposes such as social media posts, marketing campaigns, and product demos. Top Features: 1. Extensive Stock Media Library Invideo's artificial intelligence video generator gives you access to more than 16 million stock photos and videos. This helps you easily search and put the right video clips into any part of your video. If you need a specific picture or multiple photos, it quickly looks through this big collection pile and picks the best ones. This makes sure your video looks good and matches the requirements. 2. Text Prompt Video Editing This tool makes video editing easier by letting you fix things with easy words or phrases. It's like telling a human video editor what to do, but it's even easier with a tool. Need to remove a scene, use different stock footage, or change the accent? Just give a prompt, and the AI will do the rest. This makes editing easier, even if you don't know much about editing. 3. AI-Powered Script Generation Invideo's AI script maker helps you make interesting, custom scripts for any video project, which saves you a lot of time in writing scripts. This tool is especially useful for platforms like YouTube, where your content needs to be intriguing enough to engage people & grow your channel. 4. Affordable Voiceover Alternatives The AI voiceover generator is a cheaper option than paying for professional voice actors. It makes a speech that sounds like a human in multiple accents, understanding the feeling, intent, and emotion behind each word. This function makes your videos feel alive, adding a professional look without costing too much. Pros It quickly changes your words into videos, making creating content more manageable. You can spend more time on your work and less on technical stuff. With more than 16 million stock media choices, you have access to a unique selection of pictures. This is perfect if you want to create top-notch quality videos without investing hours in creating them. AI-powered script generation can save you a lot of time in making regular, good-quality video content. It's especially helpful if you often face writer's block or have tight schedules. The AI voiceover generator tool can save money while still giving a good sound experience. This is really helpful if you own a small business or are an individual creator. Cons Initially, you might need some time to learn how to interact with the AI well to get the results you want. However, as you proceed, this eventually gets easier as the interface itself is pretty user-friendly. The free version includes watermarks. But, this is a small worry because the paid version starts at just $25/month and gives you a ton of premium features. Pricing Basic: Free Plus: $25/month Max: $60/month (The yearly plans start as low as $20/month) Sign up for invideo AI and start creating high-quality videos within minutes. Try online AI video maker Create high-quality videos for your business with AI video maker easily Get Started Now 2. Descript Do you need help with problems like evoking human facial expressions and emotional responses or the technical bottlenecks that make the video generation process time-consuming? If yes, Descript can help your creative workflow and enrich the quality of your output, making it more high-end and appealing. Moreover, it also realizes the significance of the human side of video production as it's not designed to replace human creativity but to make it better, to give you a vision, and to let the AI do the heavy lifting. Best For: As such, it's best suited to content creators, podcasters, and filmmakers who need to save time and get things done the right way. Because it is a text-based editing system, even the not-so-tech-savvy can use it. Top Features: 1. Automated Transcription Manually transcribing audio and video is time-consuming. To save time, Descript automatically transcribes all your recordings. Since the transcription is merely a text file, if you edit the transcription content, you can also edit the audio or video file itself. 2. Overdub Voice Cloning With Descript's Overdub function, you can type in the missing or correct text and then artificially generate the new audio in your voice or that of the guest. Creating a voice clone of this type involves using a voice sample to make the process convenient and smooth. 3. Studio Sound Editing Poor audio quality can negatively impact great content. Descript tackles this problem with its Studio Sound feature, which applies state-of-the-art AI to enhance the sound quality of audio files. It eliminates noise, hum, and distortion, giving a cleaner and more professional studio-type sound. 4. Video Green Screen and AI Eye Contact The green screen background editor lets you change the environment behind the video, just like a Zoom feature, so you can have more control over how you present your content. This facilitates the humanizing of the video and adds to its realism. Pros It offers a fantastic transcription tool that can automatically transcribe audio and video files into text in 23 languages. It's a handy platform that lets you cut, rearrange, or alter the contents and simplifies editing. It improves the recorded audio quality by making the spoken words much clearer. This makes your content sound super-smooth without you having to edit out one word at a time. Descript also integrates with other platforms such as Slack (a team communication tool), Podbean (podcast hosting platform), Restream (a LIVE streaming studio), and even Final Cut Pro (a professional video editing application), to name a few. You also get tutorials on using the platform to help you quickly master the features and make the most of it. Cons The learning curve for Descript isn't very gentle for someone used to text-based editing. At first, this may seem patchy, but it is difficult for users of conventional timeline-based editing tools to work. Descript boasts a full range of powerful tools but may not meet the requirements of professional-level video editing. It doesn’t even provide the convenient access to advanced effects and controls that a professional editing package would provide. Pricing is a per-person, per-month fee. This can be costly for teams or organizations with many people, primarily if more than one person uses the software. Pricing Free Tier Creator Tier: $15 per user per month Pro Tier: $30 per user per month Enterprise Tier: Custom 3. Runway Runway is an advanced AI text-to-video generator that challenges how creative content is produced and edited. With more than 30 AI-powered creative tools on offer, it is a versatile product, capable of meeting the needs of filmmakers, artists, graphic designers, and content creators for YouTube and TikTok. Runway AI offers a wide range of features for video editing from trimming cropping and resizing to adding music, voiceovers, and sound effects. You can also adjust colors, and backgrounds can be replaced automatically. These features not only cut down editing time but also open the door to professional-level video-making! Best For: Converting textual descriptions into high-grade images and videos. Top Features: 1. Generative AI Tools Runway ML offers more than 30 AI Magic Tools in its collection. These tools help you create all sorts of different content, such as videos, images, and so on. 2. Text to Video Generation (Gen-2) This is a game changer for video creation. It allows you to generate videos starting from text prompts to bring your ideas to life as you choose. Storytelling, animation, and other videos are all turned into dynamic videos by Gen-2. 3. High-Resolution Image Synthesis With Runway ML, you can make extremely high-resolution images with latent diffusion models. This is a valuable feature that lets you produce high-quality images, making it most suitable for tasks needing fine detail work. 4. Noise Reduction and Image Stabilization Noise reduction cleans up noisy or grainy photos, and image stabilization smoothes out shaky videos. Working together, they make your content refined and stylish. 5. Research and Innovation With generative AI, Runway ML will continue to be at the leading edge. As a user, you can enjoy the most advanced and revolutionary developments in this discipline. This means you are always testing the limits of possibility in generative A.I. Pros You can make your creative ideas into reality just by putting them in text. It provides unprecedented freedom of video creation, making it easy to think of and do any style or concept. The platform allows you to apply the style of any one image or prompt to every frame of your video. This is a very important feature in terms of maintaining your visual style consistency across all your video production. Based on mockups, Runway ML can turn out fully stylized and animated renders. This is especially helpful to designers and creators in creating a vibrant, engaging way to present their ideas. It’s easy to cut out subjects in your video and change them as you like with simple text commands. This lets you easily make specific modifications to individual elements in your video. By inputting an image or prompt, Runway ML can increase the realness of untextured renders. This is useful in creating realistic-looking images. Cons You might require a lot of computing resources and time. More complex tasks or high resolutions result in higher resource costs, and this may restrict its availability to users with less powerful hardware. At times, the input prompt is vague or contradictory, whereas Runway ML may produce artifacts or inconsistencies in the generated content. It may still need further smoothing out and cutting. Pricing Basic: Free Standard: $15 per user per month Pro: $35 per user per month Unlimited: $95 per user per month Enterprise: Custom 4. Fliki Fliki is another great free AI text-to-video generator that also has paid versions, letting you create videos as easily as sitting down and writing a few sentences. Aside from its practical aspects, Fliki is also fuelling a larger shift in content culture. It is just the right tool for creators and marketers to keep up with trends towards video over text and attract their audience’s attention. Best For: Fliki AI has become especially popular with bloggers, podcasters, YouTubers, and marketing experts, who use it to create interesting promotional materials. Top Features: 1. Access to Millions of Stock Media Fliki offers millions of photos, videos, and audio to improve your videos with top-notch images and audio. It's great for tasks like making professional presentations or doing personal creative work, as it has many styles and themes. 2. Over 2000 Realistic Text-to-Speech Voices Across 75+ Languages It removes the need for expensive voice samples and recording tools. It provides an easy and affordable way to change text into everyday, professional-sounding speech in multiple languages and accents. 3. Text to Video Fliki's Text to Video tool lets you easily convert text or notes into fascinating visuals using AI sounds and a comprehensive media collection. 4. Voice Cloning It lets you create special copies for an audience experience tailored to them. This feature is good for making things stand out, personal projects, and adding a special flair to the content. 5. AI Voiceovers Fliki uses AI Voiceovers to change text into realistic voices made by AI. These sounds are human-like, which gives a realistic touch to your videos and doesn’t make them sound mechanical. Pros The tool's interface is quite simple and easy. You won't be distracted by technical difficulties but can focus on your creativity. The audio quality of the voiceover is very natural and professional. This gives your videos a real feel to them, increasing the satisfaction of their viewers. It is also replete with a vast stock library for your creativity, which is one of the tool's real treasures. You'll find a diverse selection of images, video clips, and music alike. This library saves you from the trouble of searching for the right file everywhere by making it easier to track down materials from various places. Cost-wise, the tool is quite economical. You can even get better results with it than hiring professionals to do voice-over work. This reasonably priced special feature makes it ideal for any creators with limited amounts of money but ample amounts of content. Cons It does not offer great variety in pictorial variations. Though many options are there, these still might need to fit exactly your creative vision. You might experience glitches and bugs. These technical fumblings can be a bit of a roadblock to your work but are often just remediable with updates or support services. It provides a limited number of minutes per month at no charge. But that's a limit if you are doing really large projects or creating lots of output. Perhaps you would have to limit yourself and decide when to use it or spend extra for a paid plan. Convert text to video with AI Generate a video with just text Try Text to Video Pricing Free Plan Standard Plan: $21 per month for annual plan Premium Plan: $66 per month for annual plan 5. Visla Looking for the best AI video generator from text? Visla can be your right choice for a storytelling tool powered by AI that makes the entire process simpler. It has been fashioned as an easily accessible and powerful platform for a wide variety of users engaged in marketing, education, and other activities. Its most noteworthy feature is the ability to promote collaboration and improve workflow efficiency to quickly turn your ideas into videos. This lets you use storytelling and communication techniques with greater precision and effectiveness! Best For: Visla is the perfect option for developing and producing videos for marketing and sales, engineering, content creation, social media, team communications, customer service, and even personal branding. This is precisely what makes it so useful for professionals and teams to develop their own strategies for using storytelling to interact with audiences. Top Features: 1. Collaboration and Feedback Visla makes it simple to share your videos with your team or readers. In other words, you can use videos with other people, and you can receive others’ feedback. 2. Versatility for Various Industries Whether you work in marketing, sales, teaching, entertainment, or some other field, it's made to fit in wherever people work. 3. Diverse Use Cases Visla is just good for a variety of these video activities. You can create videos for social media, record personal messages to customers, recap meetings, convert old videos into new uses, or shoot videos for teaching and learning. It's like having one tool to deal with just about any job! 4. AI Summary Visla provides a feature that allows the main points of a text to be immediately grasped. Using AI, it discovers the key points, such as the keywords or main topics, or otherwise makes a long transcript short. 5. Teleprompter Mode Afraid you might have forgotten something or won't do a good job of expressing what is on your mind? This is where the teleprompter mode helps by letting you read from your marks instead of into the lens. This makes you look more confident and you don't lose your audience as you can make eye contact. 6. Community Hub Within the community hub, you can participate in discussions, seek advice, exchange experiences, and even receive ideas from other users. It's a place where you can get to know people using Visla too, help, and learn from one another. Pros Visla gives users the ability to create high-quality videos, working from the most minimal of ideas, perhaps even just a script. The platform can also be used to cover such tasks as writing scripts, narrating in its own voice, choosing the right pieces of video to show, and so on. Its AI-assisted editing functionality can even remove unwanted portions of video with an automatic effect. It has a comprehensible, easy interface, despite its many functions, which means that it can be used by people at every skill level. It allows a first-time user to become proficient with it only really requiring a timer, so that after only 2-3 minutes one can become accustomed. Visla's free subscription plan is particularly generous, as it allows publishers up to 50 minutes of video free of charge every month. This time is longer than most. Of course, there is also a great deal of access to the free version, which offers many of the platform’s main functions. It also comes with all the tools to aid in video production. With narration-assistance features powered by AI, screen recording functions for demonstration videos, text overlays for social media interviews, and so much more. Cons The inability to generate images is one major shortcoming of Visla compared to tools using coherent AI. To make up for this shortcoming, users who want to add this functionality have to feed suitable images to an external AI image generator before importing them into Visla. Exporting videos before downloading them can be very time-consuming. Likewise, the download speeds are quite slow. Even when Visla generates videos itself, it doesn't happen instantaneously, and it can still take a couple of minutes. The computer-generated script might contain mistakes that must be checked and corrected by a human. In addition, since the AI voiceover sometimes pronounces words incorrectly, this might affect the quality of the narrative. Pricing Basic: Free Plan Premium: $24 per month 6. Opus Clip Opus Clip converts full-length videos into short viral videos, and it shines through its comprehensive video content analysis capability. It also determines which parts are most effective and assembles them in easily digestible short clippings. It also employs cutting-edge artificial intelligence-enhanced functions such as AI Curation, AI Virality Score, and AI Emoji Generator to boost the attractiveness and virality of the content. All in all, it provides a great balance between accessibility and advanced, AI-assisted functionality, for newbies and experienced users too! Best For: Converting long-form video content into short clips that can go viral. It uses AI to help you create fun short videos with little effort. Top Features: 1. AI Curation This feature uses GPT-4 Turbo, the most advanced artificial intelligence, to take a long video and pick out the most intriguing segments. The selected parts are then crafted together into an attention-grabbing and compact short clip. Not only can it intelligently choose the segments, but it can also put this into a narrative framework, presenting the video in an organized, entertaining manner. 2. AI Virality Score Using AI and big data analysis of thousands of viral videos, Opus Clip attaches a score for its virality to each clip. With this score, you get a better idea of the potential impact of the cut, and you can use data to make decisions on the best way to maximize reach and engagement. 3. AI Co-Pilot With this feature, you have greater control over the video editing process. You can specify the time frames in your video to clip and make more focused and accurate content. 4. Active Speaker Detection Using predictive AI, Opus Clip analyzes and follows moving faces in the video. This enables you to keep your guests' (or, if you decide to take your own) face in the middle of the video frame. It makes your content more concentrated and professional-looking. 5. AI Keyword Highlighter With this tool, your video captions' important keywords are automatically selected and highlighted which can help to attain higher viewer engagement rates. 6. AI Emoji Generator The power of emojis is not lost on Opus Clip, which automatically adds suitable emojis to your video content. Pros It makes the video production process much faster. In other words, if a video project normally takes an hour, with Opus Clip it could be done in a few minutes. Part of the timesaving potential is especially useful for those who have to produce large amounts of video regularly. With the free trial, you can test the tool without risking any money. You can upload up to 120 minutes of video for free to test its features and determine whether or not it is right for you. This multi-language support makes the tool easier to use in different regions and audiences. This is particularly helpful for creators of content and content generators for whom English is their main language and they’re targeting an international audience or simply working in a multilingual environment. Its useful first paragraph-generating capabilities alone make it a game-changer when it comes to attracting viewers from the start. Cons Opus Clip may be a powerful software, but you would have to invest significant time and effort far beyond just learning how to use the product before you can master its full range of features. This learning curve could be an obstacle for those who need to quickly produce results without going into too much technical detail. Its effectiveness depends on the quality of the input video. If the original content was lousily shot or edited, it might not be able to finely tune it. While customization options are there, they may not meet all requirements or individual preferences of users. For some, this is a drawback, especially if highly personal or unique video styles are needed. The default caption may not be to everyone's tastes and could undermine creative expression. Pricing Free plan Starter Plan: $9 per month Pro: $ 19 per month 7. Colossyan Looking for the best AI music video generator? Colossyan can be just the right choice! It is an AI-assisted video creation tool for streamlining the video-creating process. In particular, Colossyan is adept at creating content of different forms, including marketing videos, explainer videos, and training and learning content, in more than 70 languages.

AI Avatars With Colossyan's AI Avatars, customers enjoy a huge array of digital avatars of different genders, ages, and ethnicities.

Pros The interface is simple to use. So, even if you are unfamiliar with video editing, it will be easy for you.

With a wide range of AI avatars and backgrounds, text styles, and music to choose from, alternative video creation doesn't get any more complete than Colossyan! The platform allows for smooth scene transitions, and the high-resolution output helps to raise the quality and professional image of videos. With a range of pricing plans available to suit various needs and budgets, Colossyan provides an economical solution for many users. Cons The actors are advanced AI-generated avatars, looking and sounding highly lifelike, but the platform is limited to these digital actors. This limitation does not allow users to directly incorporate live human actors or their own recordings into the platform. As comfortable and convenient as Colossyan is, the more sophisticated its customization capabilities are as they need a learning curve. Pricing Starter Plan: $35 per month Pro Plan: $120 per month Enterprise Plan: Customizable Generate AI videos quickly Generate Al videos like magic Get Started Now 8. DeepBrain AI The DeepBrain AI makes the video-creating process less complex, taking the difficulty and cost of video editing out of the equation.

Pros You'll enjoy the extensive range of AI Avatars available from DeepBrain AI. Whatever your video content, you will be able to find just the right avatar for it. This diversity means greater creativity for you, and more personalization so that each of your video creations can have the ideal avatar to suit its message. It lets you include up to 50 scenes in a single video. There will be no need to hold back with worries about being limited in scene choices. One special feature of the platform is the presence of a face swap function which allows you to easily merge your own face with the AI avatars. This feature increases personalization and interaction so that you can become a part of the video and make it more engaging! There are a range of flexible pricing plans, suited to your particular needs and budget. Whether you're a person or a business, you can benefit from the platform's features without the rigidity of a set pricing structure. Cons It has no integration with other software or platforms.

If you are on a team or need to collaborate with others on video projects, you might feel frustrated because there is no such mechanism in the platform.

Languages & Voices It has more than 100 languages and voices, which means your content can be localized. You can also use your own voice or combine many samples of voices to create voiceovers. 3. Professionally Designed Templates There are all kinds of templates available to choose from, no matter if you are making a product video, a training video, or a tutorial. These templates are simple to use and no editing skills are required. 4. AI Video Tools You get toolkits as a script wizard that integrates GPT-3 into the actual script-writing process. It takes an idea and takes it to the level of a full video through a single text prompt. 5. Brand and Customization You can maintain one consistently on-brand video across your business. It also comes with a brand hub to save your brand logo, colors, intros, and outros, as well as custom templates and choices for artificial intelligent (AI) presenters. Pros You get a variety of video templates from which you can choose an existing template that suits your needs or style, or use one of the many blank formats available to build it on your own. There are AI wizards on the platform to help you make a full video from a prompt you give them. In this way, with very little input, you can have a completed video that demonstrates what the AI can do. You're likely to find the platform convenient and fast. If you don't like to learn too much or spend too much time waiting for your videos to process, this might be just the ticket. You can spice up your performance with the built-in voice modulations. This lets you experiment with different voices depending on what you're shooting. Cons If you choose the personal plan, the maximum video quality is limited to 720p. This may be a drawback if you are after a high-definition video. The platform's content moderation system is probably not 100% foolproof, so there is a possibility of inappropriate content slipping through the net. On Windows and Android, you may encounter problems when it comes to feature recognition. If you're using these platforms and want complete compatibility, then this could be a potential drawback. Pricing Basic Plan: Free Lite: $30 per month Business: $112 per month Enterprise: Custom 10. Synthesia This one has been among the go-to favorites of all time among the best free AI video generators to generate content with pre-produced AI presenters. The USP? Well, it caters to the issue of deep fakes since it is designed to guide users toward the ethical use of AI, prohibiting the recreation of celebrities or political figures without explicit consent and strict pre-screening to ensure that only those that pass the requirements are posted! Best For: Experimenting with digital avatars Top Features: 1. AI Avatars It has a library of over 85 AI avatars. These avatars vary in styles, ethnicities, and ages, and can meet the needs of all types of video content so that users can immediately have their very own virtual representative. 2. AI Voice It supports over 120 languages and accents, which makes it an ideal tool for creating content for an international audience. Working with only one voice-over artist for each language not only would save money but would also make the content creation process seamless. 3. Video Templates With more than 55 customizable video templates including explainer videos, product demonstrations, and social media posts, Synthesia AI can meet various content needs. You can also import PowerPoint presentation templates on this platform, which is a time-saving feature. 4. Editing Studio This feature uses a drag-and-drop interface to make video editing easier than ever. This studio also offers selections of background music, images, and animations. These additions further enhance the attractiveness and impact of the videos. 5. Synthesia Academy As a paid user, you also get access to the academy, which is composed of lessons on creating videos to cover different aspects of video making with the platform, such as choreographing the content and synchronizing animations. Pros The AI avatars are pretty realistic and include many different ethnicities, ages, and styles. This is especially helpful in maintaining the attention of viewers and making the content more relatable.

Its editing studio is user-friendly, with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface streamlining the video creation process. So, even if you have no video editing experience you can do it with ease without any significant learning curve. Cons The personal plan allows for only ten video credits per month, which could prove limiting to users who require a lot of videos. While the custom avatar creation service adds a personal touch to videos, it can be quite expensive.
