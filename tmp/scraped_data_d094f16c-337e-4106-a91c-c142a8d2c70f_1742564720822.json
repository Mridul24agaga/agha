Adobe Premiere Pro | Best AI Software to Create Videos Pros Best all round video editor Cloud-syncing for backups Free trial available Colour matching speeds up edits Auto reframing useful for social media Cons Subscription based model Steep learning curve Requires high computer specs download Not only is Premiere Pro my pick of the best video editing software, but it’s now my favourite AI video app too. With the latest version you can download using the button above, you’ll get some crazy powerful AI tools to make creating high quality videos a cinch. Colour Match allows you to match the colours in two different clips in your sequence to help get rid of any discrepancies between different shots in the same scene – really useful if you use two different cameras. The Auto Reframe tool is a godsend for social media video content, allowing you to change horizontal 16:9 video footage into a tall 9:16 aspec ratio, perfect for instagram Stories or YouTube Shorts. If you shoot interviews, the auto audio ducking feature uses AI to lower the volume of music when dialogue is happening Adobe Sensei is the ‘brain’ behind the AI in Premiere Pro, providing other features such as Auto Classification which tags your footage and Morph Cut which smoothes out jump cuts. Overall, even if you didn’t use any of the AI video features in Premiere Pro, you’d still be left with the top editing software of the year – start by downloading a free trial and see what you think. How to Download Adobe Premiere Pro 2. Topaz Video AI | Photography AI Tool for Enlargements Pros Extremely powerful video editing tool Free trial available Upscaling, image stabilization, and slow-motion capabilities Can generate multiple previews at the same time Cons Relatively expensive download Simply put, Topaz Video AI is a standalone desktop video editing application that makes your videos look better. Drag and drop your video into the software, select from the menu of presets, and let the deep-learning robot minds cast their magic. You can even upscale your footage. That means that all your grainy, blurry old 1080p film can now be enhanced to 4K or 8K. You can also render your footage in slow motion which can be handy if you forgot to shoot in the correct frame rate: Let’s say you shot at 24 fps – give Topaz that video and the AI will create new frames between the actual frames you shot, so your 24 fps could become 60 fps, and you can slow it right down. The program also has two types of image stabilization to help you produce engaging videos: The first crops into your footage to create this effect, and the other is image-aware and will fill in the missing gaps around the edges of your video so that the field of view doesn’t change. With this powerful AI video editing software, you can tweak just about any setting you’d want to use to enhance the quality of your footage – the frame rate, the amount of grain, or the sharpness. Not only that, you can create your own custom presets for adding to future videos. Topaz Video AI Review 3. Filmora | Affordable AI Video Maker Pros Simple, easy-to-use interface Good suite of AI tools Subscription or perpetual license options Affordable Cons Doesn’t have the slick feel of some competitors download As well as giving you all the tools you’d expect from a video editing suite, for adding templates, titles and subtitles, and for making adjustments to the video and audio tracks, Filmora also has some fantastic AI tools. You can adjust your footage’s aspect ratio, upscale video resolution from lowly 1080p to, for example, 4K, and change your frame rate to make fast video slow and slow video fast. Other AI tools include their chroma key, which enables you to remove specific background colours. This is especially useful for green screen footage, to make the background transparent so that you can add other media. AI portrait does essentially the same thing and removes even complex backgrounds from behind subjects. Added to that, Filmora has AI image stabilization, and lens correction to help you sort out any irritating distortion your lens might have gifted you. In general, Filmora is my recommended video editing software for beginners – it may not have every feature of Final Cut or Adobe Premiere for video creation, but for the price, it can’t be beaten. Filmora Review Best green screen software 4. Deep Brain | Text to Speech AI Video Tools Pros Innovative AI human technology Multi-language text-to-speech solutions Wide application across sectors Free online AI video editor Highly customizable avatars Cons Learning curve download DeepBrain AI stands out in the field of artificial intelligence with its cutting-edge AI human technology. It excels at creating real-time, interactive artificial humans that can be employed in various domains, such as customer service, virtual assistance, and educational content delivery. Their service enables the use of AI avatars that are customizable to suit different business needs, providing a unique interactive experience for end-users. It’s particularly beneficial for enterprises looking to scale their operations with AI while maintaining a human-like touch in their customer engagement strategies. 5. Fliki | Best AI Video Generator Pros Simple workflow to convert ideas, scripts, blogs, PPT, product URLs, and tweets into videos 2000+ AI voices in 75+ languages and 100+ dialects First in the industry to offer AI-generated video clips High-quality avatars with voice cloning in 29 languages Translate/Dub videos in 75+ Languages Intuitive and easy-to-use interface Cons Require a paid subscription for premium features download Fliki is a groundbreaking text to video AI tool perfect for transforming text into engaging videos with professional voiceovers. Its user-friendly design makes it accessible even to those with little technical experience, allowing them to produce high-quality video content effortlessly. Fliki’s extensive voice selection, available in 75+ languages and over 100 dialects, provides unparalleled personalization options.

Whether you’re a content creator, a marketer, or just someone with a personal project, Fliki AI Video Generator provides the tools and flexibility needed to produce visually appealing and impactful videos. 6. Veed.io Pros Good for beginners Easy to learn Range of templates and tools Speech to subtitles feature Cons Some features are only available in higher price plans download One of the best AI video editing options for beginners is Veed.io. It has an extremely simple and easy-to-learn interface, but despite this, it still packs a punch. Veed.io has many of the features of the previous two video editing software programs in this article. With it, you can change the frame rate to speed up or slow down your footage, and you can also remove backgrounds with a single click. Something it’s well-known for is its AI-powered speech to subtitles tool, which accurately transcribes in moments, saving you potential hours of work. And there’s also the text-to-speech feature. With this, you can give your video a voiceover without manually recording your own voice, and you can choose from a range of voice profiles and accents. I’ve included Veed in this list of the best AI video software because I’ve spent many a day transcribing videos manually, and know how frustrating it can be. What is an AI camera? 7. Synthesia Pros Easy way to make presentations Powerful, simple-to-use tool Impressive range of features Affordable AI video creation platform Cons Limited, specialized use case download Synthesia specializes in speech-to-video creation using artificial intelligence to create engaging videos. They give you a range of templates and amazingly lifelike avatars which you can make say anything you want – ideal for creating YouTube videos you don’t want to appear in. Whatever you type, they can say in a range of accents, using diction and, in the most recent iteration, gestures. It’s spooky how realistic it all sounds – even if you don’t have any staff or any desire to appear in YouTube videos yourself, Synthesia can help with your video creation. You can add a background behind your avatar, add a music track, and use a range of other tools to make the video your own. How can AI benefit photography? 8. InVideo Pros Easy to use and learn Simple but powerful Simple, two-tier pricing Article-to-text feature Cons Only the highest membership tiers have access to the best video and image libraries download This software shares a lot in look and feel with Veed.io. It has a super-simple, clean interface that is very easy to navigate. It also has a vast bank of templates for a range of needs from sports to marketing, to help you kick things off. One of its most impressive features is the AI-powered article-to-text tool. With this, you can copy and paste an article into the tool, and it will scrape the text to extract the main ideas, and then create concise content around these. It can create a unique video from an article too. Let’s say I wanted to make a video from this article – I could just paste the URL into InVid, and the video would be created for me! This makes it the best AI video tool for batch creating multiple clips from a blog. Like Veed.io, InVideo also offers automated text-to-speech. No more need to record voiceovers, all thanks to the power of video artificial intelligence. What’s the best mobile video editing app for iPhone and Android? 9. Descript Pros Unique product Powerful editing tools Edit video with text Slick interface Cons It’s not for everyone, but that’s just me trying to find something to say download One for the podcasters. A powerful speech-to-text editor that will save you time by allowing you to edit automatically transcribed text and video voiceover at the same time. Simply put, you can record yourself, your voice and your face, and Descript uses AI to make a video and a written script from this. You can then edit that script, for example shortening long pauses in your speech, removing filler and thinking words, or removing whole phrases. Whatever you remove is also removed from the recorded footage, thereby seamlessly editing your video with AI. The software also allows you to sync your visuals with specific moments in the script, and there’s a toolbar to help you collaborate on a project with a team. Add to that powerful video editing features such as the ability to grade colours, remove backgrounds, and beef up sound quality, and you have yourself a winner. 10. FlexClip Pros Interface good for beginners Great template and stock library AI speech to text AI text to speech Cons Limited tools for pros Only exports to 1080p download This software is rich in templates and has an impressive amount of stock imagery and video you can use to inspire or pad out your videos. The interface is very simple – it’s the best AI video editing software I tested for beginners, who will get the hang of it very easily. Once you have your footage uploaded, you have the standard range of editing tools to work with, to make your video look exactly as you want it to. You can adjust the brightness, and the speed, you can flip it around, trim it, or use FlexClip’s range of filters to automatically adjust the colours. In terms of AI video creation features, there’s speech-to-text, which can quickly generate subtitles, and text-to-speech, which can help you make natural-sounding voiceovers. 11. Rawshorts Pros Good library of resources Timesaver for small businesses Text to animation Automatic voice generator Cons Free version is quite limited download This powerful tool is specifically for people who want to make video animations. Write a script (or get ChatGPT to do that for you!) and paste it into the program. The software will then generate a voiceover, scrape your text for the main ideas, and then use those to make a coherent, animated storyboard. You’ve probably seen these types of animations used on software product sales pages to explain how to use the software. This type of animation can cost thousands of dollars to produce (not to mention countless hours of drawing), but now thanks to AI, you can do it for a fraction of the time and cost. If you need to create videos for small businesses, you can imagine how much easier this clever AI video tool can make your work. 12. Lumen 5 Pros Quick and easy tool to use Text to video Good range of editing tools Cons Free version is very limited download This nifty AI video editing softwa re software helps you automatically transform blog posts, Zoom calls, or articles, into video. It’s super easy to do. For example, just paste your blog article URL into the program, and it will extract the key points to match them with relevant text and video. From there, you can tweak what you want, edit text, and swap out photos and videos from Lumen 5’s online library. You can also make talking head videos and enhance your videos with callouts and cutaways. My favourite feature is the ability to select words in the transcript (auto-generated by AI, of course!), then match the visuals directly to the timing of the audio. For video creation for social media, which often needs captions timed to voice over or talking heads, this AI video app is insanely useful. 13. SyntheSys Pros Professional-level software Text-to-video capabilities Easy-to-use dashboard Cons More expensive than other text-to-video competitors download Using SyntheSys, you can get a lifelike avatar to present a video for you, generated from text, or create a natural-sounding voiceover track. They have a library of male and female avatars, and their technology allows them to use gestures, and natural voice tones, and speak in 145 languages. It’s a great tool for businesses, or anyone wanting to quickly create human-looking and -sounding content for commercial purposes. Whether you want to remain anonymous in your video clips or simply prefer to use someone else, AI video generators like this can help speed up your video creation process. What Is the Best AI Tool to Create Videos? It really depends on what kind of video you want to create, as there is quite a diverse range of AI video generators out there for different use cases. A cinematographer or videographer is more likely to need a tool with the power and scope of Topaz Video AI or Filmora. These can really help you dive deep into your footage and create something extraordinary for professional videos. Veed.io and InVid are best for beginners or those who perhaps need video clips for personal use or smaller scale production edits. Then there are the tools that are better for small businesses, YouTubers, or for commercial use. Descript is a great tool for Youtubers and podcasters to clean up their script and video, whereas Rawshorts will help you create an animation from your script. Those looking for AI to make them a voiceover or a complete presentation with a video or even an avatar will need something different again. Lumen 5, for example, will help you create high quality videos like these, while Synthesia or SyntheSys will generate a presentation for you with a human-ish presenter. How Does an AI Video Generator Work? The computer science behind the nuts and bolts of AI video generation is beyond both my human intelligence and the scope of this article. But in simple terms, what I understand of it is that machine-learning, the machine who has learned – which is a way of saying ‘an extremely powerful computer’ – knowing language on some robotic, mathematical level, scrapes the text and converts it into computer language: numbers. As computers understand everything in these terms, the combinations of numbers it receives from the text will correspond to number patterns within videos that express the same ideas as the text. They will match. And thus, a video is born. AI Video Editing Software FAQ s What is the best AI tool to create videos? For creating videos and ease of use, I’d have to say Lumen 5 for enabling you to quickly make a coherent video from text, or SyntheSys for creating realistic avatar-led video presentations. For specific edits, Topaz Video AI can’t be beaten. Is there an AI that edits videos? Yes. For example, Topaz AI and Filmora both help you edit your videos. You can use image stabilization, change the frame rate to create natural-looking slow-motion effects, upscale your videos, and do many more things that only a year or so ago, weren’t possible. How do I know if a video was created by AI? With many ai video editing tools, you simply won’t know, and that’s increasingly the case. The AI tools in Topaz Video AI are so powerful there’s really no way of telling if that slow-motion video was originally filmed at 60 fps or 24 fps. Likewise, the human avatar you can use to give your video presentations can use natural gestures, voice tones and intonation, which can make it very difficult to know if they’re real or not. Take for example, the Deep Fake video below: It’s certainly very hard to spot if the video creation was by AI or if it was actual footage. What AI video app is everyone using? Everyone is using all of them! All of the video apps in this article are being used by someone, somewhere to save time, to be more efficient, and to create something more compelling for a variety of use cases. If I had to choose one, I’d say it was Topaz Video AI, just because that’s the world I come from, and I know that it’s a very popular resource. For another use case, I’d find it hard to believe that most podcasters weren’t using Descript, as it’s such a powerful and powerfully specialised tool. Is Synthesia Ai video free to use? No, it’s not. Synthesia is only offered on a subscription basis. AI Video Editing Tools: Final Words So there you go. Honestly, even though I wrote this article myself, my mind is a little blown. AI is so new, but it can already do so much. It’s hard to know where it’s going to lead, but although that’s a little terrifying, it’s also exciting. Especially if you’re working with video. The AI video generators and tools available to you are so powerful that they will change the way you film and the way you think about filming. Cinematographers can make 8K cinematic, slow-motion, fully stabilized footage from 1080p footage filmed on an old camera. YouTubers can make video content of themselves with all their thinking words removed. Businesses can make promo videos, voiceovers or video presentations without hiring voiceover artists. It’s head-spinning! Doesn’t it make you want to create AI generated videos just to see how incredible the technology has become? If you’re not already using AI video generators in some form, it definitelt feels like right now is the time to start.

They are attractive, save time, and can do many different things. There are others if you’ve ever needed clarification on the complicated details of regular video editing software. Are you curious? Video editing platforms now have Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help create videos faster and easier. This means that even people new to video editing can make high-quality videos. But, just like any new AI technology, it has good and bad sides. Do you want to be ahead when using the latest technology for your video projects? You’re in the right place. In this detailed article, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of AI video editors. We will provide helpful information to assist you in making an intelligent choice for your upcoming project. What is AI in Video Editing? AI in Video Editing: Definition and Importance Welcome to the future of making videos, where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing how we edit them. But what is AI in video editing? In simple terms, AI in video editing means using special computer programs to make editing videos more accessible and better. These programs use advanced technology to learn and improve how videos are edited, making the whole process faster and smoother. This means more than just basic cuts and transitions. We’re talking about intelligent object recognition, automatic color adjustments, and even the ability to summarize long videos. AI makes things easier by automating tasks, like editing so that you can spend more time creatively. Overview to the Advantages and Disadvantages of AI Video Editors While AI in video editing may seem exciting, it comes with its challenges and limitations. This blog wants to give you a good grasp of how the advantages and disadvantages of AI video editing tools are utilized. We will talk about features that save time and interfaces that are easy to use. We will also discuss creative control and keeping your data private. We aim to give you all the information you need to make an intelligent choice for your editing needs. Why Understanding These Pros and Cons is Essential for Content Creators Why should you, as someone who creates content, be concerned about the advantages and disadvantages of AI video editing? The answer is simple: the editing tools you choose can significantly affect how good your content is, how quickly you can work, and how people see your brand. Suppose you’re a YouTuber trying to connect better with your viewers, a marketer wanting to make exciting product videos, or a filmmaker working on your next critical project. In that case, knowing the good and bad sides of AI video editing technology is essential. This information will not only help you choose the right tools for the job but also allow you to adjust as this exciting technology keeps changing. If you’re interested in how AI can change your video editing experience or have concerns, keep reading. We’re going to explore the exciting world of AI video editing. How Does AI Video Editing Work? The way AI algorithms work in video editing is quite simple. Let me explain it to you in a way that is easy to understand. AI is a technology that stands for Artificial Intelligence, it allows computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. In video editing, AI algorithms are used to analyze and process videos to make them look better or to add special effects. If you’re curious about how intelligent algorithms in video editing AI work their magic, you might be wondering. AI video editing uses machine learning algorithms trained to do specific tasks. These tasks include recognizing objects, syncing audio, and correcting colors. The AI system is like a brain taught using lots of information from videos. These videos show different situations, things, and ways they are delivered. With this training, the AI can use data to make decisions and automate complex editing tasks. For example, it can notice when a scene is not well-lit and change its lighting and color balance. It can even analyze people’s feelings in a picture and suggest music matching them! So, how does this affect you? You can say goodbye to repeatedly spending lots of time doing the same tedious tasks. Think about how nice it would be if the AI could handle the tedious editing tasks for you. Then, you could spend more time improving your story and adding extraordinary things only you can think of. Comparison with Traditional Video Editing Methods Editing videos the traditional way can be complex and take time. Suppose you know much about Adobe Premiere Pro or just starting with iMovie. In that case, you probably know how tiring it can be to cut, splice, and sync videos and soundtracks by hand. In addition, tasks such as adjusting colors, following objects, and creating special effects often need specific skills and software that can be costly and challenging to learn. On the other hand, AI video editing tools provide a faster and easier way to create excellent videos. They help reduce the amount of physical work needed for editing and can produce results much quicker than usual. This doesn’t mean AI will take the place of human editors. Instead, it is a helpful tool that can take care of the less exciting parts of editing. This way, you can focus on your project’s creative and detailed aspects. AI video editors are not meant to replace traditional methods but rather to improve them. They have a new, more straightforward way that can be helpful for people who may need to improve at editing but still want to make things look professional. However, just like any other technology, it’s essential to understand when to use AI and when to trust human knowledge. We will discuss this further in this blog. Pros of AI Video Editors Features that Save Time 1. Processes that are done automatically. One of the advantages of AI video editors is that they save a lot of time. You can use automated tools to trim, fix colors, and sync audio in your videos. This saves a lot of time compared to doing these tasks manually. These automatic processes are not just correct but also wise. This means they can learn from what you like and improve as time passes. 2. Fast Rendering Speeds Time is valuable, and when it comes to rendering, AI video editors are extremely fast, just like Usain Bolt, who is known for his speed in the world of running. In the past, people used to keep their computers on all night to process videos with apparent images. AI algorithms can make the rendering process much faster, so you can publish or change your content more quickly than before. User-Friendly Interface 1. Easy-to-use Controls Suppose you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by the complicated screens of regular video editing programs. In that case, you’ll be relieved to see how easy AI video editors are to use. These platforms are made to be easy to use. They have features where you can drag and drop things, menus that are easy to find your way around, and clear instructions. This makes it easy for even beginners to edit items without any problems. 2. You can learn a little technical stuff. With AI video editors, you don’t have to be good at video editing software or know complicated codecs to make amazing videos. The software does the hard work for you so you can concentrate on your story and ideas. This makes video editing available to people who create content, regardless of their skill level. Affordable Solutions 1. Cheap Subscription Plans Good video editing software can be expensive. However, AI video editors usually have different pricing options, including some that are pretty cheap and offer subscription plans. This flexibility lets you pick a plan that works well for your budget and what you need. 2. Need a less powerful computer We should remember that high-end video editing often needs expensive equipment. AI video editors have a tremendous advantage: they usually work in the cloud. This means you don’t need a super powerful computer to use them. You need a good internet connection and are ready to start! Scalability and Versatility 1. Good for Making Lots of Changes If you create content and have many projects to manage, or if you are a business trying to increase your video production, AI video editors can help you with that. The automated features simplify handling large editing tasks without sacrificing quality. 2. Algorithms that Change for Different Projects AI video editors can change to fit different project needs if you’re making a documentary, a YouTube vlog, or a marketing promo. The clever algorithms can be adjusted to different editing styles, making them useful for your creative work. Professional-Quality Output 1. Graphics and Transitions Improved by AI The AI in these editors not only makes editing faster but also makes your final work look better. With the help of AI, your videos will have enhanced graphics and smooth transitions. This will make your videos look professional and polished, as well as being fast. 2. Keeping the Same Branding Abilities Consistency is crucial if you are a brand or an influencer. AI video editors have unique features that let you easily add branding elements, such as logos, colors, and fonts, to your videos. This makes sure that all your content matches well with your brand identity. Cons of AI Video Editors Learning Curve and Skill Erosion 1. Using Automation Too Much Using AI video editors can be appealing because they have many helpful features. But there’s also a downside to relying too much on automation. It can make us less skilled at editing videos ourselves. If you use AI to do things like trimming or color correction, you might not need to learn how these editing techniques work. This could be a problem if you need to edit items by hand. 2. Losing the Ability to Edit in the Traditional Way The danger of losing skills is a real possibility. As AI becomes more involved in editing, editors may not get as much practice in traditional crafts like precise cutting or sound design. This could make them less skilled in these areas. Limitations in Creative Control 1. Ready-made Templates and Formats AI video editors often have pre-made templates and formats to help make editing easier. Although they are convenient, these can restrict your creative freedom. They make you conform to pre-existing patterns instead of letting you express your creativity freely. 2. Limits on Customization Another problem with AI video editors is that they need to offer detailed customization options. Although they can do many editing tasks, they may have less control over specific details than regular software. This might be a problem for people who want to customize things highly. Data Privacy Concerns 1. Dangers of Using Cloud Storage AI video editors often use cloud-based systems to process and store data. This might make some people worried about the privacy and security of their information. You are putting your videos on another company’s server, so knowing how they keep your videos private and secure is essential. 2. Thinking about What’s Right when Using Data In addition to storing your data, it’s essential to consider how it is used. Is the AI getting smarter by watching how you edit? How does the software provider use this information? There are essential things to consider regarding ethics, like who owns the data and if people have given their permission. Costs and Subscription Models 1. Fees that happen again and again AI video editing tools can be affordable, but many work on a subscription model. This means that you have to pay fees regularly. As time goes by, these costs can add up. It’s essential to consider the long-term investment and the benefits you get. 2. Extra Expenses for Special Features Many AI video editors have simple features that are not too expensive. However, if you want more advanced options, you may have to pay extra for premium plans or add-ons. Make sure you know about any additional items or services that may be offered. Dependence on Software Updates and Compatibility 1. Necessity for Regular Updates AI video editors are constantly changing; updating the software frequently is necessary to get any changes or new capabilities. Updates can improve editing but also mean you’ll have to get used to changes. This might interrupt your workflow. 2. Problems with Being Compatible with Older Versions When you update software, there’s a chance that older project files might not work or you might have problems with older devices. This problem with not being able to work with older versions could be a challenge for projects that last a long time. Frequently Asked Questions What is an AI Video Generator?

You spend hours trimming clips, syncing audio, and adjusting colors to get that perfect look. However, AI video creators and editors can handle the boring parts and give you more time to showcase creativity. Today, video editors are smarter than ever thanks to modern tools. From auto-captioning to object removal and even generating videos from scratch, AI video editing tools are changing the game. We tested several AI video editing apps over the past 2 weeks. Here are some of the best ones that we found useful. Table of Contents 1. Adobe Premiere Pro (Pro Video Editor with AI Features) 2. DaVinci Resolve (Free Hollywood-Grade Editing With AI Tools) 3. CapCut (Simple, Powerful Mobile AI Video Editor) 4. Opus Clip (Convert Long Videos to Short Clips) 5. Descript (Edit Videos Like a Text Document) 6. Runway (Collection of AI Tools) 7. ElevenLabs (Create ultra-realistic AI voiceovers) 8. HeyGen (Generate AI Avatars) 9. Sora by OpenAI (AI Video Generator) 1. Adobe Premiere Pro (Pro Video Editor with AI Features) Adobe Premiere Pro is a top-tier professional video editing software packed with various features that let you do everything from speed ramps to color grading. But it also has AI features to simplify and speed up your editing process. For example, it has Generative extend, which uses AI to add extra frames and extend clips smoothly. So you do not worry about awkward sudden cuts if you do not have the footage needed. You also get object addition and removal tools letting you seamlessly erase unwanted objects or insert new ones. Then there is Smart Masking, making it easy to track and edit moving objects. The platform also recently introduced Text-based editing, which lets edit clips like you are working with text. For audio, you have speech to text in over 18 languages and an AI Audio category tagging feature to automatically label audio as dialog, music, or effects. You can also enhance the audio using AI or auto-color to fix exposure and color balance. Basically a professional-level video editor with AI features sprinkled where you need them. However, it comes under an expensive subscription model that costs $22.99/month as a starting plan. Some of these AI models also run locally and require a high-end computer to take advantage of this completely. | Pros | Cons | | --- | --- | | Powerful AI tools for editing and audio | Expensive subscription model | | Text-based editing simplifies workflows | Steep learning curve for beginners | | Speech-to-text in multiple languages | Requires a high-end computer | | Object removal and smart masking features | Some AI tools are in beta and may be unstable | | Professional-grade color correction tools | Generative Extend limited to 1080p at 30 FPS | Pricing and Availability Premiere Pro Single App Plan: $22.99/month (100 GB cloud storage included) Creative Cloud All Apps Plan: $54.99/month (Includes over 20 Adobe apps) Student and Teacher Plan: $19.99/month (first year, then $34.99/month) Business Plan: $89.99/month per license (All apps + team features) Platform: Available on Windows and macOS Try Premiere Pro 2. DaVinci Resolve (Free Hollywood-Grade Editing With AI Tools) Looking for a professional-level video editor that’s also free? DaVinci Resolve is a solid choice. Just like Premiere Pro, it comes packed with AI video editing and enhancing tools to make your editing smoother and faster. Take IntelliTrack AI Tracking, for example. It uses the DaVinci Neural Engine to track objects and even create immersive audio panning based on movement. With Person Mask, you can automatically detect and track people for precise color grading or effects. Coming to audio, it has Music Remixer FX that can reshape your music track to fit the style you need. Can mute vocals, or specific instruments in the music using AI. DaVinci Resolve’s AI tools also speed up your workflow. Scene Cut Detection automatically detects parts that you may want to cut in the clips, saving you hours manually chopping unneeded parts. There’s even more like SuperScale for upscaling, Audio Ducker that lowers background music during dialog automatically, speech-to-text for captions, etc. | Pros | Cons | | --- | --- | | Powerful AI features in the free version | Limited collaboration in the free version | | Advanced color grading tools | Steep learning curve | | Lifetime license (one-time payment) | High-end hardware needed for smooth performance | | Accurate object and person tracking | Some advanced AI tools are Studio-only | | Social media-friendly auto-reframe | Limited collaboration in free version | Pricing and Availability DaVinci Resolve (Free): $0 – Offers extensive editing tools and basic AI features. DaVinci Resolve Studio: $295 (one-time payment) – Includes all advanced AI tools and premium features. Platform: Available on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Try Davinci Resolve 3. CapCut (Simple, Powerful Mobile AI Video Editor) If you want a simple mobile first AI-powered video editor, CapCut is the best option available. It started on Android and iPhone but then launched a desktop app. CapCut’s AI features cover everything from script creation to final edits. Script-to-Video turns your scripts into engaging videos with auto-generated visuals, while Text-to-Speech provides natural-sounding voiceovers in different styles. Need captions fast? Auto-Captions generate them instantly, making your videos more accessible. Plus, Background Removal lets you isolate subjects without a green screen, perfect for creative edits. CapCut also helps with platform-ready videos. Auto Reframe resizes your videos for social platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Need help with ideas?

For smooth footage, AI Movement stabilizes shaky clips, giving your videos a polished look. It also has a free version that comes with basic AI tools like text-to-speech. To get all the tools CapCut can provide, you need a standard plan that costs $9.99/month. Currently, not available for new users, but existing users or downloading via third-party platforms like Softonic Works. | Pros | Cons | | --- | --- | | Strong AI tools even in free version | Advanced tools require Pro subscription | | Auto-captioning and text-to-speech | Performance issues on low-end devices | | Social-media-friendly auto-reframe | Several features moved behind paywalls | | Background removal without green screens | Risk of generic output from trendy filters | | Smooth AI-powered stabilization | U.S. app store ban affects availability | Pricing and Availability Free Version: Includes essential AI tools.

It has AI-powered curation feature that can analyze videos to exact engaging highlight parts. It can also adjust the frame focusing on the main subject automatically. However, Opus Clip takes things one notch above for the short-form content. For example, it adds additional B-Roll with relevant visuals and adds animated captions with templates for better viewer engagement. Opus also offers a Virality Score, estimating each clip’s potential for social media success. Though it does not work as you expect, so take it with a pinch of salt. Also, it has a Social Post Scheduler feature allowing you to directly post on connected platforms making your short video generation process a lot easier. The only downside is, the free plan only comes with 60 minutes/month and has watermarks. The starter plan to remove this costs around $15/month. | Pros | Cons | | --- | --- | | Strong AI-powered editing tools | Free version has watermarks | | Auto-captioning with high accuracy | Some AI selections may lack context | | Virality score for social content | Limited uploads in free version | | Supports multiple platforms for sharing | Paid version is required for brand templates | | AI B-roll enhances storytelling | AI clip selection can be hit-or-miss | Pricing and Availability Free Plan: 60 minutes/month (Watermarked clips, basic tools) Starter Plan: $15/month – 150 minutes, no watermarks, virality score Pro Plan: $29/month – 500 minutes, multi-user support, AI B-roll Platforms: Web-based (No install needed) Global Availability: Accessible in 180+ countries Try Opus Clip 5. Descript (Edit Videos Like a Text Document) Descript makes video editing as simple as editing text. You can simply edit the transcript of the video and changes will be applied to the video. For example, when you remove the text from the transcript, that part of the video will be removed from the final video. You can also change the text or add any additional text to the transcript, it uses Voice Cloning to create your voice and add that to the video. It also has AI features to edit the transcript.

You can generate with either prompts or provide a complete script and convert the text into voice. However, the free plan only has limited credits useful for testing the platform.

Generate Al videos with just text Create AI-Generated Videos Using Simple Prompts Try for free 1. Invideo AI Ready to make pro-level videos without the pro-level stress? Things are about to get easier with invideo AI by your side (even if you’re an absolute beginner). Forget the hefty investment in cameras and gear. With invideo AI, all you need to do is “imagine” what kind of video you want to produce and give a prompt based on that (e.g. create a video on “5 productivity tips and use American male accent”, and voilà – it’ll transform your ideas into stunning videos within minutes! So whether you're a budding entrepreneur, a content creator, or a marketer aiming to build your online presence, invideo AI will be your go-to tool. Best For: Pretty much everything! With invideo AI you can make professional-quality videos for YouTube channel, Instagram reels, TikTok, and other purposes such as social media posts, marketing campaigns, and product demos. Top Features: 1. Extensive Stock Media Library Invideo's artificial intelligence video generator gives you access to more than 16 million stock photos and videos. This helps you easily search and put the right video clips into any part of your video. If you need a specific picture or multiple photos, it quickly looks through this big collection pile and picks the best ones. This makes sure your video looks good and matches the requirements. 2. Text Prompt Video Editing This tool makes video editing easier by letting you fix things with easy words or phrases. It's like telling a human video editor what to do, but it's even easier with a tool. Need to remove a scene, use different stock footage, or change the accent? Just give a prompt, and the AI will do the rest. This makes editing easier, even if you don't know much about editing. 3. AI-Powered Script Generation Invideo's AI script maker helps you make interesting, custom scripts for any video project, which saves you a lot of time in writing scripts. This tool is especially useful for platforms like YouTube, where your content needs to be intriguing enough to engage people & grow your channel. 4. Affordable Voiceover Alternatives The AI voiceover generator is a cheaper option than paying for professional voice actors. It makes a speech that sounds like a human in multiple accents, understanding the feeling, intent, and emotion behind each word. This function makes your videos feel alive, adding a professional look without costing too much. Pros It quickly changes your words into videos, making creating content more manageable. You can spend more time on your work and less on technical stuff. With more than 16 million stock media choices, you have access to a unique selection of pictures. This is perfect if you want to create top-notch quality videos without investing hours in creating them. AI-powered script generation can save you a lot of time in making regular, good-quality video content. It's especially helpful if you often face writer's block or have tight schedules. The AI voiceover generator tool can save money while still giving a good sound experience. This is really helpful if you own a small business or are an individual creator. Cons Initially, you might need some time to learn how to interact with the AI well to get the results you want. However, as you proceed, this eventually gets easier as the interface itself is pretty user-friendly. The free version includes watermarks. But, this is a small worry because the paid version starts at just $25/month and gives you a ton of premium features. Pricing Basic: Free Plus: $25/month Max: $60/month (The yearly plans start as low as $20/month) Sign up for invideo AI and start creating high-quality videos within minutes. Try online AI video maker Create high-quality videos for your business with AI video maker easily Get Started Now 2. Descript Do you need help with problems like evoking human facial expressions and emotional responses or the technical bottlenecks that make the video generation process time-consuming? If yes, Descript can help your creative workflow and enrich the quality of your output, making it more high-end and appealing. Moreover, it also realizes the significance of the human side of video production as it's not designed to replace human creativity but to make it better, to give you a vision, and to let the AI do the heavy lifting. Best For: As such, it's best suited to content creators, podcasters, and filmmakers who need to save time and get things done the right way. Because it is a text-based editing system, even the not-so-tech-savvy can use it. Top Features: 1. Automated Transcription Manually transcribing audio and video is time-consuming. To save time, Descript automatically transcribes all your recordings. Since the transcription is merely a text file, if you edit the transcription content, you can also edit the audio or video file itself. 2. Overdub Voice Cloning With Descript's Overdub function, you can type in the missing or correct text and then artificially generate the new audio in your voice or that of the guest. Creating a voice clone of this type involves using a voice sample to make the process convenient and smooth. 3. Studio Sound Editing Poor audio quality can negatively impact great content. Descript tackles this problem with its Studio Sound feature, which applies state-of-the-art AI to enhance the sound quality of audio files. It eliminates noise, hum, and distortion, giving a cleaner and more professional studio-type sound. 4. Video Green Screen and AI Eye Contact The green screen background editor lets you change the environment behind the video, just like a Zoom feature, so you can have more control over how you present your content. This facilitates the humanizing of the video and adds to its realism. Pros It offers a fantastic transcription tool that can automatically transcribe audio and video files into text in 23 languages. It's a handy platform that lets you cut, rearrange, or alter the contents and simplifies editing. It improves the recorded audio quality by making the spoken words much clearer. This makes your content sound super-smooth without you having to edit out one word at a time. Descript also integrates with other platforms such as Slack (a team communication tool), Podbean (podcast hosting platform), Restream (a LIVE streaming studio), and even Final Cut Pro (a professional video editing application), to name a few. You also get tutorials on using the platform to help you quickly master the features and make the most of it. Cons The learning curve for Descript isn't very gentle for someone used to text-based editing. At first, this may seem patchy, but it is difficult for users of conventional timeline-based editing tools to work. Descript boasts a full range of powerful tools but may not meet the requirements of professional-level video editing. It doesn’t even provide the convenient access to advanced effects and controls that a professional editing package would provide. Pricing is a per-person, per-month fee. This can be costly for teams or organizations with many people, primarily if more than one person uses the software. Pricing Free Tier Creator Tier: $15 per user per month Pro Tier: $30 per user per month Enterprise Tier: Custom 3.

This is a very important feature in terms of maintaining your visual style consistency across all your video production. Based on mockups, Runway ML can turn out fully stylized and animated renders. This is especially helpful to designers and creators in creating a vibrant, engaging way to present their ideas. It’s easy to cut out subjects in your video and change them as you like with simple text commands. This lets you easily make specific modifications to individual elements in your video. By inputting an image or prompt, Runway ML can increase the realness of untextured renders. This is useful in creating realistic-looking images. Cons You might require a lot of computing resources and time. More complex tasks or high resolutions result in higher resource costs, and this may restrict its availability to users with less powerful hardware. At times, the input prompt is vague or contradictory, whereas Runway ML may produce artifacts or inconsistencies in the generated content. It may still need further smoothing out and cutting. Pricing Basic: Free Standard: $15 per user per month Pro: $35 per user per month Unlimited: $95 per user per month Enterprise: Custom 4. Fliki Fliki is another great free AI text-to-video generator that also has paid versions, letting you create videos as easily as sitting down and writing a few sentences. Aside from its practical aspects, Fliki is also fuelling a larger shift in content culture. It is just the right tool for creators and marketers to keep up with trends towards video over text and attract their audience’s attention. Best For: Fliki AI has become especially popular with bloggers, podcasters, YouTubers, and marketing experts, who use it to create interesting promotional materials. Top Features: 1. Access to Millions of Stock Media Fliki offers millions of photos, videos, and audio to improve your videos with top-notch images and audio. It's great for tasks like making professional presentations or doing personal creative work, as it has many styles and themes. 2. Over 2000 Realistic Text-to-Speech Voices Across 75+ Languages It removes the need for expensive voice samples and recording tools. It provides an easy and affordable way to change text into everyday, professional-sounding speech in multiple languages and accents. 3. Text to Video Fliki's Text to Video tool lets you easily convert text or notes into fascinating visuals using AI sounds and a comprehensive media collection. 4. Voice Cloning It lets you create special copies for an audience experience tailored to them. This feature is good for making things stand out, personal projects, and adding a special flair to the content. 5. AI Voiceovers Fliki uses AI Voiceovers to change text into realistic voices made by AI. These sounds are human-like, which gives a realistic touch to your videos and doesn’t make them sound mechanical. Pros The tool's interface is quite simple and easy. You won't be distracted by technical difficulties but can focus on your creativity. The audio quality of the voiceover is very natural and professional. This gives your videos a real feel to them, increasing the satisfaction of their viewers. It is also replete with a vast stock library for your creativity, which is one of the tool's real treasures. You'll find a diverse selection of images, video clips, and music alike. This library saves you from the trouble of searching for the right file everywhere by making it easier to track down materials from various places. Cost-wise, the tool is quite economical. You can even get better results with it than hiring professionals to do voice-over work. This reasonably priced special feature makes it ideal for any creators with limited amounts of money but ample amounts of content. Cons It does not offer great variety in pictorial variations. Though many options are there, these still might need to fit exactly your creative vision. You might experience glitches and bugs. These technical fumblings can be a bit of a roadblock to your work but are often just remediable with updates or support services. It provides a limited number of minutes per month at no charge. But that's a limit if you are doing really large projects or creating lots of output. Perhaps you would have to limit yourself and decide when to use it or spend extra for a paid plan.

Visla Looking for the best AI video generator from text? Visla can be your right choice for a storytelling tool powered by AI that makes the entire process simpler. It has been fashioned as an easily accessible and powerful platform for a wide variety of users engaged in marketing, education, and other activities. Its most noteworthy feature is the ability to promote collaboration and improve workflow efficiency to quickly turn your ideas into videos. This lets you use storytelling and communication techniques with greater precision and effectiveness! Best For: Visla is the perfect option for developing and producing videos for marketing and sales, engineering, content creation, social media, team communications, customer service, and even personal branding. This is precisely what makes it so useful for professionals and teams to develop their own strategies for using storytelling to interact with audiences. Top Features: 1. Collaboration and Feedback Visla makes it simple to share your videos with your team or readers. In other words, you can use videos with other people, and you can receive others’ feedback. 2. Versatility for Various Industries Whether you work in marketing, sales, teaching, entertainment, or some other field, it's made to fit in wherever people work. 3. Diverse Use Cases Visla is just good for a variety of these video activities. You can create videos for social media, record personal messages to customers, recap meetings, convert old videos into new uses, or shoot videos for teaching and learning. It's like having one tool to deal with just about any job! 4. AI Summary Visla provides a feature that allows the main points of a text to be immediately grasped. Using AI, it discovers the key points, such as the keywords or main topics, or otherwise makes a long transcript short. 5. Teleprompter Mode Afraid you might have forgotten something or won't do a good job of expressing what is on your mind? This is where the teleprompter mode helps by letting you read from your marks instead of into the lens. This makes you look more confident and you don't lose your audience as you can make eye contact. 6. Community Hub Within the community hub, you can participate in discussions, seek advice, exchange experiences, and even receive ideas from other users. It's a place where you can get to know people using Visla too, help, and learn from one another. Pros Visla gives users the ability to create high-quality videos, working from the most minimal of ideas, perhaps even just a script. The platform can also be used to cover such tasks as writing scripts, narrating in its own voice, choosing the right pieces of video to show, and so on. Its AI-assisted editing functionality can even remove unwanted portions of video with an automatic effect. It has a comprehensible, easy interface, despite its many functions, which means that it can be used by people at every skill level. It allows a first-time user to become proficient with it only really requiring a timer, so that after only 2-3 minutes one can become accustomed. Visla's free subscription plan is particularly generous, as it allows publishers up to 50 minutes of video free of charge every month. This time is longer than most. Of course, there is also a great deal of access to the free version, which offers many of the platform’s main functions. It also comes with all the tools to aid in video production. With narration-assistance features powered by AI, screen recording functions for demonstration videos, text overlays for social media interviews, and so much more. Cons The inability to generate images is one major shortcoming of Visla compared to tools using coherent AI. To make up for this shortcoming, users who want to add this functionality have to feed suitable images to an external AI image generator before importing them into Visla. Exporting videos before downloading them can be very time-consuming. Likewise, the download speeds are quite slow. Even when Visla generates videos itself, it doesn't happen instantaneously, and it can still take a couple of minutes. The computer-generated script might contain mistakes that must be checked and corrected by a human. In addition, since the AI voiceover sometimes pronounces words incorrectly, this might affect the quality of the narrative. Pricing Basic: Free Plan Premium: $24 per month 6. Opus Clip Opus Clip converts full-length videos into short viral videos, and it shines through its comprehensive video content analysis capability. It also determines which parts are most effective and assembles them in easily digestible short clippings. It also employs cutting-edge artificial intelligence-enhanced functions such as AI Curation, AI Virality Score, and AI Emoji Generator to boost the attractiveness and virality of the content. All in all, it provides a great balance between accessibility and advanced, AI-assisted functionality, for newbies and experienced users too! Best For: Converting long-form video content into short clips that can go viral. It uses AI to help you create fun short videos with little effort. Top Features: 1. AI Curation This feature uses GPT-4 Turbo, the most advanced artificial intelligence, to take a long video and pick out the most intriguing segments. The selected parts are then crafted together into an attention-grabbing and compact short clip. Not only can it intelligently choose the segments, but it can also put this into a narrative framework, presenting the video in an organized, entertaining manner. 2. AI Virality Score Using AI and big data analysis of thousands of viral videos, Opus Clip attaches a score for its virality to each clip. With this score, you get a better idea of the potential impact of the cut, and you can use data to make decisions on the best way to maximize reach and engagement. 3. AI Co-Pilot With this feature, you have greater control over the video editing process. You can specify the time frames in your video to clip and make more focused and accurate content. 4. Active Speaker Detection Using predictive AI, Opus Clip analyzes and follows moving faces in the video. This enables you to keep your guests' (or, if you decide to take your own) face in the middle of the video frame. It makes your content more concentrated and professional-looking. 5. AI Keyword Highlighter With this tool, your video captions' important keywords are automatically selected and highlighted which can help to attain higher viewer engagement rates. 6. AI Emoji Generator The power of emojis is not lost on Opus Clip, which automatically adds suitable emojis to your video content. Pros It makes the video production process much faster. In other words, if a video project normally takes an hour, with Opus Clip it could be done in a few minutes. Part of the timesaving potential is especially useful for those who have to produce large amounts of video regularly. With the free trial, you can test the tool without risking any money. You can upload up to 120 minutes of video for free to test its features and determine whether or not it is right for you. This multi-language support makes the tool easier to use in different regions and audiences. This is particularly helpful for creators of content and content generators for whom English is their main language and they’re targeting an international audience or simply working in a multilingual environment. Its useful first paragraph-generating capabilities alone make it a game-changer when it comes to attracting viewers from the start. Cons Opus Clip may be a powerful software, but you would have to invest significant time and effort far beyond just learning how to use the product before you can master its full range of features. This learning curve could be an obstacle for those who need to quickly produce results without going into too much technical detail. Its effectiveness depends on the quality of the input video. If the original content was lousily shot or edited, it might not be able to finely tune it. While customization options are there, they may not meet all requirements or individual preferences of users. For some, this is a drawback, especially if highly personal or unique video styles are needed. The default caption may not be to everyone's tastes and could undermine creative expression. Pricing Free plan Starter Plan: $9 per month Pro: $ 19 per month 7. Colossyan Looking for the best AI music video generator? Colossyan can be just the right choice! It is an AI-assisted video creation tool for streamlining the video-creating process. In particular, Colossyan is adept at creating content of different forms, including marketing videos, explainer videos, and training and learning content, in more than 70 languages.

AI Avatars With Colossyan's AI Avatars, customers enjoy a huge array of digital avatars of different genders, ages, and ethnicities. These avatars aren't just created as lifeless images but with life-like movements and facial expressions. This brings a bit more realism and engagement to your videos, making them more relevant to your audience. 2.

With a wide range of AI avatars and backgrounds, text styles, and music to choose from, alternative video creation doesn't get any more complete than Colossyan! The platform allows for smooth scene transitions, and the high-resolution output helps to raise the quality and professional image of videos. With a range of pricing plans available to suit various needs and budgets, Colossyan provides an economical solution for many users. Cons The actors are advanced AI-generated avatars, looking and sounding highly lifelike, but the platform is limited to these digital actors. This limitation does not allow users to directly incorporate live human actors or their own recordings into the platform. As comfortable and convenient as Colossyan is, the more sophisticated its customization capabilities are as they need a learning curve. Pricing Starter Plan: $35 per month Pro Plan: $120 per month Enterprise Plan: Customizable Generate AI videos quickly Generate Al videos like magic Get Started Now 8. DeepBrain AI The DeepBrain AI makes the video-creating process less complex, taking the difficulty and cost of video editing out of the equation.

Best For: DeepBrain AI fits best for video production, including educational and training material and marketing, advertising, and customer service content. Top Features: 1.

Pros You'll enjoy the extensive range of AI Avatars available from DeepBrain AI. Whatever your video content, you will be able to find just the right avatar for it. This diversity means greater creativity for you, and more personalization so that each of your video creations can have the ideal avatar to suit its message. It lets you include up to 50 scenes in a single video. There will be no need to hold back with worries about being limited in scene choices. One special feature of the platform is the presence of a face swap function which allows you to easily merge your own face with the AI avatars. This feature increases personalization and interaction so that you can become a part of the video and make it more engaging! There are a range of flexible pricing plans, suited to your particular needs and budget. Whether you're a person or a business, you can benefit from the platform's features without the rigidity of a set pricing structure. Cons It has no integration with other software or platforms. This limitation might be inconvenient if you need integration with other tools or services for an enhanced video production environment. If you are on a team or need to collaborate with others on video projects, you might feel frustrated because there is no such mechanism in the platform. Pricing Starter Plan: $30 per month Pro Plan: $225 per month Enterprise Plan: Customizable 9. Hour One Hour One AI is just the right platform to produce AI-generated videos, especially if we talk about the best AI video generator free version available in the market.

It uses advanced neural networks, machine learning, and audio-visual pipelines to create and animate characters realistically.

There are AI wizards on the platform to help you make a full video from a prompt you give them. In this way, with very little input, you can have a completed video that demonstrates what the AI can do. You're likely to find the platform convenient and fast. If you don't like to learn too much or spend too much time waiting for your videos to process, this might be just the ticket. You can spice up your performance with the built-in voice modulations. This lets you experiment with different voices depending on what you're shooting. Cons If you choose the personal plan, the maximum video quality is limited to 720p. This may be a drawback if you are after a high-definition video. The platform's content moderation system is probably not 100% foolproof, so there is a possibility of inappropriate content slipping through the net. On Windows and Android, you may encounter problems when it comes to feature recognition. If you're using these platforms and want complete compatibility, then this could be a potential drawback. Pricing Basic Plan: Free Lite: $30 per month Business: $112 per month Enterprise: Custom 10.

Load More Results Home Marketing Disruptive AI Video Trends that are Transforming Marketing in 2024 Disruptive AI Video Trends that are Transforming Marketing in 2024 Written by: Kipp Bodnar and Kieran Flanagan THE STATE OF AI IN 2024 New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing with AI. Download the Free Report Updated: 08/01/24 Published: 07/23/24 AI-generated video content is turning the marketing world on its head. But what trends should marketers be focusing on to stay ahead of the competition? If you've been following the latest buzz in AI marketing trends — and you should be — you know that AI video tools are at the forefront of this change. Whether it’s trained ad avatars or hyper-personalized video scripts, these technologies are irreversibly changing how we create content and engage with our audiences. But with such rapid innovation, what’s actually worth the hype? Kieran and I experimented with some of these new developments in a recent episode of Marketing Against the Grain, including a viral AI video on Twitter and an AI-generated ad created in less than 15 minutes. Among the many AI video options available, these four trends have been particularly notable — and are worth paying close attention to. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video 1. Avatar actors and likeness licensing are the new norm. Instead of hiring an actor to read a script or act in an ad, businesses can now license an actor’s likeness, use it to train an AI model, and then use that model to create ads and avatars. This enables marketers to quickly generate a variety of content, testing, and refining different approaches and messages without the logistical constraints of traditional video shoots. For example, this viral video ad features a woman casually talking about a product while seated inside her car. What’s so significant about it, however, is that while she’s a real actress hired off of Fiverr, the video itself is generated by AI video, using tools like Arcads. \"This produces video content that is human-trained but AI-agent delivered,\" Kieran explains. \"That’s quite an unbelievable concept to think through.\" 2. Low-quality but authentic content is driving engagement. Polished, high-budget video ads are quickly becoming a thing of the past — or at least, less favored by audiences. Instead, low-production, personable videos are taking the lead, outperforming traditional ads on platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels. Take, for example, the viral video I mentioned above: it’s not polished or high-budget. Instead, it’s set in a poorly-lit car, with an unflattering angle. Yet people are more likely to engage with it. Why? \"Because it feels authentic, relatable, and personable,\" Kieran explains. \"It’s how a real person would talk about a product.\" For marketers, this shift means experimenting with AI tools like HeyGen and InfinityAI, which quickly create videos that drive engagement, despite — or even because of — their imperfections. 3. Video personalization and customization are must-haves. Hyper-personalized videos that cater to customers’ accessibility needs, languages, and preferences are essential for successful marketing campaigns. During the episode, we highlighted how AI tools can use customer data from your CRM platform — like call logs, support tickets, and emails — to craft personalized video scripts. This enables marketing teams to deliver tailored content that feels uniquely targeted and relevant to each individual viewer. We also experimented with HeyGen’s groundbreaking Avatar in Motion, which creates customized avatars based on your own likeness. Move your hands, make gestures, or use unique tones of voice, and HeyGen will flawlessly track, translate, and lip-sync your video with any customizable input text. 4. Accelerated iteration is driving innovation. AI tools significantly speed up the iteration cycle for creative video content and limit lengthy and expensive production cycles. For example, during the episode, I showed Kieran how I designed and launched a video ad in less than 15 minutes. To stay ahead, marketers need to quickly and constantly innovate, as the ease of copying and templatizing creative work will lead to a rapid commoditization of content. Standard approaches to AI-powered video content may outperform current methods in the short term because they’re new and different. But effectiveness is likely to peak within the first six to twelve months. Then, it will taper off as audiences get used to it and become aware of its widespread use. \"Your best-performing content will now be ‘best-performing’ for a much shorter period of time,\" says Kieran. In other words: your iteration of ‘creative’ as a marketer will have to increase exponentially. Differentiation will rely heavily on the unique 10-20% of creative input, putting increased pressure on marketers to continually produce new and distinctive ideas.

Vidyo.ai 10 tips for maximizing efficiency with AI video toolsCreate impactful videos effortlessly with the right AI tools Share this article: Humans have always been visual creatures. From cave paintings to the latest viral TikTok trend, visuals have been our go-to mode of communication. Creating engaging videos can still seem daunting with the hours required for scripting, filming, and editing. Luckily, AI is here to change that. Imagine entering a text-based script, and moments later, a professional-looking video appears, complete with voiceovers, background music, and engaging visuals. Or picture yourself removing awkward pauses from a video clip with just a click of a button. These are not futuristic concepts—they’re the capabilities many AI-powered video tools like Loom’s screen recorder and Synthesia’s text-to-speech tools offer today. Explore the best AI video tools for content creation and discover what features to consider when selecting one. What to look for in an AI video tool When choosing an AI (artificial intelligence) video tool, consider factors like ease of use, AI-powered video editing, and automatic caption and transcription generation. All these elements help you create high-quality video content, including explainer videos, social media posts, and tutorials, without extensive editing or technical expertise. Here’s a closer look at the features to look for in an AI video creation tool: User-friendly interface In a world where time is money, AI video tools automate editing and make the video creation process seamless and quick. They allow you to focus on the creative side of production rather than worrying about complex tasks or software features. Look for a platform that offers a clean, intuitive interface, including a simple layout with easy-to-navigate menus and clear instructions, allowing even beginners with minimal technical skills to create professional videos. AI-powered video editing features You just finished recording a video presentation for your team. As you’re watching it, you notice a few awkward pauses, some “ums” and “ahs,” and a couple of lengthy segments that could be trimmed. In the past, this meant spending hours sifting through footage to make those edits. Today, AI video tools like Loom have AI-powered video editing features that automatically detect and remove awkward pauses, improve audio quality, and trim unnecessary sections, reducing considerable editing time. Loom’s AI video tools automatically remove filler words from your video It’s equally important to look for features like automatic transcription and caption generation to make your videos more engaging and accessible. Customization options While AI tools automate editing, look for ample customization options to tweak elements like text, colors, and transitions to maintain creative control, including your branding and style. AI tools like Pictory and Descript even offer editable templates to accelerate the content creation process while still giving you control over your content and branding. Collaboration features Collaboration features are essential when working with a team to streamline communication and feedback. Consider tools that allow multiple users to edit videos in real time, provide feedback directly on specific moments, and offer cloud-based storage for easy access and sharing, especially in remote or hybrid work workspaces. With Loom, teams can react to videos with emojis, add time-stamped comments, and share video content with a single click across platforms like Slack, Gmail, and more. 1. Loom Tired of spending hours editing videos just to communicate a simple idea or update? Loom’s AI-powered screen recording tool might just be the perfect fit. Record your screen, webcam, and microphone simultaneously—just press “Record” to capture your message, and when you’re finished, Loom instantly generates a shareable link for your video. Loom AI generates video titles and summaries, removes pauses and filler words, and even crafts messages for you. Loom’s AI takes care of the rest—transcribing, summarizing, and even removing awkward pauses for professional polish. Once you share the video, recipients can watch it and respond at their convenience. They can also react with emojis and leave comments at specific timestamps in the video. Loom is especially popular with remote and hybrid teams for recording quick video presentations, explainer videos, training videos, feedback, tutorials, and personal messaging.

Understanding what role videos play in your business is key to choosing the right AI video maker for the job. If you’re focused on internal communications and personalized outreach, a tool like Loom is best. But if your goal is to create quick clips for social media, you might prefer Opus Clip. Brainstorm scripts. Even if you’re using an AI-generated video script, customization is essential for keeping your videos focused and cohesive. Keep it concise. The Sprout Social Index Report found that two-thirds of consumers find short-form videos to be the most engaging form of content on social media. Keep your content short and sweet to maintain attention. Use high-quality visuals. Look for video creation tools that record in at least high definition (HD). For example, the Loom free plan records in HD, while paid plans record in up to 4K resolution. If you use AI video generators, look for libraries of professional-level stock footage or high-quality, AI-generated videos that look realistic. Add a CTA. Make it clear what you want your viewers to do after they watch your video by adding a CTA. Some AI video editors, like Loom, allow you to embed auto-CTA links directly into your videos to make it even easier for viewers to take the next step. Track your results. Keep an eye on how your videos perform and adjust as necessary. Measuring video engagement is also important for training videos and team updates. Tools like Loom allow you to see who hasn’t watched your video yet, giving you a chance to follow up. Start small. You don’t need to overhaul your entire video strategy or team collaboration workflow overnight. Start with small steps to gradually integrate AI tools into your process, gain confidence, and experiment with different ways to use AI to your advantage. Create impactful videos effortlessly with the right AI tools You post an engaging video on your social media channels. The next thing you know, everyone’s sharing, commenting, and creating their own interpretations. This is the kind of buzz that great video content generates—captivating, memorable, and, most importantly, shareable. With AI video tools in your tool kit, your video marketing strategy can produce that level of excitement effortlessly, and within a few minutes. You can streamline your video creation process and turn recording and editing into a seamless, one-click task. To create high-quality videos with realistic AI avatars and voiceovers, Synthesia is a suitable option. Pictory and Lumen5 are solid text-to-video AI video makers. For those seeking a tool that lets you add a personal touch to your content, Loom stands out from the rest. The AI screen recorder captures your webcam, your screen, or both simultaneously, making it perfect for adding cues, gestures, and a level of engagement that feels personalized and authentic. When you’re finished recording, Loom’s AI-powered features handle the editing, adding speech-to-text captions and transcriptions, removing filler words and pauses, and adding other enhancements to make your video polished and ready to share.

An AI video generator is a tool that generates videos from descriptions using artificial intelligence algorithms.

Choose your ideal avatar, type your script, and generate talking head videos for your product releases, explainer videos, and more in minutes. What is a talking head video? A talking head video is one of the most common types of video used for e-Learning. It features a person, or the “Subject-Matter Expert” (SME), who directly addresses the viewer in an interview-like format. This video type is often shot from the chest or waist upwards, with the presenter either standing or sitting. Because of their human elements, talking head videos are suitable for building trust and connection with the target viewers. What differentiates talking head videos from other video types? What sets talking head videos apart from other video types is they let SMEs or instructors communicate directly through the camera, as if they're having a one-to-one conversation with learners. Talking head videos are ideal for brief and straightforward learning sessions, which users can access on their own time. With tools like an AI video generator from text, you can break down lengthy presentations into a series of shorter clips. Can AI create videos from text? Yes, it can! Type in the script you want the avatar to narrate or speak and choose from 300+ voices available in 40+ languages. Then, watch as AI generates your video in minutes. Use the AI video maker to turn your script into talking head videos with customizable AI avatars. Omg I love you guys! Thanks for making it so easy for me to use your templates. There’s so many selections and your site and app are very easy to use and navigate !!! 🥇💓💓💓💓💓💓 @curlyfrosista @canva is an incredible app for designing pretty much anything you need! A huge selection of templates, fonts and colours; endless choices at the tip of your fingers; easy editing and sending/sharing. Best app I’ve used for a long time. If you haven’t tried it... try it! @SpotOnDomain @canva is simply outstanding as a tool to create designs. Using Canva is such a seamless experience that once you sit down to design, you don't feel like getting up. It's addictive and useful. Keep going Canva. I use Canva every day – I couldn’t do my job without it. The ability to style logos is my favorite @navneet4 @canva is such a life changing tool! One of the most well thought out websites I've ever seen. I use it to showcase my work with the community and it never ceases to amaze me! Kudos for all the love and effort you've put into its development! #canvadesigns @mahimagirdhar I don’t know where I was without @canva They have absolutely great graphics for any social media platform.
